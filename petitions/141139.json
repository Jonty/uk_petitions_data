        "action": "New EU referendum should Scotland leave the UK and break the Union.",
        "additional_details": "This petition aims for Parliament to consider and plan through any serious changes that may result from Scottish independance and the impact this would have on the recent referendum result and mindset of the voting public.\r\n\r\nThe original referendum question posed was for the United Kingdom exiting the EU, should Scotland gain independance then the UK breaks up and the question is void, given the change of circumstances.",
        "background": "This petition calls for a suspension of any action for an exit from the EU until the issue of Scottish independance is resolved. If Scotland leave and the UK breaks up then a new question would need to be posed, reflecting the nature of the change, the original question becoming invalid.",
