        "additional_details": "The bedrock of our wildlife and environmental protections, which have massively improved air and water have come from our relationship with countries across Europe, predominantly based on EU legislation. We need to make sure that these gains are protected into the future, rather than becoming, once again, the Dirty Man of Europe. Ensure that our legislation is kept strong, protecting our environment into the future.\r\n\r\nWe have stopped exporting acid rain across Europe, we are doing good work on Climate Change, our wildlife, which is still in serious trouble, is improving because of our work with other EU member states.",
        "background": "Ensure that current legislation, based on the EU environmental directives, is secured in the fallout of the UK's referendum decision to leave the EU and Article 50 notification.",
