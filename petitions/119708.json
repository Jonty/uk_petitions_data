        "additional_details": "It is possible to send secret/private communications using nothing more than pen and paper and dice which cannot be read by anyone else, not even GCHQ or NSA. So terrorists and criminals can communicate anyway.\r\n\r\nBut the Investigatory Powers Bill asks companies to remove any \"protection\" someone has applied. This can only serve to invade privacy of the rest of us!\r\n\r\nSo the question is whether the government wish to allow iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, https, etc, with no intercept, or not?\r\n\r\nYes/No?",
        "background": "The Home Office answered my last petition with a contradiction, so this is a simple yes/no question.\r\n\r\nEncryption means people can communicate privately, so their communication is impossible to read. \r\n\r\nThis means terrorists and criminals can also have privacy.\r\n\r\nWill the government allow this?",
