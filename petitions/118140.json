        "additional_details": "There has been not been an informed public debate on Trident for many years and few MPs appear seriously to consider the issue.\r\n\r\nYet there are politicians of all parties who believe we should not renew Trident, and many in the military.\r\n\r\nThe public, offered the opportunity, would almost certainly vote No, preferring the money to be spent on health, education, housing and the environment.  \r\n\r\nAs with the EU, we should now have a referendum, giving MPs freedom to campaign according to conscience. ",
        "background": "Trident has no relevance in the 21st-century world - even for those with a belief in a so-called nuclear deterrent. It is expensive, dangerous, fundamentally absurd - and certainly not independent.\r\n\r\nAs with the EU, the public should decide what is the right course for our country.\r\n",
