In more than 60 countries around the world, including Australia, Japan and Russia, there are significant restrictions or outright bans on the production and sale of GMOs. \r\n\r\nAs a result, use of toxic herbicides like Roundup has increased 15 times since GMOs were introduced. GMO crops are also responsible for the emergence of \u201csuper weeds\u201d and \u201csuper bugs:\u2019 which can only be killed with ever more toxic poisons like 2,4-D.",
