        "action": "Refrain from triggering Article 50 until trade deals negotiated.",
        "additional_details": "Whilst Europe will want to trade with us it is not going to do so at the risk of further destabilising the EU. Trade figures clearly demonstrate that we need EU trade more than it needs ours. We will be negotiating with an EU that will have little sympathy for our position and every reason to make an example of us in order to prevent other EU member states contemplating a similar move. To invoke Article 50 before establishing the trading terms could well be political suicide.",
        "background": "if Britain triggers Article 50 before the Government has successfully negotiated the terms of any trade treaties with the EU and all other major economies of the world it is likely to back us into a corner from which there is no return. ",
