        "additional_details": "There is no reason why people should be charged a higher price just because they are an existing customer.\r\nUtility companies offer cheap rates to attract new customers but they rip-off existing customers by pushing up the price each year; knowing many people won't bother switching.\r\nForce companies to automatically roll-out the best offer available to all customers with a given profile and penalise if not done.\r\nThis wouldn't affect loyalty discounts for existing customers or no-claims bonuses.",
        "background": "Ever had your internet/gas/electricity/insurance renewal quote come back much higher than you were paying? Wasted time phoning up just to get nowhere? Looked online to see much cheaper offers exist and spent ages switching just to have it all happen again next year? Ban this waste of time and money!",
