        "additional_details": "There was two deaths this week the first being David Ellam aged 52 and then Dexter Neal aged only 3 years old. Eleven children were injured in a dog attack which took place in a fenced off play park. In June this year on the 24th in Bournemouth a woman was walking her dog on a lead when another dog along with its owner was not on a lead which resulted in the dog 2 viciously attacking dog 1 resulting in dog 1 dieing and the owner being injured. This is to reduce the risk of injury to the public.",
        "background": "There is no escaping the fact that dog bites are on the rise , the number of people admitted to hospital as the result of a dog attack has risen by 76% in the last decade.
