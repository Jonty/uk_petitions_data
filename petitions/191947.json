        "additional_details": "They are the hidden professionals who provide invaluable support to children and are the backbone of our education system. The support they give to vulnerable and challenging children ensures that no child is excluded from school. Without them many children would struggle and leave school without the qualifications and skills needed in adulthood. Cutting support staff could affect the outcomes and life chances of children for generations.",
        "background": "The GMB union calls upon the Government to give schools enough funding so they can employ enough support staff. As a result of spending cuts many schools have reduced the number of school support staff so the remaining staff are doing more and more. ",
