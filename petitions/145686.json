        "action": "Urge MPs to call an early general election to end uncertainty over the EU.",
        "additional_details": "The referendum is advisory: only parliament can make it into law. Most MPs are in favour of remaining in the EU and they seem unwilling to vote on the subject. Instead, our two main political parties are descending into leadership squabbles and the country is in turmoil.\r\n\r\nWe call on MPs to use the 2011 Fixed Term Parliaments Act to call an early election, if not immediately then as soon as possible after the appointment of a new Conservative Party leader.",
        "background": "The EU referendum result has no constitutional power, and our prime minister has not invoked the official withdrawal mechanism, Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Political infighting and lack of leadership means voters on both sides of the referendum are now being shortchanged.",
