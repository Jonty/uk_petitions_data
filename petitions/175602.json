        "action": "Make it a criminal offence to deny estranged parents to be denied access to kids",
        "additional_details": "This mainly affects estranged Fathers, and now there is no legal aide for family matters, and the fact CSA take up to 40% of their wage for maintainence that they have to pay despite them being denied any kind of relationship with their children, a lot of Fathers can't afford to go to court. This is not equality!! If the children are young they can't express their needs, the law needs to ensure they do not suffer. We have enough childhood Depression. We need to put the children first.",
        "background": "It should be law that the estranged partner, be automatically allowed access to their children. If they truly pose a risk to them, the onus should be with the partner the children reside with to go to court prove why they feel it is not in the children's best interest to see the other parent.",
