Social media is assessible all over the world. The overall view of our nation is being displayed for all to see. This could be used to inspire hatred on both sides and could be used elsewhere to preach terror.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the use of social media by political parties and gov may end up a threat to our national security.\r\n",
