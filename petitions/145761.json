        "additional_details": "This has happened several times in the last 40 years.\r\nIn 1976 James Callaghan took over from Harold Wilson - the next election was 1979.\r\nIn 1990 John Major took over from Margaret Thatcher - the next election was 1992.\r\nIN 2007 Gordon Brown took over from Tony Blair- the next election was 2010.\r\nAll these Prime Minsters governed without a mandate from the people",
        "background": "When a Prime Minister resigns the whole country should have the opportunity to decide on the new one, it should not just depend on the electoral processes of the political party he is a member of. That is not a mandate for the people. Parliament should be dissolved and a general election held.",
