        "additional_details": "In light of the above, we support the remarks made by the Speaker on February 6th, that Trump should not be permitted to speak in our parliament. Here is an extract from his remarks '...far as this place is concerned I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons.\u201d\r\nTrump, manifestly, does not uphold these values and is not a fit person to be given the honour of addressing our parliament, either in the Commons or the Lords.",
        "background": "This petition has been started because the petition to stop President Trump making a State Visit, is being ignored by the government. Although it will be discussed, due to having almost two million signatures, it has already been made clear that the invitation issued to Trump will not be withdrawn.",
