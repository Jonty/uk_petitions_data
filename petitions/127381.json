        "action": "Outlaw packaging materials unsuitable for recycling, such as foil-backed plastic",
        "additional_details": "An everyday example is the foil-backed plastic often used for crisp packets. Although plastic is now commonly accepted for recycling in household waste collection, crisp packets are not. The foil is bound to the plastic in a way that makes it impossible for our recycling processes to be used. \r\n\r\nIn a world increasingly concerned about the environment, we need strict legislation ensuring all manufactured packaging materials are as recyclable as possible.",
        "background": "It is commonplace for manufacturing and retail to create hybrid packaging materials that are unsuitable for recycling. ",
