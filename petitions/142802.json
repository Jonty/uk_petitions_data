        "action": "Hold a vote in Parliament determining whether or not to invoke article 50.",
        "additional_details": "In the UK sovereignty lies with the Monarch and is delegated to Parliament, this is known as parliamentary sovereignty. Therefore as the E.U. referendum held on June 2016 was not legally binding, a decision to invoke article 50 by a Prime Minister based only on the referendum result has no Legal Legitimacy.\r\n\r\nFor this reason Parliament must vote on this decision, for any ensuing exit to be legitimate. Legally they, as both representatives of the people and Her Majesty, can decide to invoke it.",
        "background": "This petition calls on the Parliament of the UK to vote, after the appointment of a new Prime Minister, to hold a vote in parliament on whether or not to invoke article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and to withdraw the UK's membership of the European Union owing the idea of the sovereignty of Parliament.",
