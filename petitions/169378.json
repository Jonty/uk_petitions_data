        "action": "Restrict private parking charges to reasonable amounts.",
        "additional_details": "Every day many parking charge notices are issued to vehicles parking on private land. Normally, the fee to cover the car is a reasonable nominal amount. However, for those that overstay the period the vehicle is covered or parking the car without any cover the charges are unreasonable and far more than the loss of business the proprietor suffers. \r\n\r\nThe everyday person in the United Kingdom that uses parking facilities lawfully but from time to time cannot cover their car for entirely adequate reasons are suffering unreasonable financial burdens. ",
        "background": "It is proposed that the government amend the Protection of Freedom Act 2014 to restrict the amount a private company can issue a parking charge to a fair and reasonable amount and no more than what the local council can issue a penalty notice. ",
