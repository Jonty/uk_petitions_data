As a public, we should be confident that the services we use haven\u2019t been weakened or compromised by government mandate or pressure. No legislation or private agreement with the government should undermine our rights.\r\n\r\nWeakening encryption weakens the entire Internet. Endorse strong encryption and encourage other world governments to do the same.",
