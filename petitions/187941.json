        "additional_details": "We recognise that there are already laws in place to protect students against general extremism and, more specifically, terrorism in schools, but it is necessary that we also combat anti-Islamic extremism specifically. We must make sure that schools effectively educate students about the value of tolerance in society, and that Muslim students do not feel threatened or oppressed either by other pupils or by the wider society.",
        "background": "It is just as important to protect school students from the anti-Islamic extremist ideas which have surfaced as a result of terrorism as it is to protect them against the terrorist ideas themselves. We must therefore ensure that there are specific schemes to help protect students against such ideas.",
