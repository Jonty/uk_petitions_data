        "additional_details": "* Boris Johnson among others introduced the idea that we should vote leave in order to secure a better deal for the UK, not to actually leave. \r\n\r\n* The referendum was used to vent frustration at the government. Campaigns were set up on social media to encourage people to vote 'leave' in order to sack David Cameron.\r\n\r\n* The leave campaign was built around the idea of spending 350 million pounds a week on the NHS instead of Europe. The morning after the vote when it was described as a \u201cmistake\u201d. ",
        "background": "It would be irresponsible to trigger Article 50 and leave the EU based on a referendum in which 1.9% (fewer than 1 in 50 people) changing their mind would change the result. Given that people report that they voted 'leave' to send a message, not with a genuine desire to leave, the result is unsound.",
