        "action": "Introduce a universal Vegetarian symbol system on food & drink",
        "additional_details": "Currently there is no regulation in place to enforce how or where to place the suitability of vegetarian or vegan products. We need a standard system to be used in conjunction with the traffic light system on all food products indicating whether they are suitable for vegetarians or not. Many products only use text, or symbols in awkward positions. Where products are not suitable there is no specification at all. An example system could be the green V for suitable or a crossed V for unsuitable.",
        "background": "Food & Drink products sold in the UK currently require a traffic light system on their packaging for sugar & salt. Vegetarians have great difficulty whilst shopping to identify suitable products. There should be a standardised system enforced to place a V symbol on the front of vegetarian products.",
