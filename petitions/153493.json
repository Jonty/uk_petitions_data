        "action": "Abolish chancel repair liability",
        "additional_details": "Claims for payment are usually based on old maps of former church property.  Church and diocese records which might relate to this matter are often incomplete or non-existent or have been destroyed because no one realised that they might have some significance.\r\n\r\nLord Avebury's Bill to abolish chancel repair liability in the House of Lords fell due to lack of time in the parliamentary session before the general election in 2015.  The property of many people is subject to chancel repair notices.",
        "background": "Chancel repair liability is an outdated burden created when Henry VIII destroyed monasteries and gave away their land, rarely mentioned in  deeds to property, but by which some property owners have been asked to pay the cost of repairing the chancel of the church relevant to their property.  \r\n",
