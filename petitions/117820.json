        "action": "Revise legislation of mobile phone use whilst driving.",
        "additional_details": "With training, a level of safety can be achieved in line with other distractions such as babies, radios etc. Humans are capable of gaining this skill.\r\n\r\nHighlighting, teaching and examining this in driving tests would justify legalisation, resulting with drivers modifying their behaviour, raising their eyeline, and choosing sensible times, dictated by road and safety conditions, rather than where the least chance of being caught is. In addition, industry will advance technology to assist drivers.",
        "background": "Driving and using mobile devices is prevalent amongst road users.  \r\n\r\nThe current laws reduce safety rather than preventing use. Drivers continue to use their phones in a covert way bringing down their eye level.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, it's unrealistic to expect drivers won't use a mobile phone while driving.",
