        "additional_details": "https://www.gov.uk/bullying-at-school/the-law - says that policies are set by the school. If it was set by the government then all schools would be the same regarding the 'Behaviour Policy'. Schools could also teach that everyone is different have it be sexual orientation or religion, race which could prevent bullying. I will be campaigning to STOP THE BULLYING!! \r\n\r\nQuestionnaire below:\r\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/LZNSF7K\r\nWill be sent to schools and colleges around the UK for research.  ",
        "background": "During my time at school I had my fair share of bullying and was made to feel out of place. Speaking with local parents, who think schools don't do enough to prevent bullying, would like the government to set strict guidelines that must be followed in education for bullying, not set by the schools.",
