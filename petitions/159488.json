        "additional_details": "EU citizens are those British residents who are most severely affected by the result of the EU referendum but had no say in it. They have a right to vote and stand in local elections and elections to the European Parliament, rights that would be lost if the UK leaves the EU. They are now in a state of uncertainty and fear. This seems a travesty of natural justice. They need to be consulted, for instance by a referendum specific to them.",
        "background": "The vast majority of the 3 million EU citizens resident in Britain had no vote in the referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU and if they had been consulted the result could have been different.     \r\n\r\n",
