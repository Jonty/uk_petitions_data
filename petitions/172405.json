        "additional_details": "Students are expected to remember:quotes from each character & themes and context that are incorporated within these texts- it is estimated that 250+ quotes could be potentially memorised for this exam. On top of 20+ exams,students are experiencing high levels of stress- due to the paper being more demanding for a higher grade.English is a subject that all employers & universities look at, therefore if students are unable to realistically achieve high grades- there will be lower employment rates",
        "background": "The introduction of closed book examinations,for GCSE English Literature,requires students to learn and memorise quotes for this exam.There are 2 literature papers which include the content of:15 poems,2 plays and 1 novella.Exams shouldn't be a test on the student's memory,but how we interpret texts",
