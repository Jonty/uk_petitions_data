        "background": "London contributes more in Tax revenues than it receives as public spending.\r\n\r\nThe tax surplus generated by London is greater than the entire cost of Crossrail 2, but transport investment is always delayed.\r\n\r\nIt's time for Full Fiscal Autonomy.\r\n\r\nLondon's tax revenues should be spent on London.",
