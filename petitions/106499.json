        "action": "Increase the maximum sentence for death by dangerous driving while drunk",
        "additional_details": "People who get behind the wheel whilst drunk only to later kill another road user, should be treated the same as those who have committed manslaughter. A vehicle user should not be treated any differently than a drunk would be treated were he to kill someone whilst brandishing a knife or gun in the street. The present law, gives those who kill using a car, a level of protection that other killers do not have. It is rare for a dangerous driver to receive the maximum penalty that already exists.",
        "background": "The sentence for killing someone by dangerous driving whist under the influence of alcohol is no longer fit for purpose. The maximum sentence for death by dangerous driving is currently 14 years. ",
