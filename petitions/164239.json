        "additional_details": "The law needs to change as majority of woman work these days and can earn more than the father of their children.  Why should the man be made to pay out regardless of how little money he has left.  Equal rights should mean it is fair for everyone and everything should be taken into account with both parties.  for example, both parents should be housed and be able to live comfortably and spend quality time with their children not one live flush whilst the other one has no where to go and no money",

The male finds himself out of the family home and is expected to carry on paying for half of the mortgage if not all and child maintenance.  How can he afford to rent a home for himself and pay bills etc !!!  ",
