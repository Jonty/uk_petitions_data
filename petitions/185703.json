        "additional_details": "For parents of these children being at home to support their family is paramount. Being forced into mandatory overtime can have a severe impact on the child's development, cause stress within a parents relationship and prevent a strong and robust support network for both the child and parent career. Removing the expectation of overtime and allowing parents to opt out of working any additional hours would eliminate stress, reassure the family and set clear boundaries to the employer.",
        "background": "Quite often parents of disabled and poorly children are expected by their employer to work additional hours above the contracted amount, often at short notice. This expectation, if not met, can to lead to poor performance ratings, missed promotion opportunities and sometimes disciplinary action.  ",
