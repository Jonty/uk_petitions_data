        "additional_details": "I would refer to the debate in Parliament today (16/11/16) and to press reports on this matter (eg) - http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-peerage-theresa-may-pmqs-live-house-of-lords-a7420881.html\r\n\r\nThe British Public should express their feelings on this matter and encourage and advise the PM to recognise that there is no sanction from the British people for any such award. Quite simply, if Mr Farage wishes to influence the government, then he should stand for Parliament.",
        "background": "The PM is strangely silent on the issue of granting Mr Farage a Peerage. Granting a Peerage could mean he could sit in Cabinet with some Ministerial role. Mr Farage failed to get elected to Parliament & is a divisive figure in the UK; such a move would be an abuse of the system and undemocratic.",
