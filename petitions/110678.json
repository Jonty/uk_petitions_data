        "additional_details": "There are thousands of people, including adults with learning disabilities, voting for their favourite colour! Because they have the unjustified right to vote and want to use it,... And many others that don't bother using their vote because they have no idea what they want.\r\n\r\nI believe we should be voting for individual policies rather than who gets to be \"prom queen\" anyway, but that's besides the point.\r\n\r\nPeople should be given the option to make an educated decision for themselves.",
        "background": "Many people do not have a clue about politics. They either vote whatever their relatives vote for, vote for their favourite COLOUR, or don't bother voting at all.\r\nIf we truly want the nation to have an educated say in the runnings of the country, then we should make it compulsory to teach about it.",
