        "action": "Parliament should have a free vote now on whether the UK should leave EU.",
        "additional_details": "This petition is not saying that parliament should give no weight to the decision of over 17 million people to vote leave. Instead its point is to ask that parliament and the MPs that we elect to govern our country should give a voice to the over 16 million people voted to stay. If we depart from the EU without a vote by MPs on such a massive constitutional change in our country it seems that this decision would undermine the rules and legal precedent of our parliamentary democracy.",
        "background": "We have a parliamentary democracy and it is therefore for our parliament, where the people of this country elect MPs to make decisions on our behalf, to make the decision on whether we leave the European Union.",
