        "action": "Place a cap on holiday prices so holidays companies cannot raise prices over 20%",
        "additional_details": "One of the many reasons we think this needs to be addressed is because many parents take their children out of school to give them the holiday they deserve. This results in the children missing out on a week or more of education and parents being handed out fines. Although, parents still choose to do this, paying the \u00a360 fine per child is usually a lot cheaper than paying the difference between holidays in and out of term time. Therefore, our campaign should be taken into consideration.",
        "background": "We believe that holiday prices during school breaks are too expensive, companies choose to increase because of so called supply and demand. However, we feel everyone deserves a holiday and a fair opportunity to have one. We think a cap should be placed meaning holiday firms can't raise prices by 20%",
