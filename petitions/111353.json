        "action": "Repeal section 127 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994",
        "additional_details": "In 1994 the Tory government made it illegal for Prison Officers to be induced to withhold their services or to commit a breach of discipline.  This in effect made it illegal for Prison Officers to take legitimate strike action.\r\nPrison Officers should be afforded the same rights as any other worker in the UK and be allowed to take industrial action up to and including strike action!\r\nThe government must repeal section 127 if they are committed to equality and fairness in the workplace.\r\n",
        "background": "Today the Scottish Justice Secretary announced that removal of the legal recourse clause in the VIRA agreement.  This legitimises organising strike action for Prison Officers in Scotland.  The same must now be afforded to Prison Officers in England, Wales and NI by repealing section 127.\r\n",
