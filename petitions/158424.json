Many EU countries reject smart meters. We don't need to comply with EU Directives for compulsory smart meters.   \r\n\r\nUK Gov must scrap compulsory roll out \u2013 it\u2019s costly, unlikely to change consumption habits, adversely affect low income/pensioners, is invasive & a security risk, restricting freedom to use energy when you need to.",
