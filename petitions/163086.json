        "action": "Ban personal and commercial drone flights over residential properties",
        "additional_details": "With the usage of drones by hobbyists, individuals and organisations on the increase we are concerned that privacy will be compromised, and catching any offenders will be near impossible. The risk of harm through drone faults will increase. Drones will be used by criminals to spy and transport illegal items. Noise pollution will increase and it will no doubt cause many homeowners to feel uncomfortable & insecure in their own back garden.",
        "background": "\u200bFollowing the recent approval from The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) granted to Amazon to test its aerial vehicles without several of the flying restrictions rules, we the undersigned seek to ban all drone flights at any height over residential properties and privately owned land.",
