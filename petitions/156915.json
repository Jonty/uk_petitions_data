        "additional_details": "This will be one of the largest constitutional changes in our history, no 2015 manifesto says how parties will act in this situation.\r\n\r\nHow much do we want to remain in the Common Market?\r\nDo we want to retain freedom of movement?\r\nHow vital is the City's financial access?\r\nHow will EU based rights/regulations be re-written?\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe referendum answered none of these. The only way to secure a mandate is through a General Election.\r\n\r\nWe call on Parliament to commit to this before negotiations start.",
        "background": "The British people have voted to leave the European Union.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Conservatives and other parties cannot claim an electoral mandate to negotiate the form our exit from the EU takes. We, the people, deserve to take back control of this and vote on policies for the negotiation.",
