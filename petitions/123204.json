        "additional_details": "The biggest argument against the proposal would be the impact to the economy with a lost business day (when the 29th is on a weekday). I believe that impact would be reduced by the significant increase in travel and leisure expenditure should the idea of a \"family day\" take off.",
        "background": "The 29th of February only comes around once every 4 years. We repeatedly receive marketing emails stating \"what are you doing with your free day?\". At the moment it isn't a free day! I propose this day being a public holiday, perhaps celebrating family (similar to thanksgiving in the US).",
