        "additional_details": "There is strong evidence that medical cannabis helps with chronic pain; spasticity (common, disabling and painful after stroke or brain injury and common in those suffering from multiple sclerosis, as examples); for nausea and vomiting, especially during chemotherapy; and for the management of anxiety. It is also useful in sleep disorders, for appetite stimulation, fibromyalgia, post-traumatic stress disorder, severe childhood epilepsies, bladder problems and even for control of some cancers.",
        "background": "Drug classification powers remain reserved to Westminster. The present system of drug classification is based on historical assumptions, not scientific assessment. The Scottish Government want to consider reforming laws to allow the medicinal use of cannabis. Northern Ireland should do the same",
