        "additional_details": "There should be higher consequences for all aspects of domestic abuse including an automatic 2 year restraining order for anyone found guilty of causing Domestic abuse. This will resolve further issues including harassment and stalking preventing further abuse. A domestic Abuse list should be created to protect victims who suffered the abuse. Mental and financial abuse should be thoroughly investigated having the same consequences as phsyical. These consequences should prevent abuse re-occuring",
        "background": "Domestic Abuse is looked upon as mostly solely physical abuse in society, and this needs to change. It needs to be made publicly aware that it's more than just physical, including mental and financial. This can impact a victims life as much as phsyical, and should hold a higher sentence for all.",
