As a country that is signatory to the Human rights act and considers itself to be a democracy, preventing our aid agencies from having access in order to save face is completely unacceptable. ",
        "background": "Currently France and the UK refuse to recognise the humanitarian disaster occurring on our doorstep as a problem that requires a humanitarian response. In the absence of this declaration, the aid agencies that could provide high quality support - Oxfam, Save the Children etc CANNOT ENTER the jungle.",
