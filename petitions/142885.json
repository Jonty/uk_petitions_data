        "additional_details": "The vote of the 23rd of June succeeded in making the point that there is a deep sentiment of bitter resentment within the UK.  However, the \"shock\" effect following the outcome does beg the question; \"could more be done\" to make the electorate (us the voters) happier?  Why is Proportional Representation so scary for the dedicated and talented people who choose a career in politics.  I think P.R would benefit the UK and also help preserve our status as a proud and successful nation. ",
        "background": "This proposal is NOT to dilute, but to reinforce the principle of a second EU referendum. But not just concerning the recent \"vote to leave\" the EU but to also include within that opportunity, gather voter's opinion towards proportional representation within ALL future ballots no matter the subject.",
