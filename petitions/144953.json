        "additional_details": "In essence if someone is part of the 20-25 million people now trying to find a way to remain in the EU, to save their way of life, income, jobs, travel benefits, freedom to work and move, be part of something bigger and better ....... To support their children and grandchildren (70% of who voted to remain) then we want the government to find a way. Others who want to forgive these rights and leave should also be allowed to go their way. Everyone then has their wish and we make it work",
        "background": "48% of the voting public, plus another significant % that voted out, and now regret their decision, are shocked at what has happened. Given the huge numbers of people this concerns we feel individual people should be able to choose to remain in the EU if we wish and not be forced to leave. ",
