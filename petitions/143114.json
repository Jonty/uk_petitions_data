        "action": "A referendum to enquire if UK should trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty.",
        "additional_details": "In his resignation speech, David Cameron made it clear that the new prime minister should take the decision about when to trigger article 50. After Brexit results many British citizens regretted their decision after political pledges were retracted and effects on economy became evident. Moreover, the large number of British citizen (48.1%) who wanted to remain in EU felt betrayed from the referendum system. With this petition we pose a democratic request to give UK citizen a second opinion on BREXIT results.",
        "background": "Following the UK referendum on 25th of June 51.9% of British people decided that United Kingdom should leave the European Union (EU). For this to become effective the UK Prime Minister needs to trigger article 50 and start the formal and legal process of leaving the EU.",
