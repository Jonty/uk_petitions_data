        "additional_details": "Therefore it is impossible to have confidence in the outcome. The only solution to ensure proper consent for what happens next is to hold a general election in which all parties are required to make their position on the UK's relationship with the EU clear & to submit manifestos of their policy proposals in all areas for scrutiny, with a commitment that the resulting government would be made up of a coalition of parties with elected MPs holding a similar position on the EU.",
        "background": "There were no formal manifestos that could be fact checked & claims made by key players have been shown as false. Evidence suggests many failed to understand the consequences of their votes & an alarmingly large proportion were undecided in the final hours. There is now no clear future plan.  ",
