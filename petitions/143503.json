        "action": "Overrule the result of the advisory EU referendum of June 23rd, 2016.",
        "additional_details": "MPs have a duty and obligation to act in the best interests of the country. The referendum result is only advisory. Nearly half of voters voted against it. Given a turnout of 72 percent, only just over a third of the electorate have actually stated they want to leave the EU. Given the effects already being witnessed, we urge parliament to debate and overturn this move before it is too late, and - in the first instance - refrwin from invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.",
        "background": "The vote to leave the EU is already proving catastrophic for the UK, with serious repercussions around the world. Financial, trade and job insecurity; a surge in unfettered racism; the possible break-up of the UK; instabilty and fear for citizens abroad and EU nationals here; parliament in disarray.",
