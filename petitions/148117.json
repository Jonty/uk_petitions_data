        "additional_details": "The vote was so close that I believe there is a danger that the country remains split for a long time with those that were were on the leave side being seen as taking the country too far away from Europe, and those that were in the remain side feeling that they have no representation. This I believe would be a devisive environment.  \r\nA government of Nation Unity would be able to genuinely represent all sides and would be more trusted to explain better the difficult decisions and outcomes. ",
        "background": "The current situation is too important for one political party to undertake the negotiations for the exit from the EU. The evidence so far is that the argumentative and negative politics will continue. \r\nI propose that we need a United Parliament to undertake the negotiation on our behalf",
