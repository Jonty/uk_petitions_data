        "additional_details": "The BBC already have access to the information of who is watching iplayer.  When someone watches their IP address is logged on the BBC server, which uniquely identifies which internet connection has been using it. \r\n\r\nThe BBC have the option to make the iplayer password protected, much like Netflix or Amazon Prime.  This password could be associated with a TV licence, so only licence payers can use the service.\r\n\r\nDetection vans are an unnecessary invasion of privacy & waste of licence payers money.",
        "background": "On 01/09/16 paying TV licence free is required to watch iplayer.\r\n\r\nTo enforce this BBC claim they've developed new WiFi snooping detector vans, to packet sniff all WiFi connections to see if iplayer is being used.\r\n\r\nThis is a gross invasion of privacy.  Not wanting to watch the BBC is not a crime!",
