        "additional_details": "This recent press article in The Guardian supports our reasons for restrictions to be implemented...\r\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/24/teenager-stabbed-holloway-18th-to-die-in-london-this-year\r\nIf the UK Government and Parliament implement a new legislation restricting the sale of knives to over 21s by retailers and on-line we can significantly help lessen the ease of obtaining such offensive weapons. Knives are too freely displayed by retailers and need tighter controls introduced.",
        "background": "There is a high increase in youth knife crime across London. Innocent young people are sadly losing their lives daily to this vicious circle often through unnecessary violent confrontations. Wembley Crime Prevention feel the restricted sale of knives from retailers & on-line should be to over 21s.  ",
