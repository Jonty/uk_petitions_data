        "action": "Start a fund to help EU nationals obtain their permanent residence cards",
        "additional_details": "EU nationals that have migrated to the UK have a net positive contribution to the UK economy. These EU nationals now face having to obtain a permanent residence card to remain in the UK or obtain British citizenship, a requirement to vote on decisions affecting their future. Before November 12th 2015 there was no requirement for citizens of EU countries to obtain a permanent residence card. There is no guarantee that EU and EEA citizens will be able to remain without one. http://bit.ly/1RJEOMm",
        "background": " This petition asks that the government considers starting a fund to help all EU nationals that wish to become British citizens pay for their permanent residence cards and associated lawyer\u2019s fees, allowing them to further integrate with the UK before it leaves the EU.  \r\n",
