        "additional_details": "Apparently in 2007, an apology was issued by the MOD: http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jun/28/gayrights.military. This doesn't count as an apology to those individuals. My original letter to the Guardian, 7 years ago is here: Original letter to The Guardian 7 years ago: http://gu.com/p/22k28/sbl\r\nThe Queen and the Government have so far refused to get involved. The matter was taken up in Parliament in 2015 by Paul Blomfield, MP for Sheffield Central.",
        "background": "HM Forces men and women were investigated and discharged from the Armed forces, simply for being gay. They suffered emotional, mental and material scars that still last today - homelessness, loss of friends, job and pension, rejection by family, and still no alternative career. We want an apology. ",
