        "action": "Make criminal law teaching compulsory at schools",
        "additional_details": "I am a post graduate in law with relevant experience in the legal sector and also a secondary school mathematics teacher.  I have observed over the years at schools that children are not informed of certain acts they carry out which are criminal in nature. The moral wrong is pointed out but not the criminal wrong. Children are then repeating the same behavior out of school building and then the police are involved. Schools need to teach children criminal wrong because moral wrong is subjective. ",
        "background": " Children are criminally liable from the age of 10, thus should be taught criminal law from the age of 10. This will reduce crime rate and raise awareness. Children are told moral wrong at schools and not criminal wrongs.",
