This must be actioned and we leave the EU.\r\n\r\nDemocracy has spoken and all must accept this. Attempting to change the outcome by retrospectively manipulating the rules or attempting to force another referendum is an attack on democracy akin to a dictatorship, that has no place in a civilised world. \r\n",
