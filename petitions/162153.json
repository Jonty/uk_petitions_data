        "additional_details": "ARM designs microchips used in most smartphones, including Apple's. Its brilliance was realising that if computer chips were to be in lots of devices, you did not have to make them - designing them was the key!\r\n\r\nOnly five years ago, Cambridge was home to at least three world-beating UK-owned technology firms, ARM, Autonomy and Cambridge Silicon Radio (CSR). Autonomy was swallowed up by the US firm HP in an ill-fated deal, then last year the chipmaker Qualcomm bought CSR, and now the biggest and best, ARM, is about to have a new Japanese owner.\r\n\r\nWe cannot continually let our brightest and best companies be sold-off to foreign companies for short-term profit! So the UK Government needs to stop this sale and any similar future sales as detrimental to future UK business.\r\n",
        "background": "The UK's major player in computing is about to be sold off!\r\nIt is hard to exaggerate how important ARM is to the UK technology sector & many will be shocked at this news. To quote the words of Mr. Hauser, co-founder of ARM: \"This is a sad day for me & a sad day for technology in Britain.\"\r\n",
