        "additional_details": "The result should not be held up as an example of good democracy. This style of campaigning is rejected by us. The result isn't legally binding until the Lisbon Treaty is invoked. It should not be possible to take such a drastic decision with near half the electorate opposed to it.  The referendum should not have been called, it was unreasonable to expect the public to be equipped with the skills, expertise and depth of understanding needed to make a decision of this magnitude and complexity. \r\n",

It is unreasonable to expect the electorate to make a decision of this magnitude and complexity and therefore should not have been called.\r\n",
