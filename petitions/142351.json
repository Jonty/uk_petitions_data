        "action": "Call a second EU referendum on the basis that voters were misled",
        "additional_details": "This petition is for a second EU referendum to be called because voters were misled. It does not ask for minimum voting or turnout thresholds (see separate petition).\r\n\r\nExamples of misleading campaigning by Vote Leave include:\r\n\r\n1. \u00a3350m \"sent\" to EU per week - misleading;\r\n2. That money will be spent on the NHS - not true / now retracted;\r\n3. Immigration control claims false;\r\n4. Iraq and Syria shown on a map of countries \"set\" to join - misleading.\r\n\r\nSee Treasury Select Committee report (27/05/16).",
        "background": "A potentially decisive number of voters were misled by Vote Leave (see examples below), and voted \"Leave\" under false pretences. A second EU referendum must therefore be held, under closer supervision by the Electoral Commission. People deserve a chance to vote again now that they know more.",
