        "additional_details": "This Government is making changes to the NHS - with no mandate to do so - that will affect patients for generations to come. The public have not been fully informed on this process. The majority of JDs are against the imposed new contract (a contract neither tested nor costed nor safe). JDs are tired of false statistics and inferences from studies being used in the media to promulgate this Government's agenda, creating a climate of fear. The Health and Social Care Act must be debated also.",
        "background": "With more strikes on the cards, our Health Secretary must enter into a transparent debate on this topic, addressing the concerns expressed by doctors and the public. Ideally, an audience of JDs, consultants, NHS England and BMA reps, and the general public - with the Shadow Health Secretary. ",
