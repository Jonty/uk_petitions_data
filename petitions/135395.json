        "action": "Triggering article 50 to exit EU must first be approved by a vote in parliament",
        "additional_details": "While dissatisfaction has been registered with our current arrangement within the EU, no single alternative was offered by the referendum. Options suggested ranged from a move back into the EEA (\"Norway model\") which would not of itself limit immigration - a major issue in the campaign - through to a completely open free trade economy (\"New Zealand model\"), which would alienate other constituencies within the leave camp.  We need to vote on where we're going to, not where we're coming from.",
        "background": "Following Britain's choice to leave the EU, the terms of our new relationship are completely undefined. Before article 50, Parliament must consider the final proposal, debate whether it is in our best interests and decide whether the settled will of the country is to proceed in the chosen direction.",
