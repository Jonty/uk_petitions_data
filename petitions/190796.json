And a majority of the world\u2019s supply is found in the DRC \u2014 one of the poorest countries in the world.\r\n\r\nThe tech companies allegedly buy the mineral from third-party suppliers without checking the working conditions or ages of those who are mining for it. This should not be allowed to continue. ",
