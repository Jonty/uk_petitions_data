        "additional_details": "Mental health support needs to be available 24/7.  Starting with an emergency team who are trained in mental health care and know how to cope.  The team should include someone who can reliably make a decision as to whether the patient needs to be sectioned for theirs or the publics safety and can enforce that section. Mental health problems are increasing and care in the community is clearly not working! We need to provide a more reliable support network for people with mental health problems.",
        "background": "Patients with mental health problems are being failed since the abolition of long-term mental health hospitals and the introduction of care in the community. Care in the community is only available Monday to Friday 9-5, after which the Police, Ambulance Services and A&E staff are left to cope.",
