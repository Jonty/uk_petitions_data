        "action": "Reduction to Zero of Wind Turbine Subsidies",
        "additional_details": "The spread of Wind Turbines is now out of control and their numbers need to be culled.  The electricity that they generate is a fraction of what is promised, they are a blot on the landscape, and a danger to birds and bats.  For me 'Green' Energy' is something that will generate electricity 24 / 7, 365 days are year, is unobtrusive, and does not require massive subsidies, and is harmless to both animal and human health.  Wind Turbines are none of the above.",
        "background": "That all subsidies paid for new wind turbines should be zero; for both onshore and offshore turbines.  Furthermore, that all subsidies for existing wind turbines, both onshore and offshore should be reduced by 25% yearly.  After four years, there will be NO subsidies paid for electricity from wind.",
