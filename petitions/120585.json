        "action": "Make ZANU a banned political organisation in the UK & Crown territories",
        "additional_details": "Zanu has maintained the ruling party power in Zimbabwe since 1980 and created a baseless law to forcibly aquire land and property for the government. Many hundreds of thousands were fired out their homes into poverty and foreign lands. Current estimates are that over 40% of Zimbabweans live abroad. Zanu continues to intimidate, terrorise and murder families of those abroad operating with impunity in UK and Crown territories. It's time to ban them like ISIS and other hate crime supporters.",
        "background": "Zanu actively intimidates Zimbabwean citizens abroad by indirect means as witnessed with the Nyatsuro forced farm aquisition as reported in UK papers recently.",
