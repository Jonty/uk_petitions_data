        "action": "Allow 3500 child refugees into the UK as promised under the Dubs Amendment.",
        "additional_details": "When Trump tried to ban refugees from entering the US last week, there was a global public outcry, yet the UK is doing exactly that. Backbench Tory MPs, Labour politicians, refugee NGOs and the Archbishop have spoken out but need public support. Local councils have also made it clear that they could take more refugees if funds are made available. Even the Daily Mail said last year \"..we MUST give these lost children sanctuary\". Today none of the tabloids have covered the closure of the scheme.",
        "background": "Last year the UK promised that 3500 unaccompanied refugee children would be given a haven in Britain; yesterday the 'Dubs' scheme was quietly closed and numbers capped at 350. These extremely vulnerable young people are being turned back to traffickers, mud and utter hopelessness. ",
