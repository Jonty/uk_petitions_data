        "additional_details": "The UK is one of the most significant contributors to foreign aid and regularly meets the agreed foreign aid budget of 0.7%.  The UK is one of a handle of countries that meet this target.  In 2015 the UK's contribution was around \u00a312.23 billion.\r\n\r\nRecently there have been arguments that the money sent abroad by the UK is not reaching those most in need.  Therefore, with mounting concerns over NHS' financial difficulties, should more be spend on the NHS and services than foreign aid.   ",
        "background": "The National Health Service (NHS) has been a vital service for the United Kingdom (UK) but is one that experiences significant financial shortfalls.  It would be worrying to see the demise of such a treasured resource, especially if it is not adequately financed. ",
