        "additional_details": "Agreements with EU leaders concerning UK renegotiations of membership will be subject to European Parliament\u2019s approval and may result in modification to those agreements. Any referendum should therefore not be held until such approval has been obtained, otherwise the referendum would be based upon incomplete and perhaps erroneous information.\r\nAlternatively if the referendum occurs before such approval and any significant changes are made during that process, a second referendum should be held\r\n",
        "background": "The British Parliament should prevent any referendum on British membership of the EU being held before European Parliamentary approval has been obtained for agreements made with EU leaders. ",
