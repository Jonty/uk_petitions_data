        "additional_details": "I am British, I live in Germany. I have a UK pension, I am likely expected to pay inheritance tax upon death and who knows where I might retire. This decision affects people like me too and we need to have a vote on this matter.\r\nThe UK parliament should debate if we are now allowed also a vote which should be integrated retrospectively with the referendum already held, and see how this impacts the referendum result.",
        "background": "British people living abroad were NOT allowed a vote and are hugely impacted by the outcome. We form a constituency of people who live a special way of life in the EU - the life that experiences free movement of labour and we well understand free trade benefits. An important voice could not vote.",
