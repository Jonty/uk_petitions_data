        "additional_details": "In 2015/16 the National Child Measurement Programme revealed that 19.8% of children in Year 6 were obese and a further 14.3% were overweight. Overweight and obese children are likely to become overweight adults and continue to have an increased risk of developing various physical, emotional and psychological problems. The government needs to act now to help solve this crisis by educating the young people of the UK so they are fully informed of how to keep themselves healthy.",
