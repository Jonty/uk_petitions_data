The \u00a330,000 household income should not fall into the category of the 'rich' (this is only \u00a315,000 each!  Its encouraging not to work and earn more, but to earn less!",
        "background": "George Osborne wants to enforce the law, that if you earn a household income of \u00a330,000 or more (\u00a340,000 in London) you will have to pay equivalent of the private renting sector as of April 2017. He describes it as the 'rich' will no longer have the privilege. Some rents will increase by 300%",
