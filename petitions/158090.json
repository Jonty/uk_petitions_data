        "additional_details": "The brexit campaign did not set out a clear policy for how we should leave the EU. We have not voted on HOW we should leave the EU only that we should leave. The repercussions of how we leave the EU will shape our country and it's economy for generations. A decision of this magnitude cannot be made by a party leader who has not been elected by the general public. There must be a general election now in order that an elected prime minister with a democratic mandate can decide on our future. ",
        "background": "By October a party leader not elected by the country will be negotiating for our economic future. Whilst the country has voted for brexit there has been no democratic process for deciding how brexit should happen. This is fundamentally undemocratic. There should be a general election.",
