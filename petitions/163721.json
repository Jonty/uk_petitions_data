I find there to be the downturn/deterioration of courtesy and common sense within road users, more and more road users do not give way and sadly selfishly blocks the way of motorbike users during slow moving or stationary traffic.  \r\n\r\nThis would  increase safe passage for motorbikes and emergency services without affecting the road user!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Allowing motorbikes and emergency services to filter/continue without risk of accident. ",
