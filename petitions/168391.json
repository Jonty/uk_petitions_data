The fact that women have to spend thousands of pounds on their periods whilst free contraception is handed out is absurd and needs to be changed.

In 2016, 25 charities were allocated funding and we entered into partnerships with Comic Relief and Rosa to disburse \u00a35.2m of funding to help meet our ambition to reach grassroots women\u2019s organisations across the country.\r\n \r\nThe Tampon Tax Fund supports women\u2019s charities that are making a significant impact in the lives of women and girls in the UK, including health, wellbeing and education initiatives, and services for vulnerable women. The bids selected represent a range of different initiatives to benefit women across the whole of the UK.\r\n \r\nFollowing a review of the grants already awarded and in order to further focus resources the OCSI/Cabinet Office has carried out a targeted exercise to seek views on how to spend the remaining capital in the Tampon Tax Fund effectively. We will consider the results of this exercise in designing any such fund.  \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health",
