        "additional_details": "I feel that Kenneth Clarke MP and other like minded MP's are using voters high fuelled feelings to create as much disruption as possible and giving these people false hope. \r\nThe vote was for an exit, it was carried out in a proper democratic system that has been used for centuries and just because it is not the result he and others wanted, does not give him and others the right to undermine our democratic system. If continued he could be inciting hatred and more.",
