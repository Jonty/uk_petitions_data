        "additional_details": "If we can teach subjects such as Religion without being bias then why is one of the most important subjects not taught? Without being given the knowledge we are left to form an opinion based on family and friends with strong views, scary propaganda, media and even lies told to us. How are we supposed to make a valid and informed choice on this? Without real interest it is a subject that not many will seek on their own to learn, but it is knowledge that we all need to really make a difference.",
