        "additional_details": "Seems so obvious but political parties are hamstrung in taking the initiative. It would require cross party agreement so that politics can be set to one side and common sense (what everyone knows but can't admit) be allowed to prevail. The important bit is to guarantee to taxpayers that the extra money can/will only be used for these two purposes (so controlled not by the government of the day but by some independent body).",
        "background": "NHS has a deficit of c\u00a36b pa. We also have inadequate social care provision (why hospitals are full of elderly not poorly people). I  believe the vast majority of people would be happy to pay an extra 1p in the \u00a3 to solve both problems. Funds to be ring fenced (so can't be spent on anything else).",
