        "additional_details": "The age of consent in the UK has been 16 since 1885. Sex education has improved since 1885, and so 14 year-olds nowadays are capable of consenting to safe sex and understand the implications. Most countries in Europe have a lower age of consent than we do, which has led to calls to reduce ours. However, I believe that this is a dangerous move with paedophilia being so common today, and so I believe that my proposal is the best option. Various US states follow legislation similar to my proposal.",
        "background": "The age of consent is currently 16, and therefore those aged below 16 are prohibited from engaging in sexual; whether protected or unprotected. My proposal is that 14 year olds should be allowed to engage in sexual activity; but only protected, and with partners who are no more than 3 years older.",
