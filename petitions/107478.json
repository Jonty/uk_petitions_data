        "additional_details": "The cap is having a negative impact on Motability customer, as there is a limited choice of vehicles available for disabled people (wheel chair users/automatic licence holders, etc). Numerous Motability customers are struggling to find vehicles, which are appropriate and compulsory for their needs/disability. \r\n\r\nIt is morally unreasonable that legitimate disabled people are put through further adversity, just because of some bogus individuals abusing the scheme and because of the media\u2019s misinformation. Genuine disabled people are being targeted regularly by this current government and that needs to be addressed  \r\n",
        "background": "In 2012 Motability decided to change its policy and placed a \u00a325000 cap on the cars, they provide to disabled individuals. We are asking Motability/DWP to raise the cap from \u00a325000 to \u00a330000, as the present price restriction is not in line with current inflation.",
