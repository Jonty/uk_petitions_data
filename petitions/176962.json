        "action": "The UK Government must commit to publicly destroying all stockpiled ivory.",
        "additional_details": "Publicly destroying ivory stockpiles will raise awareness that the $20bn annual illegal wildlife trade is the 4th largest global illegal activity. This action will send a clear message to the world that the UK will not tolerate illegal trafficking and commercial trade in any raw or worked ivory and that we support a near total ban on domestic ivory trade. Most importantly, it will emphasise to current and future generations that ivory is worthless unless it is on wild living elephants.",
        "background": "Between 2009 and 2014, 40% of all illegal wildlife seizures made by the UK\u2019s Border Force were ivory items. In 2015, 110kg of ivory were captured at Heathrow airport in one of the UK\u2019s largest seizures of illegal ivory. We call on the UK Government to commit to destroying any stockpiles of ivory.",
