        "additional_details": "In December 2016, Britain along with a number of other nations voted in favour of a UN resolution against Israel's illegal settlement building in the Palestinian West Bank. Netenyahu not only continues to ignore this but has been responsible for shelling UN schools and hospitals in Gaza during 2014. Netenyahu is under investigation for allegations of corruption and war crimes by several Governments and organisations. We should not be rewarding this behaviour with formal visits.",
        "background": "Benjamin Netenyahu's governance of Israel has seen an increase in segregation, settlement building and international condemnation. A visit at this point in time sends the wrong message and weakens our position on human rights.",
