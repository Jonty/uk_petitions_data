Developers are no longer building affordable homes. The average Londoner can no longer afford a home in London. The mayor must do more than just say it. Londoners are struggling!! We love our multicultural city and want to see it thrive with people of all walks of life but the gov cannot forget about us here, we need affordable homes",

Developers must be forced to build a certain number of affordable homes for every luxury home developed and quotas on the number of luxury homes developed each year for more affordable homes. There's no point having help to buy when every home is so expensive",
