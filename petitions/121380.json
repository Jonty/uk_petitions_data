The NHS and all who serve her are a British institution and part of our culture. This was wanted by those who sacrificed greatly during world war 2 and built by them for future generations. We pay and have paid for this, it is our right and not the right of any politician to sell off or try to dismantle by nefarious means. There should be no political idealism when it comes to the NHS and it should be our constitutional right to have good healthcare regardless of wealth",
