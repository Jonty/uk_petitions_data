        "additional_details": "There are Muslim families who are sending their children to school for 9 hours on an empty stomach, no fluids & children who would have been woken up at 2am to eat their breakfast.Whatever this tradition is, it is not prescribed by the Islamic faith & it is abusive on young children.Feeding children processed foods all year around is wrong, that's why it is banned from lunch boxes. Similarly, imposing fast is abuse and we must forbid it and promote education over dogma. ",
        "background": "Healthy minds, bodies and spirits to build strong cohesive society. \r\nAs a therapist who also happens to be a follower of Islam, I have researched how fasting positively impact my mind, body and soul. \r\nBut fasting should not be imposed on children. ",
