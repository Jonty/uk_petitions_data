        "action": "Abolish  year 6 sats",
        "additional_details": "I think its about time the Government  realised that our children are not numbers or statistics, but fantastic human beings with great gifts that tests cannot measure. It is important that attainment is measured but use assessments that give positive feedback .For many children year 6 is the best year of primary school, unfortunately their days are being filled with past papers and endless maths and English , missed P.E and science lessons due to booster groups and the nightly revision plans! ",
        "background": " The pressure that our children are under is immense.  When the majority of secondary schools do not use the sats results and do their own testing in year 7, why are we subjecting our  children to this pressure? They are becoming disengaged and losing their love of Learning.",
