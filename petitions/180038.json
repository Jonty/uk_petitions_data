        "additional_details": "President Trump is implementing a policy on which he stood and on the basis of which he was elected by the American people.  It is unacceptable to lecture our supportive and powerful friend on his nation's moral standards.  Civilised dissent is acceptable, but he should be welcomed with enthusiasm.   The liberal option of uncontrolled immigration practised in Europe has caused criminal outbursts and general resentment.  Self-righteousness and arrogance ill suits its protagonists. ",
        "background": "President Trump should not be attacked for adopting a bold interim strategy towards the dangers & difficulties presented by mass immigration from countries with a high proportion of anti-western extremists.  This is a security initiative and is not prejudice against Muslims or nationalities. ",
