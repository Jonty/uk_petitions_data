        "additional_details": "I believe the leave campaign deceived the general public to vote. For example \u00a3350 million pledge to invest in to the NHS which was later referred to as a mistake! There are \"leave\" voters already questioning what they actually voted for. The general public needed a clear outline to make them aware of the differences between what is a Westminster decision & an EU decision. There was a clear lack of responsibility here for what is such an important decision for the British people.",
        "background": "As a small business owner it was evident that the economy will struggle by leaving the EU. I believe the leave campaign failed to layout the hard facts. It is inexcusable and irresponsible to call such vital information and statistics \"scare-mongering\".",
