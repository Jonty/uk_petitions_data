        "action": "Remove Boris Johnston as Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs",
        "additional_details": "Mr Johnson has consistently made politically incorrect claims about foreign countries and their leaders, such as his description of children from the Commonwealth as \u2018piccaninnies\u2026\u201d and his comparison of the EU to Hitler. Regardless of whether these claims were later revoked they continue to cause offence, hence the international dismay at the news of his appointment.\r\n\r\nGiven his track record, how can you not question whether this is really the man Britain needs as Foreign Secretary?\r\n",
        "background": "We, the undersigned believe Boris Johnston lacks the diplomatic skills and international standing to be an effective Foreign Secretary, and should therefore be stripped of responsibility over, among other things, relations with foreign countries and the promotion of British interests abroad.",
