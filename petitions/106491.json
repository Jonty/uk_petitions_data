        "additional_details": "The nurse said to me 'that procedure was a life saver.' If I hadn't of been tested the cells would have eventually changed to cancer.\r\nThis disease devastates  lives and is on going. People younger than 25 are dying of cervical cancer, when it could be stopped by lowering the screening age. Doctors are saying that under the age of 25 testing causes more damage than it's worth. I'd much rather have small damage than cancer and I'm sure you would agree. \r\nPlease sign this petition to make a change. ",
        "background": "I routinely received my smear letter 6 months before my 25th birthday. My Mam kept reminding me to make an appointment to which I did. My results came back to show high grade pre cancerous cells. I had these removed at the age of 24. After a check up a few months later it sunk in what had happened.",
