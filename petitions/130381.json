        "additional_details": "Most parents and teachers cannot afford a family holiday out of term time. Teachers are not allowed to take holiday during term time. It is grossly unfair and completely unnecessary to charge higher rates simply because it is the school holidays. We call upon the government and trading standards to hold these companies to account so as to avoid any further high court rulings and allow more families to enjoy time away. ",
        "background": "Recently a father of a school-age child won a High Court ruling allowing him to take her on holiday during term time. If he had lost he would have been forced to pay a \u00a3120 fine to the school for \"continuous absence.\" His victory has highlighted the extortionate rates that holiday companies charge.",
