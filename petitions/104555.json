        "background": "Before hare coursing was banned in 2005, there were tens of thousands of spectators and gamblers attending the events. The sport has been going since the 1800's and it's what the dogs involved were bred to do. Hares were killed by accident (if any were killed). It's a sport on how fast a dog can run",
