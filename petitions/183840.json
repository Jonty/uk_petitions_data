        "action": "Allow people to invest their Pension Funds in residential property.",
        "additional_details": "\r\nIt is acknowledged the concerns about pension funds purchasing the homes of scheme members and we therefore accept the need for regulations to prevent this.\r\nHowever, the unintended consequences of the way that the current regulations are drafted is that the sector is potentially being deprived of significant and stable investment. Investors are instead being driven to potentially more risky buy-to-let investments, or not into housing at all.",
        "background": "Currently people who have SIPPS and SSAS Pension Funds are prohibited from investing in residential property and can only invest in commercial. Allowing residential property purchase would unlock investment in rental housing which would then overtime reduce the cost of rental property.",
