By comparison, drunk drivers displayed a 12% decrease in reaction time, while drivers intoxicated with cannabis had slowed response times by 21%. http://www.techtimes.com/articles/8185/20140609/texting-is-more-dangerous-than-drugs-alcohol-while-driving-study.htm ",
        "background": "While driving around the country with work, I witness far too many drivers all over the road because they are using their mobile phones, mainly in their hands, while driving. This is mostly texting or typing. The current fine and penalty points are far too low and the penalty must be higher.",
