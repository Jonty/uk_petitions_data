        "action": "Simplify the legal process of buying and selling a home",
        "additional_details": "The current system has barely changed in decades. Solicitors still communicate via post, creating huge delays waiting for various documents to be passed between parties. Too many separate entities need to be consulted, often to confirm obvious or know facts. The existing system provides no incentive to reform the process as it generates significant 'easy money' for solicitors, estate agents and others, with buyers and sellers lacking the knowledge to challenge the process.",
        "background": "Buying and selling a home in the U.K. is an overly complicated, slow, and frustrating process. Introduce a single body to deal with 'searches' (Land Registry?), create an online system to track progress and facilitate communication, and reduce the ability of parties to make changes prior to exchange",
