        "additional_details": "Democracy is meant to be for all but the current system is unnecessarily partisan. Issues tend to be complex so why do we have such a binary voting system that no longer reflects the UK?\r\n\r\nChanges also need to be made to the ways in which we can vote and how we register to vote.",
        "background": "Voter turnout has been steadily falling over decades. Whilst registration improved for the EU referendum, it seems some people may have used this as a protest vote against the government. It seems logical that a voting system that better reflects voters wishes can only improve democracy for all.",
