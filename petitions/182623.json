        "action": "Reimburse the NHS from the Foreign Aid budget for treating overseas visitors.",
        "additional_details": "The episode of \"Hospital\" aired on BBC2 on February 1st, left me feeling angry and frustrated. Where treating overseas visitors is concerned, the NHS is placed in a very difficult position. Quite rightly it cannot, and should not, refuse to treat them, but equally it should not be expected to absorb the costs involved which run to quite eye watering amounts which in reality are unlikely to be repaid. My proposal would address this problem and I am sure would have popular support. ",
        "background": "The NHS cannot refuse to treat overseas visitors but equally it should not bear the cost of treating them. The  Government's ring fenced foreign aid budget, now running at something like \u00a312 billion, does not enjoy popular support and therefore should be used to reimburse the NHS. ",
