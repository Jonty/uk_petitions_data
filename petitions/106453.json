        "additional_details": "We have just enough time to stop Fracking taking hold in the UK. The industry here is in its infancy and is trying to gain social acceptance. Fracking companies are still exploring, drilling small numbers of wells to gather data about the geology and local communities attitudes. The Government is rushing through powers to speed up the process of licensing. The whole process should be stopped until all aspects can be properly investigated and results published comprehensively to the public.",
        "background": "Fracking is the process of injecting liquid at high pressure into subterranean rocks, boreholes, etc. so as to force open existing fissures and extract oil or gas. We want all fracking related activity to halt within the UK until public opinion on the process can be properly attained by referendum.",
