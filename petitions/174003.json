        "action": "Make it law that bicycles must be licensed, taxed and insured",
        "additional_details": "As bikes increasingly dominate more space and time on our roads, there is no good reason why they should be exempt from being licensed, taxed and insured.\r\n\r\nCyclists and their bicycles should have to conform to the same laws, regulations and high safety standards that other vehicles are compelled by law to do.  In order to hold cyclists to account, they must have visible license plates and be fully insured, given they are increasingly the cause of damage, accidents and incidents on our roads.",
        "background": "Bicycle riders use and benefit from using UK roads for leisure, work and sports, so they should contribute towards the costs of building and maintaining them, policing, safety furniture, traffic controls, road markings, road signs and other ancilliary livery, as do all other vehicle users",
