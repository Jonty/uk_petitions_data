Paying for the tablets that put them on par with those not suffering from mental disabilities is something that millions of students are facing.\r\n1 in 6 adults have a common mental disorder (CMD), and those of which who are students are occasionally, like myself, facing the choice; food or medication.\r\nThis is something I believe should be a thing of the past ",

I see it unfair that millions of students suffering from Mental Disabilities such as ADHD are required to pay for their prescriptions.\r\n\r\nStudents have limited funds and I feel that those funds should be spent on books, not their medication",
