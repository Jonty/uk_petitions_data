        "additional_details": "Many who voted leave did so believing that our country was better off out of the EU. The remain voters believe that this was unfair because the voting turnout was only 72% - We believe that it was true democracy in action and the result should stand. All registered eligible voters had the opportunity to vote and the leave turned out in higher numbers on the day. Regardless of ANY reason for voting leave, the vote was fair and the result was LEAVE.",
        "background": "On the 23rd of June 2016 the British public decided to leave the EU with a majority 52% of the votes cast. Now people who voted Remain are trying to force a second Vote - This is an attack on our democracy and it must be stopped!",
