        "additional_details": "A general election would allow political parties to take a position on leaving the EU and make clear in their manifesto whether they will or will not enact article 50.  Voters can then confirm their wish to leave or remain in the EU by their choice of political party.\r\n\r\nAt a general election, voters would also be choosing the government which would implement their choice, and details of all their intended policies in relation to the EU question.",
        "background": "The referendum result has created deep disquiet. Emerging risks include the breakup of the UK and threats to peace in Northern Ireland. Leave leaders say campaigning claims are not deliverable. Younger voters were under-represented and this has biased the referendum result.",
