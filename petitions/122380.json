        "additional_details": "Every five years a lot of money is spent on persuading young adults to vote. Meanwhile, 16 and 17 year olds are asking for a vote, and it has been proven they will use it. If the government wants more young people to vote, giving the vote to 16 and 17 year olds would be a pretty good solution. In the Scottish Referendum around 75% of 16 and 17 year olds voted, so it has been proven this age group will use their right to vote - why not give it to them?",
        "background": "Now that the date of the EU Referendum has been set for 23rd June 2016, we're counting down to the day that the British public votes on whether or not we will stay in the EU. Yet the people who will be impacted most by the decision made by the public are the ones left out; the 16 and 17 year olds.",
