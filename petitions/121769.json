        "action": "Stop poaching healthcare professions from 3rd world and poorer nations.",
        "additional_details": "The shortfall in the countries from where the staff are poached leaves the local populations exposed to the consequences of a shortage of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals. This will inevitably include morbidity and death in these populations. The nations spend a significant proportion of their GDP on training these staff only for them to be stollen by bribes by our own NHS. This must stop.",
        "background": "NHS trusts nationwide frequently poach healthcare staff from third world; developing and poorer Eastern European nations. They are doing this to meet the training shortfall in this country and because it is much cheaper alternative to training domestic staff; causing a shortfall in these countries.",
