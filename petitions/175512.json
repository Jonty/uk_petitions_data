        "additional_details": "All over twitter, Aleppo refugees are posting how the government is murdering them en masse. Innocent men, women and children. The UN must condemn the massacre as against international law, and the UN, failing them the EU, failing that Britain alone, mut notify Assad of its intent, and send a task force to the city. Not to fight Assad's forces directly, but to advise his troops to not engage, & to protect any citizen fleeing the city against his troops, withdrawing when the people are removed.",
        "background": "The city of Aleppo has been conquered by the dictator Assad. His forces are massacring its people - men, women and children. It is preventable. Ask the government to petition a UN/EU task force to immediately go into the city as peacekeepers, not to directly fight Assad, but to evacuate citizens. ",
