        "action": "Introduce a law that stops companies from profiteering during school holidays.",
        "additional_details": "We want the UK Government to introduce a law that forbids companies from profiteering during the school holiday periods. This has been a long standing practice whereby the cost of holidays rockets up in the school holiday period only to return to \"normal pricing\" after the school holidays are over. Indeed some parents would rather pay the fine for keeping their children out of school during term time rather than pay the prices holiday companies are asking during school holiday times.",
        "background": "There is a horrendous rise in the prices charged by UK companies during the school holiday periods. A recent example was 3 weeks before a school holiday period the price quoted was \u00a3700, and three weeks later, during the start of school holidays the price rose to \u00a31,900 for the exact same holiday.",
