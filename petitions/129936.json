It has become first place to visit when needing a new recipe. I cannot help but feel that if it were not for the BBC my diet would not be as varied as it is today. It has promoted a healthier attitude to food which is vital for a healthy population. BBC Food is a public service and should remain that way.",

BBC Food provides inspiration to those that lack confidence in the kitchen and is vital resource to promote healthy attitudes to food",
