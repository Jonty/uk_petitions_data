        "additional_details": "The exact nature of the citizen's assembly is not as important as that the upper house should be largely free of the self-serving career politicians and bought peerages who have have recently shown so much contempt for the will of the people.\r\n\r\nSeveral options are possible including an assembly selected like a jury from volunteers or one appointed by a similar citizen's panel where members are chosen for the character not their political colour.",
        "background": "Following the behaviour of the Lords & many politicians in trying to thwart the will of the British people over Brexit, they have shown they cannot be trusted with our democracy.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords should be scrapped and replaced by an apolitical body such as a citizens assembly.",
