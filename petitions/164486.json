        "additional_details": "I am an Indian citizen working as an Engineer in the UK. I enjoy travelling in my spare time and I also have the need to attend business meetings in the Schengen area. I have personally experienced the trouble of applying for short term visit visas (both Tourism and Business).  I encourage the the honourable UK govt. to urge the EU to look into a solution to this, by offering a longer term visa, with restrictions on the maximum number of days spent continuously in the EU. This solution could be offered to someone who has travelled to the EU at least twice, to prove that the country of interest is the UK. ",
        "background": "As a resident in the UK with a valid UK visa, it seems unnecessary that a Schengen visa is required for tourism/business purposes in the Schengen area. Some form of long term visit visa with stringent background checks might be a good solution.",
