        "additional_details": "When my mum first went to pip she ended up taking them to court and my mum won because they never showed up, and she got higher, now she's lower and nothings changed, her condition will never get better, so why should it be any different to the last ones, fibro should be classed as a disability by law and by the government  because it's a long term condition and affects the muscles. They need more support and more awareness of it, because so many people have it nowadays more common ",
