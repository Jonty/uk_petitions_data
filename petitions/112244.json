Where sufficient housing is found, bedroom tax is applied. \r\n\r\nWhere a court order is in place all parents should be treated equally.\r\n",

There is no financial help regardless of income, no housing help even though we need to provide a home, and we are charged bedroom tax for the rooms our children occupy, NRP's need support too!",
