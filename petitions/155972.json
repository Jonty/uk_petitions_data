        "additional_details": "The recent referendum was conducted against a backdrop of lies and half-truths. Many people now realise that they were misled. Millions of people are petitioning for a second referendum. If the Government refuses a second referendum, calling on MPs to vote against the repeal of the European Communities Act 1972 offers another way of preventing what many sincerely believe would be a national disaster. If this law isn't cancelled and removed from the statute book we remain a part of the EU. ",
        "background": "The recent referendum has no legal force. The simplest way to prevent the UK's exit from the EU is for pro-European MPs to vote against the repeal of the European Communities Act 1972.",
