        "additional_details": "Responsible and robust control of the arms trade is one of the most crucial ways to uphold the rule of law and protect civilians across the world from violence and oppression.\r\n\r\nAs a signatory of the Arms Trade Treaty, the UK is expected to create a Register of Arms Brokers. It allows for greater scrutiny of brokers and is a vetting mechanism to ensure a safe and legitimate trade of weapons.\r\n\r\nFor more info: \r\nAmnesty International https://goo.gl/1FGCO8 \r\nSaferworld http://goo.gl/aX6ljP",
        "background": "While many arms brokers work within the law, some unscrupulous brokers are responsible for the illegitimate and illegal trade of weapons, including to terrorist groups and in war zones. \r\n\r\nA Register of Arms Brokers would better regulate this trade, and prevent criminals from dealing in weapons.\r\n",
