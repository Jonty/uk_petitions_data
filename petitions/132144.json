        "additional_details": "The menace of traffic lights on roundabouts is a constant theme of irritation and disbelief amongst the drivers I have spoken with. Many actually ignore them late at night and risk a prosecution rather than adhere to the Highway Code. Additionally, I live near a large motorway access road junction (M27 J8.) The roundabout at the top of the slip road always flows better when the lights breakdown. I have seen this on a few occasions. I drive this roundabout continually to and from work.",
