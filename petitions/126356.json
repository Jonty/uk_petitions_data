        "additional_details": "The National Minimum wage and the new National Living wage keeps getting increased and the government are leaving commissions in the calculations so the short fall is increasing.\r\nEmployers are abusing the loop hole by not paying national minimum wage and relying on their employees to make up the short fall with commissions.\r\nTHE SOLUTION\r\nThere should at least be a National Minimum Salary enforced to overcome this, this should equate to the amount of hours you work at the National Minimum wage.",
        "background": "For many years now National Minimum wage has been calculated and includes commission based jobs, so to calculate how your minimum wage is made up, your commissions will be topping your salary up to make up the short fall, this in some commissioned based jobs can be a short fall of \u00a3600 or more.",
