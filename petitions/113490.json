That's on top of their salaries of \u00a374,000 (which rose from \u00a367,060 last year). Hardly seems like they're short of a few pounds, does it?\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister's new plane is apparently going to save the UK tax payer \u00a3775,000 p/a. Which is great. However, lowering MP's salaries to match UK minimum wage will save the tax payer \u00a332 Million a year.\r\n\r\nWe're all in this together.",
        "background": "\"We're all in this together.\" Remember that? In the same month that the Conservative party try to push through benefits cuts that will affect millions of hard working people, the Prime Minister announces he's getting a new private plane.\r\n\r\nDoes this sound like we're all in this together?",

That power was given by Parliament to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) in 2010, so that after 2012 MPs no longer had control over their own pay. IPSA conducted a public consultation after 2012 and decided what the salaries of MPs should be after the election.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contact IPSA about its decision, here\u2019s how to contact them:\r\n\r\nhttp://parliamentarystandards.org.uk/About%20Us/Pages/Contact-Us.aspx\r\n\r\nThe only way that the decision of IPSA could be challenged would be if the law was changed to return the power to set MPs\u2019 pay to the MPs themselves, or to give the power to some other body. The law could only be changed by Parliament.\r\n"
