        "additional_details": "Bonfire night seems to get longer every year. Animal owners cannot sedate or prepare their animals for weeks or days on end. Many dogs and cats bolt in fear at the noise of fireworks, or spend nights in terror. Fireworks are no longer confined to 5th November, which causes many nights of stress to our pets. Fireworks without noise would allow people to celebrate with fireworks, but be kinder to our pets.",
        "background": "Fireworks are a part of our history, but the noise of them creates so much stress on our pets and other animals, we need to now compromise. Fireworks without noise can still be enjoyed for a visual display and our pets will incur less stress, as it is the noise that causes distress and disturbance.",
