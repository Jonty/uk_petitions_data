        "additional_details": "Students sitting their exams in 2017 want the same chance the years above got, with only having exams and no coursework, it's going to be much harder for students to achieve the grades they want. If it turns out a pupil is having a bad day on the day of their exam, it shouldn't determine their GCSE levels. With the grading system now, students have coursework to fall back on. Teens like me and thousands of others just want an equal opportunity to achieve their desired grades.",
        "background": "I'm a year 10 student who will be the first year to sit the new exams with the new grading systems. Many other students and teachers think this new idea is somewhat unfair and would likes to see a change. People sitting their exams in 2017 should get the same chance people in the previous years got.",
