        "additional_details": "I was shocked to learn at the age of eighteen (two years after the age whereby one can consent to having sex) that lesbian-specific protection exists. \r\n\r\nFrom asking people on my social media, only 18/100 people were taught about this protection in school, while 32/100 knew it existed.  \r\n\r\nThere is a call for homosexual sex-ed lessons in schools, but lesbian protection should be taught as a priority as a matter of promoting safe sex.  Everyone should know how to protect themselves and stay safe.",
        "background": "While every school teaches students to use a condom to protect from pregnancy and STI's, very few even mention lesbian-specific protection.  Young women should be formally educated on the risks they face when engaging in same-sex sexual activities and how best to avoid them.",
