        "additional_details": "For every 40 hours a 21 year old works, an 18 year old has to work an additional 10 hours to earn the same amount of money - this is essentially an extra week's worth of work every month.18-20 year olds are constantly exploited in the workplace because of this. Working for 200 hours pays around \u00a31,060 before tax and national insurance, working for the recommended 160 hours pays around \u00a3870. For a whole month this is not enough for an independent person to live off.",
        "background": "The current minimum wage for 18-20 year olds in the UK is \u00a35.30. The current minimum wage for 21- 24 year olds is \u00a36.70. This is a huge gap even though the cost of living is exactly the same; the cost of food, rent and bills is not lower - so why is the rate of pay? ",
