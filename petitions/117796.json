        "action": "Make people on benefits help out in their local communities where possible",
        "additional_details": "Some examples of the activities they could do in their communities include:picking up litter,gardening for the less able, helping out at youth centers. These are just some ideas and there are many other activities they could do. Those who are passed retirement age, working but on a low wage, disabled or unwell would be exempt from this programme. Those on the programme should be able to chose from a list what activities they are best at. This deters undeserving people from applying for benefits.",
        "background": "The sad reality about most of the people on benefits today is that they sit at home with nothing to do and a low likelihood of getting a job with decent pay. By working in their local communities they have something to do which is effective and they can learn skills which could help them get jobs.",
