        "additional_details": "There is a large portion of the country who choose not to vote as they believe it will make no difference. We the undersigned believe it's time to change the system so that result percentages are calculated using the number of registered voters and not only those who voted. We believe that this will give a more accurate picture of what the citizens of this country want.",
        "background": "The official result of the EU referendum was that 52% voted leave, whereas when the total number of registered voters was taken into account the result was only 37%. Likewise, in the last General Election in at least one area the number of abstainers was greater than the winning candidate's margin.",
