        "additional_details": "To allow someone to our lead great country after simply being voted into power at such a sensitive time by less than 0.5% of the electoral register couldn't be less democratic.\r\n\r\nWe must hold a vote in Parliament to trigger an early General Election; critically before the UK triggers Article 50, as we as a whole country must democratically decide who is to control the exit from the EU and how.\r\n\r\nWithout doing this the new Leader of the Comservatives will have no mandate; this is unacceptable.",
        "background": "The Conservatives are within their rights to appoint a new party leader, but given the severity of our country's situation post-referendum we must give the general public a right to decide (by election) which party is best to take us forward by allowing each of them to vocalise their manifesto.",
