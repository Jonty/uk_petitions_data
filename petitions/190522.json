        "action": "Schools should not be allowed to punish students for 'extreme hairstyles'",
        "additional_details": "Schools are using 'extreme hairstyle' as an excuse to choose carelessly what hairstyles are not allowed. Often multiple teachers have to 'confirm' together on whether or not a hairstyle is 'suitable'. A rule should not be subject to interpretation but rather clear to both staff and students.\r\n\r\nCertain cultures have particular styles excepted in everyday society, an example of this being 'braids' on those with African descents. Denying cultural norms in a culturally diverse society is allowing indirect discrimination",
        "background": "Telling students what hair they can and cannot have always ultimately permits indirect discrimination, knowingly or unknowingly. 'Extreme hairstyles' are ridiculous and subjective grounds for punishiment. Students should have 100% control over how they feel confident styling their hair to school.",
