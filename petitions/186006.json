        "additional_details": "Cornwall is small and being built upon like the rest of the country, however we have few trees and those we have provide important habitat for wildlife and enhance the landscape. We are losing trees everywhere for development and our landscape is changing rapidly. It is time to stand up for their protection. No building on Woodlands or copses.",
        "background": "The reason I have started this petition is because of the awful destruction of mature woodland in St Ives for development at Treloyhan Manor. I believe that woodlands should be afforded  extra protection above and beyond the Tree Protection Orders, especially in Cornwall where there are few trees.",
