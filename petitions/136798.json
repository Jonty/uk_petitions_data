        "action": "Lower the voting age so 16 and  over can vote in the next EU referendum!",
        "additional_details": "This decision affects the younger generations most, so why cant we voice are own opinions democratically. The government believes we are responsible enough to join the army, and fight in overseas conflict yet still denies we aren't mature enough to make a decision, where the outcome will have such a massive impact on our lives, and our future families. So please reconsider!",
        "background": " I am pleading to the  UK government to rethink their decision on the voting age, and to lower it so 16 year old's can vote. This petition isn't about whether you believe in \"IN\" or \"OUT\" this is about us youth, the new generation being able to show our voices in such a major decision. ",
