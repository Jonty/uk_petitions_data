        "additional_details": "If the AV was introduced all MPs would have the support of a majority of their voters. Following the 2010 General Election, two thirds of the MPs elected lacked majority support, the highest figure in British political history.\r\nAV also reduces the need for tactical voting. Electors can vote for their first-choice candidate without fear of wasting their vote.\r\nFinally It penalises extremist parties, who are unlikely to gain many second-preference votes.\r\n",
