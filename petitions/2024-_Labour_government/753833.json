        "additional_details": "We would like the UK Government to support this action because the creation of a Greater Tajik nation could help bring an end to the oppression of Tajiks in modern day Afghanistan under the Taliban and will reunify the Tajik people who have been separated by colonial borders. We believe the elimination of borders and territorial integration of the two regions will restore Tajik control and authority, improve human rights and inform future UK diplomatic and development policy.",
        "background": "We want the Government to support the unification of Northern Afghanistan and Tajikistan into one nation called Greater Tajikistan. Many people share the same culture, history and language. We believe unification could strengthen regional stability, improve trade routes, and enhance local governance",
