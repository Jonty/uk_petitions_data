        "additional_details": "Allowing hospitality businesses to reclaim 10% of their food costs against their 20% VAT liability could help hospitality face a more sustainable future, which can lead to growth. We believe it could stabilise thousands of independent venues which are at risk, and could prevent closures, which are damaging to local high streets & tourism. We believe this targeted support is simple to administer and directly strengthens struggling businesses without broad fiscal overhaul.",

We believe this would help businesses remain viable, protect jobs & sustain local communities, and that this could support thousands of independent businesses.",
