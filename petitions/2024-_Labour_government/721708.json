        "additional_details": "Every year, poor workplace mental health costs the UK billions\u2014not just in money, but in burnout, breakdowns, and lost potential. We react to crisis instead of stopping it from happening. Leaders don\u2019t know how to support their people, and stigma silences conversations. Making prevention a legal requirement will save businesses, protect employees, and stop waiting for people to break before we do something about it. This change is overdue.\r\n\r\nTime to Make some noise for all the right reasons",
        "background": "Workplaces legally provide physical first aid, but mental health support is optional\u2014that needs to change. We need mandatory mental health training for leaders, wellbeing KPIs, legal protections for psychological safety, and government-backed early intervention programmes. Prevention must be law.",
