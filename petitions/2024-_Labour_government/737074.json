The summer holiday are to long for children to be out of education for. It also affects them going back to school after the holidays, they take longer and find it harder to settle back into a routine, which is harder for educational professionals to deal with. Also it\u2019s harder for parents to find childcare whilst they work, being such a long holiday. Creating a stressful situation",
