        "additional_details": "The UK has one of the longest coastlines in Europe, and the UK experiences one of the largest tidal variations, with up to a 15m variation in the Bristol Channel.\r\nWe consider that tides are more regular, reliable and consistent than wind or sun exposure. France have been benefitting from tidal power since 1966 and have a 240 Megawatt installation in Brittany that operates very well. Focusing on a small number of large tidal installations could make integration with the power grid simpler and we think could help save hundreds of miles of additional pylons.",
        "background": "We think the government should reassess their priorities, away from sources of energy currently being promoted, (Wind and Solar), which we consider to be unreliable and ineffective, and increase investment in tidal energy generation, which we think is more reliable and efficient.",
