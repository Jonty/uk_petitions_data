        "additional_details": "Parliament must discuss why removing a Union Flag or a British nation\u2019s flag from public spaces should be considered treason. These flags embody Britain\u2019s identity, unity, and values, courage, liberty, sacrifice. Such acts disrespect Britons, risk fracturing identity, and threaten stability. Debate is vital to protect national symbols, uphold loyalty, and address free speech concerns. Parliament must clarify legal consequences to safeguard Britain\u2019s heritage and unity.",

These flags embody British values: courage, liberty, unity, forged in sacrifice. It\u2019s betrayal, not protest, spitting on our pride and heroes. It should b considered treasonous.",
