        "additional_details": "This would be to allow responsible dog owners to travel freely within the UK as long as the rules are followed. I believe that due to these rules, people who follow these rules cannot visit friends or family who live in Scotland from England or vice versa or cannot go on holiday in other UK nations. I also believe it is now difficult to find suitable boarding or sitters as many may not take XL Bullies.",
        "background": "I believe responsible owners of XL bullies are being unfairly restricted in many ways, despite the coordinated approach being taken by all nations in relation to exemption rules. I propose the Government create a single, UK-wide certificate for exempted XL bullies.",
