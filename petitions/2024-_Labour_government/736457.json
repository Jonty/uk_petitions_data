        "action": "Allow each child one flexible week off school per year outside standard holidays",
        "additional_details": "School holidays force families to travel at peak times when prices are highest, making holidays unaffordable for many, especially larger or low-income families. Allowing each child one flexible week off per school year with 4 weeks' notice, would ease financial pressure, reduce inequality, and support family wellbeing. Education matters but so does family time. We ask the UK Government and Department for Education to support this fair, family-friendly change.",
        "background": "We call on the government to require all schools in the UK to allow each child one week of authorised absence per academic year, taken at any time with reasonable notice. This would help working families take affordable holidays outside peak school holiday times.",
