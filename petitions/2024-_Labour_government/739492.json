        "additional_details": "We are concerned about dispensing pharmacies closing across the UK as they may be unviable, which can leave people, particularly the elderly and vulnerable, with no way of getting prescriptions. We believe additional goods for sale in pharmacies can be purchased elsewhere, but prescriptions which are vital for many people can only be supplied by qualified pharmacists, so we believe it is the Government\u2019s duty that all UK citizens have access to one.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to fund not-for-profit NHS dispensing pharmacies in every town in the UK, including the re-opening of any pharmacy that previously closed as NHS dispensing pharmacies. We believe they are a lifeline for anyone in need of prescription medicine and drugs.",
