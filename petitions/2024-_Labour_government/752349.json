        "action": "Call a General Election now due to loss of confidence in the Government",
        "additional_details": "Public confidence in the Government has declined significantly due to concerns about economic management, rising costs for working families, pressure on public services, weak border control, and failure to deliver key commitments. A General Election is needed to give voters a say on the UK\u2019s future direction and restore trust in national leadership.",
        "background": "We the public want Parliament to call an immediate General Election so the public can decide whether the Government still has a valid mandate. A new election would restore democratic accountability and ensure the country has leadership that reflects the priorities of voters.",
