        "additional_details": "We need to have a variety of courses  available for students  in mainstream schools other than GCSE's. Not everyone  is academic and it shouldn't  be one course for all. Schools should  be getting  90% or more pass rates on exams which include more relevant  skills and knowledge  to prepare  students  for the rest of their lives. Many schools get GCSE pass rates of 65% or less which is not acceptable.  Our children are being let down and many fail or leave school with no or poor qualifications .",
        "background": "Too many students  are put under tremendous amounts of high pressure to achieve  grades in exams which are ridiculously over complicated and so overwhelming. Many students can't cope with pressure  and therefore give up and fail. Students  endure  endless mock exams and study irrelevant topics.",
