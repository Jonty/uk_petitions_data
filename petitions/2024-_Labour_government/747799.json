Concealment fuels moped gang robberies and aggressive street crime, prevents identification, and terrorises communities. A targeted prohibition with narrow exemptions will strip criminals of an easy anonymity tool, improve investigations, deter organised attacks, and restore public safety and confidence.\r\n\r\nMoped gangs and people using these masks have to have their advantages taken from them.",
