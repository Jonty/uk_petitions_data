        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to review the CMS process for accepting reduced payments to ensure that paying parents aren\u2019t allowed to reduce their payment based on incorrect information. We want the CMS to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Require financial disclosure from both adults in the household;\r\n\u2022 Verify that any declared dependents are genuinely financially supported by the claimant; and\r\n\u2022 Exclude dependents who already receive maintenance from their biological parents.\r\nWe believe this will make the CMS fairer and prevent misuse of the system.",
        "background": "Currently, a paying parent can reduce their CMS payments by adding a partner\u2019s child as a \u201crelevant child,\u201d even if that child is not biologically theirs and already receives support from their own parent. We want the Government to review this process.",
