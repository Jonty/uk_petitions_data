Educational institutions must remain safe environments where children can learn without fear, yet recent events have shown that they are vulnerable to targeted acts of violence. We urge authorities to implement robust security protocols\u2014including threat assessments, emergency preparedness training, controlled access points, and enhanced coordination with law enforcement\u2014to prevent potential attacks. The safety of our students, educators, and staff must be treated as an urgent priority, and proactive steps must be taken now to secure our schools against any threat of terrorism.",
