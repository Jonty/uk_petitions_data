        "additional_details": "Children who have experienced early adversity, including those who are adopted or under SGOs, often face complex emotional, psychological, and developmental challenges. Specialist assessments are crucial in identifying these needs, leading to tailored therapeutic interventions that promote healing and development. The ASGSF has enabled access to such services, including trauma-informed therapies, which have been pivotal in improving outcomes for these vulnerable children.",

It has resulted in delays for assessment and treatment that is having real and potentially lasting impact. It needs to be rectified quickly.",
