With high EV depreciation, uncompetitive charging costs, and no additional incentives, this policy diminishes affordability and sustainability. Abolish EV road tax now.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to abolish the planned electric vehicle (EV) road tax in 2025 and ensure all EVs, both new and preowned, remain exempt for the lifetime of the vehicle. Support EV adoption with consistent incentives.",
