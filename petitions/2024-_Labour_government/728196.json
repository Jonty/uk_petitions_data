        "additional_details": "The NHS right to choose was partly introduced to releive pressure on parts of the NHS, like nurodiverse assessments. However if you wish to access NHS prescriptions you must also be assessed by your local council NHS provider so you are effectively taking up 2 appointments costing the NHS twice and leaving thousands on long and unnecessary waiting lists.",
        "background": "Currently GPs can, and most do, refuse shared care for ADHD medication even though the assessment and advice to medicate are via NHS right to choose.",
