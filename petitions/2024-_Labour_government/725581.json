        "additional_details": "We think the government\u2019s delayed action has allowed children to be harmed, and it is now their moral duty to right that wrong. In our view, vapes are a smoking cessation tool, not a product to attract new users. We think a full ban on the sale of all nicotine products, including vapes, to anyone born on or after 1 January 2009 is the only appropriate and responsible course of action.",
        "background": "We are calling for the Tobacco and Vapes Bill to go further and ban the sale of all nicotine products, including vapes, to anyone born on or after 1 January 2009. We think this would protect those already harmed by marketing campaigns and mean vapes are used only as smoking cessation tools.",
