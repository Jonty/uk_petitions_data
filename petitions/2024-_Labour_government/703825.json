        "additional_details": "As it\u2019s the right thing to do. We need more of a warning as all that flooding came out of nowhere. There wasn\u2019t even an alert for it. Or anything said on the weather channels, only that wales would get the worst of it not how bad it would be for us. There\u2019s needs to be more warnings and sirens for things like this. And for the councils around the area to do a lot more. So please help us Welsh people.",
        "background": "As most would know, during the storm Wales got completely flooded over the weekend with the councils not doing a lot for us around the area. And we want a change. That\u2019s why we are asking for more preparedness to be done if there was something to happen like this again.",
