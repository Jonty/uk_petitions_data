        "additional_details": "We believe commute costs place a significant burden on workers, particularly for those in areas where public transport is limited or expensive. We believe a tax refund on commute costs would make the system fairer, support economic participation, and reduce the financial strain on hardworking individuals. We also believe it recognises that commuting is a necessity, not a luxury, for many workers.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to introduce a tax refund for commuting expenses, including costs for fuel, public transport, or vehicle maintenance. We believe this would provide financial relief to workers who commute and ensure fairness for those incurring unavoidable travel expenses.",
