This is because petitions need to call for the Government or Parliament to take a clear and specific action, and we are not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do, for example setting out how you'd like the Government to change its policies or support for disabled people."
