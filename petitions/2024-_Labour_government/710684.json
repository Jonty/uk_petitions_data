        "additional_details": "Why leave cannabis illegal when the government can put a tax on it and sell it as they do alcohol or cigarettes! Both of which are so much worse for you than a naturally grown plant that has many health benefits with evidence by studies. Let's catch up to the modern world and legalize cannabis like many many other countries have done already. (This should include allowing people to grow their own plant at home for personal use, as long as they don't intend to sell to others)\r\n\r\n!LEGALIZE WEED!",
        "background": "I believe that cannabis should be legalized in the UK, especially for medical conditions such as Cancer, Anxiety, Panic Attacks etc.\r\n\r\nInstead of people obtaining cannabis illegally (which they're going to do no matter what) I think it would be better for the people, the country and the economy!",
