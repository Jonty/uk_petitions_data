If you\u2019re not given access for parking permits, staff have to resort to use the park and ride.The park and ride does not have adequate security, minimal lighting, where staff members have been followed, threatened, cars have been vandalised, broken into or stolen. Staff members have had to resort to risking parking fines for their own wellbeing by  parking on site.",

I feel that this is persecution against staff",
