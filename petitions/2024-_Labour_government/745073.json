Both debates will be in Westminster Hall and start at 4.30pm. A government minister will attend the debate and respond at the end.

For example, you could start a new petition calling for all petitions that reach 100k to be debated. \r\n\r\nWe've published the following petitions which you may wish to sign: \r\n\r\nMake Government Petitions Legally Binding at a Threshold of Public Signatures: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/736129\r\n\r\nGive More Power to Public Petitions to Force the Government to take Action: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/736968\r\n\r\nReform of petitions to include creating Citizens\u2019 Assemblies at 500k signatures: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/733648"
