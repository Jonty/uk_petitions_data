        "additional_details": "We are an addicted nation. An 18 yr old will spend 25 yrs of their life on a phone. Children spend less time outdoors (<1hr) than inmates. Loneliness, anxiety and polarisation are spiraling and all this before consideration of specific harms: exploitation, radicalisation, misinformation+\r\n\r\nThe UK has fewer bank holidays than almost anywhere in Europe.\r\nOne offline day/ year could provide a critical reset and reminder of what\u2019s important. A day to reconnect with ourselves and our local communities.",
        "background": "Britain needs a breather. An annual reset for our overwhelmed lives. A day where the nation logs off, looks up and reconnects. A government-enforced opportunity to not only build awareness for the grip tech has on us but remind us of what matters in a healthy society:  people, place and presence.",
