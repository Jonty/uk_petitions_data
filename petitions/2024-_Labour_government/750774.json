They fail to understand that parking in normal bays with small children is dangerous as cars can swing into bays without knowing what our who could be in the bay and potentially run children over. Also, people can park too close to cars and parents are unable to place their children into seats from the door.",
        "background": "I want to make it so parents with children who are age appropriate to hold badges for parent and child parking bays so if anyone who parks there without a child/children and a badge can be fined like disabled parking fines.",
