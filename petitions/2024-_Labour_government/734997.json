The petition appears to be about a role hosted on a platform which advertises both Government jobs and those offered by charity and private sector employers.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Sharia councils are not part of the court system in this country and have no legal status. If any of the decisions or recommendations they make are contrary to national law (including the Equality Act 2010) then national law prevails. This is no different to any other council or tribunal that is not recognised in law.\r\n"
