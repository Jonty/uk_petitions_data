        "additional_details": "We propose updating Section 170 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, to make it a legal requirement for drivers to stop and report collisions with cats.\r\n\r\nThis urgent change to the law is required so that when a cat is hit by a car: Owners can be notified and seek immediate veterinary help; Cats have a greater chance of survival if treated promptly; Ensures driver vigilance and accountability\r\n\r\nWe feel it is time that the law reflected the value and vulnerability of all companion animals equally.",
        "background": "Cats are beloved family members, yet the law does not protect them as it does dogs. When a cat is hit by a car the impact on families is profound and immeasurable. However, drivers are currently not required to stop, seek help and report it. This silent gap in the law must change.",
