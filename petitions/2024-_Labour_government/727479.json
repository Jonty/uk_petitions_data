        "action": "Conduct an independent review and reform of the Child Maintenance System (CMS)",
        "additional_details": "The current CMS system is causing severe financial hardship for many paying parents, often due to unfair assessments, estimated incomes, and aggressive enforcement tactics. Many parents who share care are still penalised. Reform is needed to create a fair, transparent system that truly supports children without pushing parents into poverty or homelessness. An independent review would ensure accountability and modernise the system for today\u2019s families.",
        "background": "We want the Government to carry out an independent review of the CMS and reform it to ensure fair, accurate assessments, better accountability for both parents, capped deductions, improved appeal processes, and protection from financial hardship for paying parents.",
