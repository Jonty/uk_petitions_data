        "additional_details": "Head and neck cancer treatments, such as surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, can result in long-term oral health issues, including dry mouth, tooth decay and infections. These conditions can severely affect survivors' quality of life, their self-esteem and ability to eat, speak. Providing free dental care could ensure patients have access to essential treatments, improve their health outcomes, and reduce the financial burden, similar to other cancer types already covered by healthcare services.",
        "background": "We want the Government to fund free dental care for head and neck cancer patients both during and after treatment to address the significant oral health challenges that survivors may face, and to improve their overall quality of life.",
