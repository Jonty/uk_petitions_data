        "additional_details": "Fireworks are unnecessarily cruel to animals and humans alike. From late October for at least 2 weeks, the noise of fireworks occurs almost nightly for Diwali and Guy Fawkes. Then again at New Year. They have the potential to cause both physical harm as well as frightening livestock, farm animals, domestic pets and triggering anxiety in vulnerable people and those suffering PTSD. This is totally preventable by banning retail sales and  limiting organised displays for prescribed dates and times.",
