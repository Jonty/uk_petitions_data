        "action": "Petition Against Retrospective Implementation of ILR on Skilled Worker Visas",
        "additional_details": "Because changing ILR rules retrospectively is unfair to legal migrants who built their lives in the UK based on the original promises. It would cause unnecessary hardship, break trust, and disrupt the plans of people who have contributed to the country in good faith. Many have invested years of work, under the expectation of stable rules, and sudden changes would create stress, insecurity, and financial strain. Keeping the original ILR pathway for current visa holders is essential to maintain fairness and confidence in the UK\u2019s immigration system.",
        "background": "I request the Government to stop ILR changes from applying retrospectively. Current Skilled Worker visa holders should keep the ILR pathway they were promised to, with any new rules applying only to future applicants to ensure fairness and protect those who have contributed to the UK in good faith..",
