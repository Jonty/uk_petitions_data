Yet the guidance from DWP is unclear about whether working parents receiving universal credit can be reimbursed for the cost of these contracted itemised meals. Furthermore, in the DWP document it states there\u2019s no Barriers, however we think that there are barriers because universal credits will not reimburse contracted meals that are itemised on the invoice. We think this can present a challenge to working parents due to financial pressures, it is not inclusive.",
