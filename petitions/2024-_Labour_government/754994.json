        "additional_details": "After the Bondi Beach Hanukkah attack in Sydney, where 15 people were killed and authorities are investigating it as antisemitic terrorism, most UK Jews fear that tolerating this slogan normalises calls to violent \u201cuprising\u201d. The First and Second Intifadas included suicide bombings, stabbings and murders of Jewish civilians. Publicly chanting \u201cglobalise the intifada\u201d can be understood as endorsing that violence and can embolden extremists and intimidate Jewish communities.",
        "background": "Introduce legislation and policing guidance to treat public chanting of \u201cglobalise the intifada\u201d as a call to violence/terrorism. Prohibit its use at demonstrations and public events, and require organisers and police to stop it and take enforcement action where it intimidates, harasses or incites.",
