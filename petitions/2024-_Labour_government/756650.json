        "additional_details": "Religious freedom for all religions should be protected, but problems arise when religious slaughter standards are introduced as a default without clear labelling, consultation, or the ability to opt out. Clear information, genuine alternatives, and consent are essential for fairness, choice, and public trust.\r\nConsent, respect, and genuine choice must apply equally to all religious, ethical, and moral beliefs which currently is sadly lacking",
        "background": "Require clear labelling of halal and kosher meat, end its default use in public institutions, guarantee a non-halal/non-kosher alternative, and ensure informed consent and consultation so that all religious, ethical, and moral beliefs are respected equally.",
