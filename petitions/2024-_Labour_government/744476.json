        "additional_details": "We give our prisoners 3 square nutritious meals per day - they have no choice about the matter - they are fed what they are given.  This issue is the same, we send children to school, they are required in school for a set period per day. There should be no discrimination between hot and cold food, food purchased on site or packed lunch.  Some children forget lunch and don't then get fed.  Catering in schools is a business - prices rise with inflation and these organisations run for profit.",
        "background": "WE want you to review the policy on hot school meals - we have children going to school hungry and coming out hungry - children who are unable to get a hot meal at school as food's ran out, catering organisations are ran as a business for profit and not considering what's best for our children!",
