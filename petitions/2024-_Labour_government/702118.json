        "additional_details": "At the moment the current policy involves making parents wait until the child is 2 years of age (if receiving benefits) or 3 if not in receipt of benefits. This is too late and is negatively impacting on working families and children. It means working mother's have to put their careers on hold for longer in Scotland, despite Scotland having higher taxes than England. Scotland want to help more families in poverty but this help only starts from 2 years of age, England helps everyone from 9 months",
        "background": "Align the Scottish childcare policy with that of England. So that all families with a child older than 9 months get 15 hours support with childcare costs.",
