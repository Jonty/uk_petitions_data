We feel that travel companies exploit this captive market, charging premiums compared to term-time prices.\r\n \r\nThis can act as a de facto pay cut for public servants.\r\nWith the current recruitment and retention crisis in education, pricing staff out of affordable rest is unsustainable. If the Government cannot raise wages, it must intervene to lower the cost of living for those serving our schools.",
