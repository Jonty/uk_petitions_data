        "additional_details": "Armley area (LS12 2AJ) lacks safe, high-quality recreational spaces for children and young people. Many families have limited access to playgrounds or youth facilities within walking distance. As a result, young people often have nowhere safe to be active, which contributes to poorer physical health, reduced social opportunities, and increased antisocial behaviour in the community. A Government-funded play area and skate park would provide a positive, safe environment that supports and strengthens the local community.",
        "background": "I request that the Government allocate funding or establish a national support programme to enable the development of a play area and skate park on the Big Field in Armley Leeds (LS12 2AJ). This investment would improve youth wellbeing, encourage physical activity, for the local community.",
