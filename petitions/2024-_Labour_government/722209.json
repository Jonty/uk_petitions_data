        "additional_details": "1.8 million private rented tenants receive housing cost allowance within UC or legacy HB. 60% of landlords have loans on their rental properties. Current remortgage costs and interest rates are forcing good landlords to leave the sector. This places greater burdens on the social housing sector which cannot meet increased demand. Thus putting more families into unsuitable temporary accommodation, disturbing lives, disrupting school attendance, effecting family health, physical & mental wellbeing.",
        "background": "Identify or select mortgage providers to offer established landlords who have let to tenants on benefits for the last 5 to 10 years a reduced interest rate when their current mortgage deal has expired. Landlords should then continue to let to tenants on benefits for the duration of the new mortgage.",
