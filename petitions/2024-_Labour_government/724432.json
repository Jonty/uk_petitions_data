        "additional_details": "We think this will help tackle inaccessible education, improve inclusion for neurodivergent pupils, and reduce mental health risks through better understanding, early support, and inclusive practices.\r\n \r\nMany neurodivergent pupils face barriers in school due to a lack of understanding and support. Only 14% of secondary school teachers have received more than half a day\u2019s training on autism, and autistic pupils are twice as likely to be excluded. We believe this contributes to poor mental health and emotional distress.\r\n \r\nMandatory training could help staff create inclusive classrooms, recognise distress early, make reasonable adjustments, and ensure neurodivergent children feel safe, supported, and able to thrive.",
