        "additional_details": "The failure to address unacceptable waits for ADHD assessments and subsequent medication therapy impacts society and individuals\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that 50% of neurodivergent individuals have to take time off work due to their condition. An inability to be able to access medication is forcing people in to long term sickness. \r\n\r\nIn addition, 25% of the adult prison population are estimated to meet ADHD diagnosis criteria. Failing to address the ADHD crisis is causing avoidable societal strains.",
        "background": "Declare a healthcare emergency with a view to fixing access to ADHD referrals and accessibility to needed medication. This is a societal priority and imperative to the government's work to reducing welfare claims and reducing prison population. The government need to prioritise access to diagnosis.",
