        "additional_details": "The Spanish Bluebell plus it's hybrid varieties is an invasive and quick propagator that is outcompeting our native English Bluebell in many areas. It is often impossible to eradicate from a garden and will quickly spread via air (seed) and underground (bulb) from one garden to the next. This can cause disputes as well as ruined gardens. It is readily available for sale online and in garden centres with no warnings about it's capacity to spread and carpet entire areas.",
        "background": "I want the Spanish Bluebell plus it's hybrids to be listed as an invasive plant species and banned from sale in the UK. I also want a ban on the planting of it in gardens or in the wild.",
