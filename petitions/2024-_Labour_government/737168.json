        "additional_details": "We think reducing National Insurance contributions for the social care sector would ease financial pressure, improve staff recruitment and retention, and enhance care quality. We think it would also help relieve strain on the NHS and support the long-term sustainability of vital services. The social care sector provides vital support to millions of vulnerable people, yet faces severe financial and recruitment pressures. We think high employer National Insurance contributions place an unsustainable burden on providers.\r\n",

With limited funding, this may affect staffing and care quality. We think reducing NI contributions would ease pressure, strengthen the workforce, and protect vital services.\r\n ",
