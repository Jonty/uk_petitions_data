        "additional_details": "Current uniform is not suited to the needs of growing children who spend long days learning, playing, and moving around.\r\nWe believe that uniforms should reflect a balance between practicality, equality, and comfort. For example, polo tops are more breathable and suitable in warm weather. Uncomfortable, tight, or poorly ventilated uniforms can be a distraction from learning Education should be the focus\u2014not discomfort caused by restrictive dress codes. Focus on what really matters: learning.",

The current standards\u2014such as mandatory blazers, ties, and rigid clothing\u2014are often uncomfortable, outdated, and expensive.",
