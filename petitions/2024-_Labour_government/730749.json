        "additional_details": "I am thin with a small car but I get enraged by tiny car park spaces. I literally have to hold my car door ajar so that it does not damage the adjacent parked car and squeeze/shimmy out of my car. It is demeaning and probably much worse for larger individuals. This needs to change. We think government need to set the minimum car park space dimension width as 3.6 metres, to accommodate not just the car but the actual people accessing their cars.",
        "background": "We think car parking spaces are too small and don\u2019t allow doors to open adequately for people to get in and out of their cars when other cars are parked either side of the defined parking zone. We want the Government to introduce a minimum width of 3.6 metres for car spaces in car parks. ",
