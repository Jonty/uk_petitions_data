        "additional_details": "The weather is getting hotter yearly and I think putting these measures into place early would encourage companies to provide adequate cool breaks or Aircon which will eventually be needed regardless as temperatures rise ..also staff would be fairly compensated for the hot work environment if safety measures are not met...i know some buildings hit over 50 degrees Celsius last year. We have no choice but to work so please make it safe.",
        "background": "I would like the government to decide on a maximum work temperature. As the temperature is rising yearly in England many work places are not equipped to cope with the heat.\r\nI would also like the government to consider heat compensation for staff of environments that rise above the chosen limit.",
