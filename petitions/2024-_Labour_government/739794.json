        "additional_details": "Currently, families on visas with \u201cNo Recourse to Public Funds\u201d cannot access the 30 hours free childcare scheme, even though they pay the same taxes as everyone else. Government guidance states that early education and childcare funding is not classed as a \u201cpublic fund,\u201d so children should not be excluded from the free childcare scheme on immigration grounds. Access should be based on work and contribution, not status, so all children have equal opportunities.",
        "background": "As working parents on visas, we pay the same taxes as everyone else, yet our children are excluded from the 30 hours free childcare scheme. This creates inequality, adds financial strain, and denies children like ours the early education they need to thrive.",
