        "additional_details": "St George\u2019s Day is a symbol of English identity, unity, and courage. Unlike Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, England does not have a dedicated public holiday to celebrate its patron saint. Making 23rd April a national holiday would promote cultural pride, bring communities together, and provide a meaningful celebration of England\u2019s history and values, while boosting morale and tourism. It\u2019s time England had the same recognition.",
        "background": "We want the UK Government to formally recognise 23rd April, St George\u2019s Day, as a national public holiday across the United Kingdom, giving people the opportunity to celebrate English heritage, history, and culture, just as other nations do with their saints\u2019 days.",
