        "action": "Protect Current International Students & PSW Visa Holders from ILR Rule Changes",
        "additional_details": "Many international students chose the UK based on the 5-year ILR route. Changing the rules now, before we move to Skilled Worker visas, is unfair and damaging. We\u2019ve invested time, money, and trust in the UK. This change would impact our careers, families, mental wellbeing, and future stability. It may also discourage future students, harming universities and the economy. We ask for fairness, clarity, and a respectful transition that protects current visa holders and their future.",
        "background": "We ask the UK Government to maintain the 5-year ILR eligibility for Skilled Worker visa holders and ensure proposed changes don\u2019t apply to current international students and Graduate Route (Post Study Work visa) holders who planned their future in the UK based on the existing system.",
