        "additional_details": "As an immigrant with strong qualifications and experience, I\u2019ve faced rejection in over 500 job applications due to the lack of visa sponsorship. Many skilled immigrants are forced into lower-level jobs, limiting their potential. Reforming visa and hiring systems would help the UK tap into this talent, address skill shortages, and allow workers to contribute to the economy. A fairer process would unlock opportunities for growth and innovation.",
        "background": "I urge the Government and Parliament to revise immigration policies to give skilled immigrants a fair chance at graduate-level jobs. This includes simplifying overseas qualification recognition, creating pathways into RQF Level 6+ roles, and offering incentives for businesses.",
