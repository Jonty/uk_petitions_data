        "additional_details": "Children cannot consent to life-altering medical experiments. This trial subjects minors to hormones with unknown effects on fertility & bone health. History is full of medical trials on children that caused unforeseen harm; such research on minors is inherently high-risk. Government must prioritize safeguarding over experimentation and protect children from interventions where informed consent is impossible. We call for the abolition of this trial to ensure children are not used for research.",
        "background": "Abolish the NHS puberty blocker trial for 10\u201316 year olds. We believe children cannot legally or ethically consent to experimental medical trials with unknown lifelong risks. The Government must stop this trial to uphold child safeguarding.",
