        "additional_details": "Nearly half of GP trainees are IMGs. Due to the 3-year training period, many are ineligible for ILR at completion, unlike other specialties with longer training periods. This leads to career disruption and stress, forcing some to leave the NHS and the UK. We believe that considering ILR for IMG GPs will help retain them, offering a strong return on investment for UK taxpayers.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to make international medical graduates (IMGs) who complete GP training in the UK and receive a Certificate of Completion of Training automatically eligible to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), reducing visa barriers and helping retain skilled doctors in the NHS.",
