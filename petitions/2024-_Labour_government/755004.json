        "additional_details": "Some work-based pensions allow for a named beneficiary to receive three years\u2019 salary as a 'death in service' settlement, which we believe is reasonable. If a spouse dies before their SPA, even when both have paid thirty-five years\u2019 worth of national insurance contributions, their partner cannot receive any part. We are calling for the Government to change this to allow a surviving spouse to receive a single payment equivalent to three years\u2019 worth of state pension payments.",
        "background": "If a spouse dies after retirement, surviving partners may be able to inherit up a part of their spouse\u2019s pensions, sometimes up to 50%. However, most people cannot inherit their spouse\u2019s state pensions based on their contribution record if their spouse dies before retirement age.",
