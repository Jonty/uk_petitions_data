        "action": "Introduce joint income taxation for a household",
        "additional_details": "The current UK system penalises couples with unequal incomes. Joint taxation would benefit families, encourage financial equality and fairness. \r\nAvoiding the \u00a3100k personal allowance trap, this is especially attractive for families where one parent stays at home or works part-time. It would support family stability and child welfare, encourage workforce flexibility without penalising families, and improve labour market participation.",
        "background": "We would like to urge the government to revise the UK tax system to allow married couples, civil partners or cohabitants to file income tax jointly, enabling household-level assessment instead of individual assessment.",
