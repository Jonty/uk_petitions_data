        "additional_details": "We call for the immediate recognition of Palestine as a sovereign state, and for international pressure to be applied to ensure unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. The denial of food, medicine, and basic shelter to civilians\u2014especially children\u2014is indefensible. No nation holds the right to inflict collective punishment or to violate the fundamental human rights of innocent people. The international community must act decisively to uphold justice and protect those most vulnerable.",
        "background": "We urge His Majesty\u2019s Government to formally recognise the State of Palestine and to take immediate action to ensure unimpeded humanitarian aid reaches civilians in Gaza. Innocent men, women, and children are facing starvation, medical crises, and unsafe living conditions.",
