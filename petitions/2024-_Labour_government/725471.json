        "additional_details": "More and more drivers, cyclists and even pedestrians are experiencing this danger on a daily basis, and this needs to be challenged.\r\n\r\nAlong with more and more vehicles having touch-screen controls (requiring the driver to take their eyes off the road to even change the heating or air-conditioning), these LED headlights are promoting significantly more unsafe vehicles on the roads, and thus directly, more potential serious injuries and certain deaths of road users and pedestrians.",
        "background": "Review compliance and safety regulations for vehicle LED headlights.  These headlights pose a serious danger to road users and pedestrians as they frequently dazzle oncoming drivers, even when in the \"dipped\" mode.  SUVs have their headlights at eye-level of drivers of normal cars, making it worse.",
