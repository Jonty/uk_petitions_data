        "action": "Make it a legal requirement to take cats hit by cars to a vet",
        "additional_details": "Cats are companion animals, yet drivers are not legally required to stop or seek help if they hit a cat. This can leave injured cats suffering without care. This petition is made in honour of a kitten called Little Bit, who was seriously injured in a road traffic collision and later taken to a vet by a kind member of the public after the driver did not stop. Delays in veterinary treatment can reduce the chance of survival. Requiring drivers to take cats they hit to a vet would improve animal welfare and save lives.",
        "background": "Amend the Road Traffic Act 1988 to include cats, so that drivers who hit a cat are legally required to stop and take the animal to a veterinary practice, or report the incident, if it is safe to do so.",
