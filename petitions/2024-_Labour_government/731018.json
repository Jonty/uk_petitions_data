        "additional_details": "It\u2019s much easier to focus and get work done when the room isn\u2019t too hot. When it\u2019s warm, most of us feel tired, uncomfortable, and distracted \u2014 it\u2019s hard to concentrate when you\u2019re sweating or just trying to stay awake. Cooler environments help us stay more alert and clear-headed, which makes studying and learning a lot easier. That\u2019s why schools should let us wear shorts, especially when it\u2019s hot. Dressing in a way that keeps us comfortable isn\u2019t about breaking rules \u2014 it\u2019s about helping us do our best. If we feel better, we\u2019ll learn better too.",
