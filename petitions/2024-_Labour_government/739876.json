Experts believe the planet is absorbing more solar energy than before and warming may be accelerating faster than models predicted. We think a similar system should apply to businesses and other organisations, which we believe should be given appropriate monthly allowances.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to create a monthly, free shareable, tradeable Personal Carbon Allowance (PCA) (in kgCO\u2082e) for those over 18 to limit and ration carbon usage. We want this allowance to include travel and energy use and reduce annually in line with Government carbon consumption targets.",
