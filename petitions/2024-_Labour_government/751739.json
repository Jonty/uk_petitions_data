        "additional_details": "I run a cat rescue from my small two-up, two-down home, with shelters built in the garden. The financial strain has hit us hard: donations are down, yet the vet bills are greater than ever. \r\nWe call ourselves a nation of animal lovers, yet small rescues like ours are rarely mentioned. We are saving lives too, and we need recognition, support, and a voice in this conversation before it is too late.",
        "background": "The financial strain is about the cost of care itself. Spay for a cat costs around \u20ac35. In England, the average price for a female cat spay is \u00a3230. Medication costs are equally shocking: for example, one drug we use, Serena, costs vets \u00a32.45 per tablet, yet pet owners are charged \u00a341 per tablet.",
