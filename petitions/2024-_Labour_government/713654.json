        "additional_details": "Over the years, countless vulnerable individuals\u2014many of them children\u2014have fallen victim to the heinous crimes of grooming, exploitation, and abuse. Reports from towns and cities across the UK have unveiled patterns of institutional neglect, poor coordination among authorities, and a reluctance to act decisively due to cultural sensitivities or fear of political repercussions. These failures have allowed perpetrators to evade justice while victims have been left unsupported and unheard.",
