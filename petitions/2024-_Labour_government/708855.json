        "additional_details": "Recognizing Scottish as a distinct language is crucial for preserving Scotland's cultural heritage and promoting linguistic diversity. By officially acknowledging it, the government will ensure Scottish speakers receive equal access to education, technology, and public services in their native tongue. This will empower over 1.5 million speakers, ensure the language thrives, and promote inclusivity, equality, and respect for all languages. Recognition of Scottish strengthens Scotland\u2019s identity and contributes to a more diverse, inclusive society.",

This recognition should include measures to protect and promote it, ensuring its inclusion in education, public services, and digital systems. Recognition of Scottish will honor linguistic diversity, equality, and inclusion",
