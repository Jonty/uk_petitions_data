        "additional_details": "Each parent can take up to 18 weeks of parental leave for each child until each child is 18 years old. This means that parents can only take on average one week of parental leave per year for their child. There are six weeks of summer vacation per year, two weeks off for Christmas, and two weeks for Easter. Additionally, there are four half-terms per year, each with a week off. There are roughly 14 weeks off from school per year. It's impossible for parents to take that much leave.",
        "background": "We believe raising the parental leave limit for parents working at least 16 hours a week is particularly important for single parents. We want the parental leave limit to be raised to at least 4 weeks per year. ",
