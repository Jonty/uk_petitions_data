        "additional_details": "Education is a basic right. Everyone should have the opportunity to go to their dream school/college. This would ensure that all children have the ability to get to school and learn. Parents cannot always be there for kids and a safe way to get home can help with peace of mind. Additionally, seniors get cheaper transportation so it's unfair on students.",
