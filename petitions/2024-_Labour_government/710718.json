        "action": "Cap the cost of private dental care to no more than 1.5x the cost of NHS dental",
        "additional_details": "Access to dental care is vital for maintaining overall health and well-being. However, the high cost of private dental services is a significant barrier for many individuals, particularly as NHS dental services often face long waiting lists and limited availability. These financial barriers have led to a rise in untreated dental conditions, which disproportionately impact low- and middle-income families. This aims to make dental care more affordable but also reduce pressure on NHS services.",
        "background": "Introduce legislation capping the cost of private dental care to no more than 1.5 times the cost of NHS dental care. This measure is essential to ensure that dental health remains accessible to all members of society, irrespective of financial circumstances and will help to reduce strain on the NHS.",
