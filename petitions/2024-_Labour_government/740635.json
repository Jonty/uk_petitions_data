        "action": "Keep the 5-Year ILR Pathway for EU Nationals under Skilled Worker Visas",
        "additional_details": "The UK and EU have long shared deep ties of cooperation, friendship, and freedom of movement. For many years, EU nationals have come to the UK to work, study, and contribute to the economy. Many of those now on Skilled Worker visas are not newcomers, but people who had already built their lives here under these shared rights and values, demonstrated commitment and loyalty to the UK. To extend the ILR pathway to 10 years would disregard the trust and history of cooperation between the UK and EU.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to maintain the 5-year pathway to Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) for EU nationals on Skilled Worker visas, rather than extending it to 10 years. This would recognise their prior contributions under free movement, support family stability, and uphold the UK\u2013EU relationship.",
