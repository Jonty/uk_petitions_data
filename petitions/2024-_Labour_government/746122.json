        "additional_details": "Many of these individuals have built their lives here, paid taxes, worked in essential services, and contributed to our communities. Yet they face financial and administrative barriers to becoming citizens, including high application fees and the Life in the UK test.\r\nPeople, effectively British should not be excluded by complex or costly processes. Recognising their commitment promotes fairness, integration, and  British values.\r\nWe call for citizenship for nationalised UK residents",
        "background": "Ask the UK Government to change its citizenship policy so that nationalised residents who have lived and contributed to society in the UK for years are automatically granted UK citizenship without needing to pass expensive tests.",
