Remaining tied to employer sponsorship for 10\u201315 years puts workers at serious risk, especially in sectors such as social care, where dependence on a sponsor can lead to unfair treatment. A two-stage ILR system would remove this vulnerability by allowing workers to leave restrictive sponsorship arrangements after three or five years, without granting immediate access to public funds.",
