        "additional_details": "It\u2019s about time pet shops stopped selling animals. Rabbits in particular are the 3rd most popular pet in the UK and the most neglected. 100,000 rabbits per year end up in rescues, putting enormous financial, emotional and physical pressure on them. They are being bred faster than they can be saved. There is no need to breed. These rabbits end up in unthinkable conditions and it\u2019s cruel and unfair.",
        "background": "I am calling for ALL pet shops to stop the sale of live animals. They are being over bred - leading to thousands upon thousands of animals being dumped, neglected and abused every single day.",
