        "additional_details": "Smartphones are not safe for children and are causing immense harm. Storing them is an option to better protect children during the school day. However, pouching smartphones:\r\nNormalises children owning smartphones\r\nEncourages parents of Year 6 to buy their child a smartphone\r\nIs very expensive (see Ireland)\r\nPromotes belief that schools cannot manage this themselves \r\nMakes complex what is actually straightforward\r\nLocks schools into contracts with 3rd parties that they will find difficult to leave",
        "background": "The Government should commit to not mandate nationwide phone storage systems in schools. The high profile movement to make this statutory should face proper scrutiny, in terms of costings, for example, and, instead, the far better alternative of banning smartphones from school premises be considered",
