        "additional_details": "COVID continues to exert a serious toll on national health. Its impact is felt across the NHS, schools, businesses, and industry \u2014 with clear consequences for the wider economy. While COVID primarily targets the respiratory system, it can affect multiple organs and trigger a wide spectrum of symptoms and complications, some leading to hospitalisation and potentially life-threatening outcomes. Unlike many other countries, the UK still restricts access to COVID vaccines, despite their vital role in reducing severe illness and protecting public health.",
