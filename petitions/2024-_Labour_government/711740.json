        "additional_details": "If you start working at 16/18 years old as a lot of us do, if you cannot retire until you are 66 then you are paying in all that money into your State Pension for almost 50 years. There is no way you can ever get the full benefit of that money because you are not going to live until you are 116 years old! Why do we have to pay in so much and wait so long when we cannot possibly ever gain from what we pay in fully. Plus why can the State Pension not be nominated to our family on our death?",
        "background": "Give everyone the right to retire at 60 and claim their State Pension. We all pay in from a young age and yet cannot claim it until we are 66. A lot of people will never get the full benefit of what they have paid in and sadly some people don't even reach that age so they never benefit from it.",
