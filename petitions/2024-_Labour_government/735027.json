        "additional_details": "\u00a337,600 is the mean average pre-tax salary in the UK. We think some employers impose excessively long notice periods (e.g. 3 months) even for minimum wage roles. We feel that this disproportionately affects workers earning below the national average salary, preventing them from moving to better-paid jobs and trapping them in low paid jobs.\r\n\r\nEmployers often cannot wait 3+ months to fill roles, meaning suitable candidates could be blocked from progressing or improving their pay.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to help protect lower-paid workers by legislating for a cap on contractual notice periods, so that no employee earning below \u00a337,600 can be required to give more than one month\u2019s notice.",
