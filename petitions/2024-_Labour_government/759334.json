        "additional_details": "West Dunbartonshire Council are picking on the most vulnerable people in the district. The 2 buses which are used to take the adults to and from the centre and used for outings through the day are now being axed from Bruce street from the 29th March. This means the services will be centre based all day taking away their independence, total savings are \u00a3295.00.\r\nHaving the bus is a huge part of the interaction for the adults who attends Bruce Street and taking it away is also taking away freedom.",
        "background": "We need everyone's help to try and put pressure on WDC as our vulnerable people need our help again. These adults rely on the bus and without it some will now be unable to attend the centre therefore isolating them from the community. We are asking if the Parliament can change this and keep the bus.",
