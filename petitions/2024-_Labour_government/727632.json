        "additional_details": "People came here with the United Kingdom Government's promise of settlement status after 5 years of working and contributing to the UK economy. If they change the rules for existing Skilled Worker visa holders, it would be a betrayal and people's lives would be affected by this decision. People have already built their lives in the UK, and moving the goalposts now will plunge many into deeper debt, uncertainty, and trauma.",
