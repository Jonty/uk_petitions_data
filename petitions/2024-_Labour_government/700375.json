        "additional_details": "Noisy fireworks in residential areas cause unnecessary suffering to animals and people. After a new housing estate was built near my farm, residents set off fireworks for over five hours, for days, distressing my horse and led to an injury and vet bills. And sleepless nights for me.\r\n\r\nEvery year, countless pets endure fear and anxiety from these loud noises. It\u2019s time to switch to silent fireworks for personal use and limit traditional fireworks to licensed organised displays.",
        "background": "Request action against the use of noisy fireworks in residential areas. Fireworks cause distress to animals, livestock, and individuals with trauma.\r\n\r\nCurrent regulations are often ignored. We urge stricter enforcement and only silent fireworks to be on public sale to protect our community.",
