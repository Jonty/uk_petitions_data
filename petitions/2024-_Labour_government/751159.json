        "additional_details": "Advances in technology, digital tax reporting, and improved financial visibility now make it possible to assess a range of income sources. We ask that CMS calculations take into account relevant financial assets such as property and landlord income, company shares and director benefits, as well as indicators of personal wealth such as vehicles, homes, and inherited assets.\r\n\r\nThis would help ensure fair and consistent maintenance assessments, reduce opportunities for individuals to avoid their responsibilities through artificial income minimisation, and better support children in single-parent households.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to conduct a full review of Child Maintenance System calculation rules for parents who are self-employed or work outside the PAYE system. We request a modernised, transparent assessment framework reflecting the true financial position of parents, regardless of employment type.",
