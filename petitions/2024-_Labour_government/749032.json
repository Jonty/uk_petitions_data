        "additional_details": "I feel like the current self defence laws are appauling, the non lethal self defence tools on market are mostly illegal to own and use and all current ones that a legal do nothing to stop an attack happening, we deserve the right as British people to live without fear of being murdered and not being able to stop that from happening without jail time, the world is changing drastically to a dangerous place so i believe its time for a change in self defence rights as this will deter future attacks",
        "background": "we need self defence laws changed so the British public has a right to defend themselves from attackers such as the Huntingdon train attack which could of been stopped sooner if we had a right to defend outselves",
