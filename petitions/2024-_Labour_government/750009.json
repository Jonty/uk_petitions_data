        "additional_details": "A manifesto is a publication issued by a political party before a General Election. It contains the set of policies that the party stands for and would wish to implement if elected to government. Very rarely are these policies delivered, or delivered exactly as they are portrayed. Claiming not to raise taxes- then raising taxes would be an example of going against the manifesto in which people voted for. This will bring a certain level of trust back to politics.",
        "background": "Political parties are elected based on their manifesto- so they should be made into a legally binding document. Whereby any manifesto promise that isnt made- or is broken , then legal action can be taken. This will make parties ensure they are delivering what they promise.",
