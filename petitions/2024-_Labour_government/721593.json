        "additional_details": "Modern LED and HID headlights are dangerously bright, causing glare that blinds drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians, increasing accident risks. The government must set stricter brightness limits, enforce proper headlight alignment in MOT tests, and ban ultra-bright aftermarket LEDs. Automatic high beams must be better regulated to prevent delayed dimming. We also urge investment in adaptive headlight technology to improve safety. It's time to act and make UK roads safer",
        "background": "The UK government must regulate excessively bright LED and HID headlights to reduce dangerous glare on roads. We urge limits on brightness, stricter MOT checks for alignment, bans on unsafe aftermarket LEDs, and improved high-beam regulation. Safer headlights mean safer roads for all.",
