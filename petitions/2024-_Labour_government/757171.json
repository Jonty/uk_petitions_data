        "additional_details": "UK student loan interest rates significantly exceed inflation and continue to grow even when graduates earn modest incomes. As a result, many borrowers see their debt increase despite making regular repayments. We believe the current system discourages social mobility, places long-term financial strain on graduates, and disproportionately affects lower and middle earners. The Government should reduce, cap, or reform student loan interest rates so that repayments genuinely reduce debt.",
