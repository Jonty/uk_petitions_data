        "additional_details": "The sugar tax already inflates prices and unfairly punishes consumers and small businesses, despite many switching to artificial sweeteners \u2014 which come with their own health concerns. Sugar in moderation is not the enemy. Education, not control, is the real solution.",
        "background": "The restrictions on sugary drink refills are an overreach that removes personal freedom and limits choice. People \u2014 not politicians \u2014 should decide what they consume. For example, diabetics experiencing hypoglycemia may urgently need access to sugary drinks, and blanket bans make that harder.",
