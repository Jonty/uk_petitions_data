        "additional_details": "Footballers under investigation for serious crimes can still play, earn full pay, and appear for their clubs \u2014 with no transparency or interim action. This would be unacceptable in education, healthcare, or law enforcement. Football must follow similar safeguarding standards. This is not about presuming guilt, but about protecting women, maintaining public trust, and ensuring football reflects the values we expect in every other part of public life.",
        "background": "Work with the FA and Premier League to require that players under police investigation for serious offences like rape or assault are suspended temporarily, and to create a national safeguarding code of conduct for all professional football clubs.",
