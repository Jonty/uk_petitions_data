        "additional_details": "There is currently a proposal to amend copyright law to provide an \u201cexception\u201d for tech companies, allowing them the ability to freely steal the work of millions for their own commercial interests. If passed, this would be an absolute disaster for the UK\u2019s Arts sector, destroying the livelihoods of countless people. It would also compromise protections against deep fakes, and allow scammers and bad actors to create convincing fabrications to either extort someone or damage their reputation.",
        "background": "Creators and Performers need strong protections against tech companies harvesting their work to train \u201cGenerative AI Models\u201d. Every performance, piece of writing and work of art needs to have total protection from being included in training data, and clear ownership rights for the Performer/Artist.",
