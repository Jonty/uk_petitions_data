It will lead to increased refugee migration, rising living costs, and the threat of retaliatory attacks. The UK\u2019s support for Israel risks damaging its global image and public trust.  We want the government to prioritize peace, diplomacy, and the well-being of its citizens. Any decision regarding the involvement in the war must go through a parliamentary debate.",
