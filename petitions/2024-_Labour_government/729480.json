        "additional_details": "We think many young people feel their futures were decided without their say. We think a youth mobility deal must address the barriers now faced, like visas, affordability, and access to EU schemes like Erasmus. We think the Government must actively include young people in shaping these decisions and consider democratic ways to reflect the views of those unable to vote in 2016. We think the government should ensure British young people the freedom to live and work across Europe, just as previous generations once enjoyed.",
        "background": "We feel many young people, born EU citizens, lost key rights post Brexit and many may have been unable to vote in 2016. As the Government considers a youth mobility scheme, we think it must consult young people to ensure their needs are met, with access to the same opportunities as prior generations",
