        "additional_details": "A.I. media generation is going to cause immense issues. This can range from the less serious, such as the manipulation of footage of politicians to say things they didn't and the spread of fake, albeit harmless, misinformation, to the outright dangerous and disturbing - such as the generation of child sexual abuse material,  the fabrication of 'evidence' in criminal trials and the mass production of enhanced deep-fake pornography. \r\n\r\nThis is dangerous & of no material benefit. It must be banned.",
        "background": "The Government must ban the use of large-language models or other generative AI systems and software in the production of image, video and audio media. \r\n\r\nIt must take every step necessary in order to enforce such a ban.",
