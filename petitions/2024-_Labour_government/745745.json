        "additional_details": "The Home Office announced powers to allow police to consider the \u201ccumulative impact\u201d of repeated protests when deciding whether to impose conditions or stop them. While the Government says this is about preventing disruption, the effect would be to make it harder for citizens to protest more than once about the same issue. These proposals risk silencing voices and discouraging people from standing up for what they believe in. We urge the Government to protect, not weaken, this fundamental right.",
        "background": "Withdraw proposals to give police powers to restrict or ban \u201crepeat protests\". We think these measures undermine the right to free expression, peaceful assembly and democratic participation in the UK. Peaceful protest is a vital part of holding Government to account. Defend free speech. ",
