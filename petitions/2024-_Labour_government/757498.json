        "additional_details": "The Recall of MPs Act 2015 should be reformed to include voluntary party defections as a trigger condition. \r\n\r\nSome may ask why not instead mandate automatic by-election upon defection. While this approach has its merits, by-elections cost taxpayers an average of \u00a3240,000, so it makes sense to only hold one when there is clear constituent demand. Some MP defections, such as Lee Anderson's in 2024, reflect shifting voter preferences - in such cases, automatic by-elections can prove unnecessary.",
        "background": "When MPs defect to another party during a Parliamentary term, they betray the trust of constituents who supported them. Voters elect MPs as local representatives, but party affiliation and manifesto commitments almost always drive that decision. Our political institutions must recognise this.",
