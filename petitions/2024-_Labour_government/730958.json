        "action": "Ban Second Jobs and Paid Gigs for Elected Officials, Including MPs",
        "additional_details": "Elected officials are elected to serve the public. Second jobs or paid roles risk conflicts of interest, reduce public trust, and distract from their duties.\r\n\r\nServing as an MP or other elected official should be a full-time role. The ban should cover all forms of paid work, including jobs, consultancy, media, speaking gigs, and board positions, whether paid directly, indirectly, or through companies or trusts.\r\n\r\nPublic service requires full focus and accountability. This measure would help protect democracy and ensure officials serve only the people who elected them.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to introduce legislation that bans Members of Parliament (MPs) and all other elected officials from holding second jobs or engaging in any other paid work or \u201cgigs\u201d during their term of office, regardless of whether payment is monetary, in kind, or indirect.",
