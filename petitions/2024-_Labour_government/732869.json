        "additional_details": "We urge Parliament to legislate or amend laws such that no airfield/aerodrome is closed & redeveloped without formal consultation involving public, industry, and government. Each site\u2019s strategic value should be assessed, with DfT input required. We think airfields should be recognised as critical infrastructure supporting aviation, emergency services, military, and economic growth. We think preserving them is vital for the UK\u2019s role in the Advanced Air Mobility Revolution and emerging sustainable air transport.",
