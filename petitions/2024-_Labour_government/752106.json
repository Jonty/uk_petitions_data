        "additional_details": "The government itself states that international students need \u00a31100 to \u00a31600/month for living expenses. Students are struggling to meet essential needs, such as housing and food, while staying within a 20h cap. \r\nRestricting independent work prevents students from taking part in flexible forms of employment that align with today\u2019s market.\r\nIf the UK wants the best and brightest it must allow students to work enough to cover their basic needs, creating competitiveness as a global study destination.",
        "background": "Increase the weekly working hour limit for international students from 20 to 28 hours during term time.\r\nAllow international students to take part in independent work, so they can engage in modern forms of employment and develop experience relevant to their studies and future careers.",
