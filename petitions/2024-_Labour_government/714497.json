        "additional_details": "We think this action is necessary to enhance public safety and security. Balaclavas can be used to conceal identity, making it impossible for authorities to identify individuals in the event of criminal activities or public disturbances. By restricting their use to appropriate contexts, such as winter sports, we think the government could help reduce the potential for anonymity in situations that could compromise safety while allowing for personal freedom in legitimate circumstances.",
        "background": "We want the government to introduce legislation that clearly defines restrictions on wearing balaclavas in public, with exemptions for winter activities.\r\n \r\nThere could be penalties for non-compliance, and guidance issued to ensure public understanding and adherence.",
