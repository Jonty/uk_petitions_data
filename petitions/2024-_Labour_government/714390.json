Many suffer from persistent symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and malnutrition, with limited treatment options. We think this device could reduce hospital stays and improves nutrition. We think providing funding could ensure equitable healthcare access, reduce long-term NHS costs, and offer patients a chance at a better quality of life, free from constant hospital visits and severe symptoms.",
