I believe a licence would establish minimum standards that dog walkers must meet. Currently, walkers may take more dogs than they can handle, which could be unsafe. I believe a licence would regulate numbers. If a licensed walker acts irresponsibly, their licence could be suspended/revoked and this could give incentive to follow conditions.",
