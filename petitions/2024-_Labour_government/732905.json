Parliament\u2019s own Public Accounts Committee has raised concerns about this technology. In their 2023 report, they stated that Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) remains \u201cuntested at scale\u201d in the UK, and warned that its ability to deliver either value for money or climate goals is \"still unclear\".",
        "background": "We ask the Government to pause the Liverpool Bay marine CO\u2082 government storage project until a full independent safety and environmental assessment is completed. This site risks acid formation, seabed contamination, and long-term damage to protected marine ecosystems and aquifers.",
