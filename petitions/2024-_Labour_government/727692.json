The murder of a child is one of them.\r\n\r\nWhen someone brutally takes the life of a child, and modern DNA evidence confirms their guilt beyond all doubt, there should be no room for leniency. It\u2019s time for the UK to bring back the death penalty in the most extreme cases\u2014but only where the evidence is final and irrefutable.",
        "background": "We call on the UK government to reinstate the death penalty\u2014but strictly for child murderers whose guilt is proven with 100% certainty through DNA evidence. Justice must reflect the horror of the crime when the most innocent lives are taken.",
