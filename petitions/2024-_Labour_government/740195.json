        "additional_details": "While laws such as the Equality Act 2010 and the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 exist, we believe they do not adequately address discriminatory rhetoric by political parties or individuals unless it meets extreme legal thresholds. As such, we believe parties are able to promote harmful views without consequence. We ask for an independent body with the power to investigate complaints, assess patterns of discriminatory behaviour in political campaigns, and apply meaningful sanctions.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to create an independent public body to monitor political discourse and introduce sanctions, enforced by this body, against candidates or parties who are using discriminatory rhetoric. We believe we need clear rules to stop discriminatory rhetoric in political campaigning.",
