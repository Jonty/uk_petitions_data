        "action": "Off-Peak prices for holidays for educational staff",
        "additional_details": "Educational staff dedicate their time, energy, and passion to shaping the minds of future generations, often working long hours beyond the classroom with limited flexibility for time off. Because they can only travel during fixed school holidays, they are unfairly subject to inflated peak prices, making rest and recovery unaffordable for many. This not only impacts their well-being but also affects morale and retention in a vital profession.",
        "background": "We request off-peak holiday prices for all educational staff, including teachers, assistants, admin, and support roles. These prices should apply during school holidays, matching standard off-peak rates. Access should be simple, requiring only proof of employment in education.",
