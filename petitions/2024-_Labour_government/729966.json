        "additional_details": "The current driving test booking system has collapsed. Learners face months-long waits, websites block access, and bots monopolise slots to resell for hundreds of pounds. This creates stress, encourages fraud, and exploits the public. The DVSA must fix this with urgent reforms and enforcement.",
        "background": "Increase driving test capacity by opening new centres, extending test hours and offering weekend slots. Enforce measures to stop third-party resellers and bots from exploiting the booking system and reselling appointments.",
