Schools should protect and encourage those rights, not compromise them.\r\n\r\nMany schools do not have clear policies explaining where this information is stored, how long it is kept, whether it is ever reviewed, or who has access to it. This lack of transparency raises serious data protection concerns.\r\n\r\nWe believe the Government must step in to ensure that all education respects the students' dignity when online.",

Keyloggers record everything a student types, including private messages and passwords not intended for others to view, which is a breach of their digital privacy.",
