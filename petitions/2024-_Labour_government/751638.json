People already living, working and contributing to the UK should not have the terms of their settlement route changed suddenly. Stability and fairness require that new rules only affect future applicants.",
        "background": "The Government should keep the current 5-year qualifying period for Indefinite Leave to Remain and ensure that no new rules are applied retrospectively to people already on a valid route to settlement. Any changes should apply only to new applicants.",
