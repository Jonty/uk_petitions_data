We seek a national fund and public inquiry into government and council decisions on RAAC. We want laws to protect homebuyers, including a high-risk building register, mandatory issue reporting by surveyors and solicitors, and developer accountability for defects. We think mortgage interest charges should be banned on condemned properties, and first-time buyer status restored for affected owners.",
