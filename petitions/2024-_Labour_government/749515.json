        "additional_details": "I want Parliament to act because prohibition is failing to protect young people and communities. The illegal cannabis market fuels organised crime, child exploitation, human trafficking, and unsafe products. A regulated system with age limits, lab-testing, education, and strict licensing would reduce crime, protect children, improve public safety, free up police resources, and generate tax funding for the NHS and education. This is a responsible public-health approach, not a pro-drug stance.",
        "background": "I am asking the Government to replace the current illegal cannabis market with a regulated, controlled system that protects young people, reduces organised crime, prevents human trafficking, and generates tax revenue for public services.",
