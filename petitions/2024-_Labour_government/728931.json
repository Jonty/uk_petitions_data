        "additional_details": "We think the government should get these kinds of crimes deleted from the Standard and Enhanced DBS check. We believe that the individual who only committed one crime in their life, which is also potentially a minor incident, a one off mistake in life, doesn't deserve to be embarrassed in a job application by this coming up as a reminder. In life this could have a mental impact and unnecessary stigma on them, or they may even be rejected in jobs which they deserve to work in.",
