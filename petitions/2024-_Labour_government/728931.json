We believe that the individual who only committed one crime in their life, which is also potentially a minor incident, a one off mistake in life, doesn't deserve to be embarrassed in a job application by this coming up as a reminder. In life this could have a mental impact and unnecessary stigma on them, or they may even be rejected in jobs which they deserve to work in.",
