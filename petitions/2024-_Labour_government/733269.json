The event could be delivered through collaboration between Parliament\u2019s Education Service, broadcasters, and major online platforms. We think this would help ensure impartiality, secure moderation, and wide reach. The process should involve no political filtering of questions, only legal and safety moderation.",

Questions wouldn\u2019t be shared in advance and would be moderated only for legal/safety reasons on social media platforms.",
