        "additional_details": "Taxing unused pensions as part of IHT is wrong because it punishes prudence, double\u2011taxes already\u2011relieved income, forces bereaved executors into complex admin, and may trigger fire\u2011sales of assets to meet a cash tax on illiquid funds. It undermines the policy goal of encouraging retirement saving and shifts rules late in the game, hitting ordinary families who relied on guidance that pensions sat outside estates. This is harming hard working families at their most difficult time",
