This may prevent retail investors having a say on the future of the company and their investments.\r\n\r\nWe believe enfranchising shareholders can be easily achieved and we think it will support investor confidence and help attract capital to the UK stock market to deliver growth and prosperity.",

This would allow investors or their advisers to vote their shares without obstacles or additional charges.",
