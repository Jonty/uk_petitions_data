We were a compassionate nation at the end of WWII and rehomed a lot of holocaust survivors. Why can\u2019t we do that now? The illegal immigration statistics should not affect the legal immigrants. If we lose legal immigrants the economy will collapse; the statistics say it for themselves. This will uproot their lives",
