        "additional_details": "Parliament(P) is sovereign. But in a Democracy, it is the people who rule. So, we believe we are a dictatorship. We think P is not fit for purpose (mass immigration, over-borrowing, what we see as \"us\" and \"them \" laws, etc) and that the end of P is a real possibility. We believe we need a peaceful solution like government-by-referendum as the Swiss have. We think that the beauty of such a system is that P will need our consent by NR for its policies, so it will have to explain them clearly and prove they are in the nation's best interests. Our view is that this way, we all win!",
