        "additional_details": "The current UK ban on kava was introduced over twenty years ago and has not been reassessed in light of subsequent international research and regulatory developments. Other countries now manage kava through controlled frameworks rather than prohibition. A formal review would allow the Government to assess whether the existing ban remains appropriate, while ensuring public health protection and fair treatment of culturally significant traditional foods.",
        "background": "Kava, also known as yaqona, is a traditional, non-alcoholic drink with long-standing cultural significance for Pacific Island communities. The UK ban dates from 2003. We ask the Government to reassess this ban in light of updated scientific evidence and international regulation.",
