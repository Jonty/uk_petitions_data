At a time when there is a cost of living crisis, senior citizens have been denied the winter fuel payment, the budget has had a negative affect on business and the British people are struggling to make ends meet. It is not acceptable to waste money.\r\nAll Foreign Aid should be reviewed in line with British values and British interests. Aid should be just that, we will help in a crisis or disaster.",
