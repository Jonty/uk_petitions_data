That is a very unsafe statement as there are many kidnappings occurring and would you rather your child walk home in weathers such as rain, extreme heat, hail etc or be in a safe space and can lock their doors if someone tries to attack them?",
        "background": "Make the Legal age to drive a car 16 and make a age you can apply to get a provisional license around 14 and 9 months as most people already have an idea of how to drive by the age of 14 and if they can practice in a real vehicle at 14 they could be ready for a license by 16 years old",
