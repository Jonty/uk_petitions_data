        "additional_details": "The price of taking children away on holidays is extortionate and with this being unachievable for many parents like myself, this impacts not only the lived learning potential of young people but also their mental health and well being. This current issue has a further impact on families with a low income and continues to create a financial divide in society, without a fine families could enjoy a more diverse cultural experience and instil a more inclusive mentality in the younger generation.",
        "background": "Abolish fines on term time holidays which will allow for children to have up to 10 days of authorised leave. Pairing \u2018holiday leave\u2019 with bespoke home learning during the time will educate not only the young people who are using the allowance but also their peers using lived events and experiences.",
