        "additional_details": "As of 2024 the fraudulence rate for PIP was 0%. PIP is not based on whether or not someone is in work and reducing PIP will not increase the number of disabled people in work but instead increase strain on the NHS as PIP money will not be available to support disability related costs. The PIP system works and is currently deemed fair. This is an unnecessary change and only hurts disabled people- a minority that anyone can join at any time.",
