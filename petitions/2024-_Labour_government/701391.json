        "action": "Introduce legal consequences for automated buying and reselling of driving tests",
        "additional_details": "Booking a driving test is presently a race against organisations using bots to purchase all available DVSA test slots, and brokers reselling those very slots at an extortionate markup. As it stands, there is nothing to deter people from doing this, and the DVSA has not taken sufficient action to reinforce the booking system against automated technology. Legal action, such as a substantial fine, against these organisations and brokers would dissuade them from cheating the system.",
        "background": "To deter organisations from using bot technology to purchase driving test availabilities and resell them at exploitative markups, introduce a legal repercussion for this. The DVSA should also review the current booking system and make it harder to exploit by profiteers and non-learner drivers.",
