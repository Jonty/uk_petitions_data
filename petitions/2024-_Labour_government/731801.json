        "additional_details": "Currently, applications for BESS sites are being approved by planning authorities on the basis that \"the benefits to the community outweighs the harm done to the green belt\". It is becoming increasingly clear that there's a lack of central control over these applications and empirical evidence is indicating that the goverments tragets for 2030 and 2035 have already been met by the applications that have already been approved, yet hundreds still remain in the planning pipeline. Stop this madness.",
        "background": "We call on the government to introduce more stringent central controls on the arbitrary planning applications presented to local planning authorities for the creation of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS sites), most being on green belt land.",
