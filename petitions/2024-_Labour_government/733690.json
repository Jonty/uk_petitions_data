This scheme promotes fairness, improves safety, and reduces misuse across the UK. A badge would: clearly show eligibility, allow enforcement via fines, improve access for parents with young kids, and be free or low-cost, valid for 3 years from the child\u2019s birth.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to introduce an official \u201cParent & Baby Parking Badge\u201d scheme for families with newborn children, valid for 3 years from birth. This badge would work similarly to the Blue Badge for disabled drivers and must be displayed when using designated Parent & Child parking bays.",
