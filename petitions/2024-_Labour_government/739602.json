        "additional_details": "Many people are left waiting on hold for 30 minutes or longer when trying to reach customer service. This happens across many industries and wastes customers\u2019 time, causes stress, and can be especially difficult for vulnerable people.\r\n\r\nWe believe companies should not be allowed to trap customers in long waiting queues. A legal maximum waiting time of 5 minutes, or mandatory free call-back service, would ensure fair treatment and better customer service standards for everyone.",
        "background": "We want the Government to introduce a law that prevents companies from keeping customers waiting on hold for more than 30 minutes. Any company that offers customer support over the phone should be required to answer within a reasonable time or provide a free call-back option.",
