        "action": "Place a two term limit on mayors.",
        "additional_details": "Mayors in Britain have a disproportionate amount of power over their communities, especially the police, much more than the local MPs. Many are voted in by cultural block voting on top of the traditional political party vote, eg London, and simply can never be voted out. That's not democracy and in fact stagnates local councils. \r\nA two term limit is accepted all over the world and will refresh and energise local councils across the country.",
        "background": "Impose a two term limit on the 5 year mayoral term in order to refresh the local voting patterns and protect British democracy from block voting. As it is, many mayors across Britain are in for life and the communities are stagnating.",
