        "additional_details": "To lose the Lister Building is not only to erase a physical structure\u2014it is to sever Bradford\u2019s connection to one of its most profound achievements: the creation of a public educational infrastructure that empowered generations of students in science, art, and industry. Its date stone, its Bradford coat of arms, and its original, now-disused front entrance are reminders of an era when civic pride and public investment in knowledge were bound together.",
        "background": "We call upon Bradford Council and all relevant authorities to halt any proposed demolition of the historic Lister Building, and to instead recognise, preserve, and revitalise it as a living testament to Bradford\u2019s pioneering role in textile education, innovation, and civic architecture.",
