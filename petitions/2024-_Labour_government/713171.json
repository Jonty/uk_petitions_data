        "additional_details": "This expose points to the concerted efforts made by various official agencies, involved in the investigations to prioritise 'community cohesion' over the basic rights of the victims. \r\nEvidence was routinely ignored, with many subjected to egregious victim blaming including the threat of prosecution for 'false' allegations of criminal activity.\r\nThis is inimical to the rule of Law and justice.\r\nA statutory inquiry will hold these officials to account, ensuring that the victims receive justice.",
        "background": "From the expose in the Daily Telegraph (January 8th 2025) it would appear that the criminal investigations into the depradations of the Pakistani Grooming Gangs against under-age girls was deeply flawed.  Specifically, evidence provided by the victims was routinely ignored thus denying them justice",
