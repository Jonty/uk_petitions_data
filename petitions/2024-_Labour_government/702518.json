        "additional_details": "Early identification of neurodivergent conditions like ADHD, autism, and dyslexia is crucial for children\u2019s development and success. Over 15% of UK pupils have Special Educational Needs (SEN), yet many are undiagnosed, leading to delayed support and poor outcomes.  Mandatory screening in state primary schools would ensure no child is overlooked, promoting equity in education and enabling all children to reach their full potential.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to mandate that all state primary schools in England screen every pupil for neurodivergent conditions, such as ADHD, autism, and dyslexia. Early identification is essential to provide timely support, improve educational outcomes, and promote equal opportunities.",
