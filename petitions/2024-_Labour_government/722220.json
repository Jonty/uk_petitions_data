        "additional_details": "We feel that businesses have already been affected by increases in employer national insurance contributions, increases in the minimum wage and increased inflation, and that unfortunately, many businesses may not survive, especially given the already challenging economic climate. We urge the Government to increase business rates relief from 40% back to 75%, to support businesses and ensure that the local economy does not suffer further job losses.",
        "background": "We believe the Government\u2019s decision to cut the retail, hospitality and leisure business rates reliefs from 75% to 40% from 1 April could mean thousands of businesses will see business rates bills rise significantly in the year ahead. We believe such rises may be unsustainable for many. ",
