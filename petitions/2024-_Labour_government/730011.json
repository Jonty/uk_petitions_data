        "additional_details": "Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable forms of cancer if detected early. Increasing the time between smear tests would significantly increase the risk of late detection, putting thousands of women at unnecessary risk of advanced cervical cancer.\r\nwomen rely on these regular tests to catch changes in cervical cells before they develop into something more serious. Extending the interval\u2014based on assumptions of improved HPV testing or vaccine coverage\u2014should not come at the cost of lives.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, call upon the NHS and relevant health authorities to maintain the current 3-year interval for cervical smear tests for women aged 25 to 49 and not extend the time between screenings.",
