        "additional_details": "There is no proven link to better outcomes and formal uniforms. Instead it creates unnecessary barriers to education and wellbeing.\r\n\r\nRestrictive clothing causes discomfort and distraction for many children but especially those with SEND, including sensory processing differences.\r\n\r\nIt is an outdated expectation that does not align to the workplace expectations of today. \r\n\r\nThe large financial burden that comes with blazers costing \u00a340\u2013\u00a360 and require frequent replacement as children grow.",
        "background": "Build on the 2026 cap on branded items by issuing statutory guidance that phases out the requirement for restrictive blazers and ties in all state funded schools. \r\nSchools should adopt practical, comfortable, inclusive, and affordable uniforms and prioritise pupil wellbeing.",
