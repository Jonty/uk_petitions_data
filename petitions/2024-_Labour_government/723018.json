        "action": "Title: Increase Funding for Nurseries to Support Early years education",
        "additional_details": "Nurseries play a crucial role in early childhood education, yet many struggle to stay open due to inadequate funding. This leads to staff being underpaid, parents facing unaffordable fees, and children missing out on essential early learning. \r\nProper investment in early years education benefits society as a whole. We call on the Government to prioritise funding for nurseries to secure a brighter future for children and families.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to increase funding for nurseries to ensure they can provide high-quality early years education and care. Chronic underfunding has led to closures, staff shortages, and rising costs for parents.",
