        "additional_details": "I am currently applying for a WAV with Motabilty Foundation and in discussing my needs I have explained how frustrating it is to access a local WAV taxi. They have told me this is a nationwide problem. The Equality Act 2010 is meant to level up access to enable disabled people to be as independent as possible and have good quality of life as does the rest of the population.",
        "background": "I am an adult wheelchair user. The list of wheelchair accessible taxis (WAV) on the council website is misleading. Only one operates in Bath and often tied up with school runs. This is an essential service to the disabled community. I've been left in the rain by regular taxis who refused to take me.",
