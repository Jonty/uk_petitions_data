We should definitely be looking towards other countries like Norway and Iceland who are leading in this area of LGBTQ+ rights for a way forward.",
        "background": "The Supreme Court has ruled that the legal definition of a woman is only a biological woman. This ignores intersex people and puts transgender women in the U.K at risk of both discrimination and violence. Also completely negating the point of the Gender recognition certificate.",
