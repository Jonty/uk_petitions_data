        "action": "Seek regulation with other governments of cross-Channel ferry & rail services",
        "additional_details": "We believe that cross-Channel ferry and rail fares have been excessively high for many years, including before Brexit, and these remain largely unregulated. These routes function as the UK\u2019s primary land connection to mainland Europe, yet we feel they are treated as premium commercial services rather than essential transport infrastructure. In the context of the cost-of-living crisis, we think this places an unreasonable burden on UK residents and restricts mobility for work, family and essential travel.",
        "background": "Seek to work with other governments to introduce price caps, regulatory oversight and public service obligations on cross-Channel ferry and rail passenger services, similar to those applied to domestic transport, to help ensure fares are fair, proportionate and affordable for UK residents.",
