Many of us made life\u2011changing decisions in good faith, and during the COVID\u201119 crisis we gave our all \u2014 some even their lives \u2014 to support this country. To change the rules after the fact would undermine trust and fairness, values that define the UK. We ask that policies honour both sacrifice and integrity by being applied prospectively only.",
