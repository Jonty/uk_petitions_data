B) Prevent a lot of harm that can be done by AI and Deepfakes. \r\n\r\nI think that if we continue with the current state of AI we will be in a world of not knowing what is real and what isn't. I also think that we will start seeing people be seriously harmed by the production of these videos on sites such as GROK which don't prevent a large amount of inappropriate content.",

I am not bored by seeing all the AI crap but I am concerned about the issues that will outcome, scams have already used it. Next it will be used to blackmail and then to force people off the internet.",
