        "action": "Prevent the collective action of GP\u2019s against shared care for ADHD",
        "additional_details": "Stop this collective action and instead, establish new pathways from private ADHD diagnosis companies back to the NHS. The medication without NHS support is too costly for the average person but the demonised medications are akin to a wheelchair giving a person independence with how it enables them to function in society.\r\n\r\nPrivate diagnosis\u2019s should be recognised for alleviating pressure off of the NHS wait times and for caring to help people with a very real disability change their lives.",
        "background": "This collective action being pushed by GP\u2019s against those with ADHD is a symptom of the stress the NHS faces but also a symptom of the generalised stigma that struggling people face when trying to seek shared care. We can and should be better than this lack of care in an age enlightened by science.",
