Dimming the sun through chemical spraying affects every community, ecosystem, and generation. Yet the public has not been informed, consulted, or given any say.

        "background": "I urge the Government and Parliament to enact legislation prohibiting all chemical solar dimming experiments. They must impose an immediate moratorium on proposed geoengineering trials, ensuring no chemicals are released until comprehensive, independent environmental+health assessments are completed",
