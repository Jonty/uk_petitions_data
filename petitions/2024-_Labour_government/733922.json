        "additional_details": "Lowering the voting age to 16 undermines the seriousness of the democratic process. At 16, most young people are still in education, financially dependent, and lack the life experience needed to make informed political decisions. Voting should remain a right and responsibility of adulthood. We urge the Government to uphold the integrity of our elections by restoring the minimum voting age to 18.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to reverse the decision to give 16 and 17 year olds the vote. Voting is a vital civic duty that should be reserved for legal adults. At 18, citizens are more likely to have the maturity, independence and life experience to vote responsibly.",
