        "additional_details": "Drainage limitations and an overstretched sewerage system mean these issues are worsening rather than improving. Local infrastructure is under strain. There has been repeated flooding in specific areas, and residents have seen first-hand how the sewerage network struggles during heavy rainfall. Available data indicates the treatment works is near capacity, with frequent sewage spills affecting the watercourse and, at times, homes and gardens. Drainage and sewage infrastructure must come first.",
        "background": "A further 550 homes should not be built until infrastructure constraints are properly resolved. Broughton Astley is a low-lying village with a watercourse running directly through it, where natural gradients already cause surface water to pool and rise.",
