        "additional_details": "All we hear is of accidents happening, children being injured or hurt etc. however a lot of accidents of children rear facing have walked away without a scratch. It\u2019s sad people only do what safest, if it\u2019s legal. Parents aren\u2019t always educated on the safest way to have their child in a car. It doesn\u2019t help when pages like local police are posting about care safety when it isn\u2019t the safest measures.",
        "background": "A child can rear face right up until the age of 7/8 or specific height and weight measurements. Rear facing has proved to be a lot more safer than forward facing however because people see ff is legal they do it. We need the legal age to be changed for people to listen!",
