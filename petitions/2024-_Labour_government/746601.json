When a person dies, their spouse should not be left to struggle financially. They should be supported by the pension their partner worked hard to earn.\r\nWe call on Parliament to act swiftly and decisively to ensure that surviving spouses receive 100% of their loved one\u2019s pension. Let us build a system that honours the contributions of the deceased and protects the living.\r\n",
