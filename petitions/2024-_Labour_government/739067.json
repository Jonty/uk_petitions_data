        "additional_details": "Gluten-free food is not a lifestyle choice for many, it's a medical necessity. Rising costs mean that only those who can afford it have consistent access. This creates an unfair barrier to health for thousands living with coeliac disease and gluten intolerance. We believe no one should be priced out of their own wellbeing.",
        "background": "We call on the UK government to ensure fair access to affordable, subsidised gluten\u2011free groceries for individuals with coeliac disease and gluten intolerance. Building on the structured support already in place in Scotland, NI and the new prepaid subsidy scheme launching this autumn in Wales.",
