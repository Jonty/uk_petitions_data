        "additional_details": "Simply, the blazers should be removed. I\u2019ll explain why in a few reasons. Blazers are expensive, with families on average spending \u00a3100+ per child on uniforms, with blazers up to \u00a340+.  A solution for the schools should be to print the logo onto jumpers instead. Another reason is that the blazer affects children, with it being uncomfortable and children refusing to wear it. We shouldn\u2019t be annoyed at going to school for such a little item of clothing that doesn\u2019t affect us. Please consider.",
        "background": "Students and families don\u2019t like to blazer. it\u2019s centuries old and isn\u2019t professional. it\u2019s a problem that sparks concern in british secondary\u2019s that has a simple solution to it. why should such a thing cause so many problems in schools.Even when it doesn\u2019t benefit us in any meaningful way.",
