        "additional_details": "By including this option, politicians and parties would no longer be able to ignore the discontent among voters who feel there is no viable candidate worthy of their vote. It would offer clearer insight into voter sentiment, ultimately guiding future candidates to better represent their constituents, and boost the integrity of our democratic process. Most importantly, it would hold politicians and parties to greater accountability and encourage them to work harder to earn our trust and support.",
        "background": "I would like the Government/Parliament to include a 'None of the Above' box on ballot papers, so that a) the electorate has a formal way to express dissatisfaction with the available candidates and b) the voice of disillusioned voters is both registered and reported.",
