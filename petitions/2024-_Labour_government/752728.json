        "additional_details": "Taxpayers fund welfare, but many do not see a pathway encouraging recipients towards independence. Without time limits, those receiving benefits may lack motivation to transition into work.  Time-bound support with job-search requirements could create mutual benefit: recipients could gain skills and self-sufficiency, while working families may see contributions create genuine pathways out of poverty rather than permanent dependency. We believe the system should lift people up, not trap them.",
