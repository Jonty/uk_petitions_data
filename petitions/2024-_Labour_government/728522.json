        "additional_details": "The 10-year ILR route unfairly impacts PSW holders already living in the UK who will switch to Skilled Worker Visas. Many contribute to essential sectors like healthcare, education, and tech but now face extended settlement timelines. The government must restore the 5-year ILR pathway to retain skilled professionals, support economic growth, and ensure fairness for those who have invested in the UK\u2019s future.we feel betrayed at this point.",
        "background": "The government should allow existing PSW holders transitioning to Skilled Worker Visas to qualify for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) after 5 years, instead of forcing them onto the 10-year route. This will ensure fairness, retain skilled workers, and support economic growth.",
