        "additional_details": "We think this new law should remain in place as we believe pornography can contribute to toxic masculinity, misogyny, objectifying women, addiction and may be a factor in higher rates of sexual violence and assault. Boys may watch porn at a very young age and learn through it which can include false realities, harm and degrade women. We feel families should praise this new law and it should not be appealed due to the people who are addicted to it. We think porn should not be easily accessible.",
