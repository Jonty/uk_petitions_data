        "additional_details": "When babies are abandoned in unsafe places, they're at risk of hypothermia, injury, and even death. Safe haven laws and baby boxes could provide a safe space for parents to surrender their baby, where parents know their babies will get medical attention and care. Many of these parents are facing unplanned pregnancies, lack of resources, or emotional distress. This could be a safe and anonymous surrender option where parents would know their baby is safe. This law could show that the UK values life and cares for its most vulnerable.",
        "background": "Pass UK Safe Haven laws and fund the provision of baby boxes to protect abandoned babies. Every week, a baby is left vulnerable. We urge the Government to introduce these compassionate laws to provide a safe space for desperate parents to surrender their baby, ensuring care and support.",
