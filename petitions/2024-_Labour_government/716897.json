In my opinion, it's as important as learning to cook in food tech, or working with wood in DT.\r\n \r\nI think it would be amazing to be able to see these animals, but it's not a case of, \"oooh let's get some puppies in school to cuddle and pet!\", but it's, \" yes, let's handle some dogs and learn how to do it correctly!\".\r\n \r\nIt could be something as simple as once every term going down to a donkey sanctuary, or visiting a dog kennel even! Just something easy to prepare for not only college, but a future job.",
