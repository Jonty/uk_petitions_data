        "action": "Petition for Direct Democracy and Political Accountability in the UK",
        "additional_details": "We demand these reforms to restore fairness, transparency, and accountability in the UK\u2019s political system. Direct democracy ensures citizens have a real voice, challenging policies that don\u2019t serve the public. Holding politicians legally accountable for manifesto lies rebuilds trust. Transparent tax reforms protect middle class families and farmers from unjust burdens. Reversing unfair social policies safeguards the vulnerable. Humane, clear immigration reforms and limits on foreign military actions prioritise domestic needs, ensuring government serves its people first.",
        "background": "Please Implement direct democracy for public led policy changes. Hold politicians accountable for broken promises. Ensure fair, transparent tax reforms. Protect social benefits for the vulnerable. Reform immigration policies. Prioritise domestic issues over foreign conflicts. Act for the people!",
