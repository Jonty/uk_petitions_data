After all it is the Government that mismanaged the nation's finances, not the general public. Politicians can contribute by paying their own heating bills.",
        "background": "Recently the Government stopped the Winter Fuel Allowance for pensioners who receive the full state pension or are not in receipt of pension credit. MPs earn significantly more annually. They can afford their own heating bills. Please make sure they pay their own bills.",
