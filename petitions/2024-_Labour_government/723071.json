        "additional_details": "Currently, the system supports children with disabilities and their families during childhood, recognising that parents or guardians are the primary decision-makers for their children\u2019s welfare, healthcare, and legal matters. However, when these children reach adulthood, we feel the system often assumes that they now have the ability to make their own decisions. In reality, we think many of these young adults continue to lack the capacity to make informed choices, and their parents are still the most qualified and trusted individuals to make decisions in their best interest.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to automatically grant Deputyship to parents of children with disabilities once they reach adulthood. We think this change would eliminate complex legal processes, ensuring continued care, while reducing financial and emotional burdens on families.",
