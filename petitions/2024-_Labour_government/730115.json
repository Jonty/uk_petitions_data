        "additional_details": "3,256 new cases of cervical cancer every year in the UK. 850 people dying annually. Incidence rates have remained unchanged in the last decade. How will REDUCING the frequency of testing improve this? Cervical cancer is \u201cthe silent killer\u201d: it frequently has no symptoms & regular testing is the only chance of identifying it. 49% of women in England do not survive cervical cancer for 10+ years. The NHS should be doing more to reduce this percentage, not implementing changes which will augment it.",
        "background": "The NHS has announced that cervical screening is now moving from a 3 to a 5 year interval. We want this change reversed and we want cervical screening to include HPV testing AND cytology screening in ALL patients, not just those who test positive for HPV.",
