        "action": "To provide better support in educational settings for send children.",
        "additional_details": "To address the SEND schooling crisis, Parliament should focus on ensuring sufficient funding for local authorities, improving mainstream school provisions to be more inclusive, and strengthening accountability for the delivery of SEND support, while also prioritizing early identification and intervention. The current wait times for specialist provisions are lengthy and a lot of children are left behind in mainstream settings because there isn't anywhere for them to go. Children are also being denied EHCP'S and assessment's as the system is at breaking point. \r\n\r\nAs of May 2024, 4,407 children across England were waiting for school places in specialist provision, highlighting a growing crisis.",
        "background": "The current system that is in place for send children is at crisis point, meaning a wide number of children are being let down by a system that is meant to be put in place to help our children flourish and reach there full potential. I am putting this petition in place as things need to change.",
