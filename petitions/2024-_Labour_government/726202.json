        "action": "Make it law for schools to accept GP evidence for mental health exam support",
        "additional_details": "Students with serious mental health needs are often denied exam support because schools demand expensive or delayed specialist assessments, even when a GP has confirmed their needs. This discriminates against students without access to private care. Accepting GP evidence would ensure fairer, faster support based on a student\u2019s functional needs, not their financial situation or ability to access specialists. No student should be left behind because of slow processes or financial barriers.",
        "background": "Require schools and colleges to accept GP evidence as sufficient for mental health-related exam access support, including extra time, rest breaks, smaller venues, and deadline extensions. Update JCQ and DfE rules to ensure support is based on need without requiring specialist assessments.",
