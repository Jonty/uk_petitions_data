        "additional_details": "Drivers must pay for lessons, theory and practical tests, and annual MOTs to ensure safety. They must wear seatbelts and avoid mobile phone use. Yet cyclists aren\u2019t legally required to complete road safety training or follow the same strict regulations. They don\u2019t need seatbelts or reflective clothing. Why are these rules enforced for drivers but not for cyclists?",
        "background": "I want the government to reinforce rules and regulations for cyclists using the roads. Drivers, in any vehicle, have endless rules and regulations including the maintenance of their cars to ensure they are being safe for themselves and those around them. I believe cyclists should be held accountable",
