        "additional_details": "We call on policymakers to revise parental leave legislation immediately! Extend paid maternity leave and offer equitable paternity leave to ensure all families can thrive. Prioritize legislative efforts that promote equal opportunities and healthy family dynamics, encouraging an inclusive policy that reflects the fundamental needs of a modern society.\r\n\r\nJoin us in advocating for a future where no family has to choose between economic security and spending vital early moments with their newborns.",
        "background": "Parental leave is vital for the well-being of newborn babies and for the mental and physical health of both parents. But the inability to financially support an extended leave period forces many parents, like us, to return to work prematurely.",
