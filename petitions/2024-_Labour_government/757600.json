These activities misrepresent historical facts and perpetuate British colonial frameworks that have no contemporary legal or political legitimacy, risking division within British communities. We ask the Government to clarify historical facts, issue formal guidance or policy, and support community-led engagement and lawful oversight.",

This will ensure colonial history is not misused to justify political claims or romanticise \u201cBritish Somaliland",
