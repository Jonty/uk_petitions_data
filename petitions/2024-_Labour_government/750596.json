Instructors can ensure candidates are test-ready, which may reduce dangerous \u201cchancers\u201d who could gamble unprepared. We think removing this safeguard undermines road safety, penalises professionalism, and puts lives at risk. Continue instructor access rather than potentially risk road safety!",

We think these professionals uphold standards, ensure readiness & reduce road risk. We think blocking them can force learners to chance tests unprepared, which could risk more road traffic accidents.",
