        "additional_details": "We think this could challenge the patriarchal norm that women must give up their original surname in marriage and protect equality by law.\r\n\r\nChanging your surname after marriage is seen as tradition, but we think it roots from patriarchal norms and imply erasure. I\u2019ve seen women pressured to change their names just to appear \u201cnormal\u201d after marriage, or because their company assumed a name change (which shouldn\u2019t be allowed). We do not think a family\u2019s unity is defined by sharing a surname; even if it is, a man is never expected to change his name. By banning surname changes for women, we think we can protect identity and challenge outdated norms.",
