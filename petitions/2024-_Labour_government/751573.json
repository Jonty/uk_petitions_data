        "additional_details": "Many people feel recent Home Office proposals under Shabana Mahmood are unfair, especially for those already in the UK who now face 10\u201315 year settlement routes. Changing rules for people who have already invested years of their lives here is unjust and damaging. Leadership change is needed to restore fairness, consistency, and public trust in the system",
        "background": "We want the Government to remove Shabana Mahmood from the role of Home Secretary and appoint someone who makes fair decisions, listens to public concerns, and ensures policies do not unfairly extend settlement routes for people already in the UK.",
