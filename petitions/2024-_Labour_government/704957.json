        "additional_details": "The deadline for the sale of petrol and diesel cars, along with the zero emission vehicle mandate restricting the proportion of new petrol or diesel cars, should be abolished. We believe the deadline removes freedom of choice from customers and is completely against the principles of a free market. We think that abolishing the deadline on new petrol and diesel cars and the zero emission vehicle mandate, which links the number of ICE cars sold to the number of EV cars, would restore the principle of a free market to the car manufacturing and sales sector. We think it would also restore the incentive for car manufacturers to develop 'low emission' ICE technology.",
