        "additional_details": "Qualified international healthcare workers in UK nursing homes face exploitation. \r\nUnder Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) rules, international nurses can register as qualified nurses if their managers provide a Supporting Information from Employer (SIFE) document.\r\nMany employers refuse to issue this certificate due to the low wages paid to qualified and experienced nurses working as healthcare assistants.\r\nThis practice blocks career advancement and perpetuates modern slavery-like conditions.",
        "background": "We call on Parliament to pass a law allowing international nurses working in UK nursing homes for three or more years as healthcare assistants, who have completed CBT and OSCE qualifications, to be eligible for NMC registration without requiring the SIFE document.",
