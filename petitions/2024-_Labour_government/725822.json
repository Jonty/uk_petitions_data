        "additional_details": "Since the SC ruling on what is a woman, there has been a lot of talk in Parliament regarding a ban on trans people using safe spaces of their acquired gender. These discussions are often ended by saying trans people have the same rights as everyone else, but there's no talk about anything being done to make sure those rights are upheld. As a trans woman I am concerned that I, and my brothers and sisters, are being placed in unnecessary danger as part of a political battle and seek reassurance.",
