        "additional_details": "The government should reduce the Motability Drive Smart age to 25 and under because accident risk drops sharply after 25. It\u2019s unfair to monitor safer, more experienced drivers up to 30. This change would respect independence, save money, and align with insurance standards. It ensures black box monitoring targets those who truly need it, making the system fairer, smarter, and more efficient for everyone.",
        "background": "I want the government to reduce the Motability Drive Smart age to 25 and under because Motability already allows access to certain cars at 25. It\u2019s inconsistent to set 30 for Drive Smart. Aligning policies ensures fairness and equal access for all drivers.",
