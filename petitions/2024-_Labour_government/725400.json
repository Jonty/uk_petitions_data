Many people, especially the elderly or vulnerable, are misled into thinking they\u2019re being contacted by the courts. This can cause serious stress and health harm. The law must stop it.\r\n\r\nMy partner suffers from a medical condition and was severely affected after receiving a misleading letter from such a company.",

This causes confusion and distress, especially for vulnerable people. We ask Parliament to ban such words in company names and stop misuse of legal-sounding branding.",
