We ask government to invoke Article 58 of the (ECHR) as UK common law and statute provides ample protection of civil liberties yet (ECtHR) judgements impact our politics and overrule our democratic governance.\r\n\r\nWe ask government to break links between British courts and the (ECtHR). Repeal the Human Rights Act and replace it with a \"British Bill of Rights\". Disapply roadblock treaties against deporting illegal immigrants and make our Supreme Court the final arbiter of UK matters.",

We ask government to detain/return illegal immigrants and ban those who do this from seeking future asylum in the UK.",
