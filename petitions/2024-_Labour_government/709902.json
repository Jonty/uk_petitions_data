        "additional_details": "We think this legislation should be included in the future English Devolution Bill. \r\n \r\nAlthough progress has been made in some areas, especially since the Localism Act 2011 and also with the rise of regional mayors, we believe UK governance remains overly centralised. Localisation of further powers and assets to towns and rural areas across England could mean that areas that know their needs best can have full control of these, tailoring services accordingly. A double devolution or power - regional and very local - meaning more resilient communities.",
