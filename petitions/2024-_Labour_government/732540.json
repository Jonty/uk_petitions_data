        "action": "Legal labelling of stunned and non-stunned meat throughout the food chain",
        "additional_details": "The UK government should implement mandatory \"method of slaughter\" labeling for all meat products: \"Stunned\" or \"Non-Stunned.\" \r\n\r\nThis promotes consumer choice, especially for religious and ethical reasons, and enhances transparency. \r\n\r\nIt requires broad consultation with stakeholders, practical industry support, and public education campaigns to succeed. Regular review is crucial.\r\n\r\nNo one should be forced to consume food which doesn't match their ethical choices and has the right to choose.",
        "background": "It is imperative that labeling of non-stunned and stunned meat be clearly and mandatory labelling throughout the food chain.  This includes, shops, supermarkets, suppliers, fast food and restaurants\r\n\r\nThis will include halal and Kosher labels clearly marked on every product available to consumers",
