        "additional_details": "I have worked in numerous places that refer to themselves as inclusive and diverse but aren\u2019t appropriately equipped for neurodiverse people. Many employees struggle and we think there is not enough support for them.\r\n\r\n1 in 7 people in the UK are estimated to be neurodivergent and we feel there isn\u2019t enough awareness on neurodiversity within the workplace. We think this should be mandatory to stop discrimination.",
        "background": "We think that every workplace should be required to have a number of people trained up on neurodiversity, reasonable adjustments, communication, sensory safe spaces and generally just being a voice for someone who may not be able to provide their perspective.",
