        "additional_details": "Despite there being a pledge in Labour's election manifesto to ban snares, no such bill, so far, has yet been created to do that and many types of snares are currently still legal to use in England. Scotland, Wales and Guernsey have ALL now completely banned snares, proving that using snares is uneccessary. It is now time for England to follow.",
        "background": "Cats, dogs, badgers and many other animals, even humans, have been caught in snares as they are as indiscriminate as they are cruel and uneccessary. We are asking the government to ban the use of ALL snares in England completely.",
