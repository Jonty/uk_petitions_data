        "action": "Draw a distinction between asylum seekers and legal immigrants!",
        "additional_details": "Politicians are doing what they believe the country wants, but this false identification is causing legal immigration to be more difficult simply because the average Brit doesn\u2019t distinguish between the word immigrant and the word asylum seeker after years of false news representation. The governments test groups therefore are inaccurate and we risk allowing legislation to pass that doesn\u2019t actually represent what the people of the UK really feel and want.",
        "background": "People use \u2018Immigrant\u2019 as a blanket term, referring to legal and non legal migrants, so when people speak out against immigration, meaning illegal, the government wrongly makes all immigration channels more difficult. We want parliament to publicly re clarify and make legal channels easier.",
