        "additional_details": "The Online Safety Act has been poorly thought through and implemented. In order to change this I would like to see things introduced such as a privacy-respecting Government issued ID (verifying you are 18+ without any private information). Alongside implementing this ID system for smaller business/websites paid for by the Government allowing companies to more easily remain accessible and suitably private in the UK.\r\n\r\nIf this act is to be around for the foreseeable future it needs an overhaul.",
        "background": "I think it's unlikely for the UK Government to repeal the Online Safety Act. However it should be their responsibility to help cover things like non-affordable age verification and/or offer help with reducing collected user information that should be private.",
