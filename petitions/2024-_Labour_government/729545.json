Without legal protections, councils and landlords can deny housing to people who have fought hard to rebuild their lives, forcing them into homelessness or unstable living conditions. This is a failure of the system.  \r\n\r\nRecovery should be recognised as a medical condition, and housing providers should be required by law to support individuals in recovery, rather than judging them based on past struggles. By ensuring funding, fair policies, and accountability, Parliament can break the cycle that keeps vulnerable people locked out of opportunities for a stable future. This is about justice, dignity, and real change.",

They should enforce fair housing policies, fund recovery programs, and establish legal accountability for violations.",
