This will allow trans women and cis women to have protections under UK law, under the status quo, as enforced by the recent ruling, women will have to biological prove they are women to access safe spaces, as well as trans individuals being excluded from that. This puts an incredibly marginalised group at risk.",

The government should act and legislate via secondary legislation to clarify that trans women are included under the term women in the 2010 equalities act.",
