        "additional_details": "Legal immigrants entered the UK under the explicit understanding that the 5-year route to settlement was the established pathway for permanent residence. \r\nLegal immigrants should not face unequal treatment in access to settlement simply because they entered under different visa categories.\r\nThis is a moral contract that the Government must honour. Extending the ILR qualifying period to 10 years is a retrospective change that breaks this promise",
        "background": "We ask the Government to immediately confirm that the retention of the 5-year continuous residence requirement for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) for all legal immigrants is a safeguard for the fundamental human right to a stable private and family life, as protected by Article 8 of the ECHR.",
