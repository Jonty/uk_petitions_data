        "additional_details": "Many studies have shown that we aren't doing enough to help our planet. I think we are all too consumed with wars and finances that we haven't paid attention to our environmental goals for 2030, or the years beyond. We can't just 'deal with it later', we must act now, and the Government is a huge factor on whether we save our planet or not. Time is money. And we are running out of time. Please do not say that you are already doing your part, many countries clearly aren't doing enough. Act now. Act more.",

More money & action must be put in environmental and conservational areas, and funding for fossil fuel production and deforestation cut",
