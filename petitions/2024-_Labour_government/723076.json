        "action": "Require local authorities to freeze Council Tax at current levels",
        "additional_details": "I want the Government to freeze Council Tax at current levels as I think it will become uneconomical if each year it is increased 5% when wages are not being increased 5% each year. The country\u2019s energy bills continue to rise, mortgage rates are rising as well as water rates. Eventually I think that no one will be able to afford to live as their wages will be spent on bills as the costs spiral out of control. I want the government to see this is unsustainable for its working class constituents.",
        "background": "Each year Councils are allowed to put up Council Tax up to 5% and in some districts 7%. However with the cost of living crisis and all other bills increasing I find it incredibly unjust that the Council Tax increases yet the services provided may be cut and lacking.",
