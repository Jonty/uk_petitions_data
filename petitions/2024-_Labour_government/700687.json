By denying them the right to vote, we believe the government is systematically silencing the voices of individuals who could be personally affected by their policies.\r\n \r\n16 and 17 year olds can vote in Welsh and Scottish elections. We believe that all 16 and 17 year olds should be able to vote in general elections.",

Despite the profound impact that government policies could have on our lives, we feel the voices of our generation remain unheard. According to the Office for National Statistics, there are 1.6 million people aged 16-17.",
