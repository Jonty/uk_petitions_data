        "action": "Mandate monthly dental visits in primary schools to teach diet and oral health.",
        "additional_details": "Tooth brushing alone is not enough to prevent dental decay. Schools may promote it, but without understanding diet\u2019s role and proper technique, it is ineffective. Teachers are not trained in oral health or diet\u2019s impact on teeth, so they should not be responsible, as even many adults brush incorrectly. Regular visits from dental professionals ensure expert-led education. This will help combat rising childhood tooth decay, improving public health and reducing NHS costs.",
        "background": "Make it mandatory for dental professionals to visit primary schools on a monthly basis to educate children on diet & oral health. Schools should be responsible for reaching out to local dental practices to arrange visits, ensuring that all children receive expert guidance on this matter.",
