        "additional_details": "I want the government to make cyber awareness compulsory because it alone can ensure all schools teach this important subject consistently and effectively. With youth cybercrime rising\u2014like the recent Co-op attack involving 16 to 19-year-olds\u2014early education on digital responsibility and legal consequences is essential to protect young people and society. Government involvement will provide resources, standards, and nationwide reach to reduce cybercrime and prepare students for a safer digital future",
        "background": "Young people must learn to stay safe online and understand that hacking, scamming, and other cybercrimes have serious consequences. I urge the government to make cyber awareness and digital responsibility mandatory in schools from Year 7 to help reduce youth cybercrime.",
