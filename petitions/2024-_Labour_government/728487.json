        "additional_details": "Changing the rules midway like extending the qualification period for ILR and reducing the PSW duration to 18 months effects a lot of careers and creates chaos for many including Children. Everyone who came here believed in the existing rules and made decisions (investing time,money) accordingly. It is understandable if the rules are for new immigrants, but changing them for existing ones who have already planned their lives around the current rules will effect their lives in many unwanted ways.",
        "background": "There is a similar petition for existing skilled workers which does not include all existing immigrants and students. This petition is more inclusive and hence we request that this be considered as well.please do not change the qualification period, immigration rules for existing immigrants midway!",
