        "action": "Introduce regulations and stricter controls on the sale of injectable products",
        "additional_details": "Currently, non-medics can legally buy injectable fillers online and treat patients without formal training. This lack of regulation puts the public at risk of severe complications such as skin necrosis, disfigurement and even blindness. Giving medical pharmacies like ACRE greater powers will help ensure all injectable products are supplied only to licensed professionals, with pharmacies acting as gatekeepers to uphold safety standards and prevent unregulated access.",
        "background": "ACRE wants the government to protect patients and ensure aesthetic treatments meet the same safety standards as other medical procedures, with mandatory training, licensing and stricter control over who can administer and supply injectable products.",
