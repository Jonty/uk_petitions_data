        "additional_details": "The top height for a male American Bully of XL Height is 23inch. Anything over that height is not recognised as an American Bully by the ABKC or ADBA. This is allowing dogs who aren\u2019t an XL to be mislabelled as such and misconstrue data and statistics. Surely government want police to be able to enforce legislation displaying competence and accuracy, but by allowing dogs who are mislabelled/mistyped only defends the flaws in the legislation. This causes unnecessary and damaging discrimination.",
        "background": "The standard used for the PBT is and remains as per the ADBA standard as published in the 70\u2019s. The standard for the XL Bully has not used the same format- this has allowed dogs who are  not XL Bulkies to be mislabelled. Amend the definition in line with the ABKC as you do with the APBT",
