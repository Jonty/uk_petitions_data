        "additional_details": "Taxing gifts received by MPs would prevent undue influence from lobbyists or corporations seeking favors. It creates a clear record of benefits, reducing the potential for corruption or its appearance. This system would also deter inappropriate gifts, ensuring MPs focus on the public good and boosting confidence in the political process.",
        "background": "MPs should be taxed on gifts to ensure transparency and public trust. Accepting gifts, especially from vested interests, can lead to conflicts of interest or favoritism. Taxing them holds MPs to the same standards as other public figures, helping protect the integrity of the political system.",
