        "additional_details": "I want the Government to do this because I feel that trains and railways are an essential part of modern-day society, however them and their history are very rarely taught about at school. I also think that our country wouldn\u2019t be the country it was today without trains and railways, as they are such an amazing invention. Therefore, I strongly believe that the history of trains and railways should be part of the National Curriculum for History at Primary School and Secondary School.",
