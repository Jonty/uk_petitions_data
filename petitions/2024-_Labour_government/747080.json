        "additional_details": "As current students of the IB Diploma, we want to preserve it in UK state schools and understand that the LPU funding makes this possible for them. The IBDP requires us to study six academic disciplines, including Mathematics and at least one Science course. It ensures that we make competitive applications to world-leading universities. This programme allows us to access post-18 destinations which may not be possible on the traditional A Level route.",
        "background": "We hope to reverse the proposed cuts to large programme funding (LPF). The cuts limit UK state schools being able to offer the IB Diploma. Current students of the IBDP in a UK state school have organised this petition to ensure that the Government recognise the threat to the IBDP if the LPF is cut.",
