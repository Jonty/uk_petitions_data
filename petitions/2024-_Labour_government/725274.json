        "action": "Amend the Equality Act to Recognise Trans Women as Women in Law",
        "additional_details": "The Supreme Court's ruling on the 16th of April overturns 20 years of legal recognition for trans women with a GRC. By redefining \u201cwoman\u201d as biological sex, the Supreme Court opens the door to widespread exclusion from jobs, healthcare, and refuges. Trans people already face high levels of violence and discrimination. This decision will worsen that. The law must be reformed to protect trans rights, restore clarity and align UK law with the Yogyakarta Principles.",
        "background": "The Supreme Court\u2019s 2025 ruling redefines \u201cwoman\u201d as biological sex, letting employers, hospitals and refuges exclude trans women. Parliament must amend the Equality Act so all women, trans and cis, share equal protection. Updating the Act affirms Britain\u2019s human\u2011rights obligations.",
