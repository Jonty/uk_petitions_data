        "action": "Legalize cannabis. Create tax revenue, regulate sales and reduce crime. Its time",
        "additional_details": "We must legalize and regulate cannabis. The current black market funds criminal activity and poses health risks from unregulated products. Legalization would generate over \u00a31 billion in tax revenue, create jobs, and save police resources. It would allow for public health campaigns and quality control, protecting our communities. It's time for a pragmatic, evidence-based approach that prioritizes public health and social justice. This is a crucial step towards a safer and more prosperous society.",
        "background": "Parliament must pass a new law to reclassify cannabis, creating a regulated market. This legislation should permit personal home cultivation, with clear limits (e.g., 3-6 plants), and establish a licensing and taxation system, while funding public health campaigns.",
