Hair loss can significantly impact mental health, as it can affect self-esteem, body image, and social interactions.\r\n\r\nHair loss can cause:\r\n\r\nAnxiety and Social Withdrawal\r\nLowered Self-Esteem and Confidence\r\nDepression\r\nBody Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD)\r\nImpact on Relationships\r\nStress and Worsening of Hair Loss\r\n\r\nWe believe that every person who loses their hair for a medical reason should receive funding to purchase a fibre, human or hair piece on the NHS.",
        "background": "We want the Government to provide people who have hair loss due to a medical condition with full funding to purchase a wig or hair piece. This could include people who have hair loss due to chemotherapy, medication, alopecia or an autoimmune disease.",
