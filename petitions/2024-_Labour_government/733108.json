In the real working world if you have a job interview and lie about what you are going to do, your contract is terminated. In government you choose not to do what was promised and get 4 years to put the country further into debt and the PM get a nice pension which most working class never would and pay for it.",

Then once they are in power, there intention change and is always another's fault why it didn't happen. It needs to become an criminal offence not to follow through with what was promised to gain position of prime minster.",
