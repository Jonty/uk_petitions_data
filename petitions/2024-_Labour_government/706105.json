We think the government need to act on this by building or renovating housing, so it is accessible for all, from families to young people leaving home. We think everyone should be able to afford to rent a decent home.\r\n \r\nWe believe that the Right to Buy Scheme, on the surface appeared to be a positive idea, however the money from the sale of council housing was never used to invest in enough new housing, thus potentially leading to increased homelessness.\r\n",
