        "additional_details": "We feel that the free childcare policy has been a total disaster and that underfunding has meant that settings have had to invent ways of remaining viable, which seem bizarre to parents. Many settings have closed due to the underfunding and we think it\u2019s time to change the approach. We want the Government to put the money into Tax-Free Childcare accounts and let parents choose.",
        "background": "We believe the 30 hours free childcare has failed, and that it doesn\u2019t take account of variety of needs or types of settings available. There are reports that settings are starting to pull out. We want the Government to offer a subsidy paid directly into Tax-Free Childcare account for parents.",
