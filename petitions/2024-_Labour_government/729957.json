        "additional_details": "Obtaining medication is extremely stressful if you can't afford private care and the system is confusing as people assume as its an NHS appointment NHS prescriptions will be available. The NHS already has procedures in place for other medical issues where the GP takes over prescriptions and the patient goes for yearly check ups with the professional.  It should work the same for ADHD",
        "background": "The NHS right to choose was partly introduced to releive pressure on parts of the NHS. However if you wish to access NHS prescriptions you must also be assessed by your local council NHS provider so you take up 2 appointments costing the NHS twice.",
