        "additional_details": "As times become increasingly difficult during the economic crisis, it's more important than ever to protect the purchasing power of cash for access to essential items. The poorest in our communities are increasingly running their bank accounts empty and into overdrafts which are ill afforded. Cash can be lent to vulnerable or elderly family members as a lifeline in an emergency. Bus companies are trialling cash-free routes, many supermarkets in London are becoming cash-free zones.",
        "background": "The government need to protect people without electronic means of making payment from being left behind. \r\n\r\nEssential goods and services such as grocery shopping, access to medication & public transport should always (where possible) allow the use of cash.",
