        "additional_details": "Many face repeated delivery failures, with parcels falsely marked as \u201cdelivered\u201d and no attempt to notify them. This causes confusion, distress, delays, and financial loss, especially for urgent items like medicine or pet supplies. Companies rarely take responsibility. We urge the Government to introduce regulation, enforce accountability, and protect consumers from ongoing postal and courier service failures.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to take action against failing delivery services, such as ParcelForce, by enforcing clear delivery standards, requiring proof of delivery, and establishing a regulatory body to investigate complaints and protect consumers from repeated service failures.",
