        "additional_details": "The food children eat at school shapes their health, habits, and relationship with food for life. Right now, too many school meals are high in sugar, low in nutrients, and lacking in fresh fruit, vegetables, and protein. These meals can affect children\u2019s concentration, energy levels, and long-term wellbeing. We're asking for more fresh, nutritious ingredients, balanced plates, a form of education through food, creating meals children enjoy whilst keeping it free for all families.",
        "background": "Across the UK, many primary school meals are packed with refined carbs, sugary desserts, and processed foods, often a big step backwards from the healthy, balanced meals children eat at home or in nursery.",
