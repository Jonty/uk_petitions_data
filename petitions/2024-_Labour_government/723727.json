        "additional_details": "We believe a tax on clothing with microplastics could have significant environmental benefits. Each year, large quantities of microfibers enter the ocean from washing clothes. With the UK leading Europe in clothing consumption per person, we believe urgent action is needed. We believe a tax can encourage sustainable production, reduce pollution, and drive innovation in eco-friendly materials, helping to protect marine ecosystems and promote responsible fashion practices.",
        "background": "To aid in combatting the issues of plastic pollution and fast fashion, we urge the Government to implement a tax on clothing containing microplastics. With this, we aim to encourage clothing companies and brands to stop partaking in fast fashion and promote sustainability.",
