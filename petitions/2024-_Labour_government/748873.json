        "additional_details": "Many people when starting airsoft purchase a two tone imitation firearm, and under the current law it is illegal to paint these black even if they are owned legally. Many players start airsoft before the age of 18 so their parents purchase them a two tone gun. Upon turning 18 even if they have a valid defence to the ban they can only purchase a new gun, not paint their existing gun. This can lead to increased cost and possibly more waste.",
        "background": "Change the law to allow for imitation firearms to be painted black, if the owner has a valid defence to the ban on owning them such as membership of a genuine airsoft skirmishing club or site.",
