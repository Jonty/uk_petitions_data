        "additional_details": "Afghans who aided the UK's mission sacrificed and faced danger. Many arrived in 2021 with ILR, but we believe lack of citizenship leaves families in limbo and hinders full participation in society. We think a clear, expedited 5 year route, requiring successful completion of the Life in the UK test, English competency, good character, and no crimes, would honour allies, promote stability, and help treat long term residents more consistently.",

Grant automatic citizenship with no need to apply if they have 5 years' continuous residence, pass the Life in the UK test, have English competency, good character and no criminal convictions.",
