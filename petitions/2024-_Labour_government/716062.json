        "additional_details": "We believe that breed bans do not work - they shift demand to new breeds. A licensing system with background checks and mandatory training could ensure responsible ownership of powerful dogs and improve public safety. We believe the focus should be on training and accountability, not banning breeds. We believe we need a solution that addresses what we see as the root cause of dog attacks - irresponsible ownership. We think a licensing system could ensure all dogs are well trained and properly controlled, reducing the strain on police resources and preventing dangerous situations before they can occur.",
        "background": "Replace breed specific bans with a licensing system for all dogs and stricter requirements for powerful breeds. Licensing could include mandatory training for owners and dogs, ensuring responsible ownership, improving public safety and preventing breed bans that we think are unfair.",
