        "additional_details": "We think the government should enact a law that prohibits the media from attending inquests involving sensitive information, particularly when families have explicitly requested no media involvement. Such legislation could safeguard the privacy and emotional well-being of families during some of their most vulnerable moments. By prioritising the wishes of the grieving, the law could ensure that the focus remains on the investigation and not on media sensationalism.",

We feel that respecting the wishes of grieving relatives is crucial, and media intrusion can exacerbate their trauma.",
