        "additional_details": "Studies estimate that 2 pupils per class have an allergy. We believe current legislation does not place demands on schools in relation to allergy which are specific enough. Our research suggests that 70% of schools in 2024 didn't have adequate allergy safeguards in place. Similar legislation to keep children with allergies safe in schools, like the School Allergy Safety Bill, is in place in parts of Canada, and there are coroners, clinicians, charities who recommend it is adopted here. We believe this law would keep children safe.",
        "background": "Legislate to require and fund schools to hold spare adrenaline auto-injectors, provide mandatory allergy training for staff, and mandate an allergy policy in every school. We think this would help keep children with allergies safe at school and prevent avoidable deaths.",
