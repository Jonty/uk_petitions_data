        "additional_details": "We want the government to set out plans for reducing fares overall, and for the introduction of more fare options, which they can implement once most passenger train operators are brought into public ownership. We think these plans should focus on peak fares during commuting times. We believe this could help boost productivity in the UK, since many businesses require workers to travel into the office and high rail fares can be a barrier for this to happen.",
        "background": "The government recently announced a rise of up to 4.6% in rail fares, explaining that people are willing to pay for a good service. We believe that fares for commuters are far too high and not sustainable for working people.",
