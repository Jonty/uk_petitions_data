        "additional_details": "These mushrooms have been used safely for thousands of years in global herbal traditions. The ban harms public access to natural wellness options and disproportionately affects small UK businesses. Emerging research supports their immune and anti-inflammatory benefits. The \u201cnovel food\u201d label ignores cultural history and scientific evidence",
        "background": "Reclassify Turkey Tail and Cordyceps as traditional foods, not \u201cnovel,\u201d and allow their sale as supplements or functional foods. Create an accessible approval pathway for small producers to meet safety standards without prohibitive costs.",
