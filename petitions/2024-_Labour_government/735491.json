        "additional_details": "As a mum of a young baby I am constantly having to struggle or park very far away at the supermarket. When I walk passed the parent and child spaces I see no parents with children, these spaces are taken advantage of massively by everyone. I see van drivers with no children, elderly people, young lads, people in sports cars. Non of them have babies or children with them at all. I see people with disabled badges parked there with all the disabled spaces available. It\u2019s time for change.",
        "background": "Create a law that states parent and child spaces are to be used by parent and child only or heavily pregnant women. Issue fines for those who break the rules to stop them from doing it.",
