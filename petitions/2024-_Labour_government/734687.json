        "additional_details": "The NHS faces a crisis with underfunding at 2.3% annual growth since 2015, below the 3.7% needed. A \u00a3211bn shortfall looms by 2028/29. Labour\u2019s 2025 plans lack funds, risking long waits. Trusts cut bank staff and 115 posts to save 7.5M, whilst newly qualified doctors, nurses and allied health professionals can\u2019t find jobs. Starmer\u2019s reforms, cutting 10,000 jobs, are seen as blaming workers, lacking union input. More funding is vital to support reforms, provide adequate staffing, and reduce waits",
        "background": "Increase NHS funding by 3.7% yearly, support realistic reforms, protect bank staff and posts, ensure jobs for newly qualified healthcare professionals (including AHPs) and address the crisis without blaming the workers",
