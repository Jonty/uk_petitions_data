        "additional_details": "We propose a robust system where:\r\nMPs undergo unannounced drug tests at least twice annually, using non-invasive methods (e.g., saliva or hair samples).\r\n\r\nAn independent parliamentary standards body, free from political influence, oversees testing and ensures fairness.\r\n\r\nA positive test triggers immediate suspension pending a confirmatory blood test.\r\n\r\nRandom drug testing is standard for police officers, pilots, and rail workers, who face strict accountability.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to implement mandatory random drug testing for all Members of Parliament (MPs) to uphold public trust and ensure sound decision-making. MPs shape laws and policies affecting millions, and their sobriety is essential for accountable governance.",
