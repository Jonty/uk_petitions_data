They are never adjusted to face down to the road and are always directly in our eyes. Its even worse when they use high beam to thank us. LED head lights are a serious issue that needs to be regulated and dampened. Much like sound issues, Lighting issues should be taken into account too to keep the roads safe.",
        "background": "I would wish restrictions and laws for LED headlights on cars to be stricter. Its becoming dangerous at night for drivers when LED Headlights pass you. Its blinding and uncontrolled. Drivers will not change the position of headlights, And specifically on larger cars.",
