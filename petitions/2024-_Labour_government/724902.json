        "additional_details": "Pornography has a very high sales income. But it should be banned due to its negative impact on society. Particularly its contribution to issues like domestic violence, toxic masculinity, and mental health problems among young people. It centres around harmful and degrading practices being normalised. A huge concern is also non-consensual acts and exploitation of young teenagers. It\u2019s poisoning society, ruining marriages and relationships. And from a religious standpoint it\u2019s not ethical.",
