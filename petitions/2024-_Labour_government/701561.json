        "additional_details": "I would like it to include protections for personal privacy related to speech and a review board to resolve complaints about infringements on free speech. I think it could help safeguard open dialogue, help prevent potential censorship, help ensure a true democracy, and help ensure accountability of digital platforms in moderating content. I think protecting lawful, non-violent speech strengthens society by allowing diverse ideas without fear of potential suppression or corporate overreach.",
