        "additional_details": "Accent can be a marker of socioeconomic status, yet we believe that UK law leaves regional speakers and many legal immigrants from non-English-speaking countries unprotected unless their accent links to nationality. Accent bias may block job opportunities, promotions and mobility, keeping Received Pronunciation (RP) dominant and limiting the UK\u2019s talent potential. Adding an accent to section 4 of the Equality Act could close this gap and protect millions.",
        "background": "We believe accent bias harms regional speakers, working-class people and immigrants in jobs and daily life. It could limit opportunities and lead to harassment, yet the Equality Act offers no protection. Parliament should amend Section 4 to add accent as a protected characteristic.",
