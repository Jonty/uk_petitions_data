        "additional_details": "Teaching all employees CPR could save thousands of lives. Each year, thousands of cardiac arrests occur outside hospitals in the UK, and the majority of people don't survive.\r\n \r\nIf more people are trained in this skill, especially in workplaces, emergency responses may improve drastically. Making CPR training universal in employment can bridge the gap before paramedics arrive, reducing fatalities and building a life-saving culture across the nation.",
        "background": "As a registered nurse, the knowledge and skills of Basic Life Support are taught throughout our training. However, I have seen how most of the general public do not have the knowledge or confidence to deal with a life threatening situation.",
