        "action": " Fund a \u00a30.10 deposit scheme for recycling single-use beverage containers",
        "additional_details": "The Government should do this because it could be very beneficial to the environment. Adding this reward scheme could ensure that it increases the recycling rates as it can be an economic incentive. This means that consumers may be motivated to return containers for recycling as they could receive a reward for it. Therefore, more people may be willing to recycle. Other countries like Lithuania have this scheme, and it was reported that recycling rates increased.",
        "background": "I want the Government to fund a \u00a30.10 deposit on single-use beverage containers (glass bottles, metal cans and plastic bottles) or any waste. Under this scheme, when containers are emptied, they can then be returned to a reverse vending machine which gives people \u00a30.10 in return.",
