        "additional_details": "The 28-day rule assumes that the hospital takes over all aspects of care. For many disabled or medically complex people, hospitals may be unable to safely meet their needs without the unpaid carer being present.\r\n \r\nMany unpaid carers remain in hospital 24/7 providing essential care, including communication support, feeding, dysphagia and safety monitoring, medication oversight, and personal care.\r\n \r\nThe Government assumes NHS hospitals take over care but for thousands of families, but this is not always true.",
        "background": "Amend the Carer\u2019s Allowance rules so unpaid carers continue to be paid their allowance after 28 days if they are still providing essential care in the hospital and require NHS trusts to confirm in writing when they cannot meet a patient\u2019s needs and when an unpaid carer must stay and provide care.",
