        "action": "Stop the Government's asylum and returns policy",
        "additional_details": "The policy proposals announced include: removing the state's obligation to support destitute asylum seekers; removing the right to family reunion; creating a mechanism by which asylum seekers contribute to funding the support they do receive, and much much more. These policies are inhumane, heartlessly cruel, and racist. Instead of attacking the world's most vulnerable, the government must take a compassionate approach to asylum and immigration, and focus on tackling the UK's economic issues.",
        "background": "On November the 17th 2025, the Government published 'Restoring Order and Control: A statement on the government's asylum and returns policy'. This policy proposal is racist in its treatment of refugees and asylum seekers. We demand that Parliament block all of the measures within the document.",
