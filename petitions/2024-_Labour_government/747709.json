        "additional_details": "Students should not have to pay \u00a39,500 a year to only be told to use AI software instead of actually working when we are already struggling with the high costs of degrees. AI Image Generation software is extremely harmful to the environment - 1L of water used for every 2 images generated - and steals from other artists work through using software to search the internet for picture references. It lowers our chances of employment in the industry, therefore has no place in university curriculum.",
        "background": "We would like the government to introduce new legislation to prevent the teaching of how to use AI in fine art courses as well as preventing universities from encouraging the use of AI.",
