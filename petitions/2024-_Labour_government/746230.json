        "action": "Reverse Funding Cuts to IB State Schools",
        "additional_details": "Removing funding from the IB means 5,000 students are losing access to programmes critical to future success. Without the LPU funding, it will be extremely difficult for state schools to get the funding to provide the IB, meaning it would only be available at private schools. The savings that the government would make from this change are minimal, but they would be affecting the lives of thousands of students and many schools who would have to remake resources and retrain teachers.",
        "background": "We call on the government to reverse the changes to the Large Program Uplift programme which cuts funding for IB state schools since from the 2026-2027 academic year the programme will only cover \"normal maths and high value A level programmes\"",
