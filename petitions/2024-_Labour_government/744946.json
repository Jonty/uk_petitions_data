Once elected, a government\u2019s manifesto is the contract between the electorate and those in power. If a government breaks the promises on which it was elected, this undermines democratic accountability.\r\n \r\nTo restore public trust in politics, the electorate should have the right to re-evaluate a government\u2019s mandate through a general election if manifesto commitments are broken.\r\n",
