        "additional_details": "There have been no measures taken to ensure students\u2019 and the public\u2019s safety along The Strand despite several accidents over the years. There is no through road in that direction, so there is little need for vehicles to drive through there anyway. Additionally, that area is surrounded by seating areas and benches where students study/socialise, as well as heavy tourism. We should not feel unsafe because of reckless drivers and government/university inaction to protect us.",
        "background": "Following several road accidents where students have been injured or killed, most recently on Tuesday 18th March 2025, we are asking for action to be taken to fully pedestrianise The Strand by King\u2019s College London Strand campus.",
