        "additional_details": "I understand people enjoy fireworks but they should be better controlled. Families who don\u2019t want to see or hear them should be able to sit inside their homes with happy and relaxed pets and children without the worry of loud fireworks upsetting/ causing everyone inside to be anxious and stressed. \r\n\r\nA properly arranged display should be the only way fireworks are available to watch. That way everyone can enjoy the night how they planned it to be.",
