        "action": "Hold a national referendum on whether the UK should rejoin the EU",
        "additional_details": "Ten years ago, the public voted to leave the EU, but voters were not fully informed of the consequences. Since then, Brexit has contributed to a \u00a320 billion loss in productivity in the UK\u2019s financial sector, with firms relocating to EU cities such as Frankfurt and Paris. It has also increased the cost of living, adding nearly \u00a36 billion to UK food bills in just two years. Despite this, little has been done to address or reverse these impacts.",
        "background": "We call on the government to begin the necessary steps toward rejoining the European Union and to hold a national referendum so the public can decide whether the UK should rejoin.",
