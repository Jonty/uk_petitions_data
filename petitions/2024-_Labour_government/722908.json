        "action": "Reform Mental Health & Benefits Assessments",
        "additional_details": "The current system causes delays, misdiagnoses, and financial hardship, leaving vulnerable individuals without timely support. 17% of adults in England experience mental health issues weekly, yet NHS wait times and inefficient assessments prevent proper care. These reforms will reduce misdiagnoses, prevent unnecessary benefit dependency, and enable faster recovery, leading to better public well-being, reduced government spending, and a stronger economy.",
        "background": "We urge Parliament to reform mental health and benefits assessments by implementing faster, fairer, and more accurate evaluations through a hybrid assessment model, enforcing 24-hour medical reviews, and expanding employment reintegration programs to support recovery and reduce dependency.",
