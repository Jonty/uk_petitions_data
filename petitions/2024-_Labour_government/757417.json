That haven't been exclusively produced in the UK from, mining the coal, iron and limestone to the machines inside the rolling mills in our steel mills.\r\n\r\nWe were once the forefront of manufacturing and innovation. We need radical policy change to restore our industry, so Britian can be industrial hub of the world again.",
