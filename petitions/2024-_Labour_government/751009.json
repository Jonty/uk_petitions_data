We urge the UK Government and NHS leaders to recognise egg freezing as essential care for endometriosis patients. Making it accessible and affordable would protect future family choices and support the wellbeing of those living with this painful and often misunderstood condition.",
        "background": "I want the Government to fund or subsidise egg freezing for people with endometriosis, ensure early fertility discussions at diagnosis, and create clear NHS pathways so patients can preserve their fertility before the condition causes lasting damage.",
