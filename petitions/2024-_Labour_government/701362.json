        "additional_details": "KEEP FARMLAND IN THE HANDS OF FAMILY FARMERS. The UK only produces part of its food needs importing the balance. Family farms are central to food security. Imposing Inheritance tax and taking farmland for 'Green', 'Nature', Re-wilding, 'Net Zero', Solar 'farm' etc alternative uses can increase our vulnerability to food insecurity. The agricultural viability and income of family farms MUST be strongly protected in law and in regulations to safeguard ALL farmland & farmers who produce food for us.",
        "background": "We believe that the UK's food security and treasured landscape could be jeopardised by the combined impacts of farm Inheritance Tax,  'Re-wilding & 'Net Zero' polices, big 'Solar 'farms' and 'Climate Change' restrictions together leading to farmland going out of production or being of reduced yield.",
