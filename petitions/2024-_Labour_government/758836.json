        "additional_details": "The proposed Peak Cluster Pipeline, like all other 'Carbon Capture' technology, is merely a greenwashing attempt to push continued burning of fossil fuels at industrial scale. CO2 pipelines pose considerable safety risks should a leak form near an urban area. A leak in Satartia, Mississippi with a population of just 40 almost cost several lives when cars stopped working due to the lack of oxygen - proving the risk to life is considerable. The rush to net zero should not mean cutting corners.",
        "background": "Block the application of the Peak Cluster Pipeline on the Wirral. The Wirral has a population of over 300,000 people and is far from rural land. CO2 pipelines bring completely different risks as compared to natural gas or other pipelines and the risk to life in the event of a leak is high.",
