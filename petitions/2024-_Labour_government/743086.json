        "additional_details": "Maternity exemption certificates are already issued to pregnant and new mothers. \r\n\r\nWith this same information or through GPs or Health Visitor services or similar, parents with babies and young children should be able to apply for a parent and child parking badge to give them more likelihood of finding a suitable space and also prevent people from parking in them for convenience and making life more difficult (and more dangerous) for parents.",
        "background": "Trying to park and get a young child or baby in and they out of the car with no extra door space is a nightmare. Even in car parks where there is ample parent and child parking available, there is nothing policing the use of these spaces, and their convenience is often abused by non-parents.",
