        "additional_details": "We want the UK to actively facilitate peace negotiations in all conflicts, which can be best achieved from a position of neutrality.\r\nThe current UK policy of supporting Ukraine and Israel has failed, as these conflicts are raging and peace is not any closer.\r\nSanctions on Russia have damaged the UK economy and the livelihoods of the British people, and have not achieved peace.\r\nWe believe a position of neutrality is in the best interests of British people and of all people involved in conflicts.",
        "background": "We ask that the UK adopts equidistance among countries involved in conflicts, without imposing sanctions and sending weapons.\r\nRegarding the two main conflicts Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Palestine, this policy means:\r\n- stop sending weapons to Ukraine and Israel;\r\n- remove sanctions on Russia.",
