        "additional_details": "We want the Government to make it illegal for tech companies to censor content about women\u2019s health and bodies. They should set clear rules separating explicit material from legitimate health information, as well as create an independent panel to review censorship complaints, with the power to penalise discriminatory censorship. Algorithms can control what is restricted or amplified. We think that the censorship of words related to women's health amounts to digital discrimination and must be stopped by law.",
        "background": "Many legitimate discussions and educational content on women\u2019s bodies and health are flagged as explicit or removed by major tech platforms. This widespread censorship limits access to vital information, harms businesses, and blocks products and services for women.",
