        "additional_details": "If this is implemented, we think the following benefits may be realised:\r\n1. A reduction in the number of solar farms\r\n2. Automatically contribute to the generation of the electricity required by the country.\r\n3. Each household might reduce their electricity consumption from the UK Grid and save money on their energy bills\r\n4. We think it would help demonstrate the government\u2019s commitment to reaching their \u2018net zero\u2019 target.",
        "background": "The government has pledged to construct 1.5 million homes by the end of this parliament. We think there should be legislation that all of these new homes must have solar panels. We think this must be incorporated into building regulations in the same way that insulation requirements already are.",
