        "additional_details": "We think that pubs are a key part of British culture and with the financial difficulties some pubs are currently experiencing this could help give them a slight increase in revenue and allow our pubs to stay open. We think those aged 14 and older should also be able to partake in this vital part of British culture ensuring its preservation for many years to come and revitalising the British pub",
        "background": "We believe that the drinking age in pubs should be lowered to 14. This should be accompanied with a meal and with parent supervision and permission. We would also like the Government to introduce legislation that allows people to purchase a small amount of alcohol in pubs from the age of 16.",
