        "additional_details": "We oppose the retroactive application of new 10- or 20-year settlement rules to those granted five-year protection. Retroactively extending a pathway undermines legal certainty and the legitimate expectations arising from existing decisions. The new conditions create psychological pressure and exclusion for legal residents. We urge the government to ensure that existing protection holders can complete their pathways without the new conditions; this is vital for public trust and legal integrity.",
        "background": "We oppose applying new 10/20 year settlement rules retrospectively to 5-year protection holders. This undermines legal certainty and creates pressure. Government must guarantee current holders complete their route.",
