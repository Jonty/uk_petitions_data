        "additional_details": "Current regulations require pets to travel in the cargo hold, exposing them to risks like extreme temperatures and reduced oxygen, which can lead to injury or death. Allowing pets in the cabin reduces these risks and benefits individuals with mental health conditions, such as PTSD, by providing emotional support. Research shows pets lower anxiety and stress. Countries like the U.S. and Canada allow pets in cabins, and the UK should modernize its policies for animal welfare and inclusivity.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to allow pets in airplane cabins to Great Britain under strict rules ensuring safety. DEFRA can set size, weight, and behavior guidelines. This change improves animal welfare, offers humane travel options, and aligns UK policies with nations allowing cabin travel for pets.",
