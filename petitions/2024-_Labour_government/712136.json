        "additional_details": "Car thefts are happening every single day in the same neighbourhood and residents are posting doorbell camera videos online of criminals trying car doors or abusing keyless entry cars. When cars are stolen, the public are paying the price through increased insurance premiums and manufacturers are not doing enough. \r\n\r\nBait cars would allow the criminal to drive away, whilst they're tracked, furthermore remote deadlocking can be used to allow an arrest of all suspects in the getaway.",
        "background": "The police force should distribute bait vehicles around problematic neighbourhoods where car crime is high. This would not be under entrapment as the vehicle is like any other vehicle, There would be no visible valuables inside the vehicle to encourage a crime.",
