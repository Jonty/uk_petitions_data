        "additional_details": "I want the government to do this because the Ulster Banner is already recognised worldwide and used for Northern Ireland in FIFA golf and the Commonwealth Games. It\u2019s the flag people see when our teams compete so making it official would match what\u2019s already happening in sport and give Northern Ireland one clear recognised symbol of identity instead of the confusion we have now.",
        "background": "I want the government to bring back the Ulster Banner as Northern Ireland\u2019s official flag. There isn\u2019t one flag everyone agrees on and the Ulster Banner has history and recognition. Major sporting bodies recognise it such as the PGA and UEFA. So why shouldn\u2019t our own government recognise it?",
