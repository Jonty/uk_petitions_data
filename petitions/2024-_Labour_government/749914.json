        "additional_details": "We think it is a helpful skill to have as it can be applied to everyday life, it also prevents the barrier that some people may have as they are unable to communicate with one another. Sign language is more beneficial than subjects such as Spanish or French as many people will have difficulties speaking and rely on sign language to communicate their thoughts. This could be an inclusive opportunity for children to learn the importance of BSL.",
