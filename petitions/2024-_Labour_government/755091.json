        "additional_details": "We believe marriage and relationship-based immigration fraud is damaging lives, harming mental health, destroying livelihoods, and exploiting UK citizens. A review is needed to identify whether there are areas of weak enforcement and loopholes allowing the system to be abused, encourage further fraud, and create more victims, while British citizens are left unprotected and treated unfairly. In our view, this undermines public trust and the integrity of immigration protections meant for genuine cases.",
