        "additional_details": "We want an inquiry to assess if families feel practice aligns with ethical values & if practice is genuinely child & family-centred, & if families feel they are treated with dignity & respect. We want further consideration given to whether services are causing harm. Are children & families receiving the right care/ respect from social care professionals? The inquiry should consider the experiences of a broad and diverse range of parents, carers/ family types, & examine the wider social & financial impacts on families and society.",
        "background": "Some families report treatment received from social workers during assessments (etc) is often punitive, blame-based, & shaped by narratives that are narrow, biased, oppressive, & lack context. We feel assessments frequently fail to reflect the full circumstances.",
