        "additional_details": "It is becoming increasingly dangerous and unpleasant to drive, especially at night,  due to a constant barrage of blindness from oncoming traffic with unnecessarily bright headlights. Time after time people have said how unbearable these lights are and that they are having to almost come to a stop in some instances and it's time to put a stop to it. Please consider changing the law to make the roads a safer place to drive at night.",
        "background": "Look at limiting the brightness of all headlights in all road vehicles and making it illegal to have them above a certain brightness level. The current headlights are extremely dangerous and there is an overwhelming concensus that they need to be banned or at least regulated.",
