Only Parliament can change the policies, funding and allocation rules that are causing this crisis. We believe we need national reform so every family has a fair chance at a safe, suitable home and older tenants are given proper options to downsize without being forced into poor-quality accommodation.",

The review should look into creating fairer allocation rules, offering suitable downsizing options for older tenants, and ensuring families have access to a safe, healthy home.",
