Many students say that they do not want to attend their Welsh Baccalaureate lessons and feel the work is too much on top of their already intense workload. Many students say that they \u2018hate Welsh Bacc\u2019 which isn\u2019t a good reputation for the subject. Most of the tasks students are asked to complete are very similar to the work asked of them in GCSE\u2019s which makes it feel as if they are redoing the work.",
