        "additional_details": "It has been reported that knife crime has risen 80% in the last decade, with thousands of offences yearly. We believe sentencing is inconsistent and often lenient. We demand: 1) mandatory whole-life orders for deliberate knife-related murders, 2) no parole or release, 3) strict penalties for knife possession in violent situations. Knife attacks destroy families and communities. We believe the punishment must reflect the severity of the crime.",
        "background": "We believe Parliament should amend sentencing laws to introduce mandatory whole life sentences with no possibility of parole, to ensure consistent punishment, public protection, and deterrence.",
