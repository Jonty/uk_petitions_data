        "additional_details": "Young people are vulnerable and the adult industry is not a line of work that should be seen as an easy way to make money. A human brain is not fully developed until 25 years old and decisions that are made before this could have a long term lasting effect on the mental health of these individuals. We think the current news headlines are becoming a danger to society. They are advertising and glamourising the industry, therefore, allowing young adults to think that certain behaviours are deemed normal.",
