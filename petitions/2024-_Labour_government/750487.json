        "additional_details": "I am a young teacher and have a young family. Immunotherapy has been working and giving me precious time and hope, but my treatment will stop in February 2026 because of the NHS two-year limit. I believe it\u2019s unfair to end treatment that\u2019s saving lives. Many patients benefit well beyond two years. I ask for the Government to extend funding so people like me can continue effective care, avoid relapse, and have more time with our families.",
