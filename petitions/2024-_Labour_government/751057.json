        "additional_details": "We call on the UK Government to regulate the courier industry \u2014 protecting the public, ensuring fair treatment for workers, and restoring trust in this essential service. MPs have raised serious concerns, yet action has lagged. We urge the Government to hold companies accountable, modernise employment laws, and guarantee self/employed couriers the right to unionise. Parcel delivery is vital infrastructure \u2014 it must serve everyone fairly. Sign the petition for real change now.",
        "background": "The UK delivery system is broken \u2014 customers face missed parcels and poor service, while couriers endure unfair pay, poor working conditions, and no protection. Despite generating over \u00a39 billion a year, the industry remains unregulated and exploitative. It\u2019s time for accountability and reform.",
