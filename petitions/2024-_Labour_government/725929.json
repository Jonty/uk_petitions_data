Yet 30 years later full and equal access to society hasn't been achieved. \r\nWheelchair users should be able to come and go from Downing Street as anybody else.\r\nPeople think you cannot make heritage buildings accessible and therefore do not try, however the law actually encourages making heritage accessible. If Downing Street is seen to make remedial changes then other owners will. \r\nPrevious ministers for the disabled have promised this.",
        "background": "To celebrate 30 years of the DDA & to show more can be done that the step from pavement to the path of 10 Downing Street and from here into the house are permanently replaced by flat thresholds. At the moment temporary ramps are put out, these do not provide good access & demeaning to visitors.",
