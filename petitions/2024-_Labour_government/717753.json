        "additional_details": "The current leasehold system is outdated, unfair, places millions of homeowners at the mercy of freeholders and managing agents, often subjecting them to unreasonable charges, restrictive conditions, and a lack of control over their own properties.\r\n\r\nThe government has acknowledged  flaws in the system, but reforms have been slow and insufficient.\r\nWe urge the government to act to end leasehold exploitation, bring meaningful reform, and protect lease holders from financial and legal uncertainty.",
        "background": "Introduce legislation to end leasehold ownership.\r\n\r\nImplement a complete ban on ground rents for all leasehold properties.\r\n\r\nIntroduce stricter regulations to prevent excessive charges, hidden fees, and unscrupulous practices. Create a regulatory body with enforcing powers.",
