        "additional_details": "We call on the UK government to address this inequity and ensure UK pensioners living in other countries, including Canada receive the same annual increase to their pension as those living in the United States, the EU, and other countries with similar policies.\r\n\r\nFor example, UK pensioners in India, South Africa, Canada, Pakistan, Nigeria and others do not receive increases.\r\n\r\nWe urge the UK government to adopt a policy that ensures all UK pensioners, wherever they live, receive fair and equitable treatment.",
        "background": "Many UK citizens have emigrated to other countries, like Canada, and now are retired and rely on their UK state pensions for financial support. Only pensioners living in the US, EU and some other countries that the UK has a bilateral social security agreement with have their state pensions uprated.",
