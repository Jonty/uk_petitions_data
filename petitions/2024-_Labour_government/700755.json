        "action": "Reopen the petition to ban fireworks or change the law on their use.",
        "additional_details": "As previously mentioned, fireworks continue to cause disruption to many people's lives with the use of them being used as threats to some individuals. The safety aspect concerns me that still nothing is done regarding either the ban of them or the use at public displays only. Working in the NHS the injuries are alarming and the impact on an already exhausted emergency service is despicable, not to mention animals welfare that is saddening and the impact on children with additional support needs.",
        "background": "The previous petition on the ban on fireworks was due to be re opened. However, the election  put this back and a date was never confirmed. The continuing rise in concern for the safety of people, animals and pollution these cause is alarming to say nothing is ever done regarding  their use.",
