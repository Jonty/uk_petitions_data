        "additional_details": "We think supporting this scheme would enable ladies to have more choice. The bra and prosthesis voucher could then be presented to a professional bra fitter from an approved list of trained fitters capable of providing that expertise in a less clinical environment than in hospital. We think people who have had breast surgery should be able to access suitable post surgery bras and prosthesis in a variety of different shapes and sizes from a vast selection of brands.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to fund a voucher scheme for all women for post surgery bras and breast prosthesis, giving ladies a choice. This would expand the current scheme to enable all women to access support, regardless of their age or income.",
