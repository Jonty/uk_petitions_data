        "additional_details": "The police are not visible any longer and there is no deterrent for criminals. Victims and potential victims are more vulnerable as the law prohibits articles that are designed to be used for self defence in UK. We don't feel safe and we don't want to break the law in order to carry an item that may be used in self defence , but failure to provide a suitable defence spray will force ppl into criminality in order to feel safe.",
        "background": "Review current self defence laws across the UK to understand whether they are sufficient to keep people safe, now that assaults and rapes are on the increase and knife crime is at epidemic levels.",
