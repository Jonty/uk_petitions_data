        "additional_details": "Over 18000 people signed up for the TV license to be abolished under the previous government. The money presenters get paid is a ridiculous amount and if cheaper presenters were used, then the TV licence could be reduced. Freedom of the individual, should be able to choose what they want to watch, if one wants to watch live TV of the itv for example, that are self funded, then why does a TV licence need to be obtained from the BBC, those overseas can watch the BBC for free, so why are we paying!",
        "background": "The TV licence is outdated and should no longer be forced on people due to competitive law with subscription based companies and free TV with adverts from many different providers. The BBC TV licence must go,if the BBC doesn't want to show paid adverts then make them an optional subscription company",
