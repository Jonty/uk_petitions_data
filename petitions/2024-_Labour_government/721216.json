        "additional_details": "To trace all cyclists responsible for any accident/incident they're involved in & cover any damages caused like any other vehicle & road user. Too many children/pedestrians getting injured by being hit/run into (even on zebra crossings) by irresponsible cyclists & they just ride off not even so much as a name given. They damage vehicles & nothing to hold them accountable making vehicle users have to claim off their own insurances to cover damages. Vehicle users would be penalised.",
        "background": "Regulate cyclists with a tracable numberplate, registered to themselves so they can be tracked with insurance in place to cover themselves. Made to do a test on road safety/high way code.\r\nThey get stolen too easily also, again untrackable.",
