        "action": "Establish an independent defence review board to axe obsolete military spending",
        "additional_details": "We want the recommendations enacted in 6 months. We believe the War in Ukraine proves modern warfare is determined by drones, cyber warfare and satellite intelligence. We feel the UK clings to old systems, which may leave us exposed if US support ends. We believe the MoD\u2019s 2025 review is slow, vague, not independent and may be protecting wasteful programs. We believe taxpayer money must fund real defence and only an independent, publicly accountable review can cut waste and make Britain ready.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to establish an independent defence review board to audit all UK military spending within 9 months. We want it to have the power to identify any obsolete programs, recommend cuts, and reallocate funding to drones, electronic warfare, and sovereign intelligence.",
