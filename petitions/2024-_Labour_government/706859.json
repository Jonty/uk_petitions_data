        "additional_details": "Vulnerable populations could be pressured into ending their lives, fearing they're a burden. Legalization risks expansion and abuse. Trust between patients and doctors might erode, as doctors feel pressured to suggest assisted dying. Resources could be diverted from palliative care, focusing on cures over comfort. This could lead to a decline in end-of-life care and a slippery slope where the criteria for assisted dying expands.",
