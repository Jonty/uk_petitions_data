        "additional_details": "Palestine recognition is promoted by some as a path to peace. If it brings peace and Israel were a member of NATO then the mutual defence clause would not need to be triggered. We think Israel joining NATO is a way to demonstrate that the potential recognition of Palestine is truly a move for peace \u2013 not political gesturing or appeasing terrorism. \r\n \r\nIsrael faces open calls for its destruction & existential threats from terrorist groups. We believe it is indefensible to offer new diplomatic legitimacy to a Palestinian state while offering no additional protections to Israel.",
        "background": "We call upon His Majesty\u2019s Government to make any UK recognition of a Palestinian state conditional on either: Israel\u2019s accession to NATO, or the establishment of NATO-level mutual defence guarantees involving the UK and/or NATO partners.",
