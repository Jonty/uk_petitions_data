        "additional_details": "Why This Matters:\r\n\r\nTransparency: we think recording ensures social workers\u2019 actions are open to review, promoting accountability and minimizing bias.\r\n\r\nFairness: we think recorded interactions provide unbiased evidence, ensuring decisions are based on facts and due process.\r\n\r\nAdmissibility: we think recordings should be admissible in court, creating a clear, accurate record and reducing disputes.\r\n \r\nWe think this will enhance fairness, transparency, and integrity in family court proceedings.\r\n",
        "background": "I call for all interactions between individuals and social services particularly in family court cases, such as interviews, home visits, assessments, and other related proceedings, to be recorded (audio and/or video), and for the law to ensure these recordings are admissible in family court.",
