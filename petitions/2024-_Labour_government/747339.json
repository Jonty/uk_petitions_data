Solar and wind sites convert energy into electricity through mechanical or photovoltaic systems. We believe referring to them as \u201cfarms\u201d misleads the public and confuses land use. The Government should replace these terms with ones we believe are more accurate, like \u201cElectric Generation Site (EGS)\u201d or \u201cRenewable Generation Facility (RGF).\u201d",
