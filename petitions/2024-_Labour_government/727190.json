It seems unfair that taxpayers in England are, in our view, punished with what we see as an extra tax that patients in Scotland and Wales are not having to pay.",

It's an extra cost paid by patients or those visiting loved ones, and we think it is unfair for patients in England to be treated differently in this way.",
