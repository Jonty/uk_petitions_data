        "additional_details": "Clock changes twice a year disrupt sleep, health, and daily routines, and can increase accidents, stress, and reduced productivity. Energy savings are minimal, with a 2017 study showing only 0.3% reduction. A consistent time system would provide longer daylight in the evenings, improving safety, outdoor activity, and overall wellbeing. In a 2018 EU consultation, 84% of citizens wanted to abolish clock changes. Ending DST simplifies life and protects public health.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to end the practice of changing the clocks twice a year for Daylight Saving Time. The UK should remain on a single, consistent time zone all year round, preferably BST.",
