        "additional_details": "Many with ILR or settled status have built their lives, families, and careers in the UK, contributing to the economy, services, and communities. Removing these rights creates uncertainty, harms cohesion, and punishes those who followed the rules. It risks family separation, deters skilled workers, and damages the UK\u2019s reputation. Parliament must protect long-term residents and ensure immigration policy stays fair and humane.",
        "background": "We urge Parliament to reject any attempt to abolish Indefinite Leave to Remain or to replace settled status with restrictive visas. People who earned these rights legally contribute to the UK and deserve security. Protect their status, safeguard families, and uphold fairness in immigration policy.",
