        "additional_details": "Digital IDs threaten the very freedoms that define Britain. They would give the state intrusive control over how we live, work, and travel, while eroding privacy and free speech. We are already seeing alarming government overreach, with arrests for online posts and thousands of \u201cnon-crime\u201d incidents recorded. Britain must not slide into a surveillance state. Parliament must defend liberty, limit intervention, and ensure citizens remain free, not monitored.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to scrap plans for digital IDs. Such a scheme threatens civil liberties, privacy, and free speech, giving the state unprecedented control over citizens\u2019 lives. Britain must remain a free nation, not a monitored one.",
