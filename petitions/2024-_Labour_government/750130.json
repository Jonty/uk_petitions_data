        "additional_details": "Royal Preston Hospital is outdated, overcrowded, and visibly under-maintained, requiring \u00a3150m to resolve the maintenance backlog. Patients are treated in cramped, poorly ventilated areas, and staff are stretched beyond safe limits. The emergency department is too small for the population it serves, and the building no longer supports safe, dignified care. Delaying its replacement until 2037\u20132039 puts lives at risk. Urgent action is needed to improve conditions now and accelerate the rebuild.",
        "background": "We ask the government to urgently bring forward the replacement of RPH, including reviewing current care conditions, accelerating the rebuild, committing to interim upgrades, and visiting the hospital to witness the situation first-hand. Central Lancashire deserves safe, modern healthcare now.",
