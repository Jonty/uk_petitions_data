        "action": "Hold annual public approval votes for sitting governments",
        "additional_details": "The public currently has no democratic recourse between elections when governments break promises or underperform. We propose a reform to introduce annual public confidence votes. If a government fails to meet a defined approval threshold (e.g. 50%), this would legally trigger a general election. Elected officials should be required to fulfil policy pledges, or face consequences at the ballot box. This reform would improve accountability and restore public trust.",
        "background": "Introduce a law requiring annual public approval votes on the sitting UK government. If approval falls below a set threshold, a general election must be triggered. Governments must also be legally bound to deliver on election promises.",
