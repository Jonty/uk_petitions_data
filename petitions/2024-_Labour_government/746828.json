        "additional_details": "AGI poses a serious risk to humanity. Aligning AI values with human values remains unresolved and may be impossible. AI systems can mislead, making alignment unverifiable. AI tools are controllable; AI agents act independently and may become uncontrollable. AGI is a one-shot process\u2014if misaligned, control may be lost permanently. While AI tools offer massive unrealized benefits in productivity and addressing almost all challenges we face, unaligned AGI could lead to catastrophic consequences.",
