        "additional_details": "We also are sceptical & suspicious about the strategy in timing for relocation of the Parliamentary Archives to Kew Gardens. \r\nThis further extends the delay of access to important records that can prove claims in casework \r\n\r\nE petitions further is refusing to publish critical petitions that disagree with government as it pushes its buisness agenda through at all costs.. despite record levels of protests in public and widespread criticism, record low support of any prime minister.\r\n\r\nWe want apology",
        "background": "We Believe that it was not acceptable for lockdown to hinder access to the national archives and anyone should have been given remote log in to proquest because the parliamentary papers act 1840 should have covered everything and reasonable adjustments. \r\n\r\nResearch has been delayed dramatically",
