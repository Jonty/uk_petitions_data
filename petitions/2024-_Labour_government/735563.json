        "action": "Make general election manifestos legally binding",
        "additional_details": "Voters deserve honesty and accountability. Too often, manifesto promises are abandoned once a party gains power. This undermines trust in democracy. Making manifestos legally binding would force governments to deliver what they promised or justify why they can't. It ensures political integrity and respects the will of the electorate. If a pledge is serious enough to campaign on, it should be serious enough to honour by law.",
        "background": "We want the UK Government to make it law that political parties forming a government must be held legally accountable to deliver the key pledges in their election manifestos. This would restore trust in politics and ensure parties cannot make promises they do not intend to keep.",
