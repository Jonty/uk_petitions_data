        "additional_details": "We call on the government and Parliament to respect individuals\u2019 right to privacy by rejecting any powers that compel companies to provide access to encrypted data. We believe encryption is crucial to protect personal information, ensure security, and preserve freedom of speech. We believe compromising encryption weakens digital security, increases risks of data breaches, and sets a dangerous precedent that could undermine privacy rights worldwide. We want to protect these fundamental freedoms.",

This petition calls for the repeal of this Act, as we believe it undermines individual freedom, risks data security, and could set a dangerous global precedent.",
