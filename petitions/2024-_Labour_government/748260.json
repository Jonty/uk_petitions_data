        "additional_details": "Changing the clocks twice a year causes confusion, tiredness and disrupts sleep. Lighter evenings would help families, children and workers enjoy daylight after school and work, improving health, safety and quality of life. Modern life no longer needs clock changes, and many nations are already moving to permanent time.",
        "background": "Stop changing the clocks in March and October and make British Summer Time (BST) permanent. The UK should remain one hour ahead of GMT year-round to give people lighter evenings, better wellbeing and a modern, consistent time system.",
