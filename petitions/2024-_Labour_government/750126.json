For example, a ban on fireworks or a ban on certain types of fireworks, such as aerial fireworks.\r\n\r\nOr you may wish to sign one of these petitions, which call for similar action:\r\n\r\n\"Reduce the maximum noise level for consumer fireworks from 120 to 90 decibels\"\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/738192\r\n\r\n\"Reduce the sound of fireworks to under 80 decibels for humans and animals\"\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/739674\r\n\r\n\"Limit the sale of fireworks to those running local council approved events only\"\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/732559"
