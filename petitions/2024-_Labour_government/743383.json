We call for full enforcement of the Illegal Migration Act 2023, transparent reporting, and a mechanism for Parliament to act when government fails to meet its targets. As Magna Carta affirmed in 1215, government must act under the law. We ask that illegal migration laws be enforced transparently and that Parliament hold government to account when targets are missed",
        "background": "Enforce existing illegal migration laws, publish accurate quarterly data on arrivals and removals, and commit to annual enforcement targets. If targets are missed, Parliament must hold a confidence vote or debate a general election.",
