        "additional_details": "PIP already does not account for a lot of aspects of daily living that disabled people struggle with, so it\u2019s already very difficult to be awarded. Insisting that people need 4 points will take away vital help from vulnerable people who desperately need it, will prevent them from being able to be independent the majority of the time and have a carer to help.  Those affected by this change will be forced into poverty and unable to manage their conditions and lives without that vital assistance.",
        "background": "Stop the proposed changes to PIP that would require a person to have 4 points in 1 section of daily living in order to qualify. To get 4 points the claimant would need to have assistance from another person the majority of the time. However the point of PIP is to enable a claimant to be independent.",
