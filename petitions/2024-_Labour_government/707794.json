Old age pensioners should not have to pay as they cannot afford it and deserve the right to watch television. \r\nThis should now be self -funded by selling advertising the same as EVERY other channel does.\r\nTelevision should be available to everyone and this would be a major step forward.",
        "background": "Due to the BBC now showing more repeats than ever before, we now feel it is time to abolish the licence fee and show adverts to generate income. We do not want to pay the fee to watch the same things over and over again.",
