        "additional_details": "MPs claiming \u00a3400,000 for home utilities, while cutting Winter Fuel Payments (\u00a3100-\u00a3300 for 25-26, per GOV.UK), is unfair. Pensioners and others struggle with heating costs, yet public funds subsidise MPs\u2019 personal expenses. The 2009 scandal showed expense misuse erodes trust, and this hypocrisy deepens it. Fairness demands public money support work duties, not personal comfort, especially during a cost-of-living crisis. Action now, with audits, will restore accountability.",
        "background": "We urge the Government and Parliament to instruct IPSA (Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority) to ban MPs' utility claims for homes, limiting them to only genuine office costs, after cutting Winter Fuel Payments, leaving pensioners and many at risk. Enforce audits by 2025's end.",
