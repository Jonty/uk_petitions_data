        "action": "Offer a free app to children and parents that monitors and manages their phones",
        "additional_details": "There are a number of apps and tech platforms that can be installed on parent/carers and children/teens phones that help the parents manage their internet access, phone time and enables parents to set boundaries for phone use. This technology isn't known about by everyone and comes at a cost. Given we are on the cusp of a global smart phone crisis with children and teens accessing everything on the internet, the Government should be taking action by creating / offering a tool like this for all.",
        "background": "The UK Prime Minister has spoken out about phone use in children. He should now ensure that in the UK all parents/carers are offered a free app that monitors, manages and regulates their child's phone usage. All parents of under 16 year olds should have access to this technology.",
