        "additional_details": "Reducing the cost of energy while striving to achieve Net Zero by 2030 is feasible through enhanced research efforts. However, considering the majority of properties in the UK are quite old and do not align with Net Zero standards, the adoption of better alternatives is imperative. Older properties in the UK often lack modern insulation and energy-efficient systems, leading to higher energy consumption and costs. The measures suggested by the government isn't working.",
