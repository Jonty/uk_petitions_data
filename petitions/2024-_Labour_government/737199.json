The killing of 500 chicks yearly erases up to 6,000 future birds on average \u2014each could breed for 12 years\u2014 and far more for those living longer. This needless loss, on top of disease and dwindling populations accelerates their decline and robs Scotland of one of its most iconic and irreplaceable seabirds.",
