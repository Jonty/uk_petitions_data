        "additional_details": "We believe timed written exams & theory components in every subject exclude neurodiverse students who can\u2019t show true ability when forced to write fast or at length. Employers tend to recruit on practical skills, projects & portfolios \u2014 not exam-hall writing speed. BTEC proves 100% practical assessment works across dozens of subjects & is oversubscribed. We think the system is discriminatory, invalid, causes mental health crises & subject decline. Abolish timed exams \u2014 make every subject 100% practical now.",
        "background": "Require DfE & Ofqual to reform every GCSE, A-Level & BTEC subject to 100% practical/portfolio/applied assessment, 0% written/theory, no exams. Grant all BTEC routes equal status in Progress 8/Attainment 8 and create dual academic/vocational pathways in every subject from 14\u201319 for inclusion.",
