        "additional_details": "In our diverse and multicultural society, the UK prides itself on being a place where people of all faiths and beliefs can live together in peace and mutual respect. However, we believe that recent acts of burning, desecrating, or harming religious books have caused deep hurt, division, and tension within our communities. We think that these actions, often carried out by individuals or groups seeking to provoke outrage or gain attention, undermine the values of tolerance, harmony, and respect.",
