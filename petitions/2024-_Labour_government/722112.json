        "additional_details": "It is the norm that UK Emergency Services are expected to risk their lives daily with little to no recognition, leading to a disillusioned, undervalued workforce. Emergency Services don\u2019t do the roles that they do for praise or accolades but that doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t deserve them. I feel that the UK Emergency Services have become overlooked and taken for granted by the UK Government. I also request that the medal be back dated to retired personnel so they are eligible to wear the medal.",
        "background": "Frontline Uk Emergency Services put their lives at risk everyday protecting the public of the UK. I call on the government to recognise their brave dedication through the creation on a 999 General Service Medal. I feel that the creation of this medal is long over due and would be much welcomed.",
