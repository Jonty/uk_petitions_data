In our view the UK is at risk of becoming entangled in these geopolitical conflicts. We propose a neutral stance that would prioritise British security, protect our economy, and allow Britain to serve as a mediator, promoting diplomacy and peace on the international stage.\r\n \r\nWe think Britain is no longer a super power on the level of America, China, or Russia.",

We believe that neutrality will protect British interests, safeguard our national security, and uphold our tradition of diplomacy and peacekeeping in an increasingly polarised world.",
