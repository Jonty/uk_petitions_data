        "additional_details": "The analogue copper landline network is independent of the internet and may be vital in the event of national emergency. Router powered phones wont work in a power cut or IT outage and we think giving a vulnerable person a battery pack that is only good for an hour as an alternative is not good enough.",

We think payphones and traditional landlines are vital for public safety.",
