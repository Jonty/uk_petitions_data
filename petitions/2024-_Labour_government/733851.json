The earlier we detect, the better the prognosis and the better the survival rate.\r\nBreast Cancer screening saves lives and needs to be available to more women.",
        "background": "Breast Cancer is the most common cancer in women in the UK.  I was diagnosed at 45 years old.  The routine mammogram is from 50 to 70 years.  This NHS screening programme was set in 1988 and the lower age for being eligible has not been reviewed despite more and more younger women being diagnosed.",
