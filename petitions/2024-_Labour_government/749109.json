        "additional_details": "Public trust in politics is collapsing. The Government\u2019s response to petition 119416 relied on voluntary integrity, not enforceable rules. Parties break promises, like Labour\u2019s pledge of no tax rises, leaving people fearful and trapped in a living-to-work cycle. Hardworking citizens are punished while others gain unfairly. Laws are needed to ensure honesty, accountability, and fairness.",
