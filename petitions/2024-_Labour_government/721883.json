        "additional_details": "Deporting foreign nationals who commit crimes in the UK could ease pressure on the criminal justice system by reducing prison overcrowding and lowering costs. It would save taxpayers money on housing, healthcare, and inmate management while enhancing public safety by potentially reducing reoffending rates. The threat of deportation could also act as a deterrent to criminal behavior. Additionally, savings could be redirected to crime prevention, rehabilitation, and other vital public services.",
        "background": "I would like the government to consider the deportation of non-UK nationals who have been convicted of crimes in the UK. Rather than serving their prison sentences in the UK, they should be repatriated to serve their sentences in their country of origin.",
