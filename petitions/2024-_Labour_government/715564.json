        "additional_details": "It is unfair that English fans can not watch premier league matches that kick off at 3PM on Saturdays, the premier league is after all an English football league, the majority of its fans are English citizens who like myself pay a lot of money to watch my team play. For example my team has 2 weeks of matches that kick off at 3PM on a Saturday therefore won\u2019t be televised but I pay a lot of money for memberships to watch these matches specifically so I will be losing money because I can\u2019t watch.",
        "background": "I want the government or parliament to make any football matches that kick off at 3PM on Saturdays televised for UK watchers/fans.",
