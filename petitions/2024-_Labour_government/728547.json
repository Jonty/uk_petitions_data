Please share this petition with your friends!\r\n\r\nKeir Starmer\u2019s deal is a total stitch-up of a defenceless group of people, the Chagossians, who have been tormented by the Mauritian government for 60 years because of racial hatred toward the colour of their skin.\r\n\r\nThe treaty is nuts, we will have to pay billions *with interest* until the year 2164. This is madness at a time of deep cuts to social security.",
        "background": "The Chagos deal is a terrible disaster. What kind of country do we live in, that the Government will betray the indigenous Chagossian people, and our national interests?\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons has the sovereign power to block legislation. There will be a \u201cChagos Bill\u201d. MPs must stop it. All of it.",
