        "additional_details": "We think organised crime thrives on the illegal drug trade, using profits to fund violence and exploitation. We think many less harmful substances remain banned, giving criminals a monopoly over supply and promoting the development of  harmful substances like synthetic marijuana.\r\n \r\nWe think reclassifying drugs based on scientific evidence of actual harm would reduce criminal profits, support health-led interventions, and free up police resources.  We think adopting a harm-based approach to drug policy would reduce crime and protect the public.",
        "background": "The Government should review how controlled substances are classified under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 based on current scientific evidence of their actual harm and addictiveness. We think criminalisation of substances creates a monopolised illegal drug market that funds further criminal activity.",
