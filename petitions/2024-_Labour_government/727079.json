        "action": "Ban Bottom Trawling in UK Waters to Protect Marine Ecosystems",
        "additional_details": "Bottom trawling is one of the most destructive fishing methods, dragging heavy nets across the seabed and destroying vulnerable habitats. It harms marine life, disrupts ecosystems, and releases carbon stored in ocean sediments. The seafloor is left barren.\r\n\r\nThis is incompatible with the UK\u2019s environmental goals. Our seas are a vital part of the UK\u2019s natural heritage and climate strategy.\r\n\r\nProtecting our seas is essential for climate resilience, food security, and to safeguard marine biodiversity",
        "background": "Immediately ban bottom trawling in all UK Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)\r\n\r\nStrengthen enforcement in Marine Protected Areas\r\n\r\nIntroduce a timeline for a full ban on bottom trawling in all UK waters\r\n\r\nSupport sustainable fishing methods that preserve the marine environment and coastal livelihoods.",
