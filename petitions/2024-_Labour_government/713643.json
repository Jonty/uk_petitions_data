        "additional_details": "Cancelling or postponing an election chips away at this democratic process, therefore we must insist that county elections go ahead as planned.\r\n\r\nLabour's attempt at governance has proven disastrous and needs to be held to account at the ballot box. Please sign this petition and insist that the Labour Government does not disrupt the electoral schedule. Stand up for the democratic process and uphold your right to vote. Your signature matters and can make a difference.",
        "background": "What fuels this democracy is the power of the vote; an opportunity for every citizen to voice their opinion and effect change. I have reason to believe that the Labour government is considering cancelling or postponing County elections in May 2025 to avoid a humiliating defeat.",
