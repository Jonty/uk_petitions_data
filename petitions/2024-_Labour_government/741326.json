        "additional_details": "Too often, severe mental health conditions go unrecognized in education settings, leading to stigma, crisis situations, and people being left without support. Staff lack the tools to respond safely and effectively. With proper funding and training, schools, colleges, and universities can reduce risks of harm, prevent exclusion, and create safer, more compassionate environments for those living with complex disorders.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to increase funding and provide mandatory training in schools, colleges, and universities so staff are equipped to understand, identify, and support people with complex mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and personality disorders.",
