        "additional_details": "Cars, lorries, and trucks are speeding into Darvel from the Priestland direction, creating a serious safety risk for residents and road users. The speeding causes loud noise, vibrations, and cracks in nearby walls, making life distressing for those along this stretch. A nearby bus stop used by children and families adds to the danger. The traffic speed and volume make it unsafe for pedestrians and uncomfortable for residents. Installing speed cameras or other calming measures would reduce speeding, improve safety, protect homes, and help prevent loss of life.",
        "background": "Take immediate action to reduce vehicle speeds on the road between Priestland-Darvel. Residents have raised serious concerns about the excessive speed of cars, lorries, and trucks entering Darvel, which is causing noise, damage to nearby homes; as well as danger to pedestrians, children, and pets.",
