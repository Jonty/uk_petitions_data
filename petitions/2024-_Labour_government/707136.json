        "additional_details": "The key fact about words or actions that result in the recording of a Non-Crime Hate Incident is that they are NOT A CRIME. Nevertheless they are entered on people's records, and may show up in a background check and have an adverse effect on their life and career. This is unacceptable. NCHIs are not a contribution to the rule of law; they are a tool of political control, used to penalise thoughtcrime and intimidate and silence those who say things that go against \"acceptable\" political beliefs.",
        "background": "I call on Parliament to outlaw the recording of so-called \"Non-Crime Hate Incidents\" (NCHIs) where people behave in ways that may be objectionable or offensive to some, but are nevertheless within the law. I also call on Parliament to ensure that all existing NCHIs are expunged from records.",
