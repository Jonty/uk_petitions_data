        "additional_details": "I believe this should be taught in school as every school is likely to have neurodivergent children with one or more of these conditions, and I feel these lessons would help children understand their peers better. I think this would open up a whole new world for children because they can help support their peers that are neurodivergent, and it could help children with neurodivergent siblings or parents to better understand and support them.",
        "background": "Every child should have the chance to be understood. I want the curriculum to require that all children be taught about neurodivergence. This should include teaching on Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia (DCD), Dyscalculia, Tourette's Syndrome, and sensory processing disorder, to name a few examples.",
