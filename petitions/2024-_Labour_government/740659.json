        "additional_details": "The current rules are inconsistent and outdated. Pets can enter the UK by car, ferry, or private jet under the same biosecurity rules but are banned from cabin travel on commercial flights. This causes unnecessary stress, higher costs, and welfare risks. Aligning rules would improve animal welfare without reducing safety.",
