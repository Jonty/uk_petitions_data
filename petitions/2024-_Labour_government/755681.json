        "background": "I urge the government to create a new law that forces all Governments (current & future) must stick to their manifesto.\r\n\r\nIf the Government wanted to bring in something new not on the manifesto they would ask the public to vote, if 60% of voters vote yes, the Governments plan is brought in.",
