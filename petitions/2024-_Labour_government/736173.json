        "action": "Make it law to stop and report hitting a cat with your vehicle",
        "additional_details": "The law states that road accidents involving specific animals e. g dogs, horses, cattle etc. require the driver to stop and report the incident, but cats are not mentioned. This has been law for nearly 40 years and 29% of households have at least 1 cat. That means nearly 20 million people keep a cat as a pet, yet there is still no law to protect them if there is a road accident involving them",
        "background": "change the Road Traffic Act of 1988 to require a person to stop and report whenever they hit a cat with their vehicle. Cats are as much a pet as a dog, and for 37 years now it has been law to do so for dogs, so why not cats?",
