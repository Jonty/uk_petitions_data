        "additional_details": "Basic necessities cost the same for everyone; many on lower wages may have to spend more of their wages on these essentials. We are concerned that over time, fewer can afford luxuries as the pay gap widens. We believe a fairer system would be a flat rate for pay increases, as it could ensure that people who are on lower wages will not be left behind and that the pay gap remains stable.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to implement a policy of flat pay rise across the public sector for all employees rather than different increases which may disproportionately benefit those on higher wages and could lead to economic division.",
