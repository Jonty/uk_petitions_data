        "additional_details": "\u2e3b\r\n\r\nI want the Government to do this because overseas Care Workers played a vital frontline role during COVID-19, working directly with infected and vulnerable patients and supporting the NHS at its most critical time. It is unfair that they are now placed on a 10-year ILR route while nurses and doctors remain on a 5-year route. Care Workers deserve equal recognition, fair treatment, and the settlement pathway they were originally expecting when they came to the UK to help during the pandemic.",
        "background": "We ask the UK Government to reinstate a 5-year route to Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) for overseas Care Workers and their dependants who have worked in the NHS or social care sector since 2021, especially those who served during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
