        "additional_details": "The cost of living as a result of the governments poor management is already at an all time high and to further reduce income puts people closer to the breadline. 40% tax is disgusting and an embarrassment to a country that claims to be for its people. \r\n\r\nIt is not fair or feasible to increase tax to this value, nor necessary when millionaires and billionaires pay such small amounts.",
        "background": "The tax is due to change in April 2025 to increase tax for earning over \u00a337,701 to 40% from 20%.\r\n\r\nThis is a huge and unfair jump considering the cost of living. With earners of \u00a3125k plus only paying 5% more. \r\n\r\nThis is far too removed from reality and a reduction in far too many wages.",
