        "additional_details": "UK emergency services sometimes work alongside the UK military and I believe they face a similar level of threat. I urge the Government to reduce the qualifying period for UK emergency service workers to be able to access their full workplace pension so that it is in line with the qualifying period for those who serve in the military. I believe the military are obviously extremely deserving but I believe the mental and physical toll on emergency service workers must also be acknowledged.",
        "background": "According to the Forces Pension Society, in the UK military, non-commissioned ranks need to serve 22 years from age 18 or date of joining to be able to qualify for their full pension, and officers need to serve 16 years from age 21 or date of joining.",
