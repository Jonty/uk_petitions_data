        "additional_details": "We believe the current minimum age is already the upper limit for safe emotional development. We believe delaying reunion until 6 months may cause trauma \u2014 for both puppies and families. We feel this law punishes love while real trafficking could still continue. We are concerned puppies may become victims of bureaucratic fear, and families may be treated as criminals. We believe no dog deserves to suffer under this policy.",
        "background": "We urge Parliament to stop the part of the Animal Welfare (Import of Dogs, Cats and Ferrets) Bill that bans puppy imports under 6 months. We would like the Government to maintain the current legal age of 15 weeks, to allow families to reunite with puppies safely and lawfully.",
