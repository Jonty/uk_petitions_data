        "additional_details": "The recent supreme court ruling compromises the privacy, dignity and safety of trans and intersex people by allowing service providers to restrict access to single sex spaces and services on the grounds of biological sex. This heavily restricts the ability of trans people to go about their daily lives without being outed as trans.\r\n\r\nIn addition there has been a worrying increase in harassment of people who are allegedly trans, and this ruling will only encourage this further.",
        "background": "Amend the Equality Act 2010 to explicitly state that \"biological sex\" is to be treated the same as \"acquired sex\", and to explicitly define gendered terms to be inclusive of trans persons who have acquired that gender.",
