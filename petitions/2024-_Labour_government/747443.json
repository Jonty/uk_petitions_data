        "additional_details": "Rapid technological change has outpaced democratic oversight, leaving citizens exposed to unaccountable systems and data misuse. A Digital Magna Carta would restore trust, transparency, and fairness online, ensuring technology serves people, not power. It\u2019s time to renew democratic values for the digital age through open, inclusive public engagement, and to legislate against political parties using citizen digital data to further their political goals and spread misinformation.",
        "background": "Digital technology shapes learning, work, and democracy, yet law hasn\u2019t kept pace. A Digital Magna Carta would set clear rights to privacy, data ownership, freedom of expression, digital access, and protection from harm, developed via full public consultation at local, regional and national levels.",
