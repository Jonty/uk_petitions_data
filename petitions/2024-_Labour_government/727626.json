These are people who are working for an approved employer, making \u00a338,700 or more a year, have degrees, and have paid more tax than most with the healthcare fee and applications. These people are often also come from unstable countries, even active warzones - and the lack of clarity around citizenship takes a toll. Let us continue to make the UK a destination for the world's best.",
        "background": "Under the May 2025 immigration white paper, there is a proposal to extend the path to ILR for Skilled Worker visa holders from 5 years to 10 years. These people followed the established law of the land and designed their lives around this agreement, and I believe we should honour this commitment.",
