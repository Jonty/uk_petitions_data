        "action": "Replace Council Tax with a progressive Land Value Tax (LVT)",
        "additional_details": "Progressive taxes take a larger share from those with greater ability to pay, easing the burden on low- and middle-income households. Council Tax is regressive: outdated bands mean lower-value homes often pay a higher share. An LVT on unimproved land (location, size, connectivity) encourages efficient use, curbs speculation, lowers rents, and funds public services. For simplicity, it should use HM Land Registry, VOA and valuation data, with exemptions for parks, nature and public green space.",
        "background": "Make taxation fairer: LVT is a progressive tax\u2014those with more valuable land pay more, easing the burden on low and mid-value homes. LVT charges the unimproved value of land (location, size, amenities, connectivity) using government data, so there would be little red tape in implementing an LVT.",
