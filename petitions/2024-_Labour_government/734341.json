        "additional_details": "The drop off charges needs to be regulated with the fees reduced and maximum charge should be implemented. The fee should be sufficient to only cover the costs of providing services not to make more profits for shareholders. The charge should be standardised for all airports. \r\n\r\nThe charge at Bristol Airport has increased from \u00a34 to \u00a37 for a 10-minute stay in the Drop & Go car park over the past 5 years. This represents a 75% increase. Most people have no other way of travelling to the airport",
        "background": "Most UK airports are now chargeing between \u00a33 and \u00a37 for a drop-off in designated zones. These fees are increasing with Gatwick, Bristol, Leeds Bradford, Southampton and Stansted charging \u00a37. \r\n\r\nAirports make huge profits from these unfair charges.",
