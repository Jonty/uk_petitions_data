We believe that Commonwealth countries share similar culture and values to the UK, due to past influence there.\r\n\r\nAncestry visa holders have 'no access to public funds' and are expected to work and be able to work long term. They are still expected to meet English language requirements, police checks, and pass a life in the UK test to show understanding of the history, culture, values and laws here.",
