        "additional_details": "Anyone who has invested in an electric vehicle or a hybrid is now facing yet another unfair blow from the government. These changes will hit hardworking people who depend on their vehicles every single day.\r\n\r\nThis poorly thought-out tax risks causing real financial harm. It could force people to sell the cars they\u2019ve worked hard to afford and push many back toward older, more polluting combustion engines. This policy will be devastating \u2014 threatening jobs, incomes, and family stability.",
        "background": "Remove the unreasonable new mileage tax being added on top of existing car tax. Charging 3p per mile for electric vehicles \u2014 after years of encouraging consumers to switch to EVs \u2014 and 1.5p per mile for hybrids is completely unacceptable.",
