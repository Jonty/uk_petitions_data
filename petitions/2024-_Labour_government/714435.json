        "additional_details": "The private sector, corporate world is broken, with a toxic culture. At the centre of this is the mamagement consultancy industry. The main problem is that there's no laws in place to protect businesses or people's ideas and creative intelligence - laws currently in place around other forms of intellectual like inventions. The result is a free for all where there's no incentive to create own ideas, only to steal from others, and spin as your own.",
