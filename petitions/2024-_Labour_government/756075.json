        "additional_details": "Litter from food on the go is a persistent and growing problem across the UK. It can impact public spaces, fuel anti-social behaviour, and place a heavy burden on local authorities and volunteers. The Voluntary Code of Practice for Food on the Go was introduced in 2004, but as a voluntary measure, it is not enforceable. Furthermore, litter trends have evolved since its introduction. The code requires updating to reflect modern food-on-the-go littering across all business sectors.\r\n",
        "background": "On behalf of a group of councils, we ask the government to issue a clear, enforceable, evidence-based statutory framework to help businesses manage litter consistently, reduce environmental harm, and create fair and proportional responsibility, in partnership with local authorities and volunteers.\r\n",
