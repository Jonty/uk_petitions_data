        "additional_details": "We think deer numbers in the UK are preventing reforestation and natural regeneration in many areas. One cause is deer stalking guides failing to reduce deer numbers as it is in their financial interests that paying guests have something to shoot. The government acknowledges the seriousness of the problem. The Scottish government for instance removed the close season for male deer. We think a fee to fund rewilding/deer fencing could offset the damage this causes and encourage more deer control.",
        "background": "Any person who offers or provides services as a deer staking guide, or lets or sub-lets deer stalking in any commercial capacity, should be subject to paying for an annual renewable licence e.g. \u00a32000 increasing based on number of clients. The funds raised to go to re-wilding projects.",
