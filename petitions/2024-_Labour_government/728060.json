They should be qualified to trade in their field - showing competence.\r\n\r\nThe Govt should work with partners to implement and maintain standards through a licencing system, funded by the licencing fee. This should involve following up on jobs and checking on standards, with a register of approved traders.\r\n\r\nThe homeowner needs protection from unscrupulous builders. The unscrupulous builders can also harm decent traders, ruining the reputation of trades.",

Currently there are no standards, proof of competence, nor legal requirements before they can trade. We believe many people have had their lives ruined by rogue traders and cowboy builders that the Govt must take action.",
