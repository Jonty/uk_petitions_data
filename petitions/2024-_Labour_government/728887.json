The latest was a tanker containing fuel which meant the road was closed for nearly a full day. The camber on this roundabout is proven dangerous as at least 7 HGV drivers have received injuries. Many people complain that the HGV\u2019s are speeding but the speed is not a mitigating factor as no driver has been charged with dangerous/ driving without due care or attention to anyone\u2019s public knowledge.",
