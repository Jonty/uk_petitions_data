        "action": "Do not introduce or support any blasphemy laws in the UK, now or in future",
        "additional_details": "Blasphemy laws undermine freedom of speech, a core democratic principle. They can be used to silence dissent, suppress discussion, and prioritise religious sensitivities over individual rights. History shows such laws lead to censorship and persecution. The UK has thrived without them, promoting tolerance through dialogue, not legal restrictions. Upholding free speech allows society to challenge ideas, fostering progress. No government should have the power to punish beliefs or opinions",
        "background": "The UK rightly abolished blasphemy laws in 2008, recognising their threat to free speech. Reintroducing them would be a step backwards, undermining debate and democracy. No belief system should be legally shielded from criticism, as free discussion is vital for a tolerant and open society",
