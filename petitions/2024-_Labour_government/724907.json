        "action": "Extend theory test validity & allow only students to book practical tests",
        "additional_details": "The UK government has made little to no effort to improve driving test availability, despite clear evidence that bots and some driving instructors are monopolising bookings. This has led to students being forced to either retake the theory test due to delays or pay excessive fees to third-party providers to secure a practical test slot. The DVSA must adopt a more proactive approach to resolve this issue and ensure that UK citizens can obtain a full driving licence fairly and efficiently.",
        "background": "I urge for the the theory test to be extended validity beyond the current 2-year period and restrict practical test bookings to students only. Due to ongoing test shortages, it is extremely difficult to secure a slot. Forcing students to retake theory tests if they don\u2019t pass first time is unfair.",
