        "additional_details": "I want the parliament to provide free bus travel for students in Secondary school to ensure that children do not have to walk in dark cold roads or worry about how to ask their hard working parents for money every week for a child ticket which in this cost of living crisis adds up for a low and middle income family. Countries like Canada, Germany, Netherland and India provide free student pass . I urge the government to please make student travel free in England.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it would be great if you could please provide a source for the statement made \u2013 as we will need to know that this is somewhere publicly verifiable before we can publish your petition.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Some buses have increased their bus fares (the maximum fare cap has now increased from \u00a32 to \u00a33) . Many bus fares around England have gone up which means school children will have to pay higher amounts just to get from Point A to B. ",
