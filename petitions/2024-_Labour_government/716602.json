        "additional_details": "Evidence shows that legalisation has not increased youth usage and has displaced the illicit market. Studies indicate that cannabis legalisation can reduce alcohol consumption and opioid dependency, additionally, the cannabis industry has created thousands of jobs and boosted economic activity.\r\n\r\nA regulated market would provide safer products, reduce policing costs, and let the UK capitalise on an emerging multi-billion-pound industry.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s time for progressive, evidence-based cannabis policy.",
        "background": "We urge the UK government to legalise, tax, and regulate the sale of recreational cannabis, following the successful models of Canada and other nations.\r\n\r\nProper regulation ensures public safety while generating significant tax revenue, reducing crime, and stimulating economic growth.",
