        "additional_details": "The amount of time it takes to drop or collect people from the airport is of a very short duration and it only adds to the cost of travel and holidays to impose these ridiculous fees. Just today I see a person penalised \u00a3170 after stopping for less than 5 minutes. Moreover, they could only pay on line. This is detrimental to any one without internet capability.",
        "background": "Make it illegal to force people to pay for dropping off and picking up passengers from airports. It is unreasonable to force car drivers/owners to pay a fee for dropping off and picking up passengers from airports when they are only there for less than 20 minutes",
