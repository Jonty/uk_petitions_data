        "additional_details": "An immediate general election is essential to restore democratic legitimacy and public trust. With growing dissatisfaction over economic hardship, NHS pressures, and leadership instability, the current government no longer reflects the priorities of the people. A fresh mandate would allow voters to choose a direction that aligns with today\u2019s challenges and expectations. It\u2019s a vital step toward transparency, accountability, and renewed confidence in our democratic institutions.",
        "background": "The British public demands an immediate general election. The Government has failed to deliver the change it promised, and voters deserve the chance to choose a new direction that reflects today\u2019s priorities, challenges, and expectations.",
