        "action": "Require time & space for Muslim children to pray at school & education",
        "additional_details": "There are around four million Muslims in the United Kingdom. We think allowing school age children the opportunity to pray and fulfil the second pillar of their religion in a safe space without feeling rushed or nervous someone may enter upon them and be confused is paramount. As well as the freedom to carry out their obligations, they might be able to engage better in the school day without fretting about missing prayer. This could lead to increased focus and productivity, and a commitment to DE&I.",
        "background": "We want the government to require schools to have a designated room & adequate time in the school day (if outside break times) for Muslim children to carry out prayers. Ablution (cleansing the body) is required before praying. We want education to be rolled out on this in schools to remove stigma.",
