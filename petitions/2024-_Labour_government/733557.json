        "additional_details": "We believe that any overseas teacher employed in the UK state education sector should have their annual working visa fees waived once their employment status is confirmed. Without their labour, we believe our education system would be in an even greater crisis. We believe they should not have to pay for the privilege of working here and educating our children and young people in the state sector. For many overseas teachers these fees cause financial hardship.",
        "background": "We believe the UK\u2019s education sector is in the grip of a significant recruitment and retention crisis. Not all students have the subject specialists they deserve. We believe overseas teachers play a vital role in bolstering our falling teacher numbers; yet may be expected to pay to do so.",
