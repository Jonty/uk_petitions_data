        "additional_details": "We urge the government to restrict fireworks to organised public displays or licensed individuals. Uncontrolled fireworks cause fear, anxiety, and trauma for children, people with ASD, SPD, PTSD, and distress to animals. They also lead to injuries, fires, and property damage. Limiting use ensures celebrations are safe, responsible, and inclusive, protecting our communities while still allowing enjoyment for all.",
        "background": "We call for restrictions on the sale and use of fireworks to ensure they are limited to organised public displays and licensed individuals only. This measure would help protect vulnerable children, adults, and animals from the distress and harm caused by excessive noise and unsafe use.",
