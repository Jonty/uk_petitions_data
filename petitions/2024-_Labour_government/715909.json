This is because it is not clear which debates you would like to make it mandatory for MPs to attend. There are usually a number of different debates happening within the House of Commons at the same time across the main Chamber, in Westminster Hall (the parallel chamber) and in committees scrutinising legislation. Select committees, committees of MPs that scrutinise a particular subject, also meet to take evidence and deliberate on reports while the House is sitting. Therefore it would be physically impossible for an MP to attend every debate.\r\n\r\nYou could submit a petition specifying that attendance at specific types of Parliamentary business was compulsory."
