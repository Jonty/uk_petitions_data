        "additional_details": "Older, less efficient vehicles can disappear naturally without some families potentially feeling forced into rash decisions about vehicle use.\r\n \r\nIn my view, any attempt to fast-track carbon reduction by hiking certain taxes like VED may make the country poorer. I think the infrastructure needed to do the things government wants to do is decades behind. I believe that it should be the case that the more fuel you use, the more tax you pay.",
        "background": "I would like Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) to be completely abolished. Instead, add the cost to Fuel Duty. I think this will mean that for more fuel-efficient vehicles which generally use less fuel and emit less CO2, drivers will pay less for fuel, and this change may help wider zero carbon policies.",
