        "additional_details": "We think the Government needs to scrutinise top earners in the public sector to see if their wages are deemed fit for public monies on a half-yearly basis; which is dependent on what the job entails (NOT every day cost of the individuals living conditions and expenses).\r\n \r\nWe think many tax payers are struggling to pay for basic need. The public sector is not a private business. We think this will help cut costs and divert taxes to more required areas of work.",
        "background": "Top leaders in the public sector have wages higher than the average earner. Some earn more the \u00a3100k for jobs that we think the tax payer deem unfit for purpose. If these wages were paid in the private sector, we think they would be scrutinised under performance of the business.",
