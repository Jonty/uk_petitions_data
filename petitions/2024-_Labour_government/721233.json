        "additional_details": "There have been many casualties in the war. We think the exercise in attrition of the Russian military has largely served US and European aims, at the cost of Ukrainian conscripts. With the US now pulling back, we think Europe faces escalating hostilities that threaten the UK\u2019s security and economic stability. We think a swift peace is urgently needed to end further tragedy and fully restore UK-Russia relations.",
        "background": "Cease funding war. Work directly with Russia, Ukraine, & European partners to seek a swift peace deal. Acknowledge threat of NATO expansion could have been a core driver of Russian participation in this conflict. Restore full diplomatic & economic relations with Russia.",
