        "additional_details": "UK rules force dogs to fly in cargo, which can be unsafe and distressing. Many countries allow cabin travel with proper controls. These restrictions cause stress, prevent travel, and may lead to abandonment. Updating rules would protect animals and bring the UK in line with global standards.",
        "background": "Change regulations to allow dogs of all sizes to travel in the cabin on flights to and from the UK, where airline safety policies permit. Work with DEFRA, the CAA, and airlines to create safe, humane rules that support pet welfare and passenger comfort.",
