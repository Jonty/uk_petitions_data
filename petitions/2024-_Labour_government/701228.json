        "additional_details": "We are a democracy & have to trust elected candidates, but there are many matters where partisan and subjective views cloud objectivity, resulting in flawed judgements. The Lords has no qualified experts in most technical subjects so is unfit to arbitrate without consulting a panel made up of expert, impartial witnesses from across relevant disciplines. This would lead to greater trust in the decision making of elected representatives whose verdicts could be assessed against the advice given.",
        "background": "There is insufficient scrutiny on matters of national security allowing material changes by groups who possibly have vested interests which can have destructive consequences for the future of our country. We need fewer regular members of quangos with affiliation to one party, & more unbiased experts",
