This causes a lot of stress to animals dogs, cats, horses ,birds etc the list goes on I don't want a ban on fireworks just the ones that make a loud bangs . Unless it's at a organised venue.",
        "background": "Fireworks that bang cause unnecessary stress to animals and it's not just for one day now . I think it would be better that fireworks that make loud noises should be at an event and not sold to the public only colourful ones .",
