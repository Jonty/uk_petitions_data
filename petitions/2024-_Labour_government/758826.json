We believe it is readily apparent that the majority of local authorities across the UK have wholly failed in this duty with regard to the road network over decades and that the problem is getting measurably and rapidly worse. Government should redirect the responsibility and funding to a new body with the sole responsibility for managing the road network.",

Responsibility should be removed from local authorities and handed to an independent, properly funded and governed, competent, professional, central body covering the whole country. ",
