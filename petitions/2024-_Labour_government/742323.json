        "additional_details": "I want Parliament to allow non-school uniform because many families struggle with the high cost of uniforms, which can be unfair and stressful. Uniforms also limit individuality and stop students from expressing themselves. Allowing students to wear their own clothes would reduce financial pressure, create more comfort, and boost confidence. School should be a place to focus on learning, not what we are forced to wear, and this change would make education fairer and more positive for everyone.",
        "background": "School uniforms create costs for families and limit self-expression. Allowing non-uniform would ease financial pressure, let students feel more comfortable, and promote individuality, while still keeping respect and focus in school.",
