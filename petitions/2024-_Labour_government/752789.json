        "additional_details": "We believe the current \u00a329,000 minimum income requirement stops many British citizens from living with their spouses, despite paying tax and contributing to the UK. It can cause emotional, social and financial harm and pushes people to work excessive hours, affecting health and wellbeing. We believe a \u00a320,000 requirement better reflects real incomes, supports a healthy work\u2013life balance and aligns immigration rules with the UK\u2019s values of fairness and family life..",
        "background": "Lower the spouse-visa income requirement to \u00a320,000 to reflect real UK wages. We ask the Government to protect the right of British citizens to live with their families, uphold the UK\u2019s principles of fairness and family unity, and ensure immigration rules do not contradict those values.",
