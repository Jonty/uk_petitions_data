        "action": "End the Saturday Football Blackout in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The 3\u202fpm Saturday football blackout is outdated and largely ineffective in the modern era. Originally intended to protect lower-league match attendance, it now has limited impact and often drives fans to watch Premier League games via illegal streams. With digital platforms and on-demand services widely available, the blackout restricts fans unnecessarily and fails to achieve its original purpose, making it time for a modernised approach.",
        "background": "Abolish the 3\u202fpm blackout, allowing fans to watch live top-flight football legally at any time. Modernise broadcasting rules to reflect today\u2019s digital, on-demand viewing habits. Protect both fans\u2019 rights and the sustainability of football by encouraging legal, accessible ways to watch games.",
