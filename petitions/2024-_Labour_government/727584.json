Many Skilled Workers are close to eligibility under the 5-year rule and have built their lives here. Families planned their futures, children's education, and finances expecting settlement and security. Changing the rules now creates stress, uncertainty, and disrupts long-term plans. It breaks trust in the system and threatens the stability we\u2019ve worked hard to achieve.",
