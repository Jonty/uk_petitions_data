        "additional_details": "We think the Government and Parliament must protect children\u2019s mental, emotional and physical wellbeing. We think the current system creates a culture of distrust and disrespect between teachers and students which we think extends to the wider families and communities. Children deserve to be treated with respect and dignity in all educational settings by teaching and non-teaching staff. They should not be fearful within the school system. We think individuality must be celebrated and encouraged. We believe that this review should seek to address attitudes towards children with SEN.",
        "background": "We think the Education system has become too focused on statistics, affecting many children\u2019s experiences in a detrimental mental, emotional and physical way and should be reviewed. We think the review should also consider how neurodivergent and children with SEN can achieve their potential.",
