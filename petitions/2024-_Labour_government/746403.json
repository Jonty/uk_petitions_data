        "additional_details": "Gurkhas have served Britain with courage and loyalty for over 200 years. Many have settled here with their families and contributed to UK society. We believe extending the ILR period to 10 years would cause hardship and break trust, and that the Government must honour its historic promise and keep the 5-year ILR route to ensure fairness, stability, and respect for those who have already sacrificed so much for this country..",
        "background": "We want the UK Government to keep the current 5-year Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) pathway, for ex-Gurkhas who left the armed forces post 1997, their spouses, and family members. Gurkhas have served Britain with loyalty and deserve fairness, stability, and respect for past commitments.",
