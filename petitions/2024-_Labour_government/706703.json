        "additional_details": "I believe that punishments in schools disproportionately target children with Special Educational Needs (SEN), intensifying their struggles. Isolation and similar practices exacerbate anxiety, depression, and feelings of exclusion, severely impacting mental health. I believe there is a need to replace harmful disciplinary measures with tailored support systems that nurture inclusion and emotional growth. It\u2019s imperative to protect SEN students' well-being and rights immediately.",
        "background": "I believe there is an urgent need to ban isolation in schools. I consider such practices harm vulnerable students, including autistic children, violating their rights and well-being and schools must adopt inclusive, supportive strategies to ensure a safe, nurturing environment for all children.",
