To secure our food security, maintain good animal husbandry and environmental standards. \r\nBritish farming families are usually asset rich but money poor. Farming is a way of life, this could be lost for many families who cannot pass on land to their children, who often work the land side by side with their parents, grandparents and even great grandparents. \r\nWe help feed the nation, it's time to help us!",
