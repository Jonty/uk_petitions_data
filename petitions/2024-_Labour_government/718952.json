        "additional_details": "We reject this rights-undermining bill that lays the foundation for a China-inspired digital totalitarian state & social credit system. \r\n\r\nIt threatens our basic human rights, letting the state watch our money, take our health records, and weaken privacy rules via mass surveillance, digital ID, arbitrary interference, & automated decision-making, undermining:\r\n\r\nRight to Privacy (12UDHR;8ECHR)\r\nRight to Freedom of Expression & Opinion (19UDHR;10ECHR)\r\nRight to Non-Discrimination (2UDHR;14ECHR)",
        "background": "This bill isn\u2019t about making things better\u2014it\u2019s about power. It could force us to use digital IDs, & let officials control our lives without our say. Passed quietly through the unelected Lords & rushed in Commons, it must be halted. We demand open debate & our right to privacy. Stop this bill now.",
