        "additional_details": "Violence and sexual assault are growing concerns, particularly for women and vulnerable groups. Teaching self-defence in schools empowers young people, increases confidence, and promotes safety awareness from an early age. Paid time off ensures that adults, especially women, can maintain personal safety skills. We think regulated access to non-lethal self-defence tools allows responsible adults to protect themselves without increasing harm to others.",

Legalise regulated non-lethal self-defence tools for adults with licensing and training, such as pepper spray.",
