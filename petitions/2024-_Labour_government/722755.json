        "additional_details": "Currently, the law is that you can re-register a birth under certain circumstances:\r\n-the natural father\u2019s details were not entered at the time of the original birth registration\r\n-the child\u2019s parents have married after the original birth registration. \r\n \r\nWe believe there should be more options for birth re-registrations than what is available at present. We believe there may be reasons why a parent might want to remove another parent from a birth certificate, such as but not limited to abusive relationships, neglect, and long term absent parents.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to amend current birth re-registration rules to create a right to remove a parent from a child\u2019s birth certificate, for example in circumstances such as abusive relationships, neglect, and long term absent parents.",
