        "additional_details": "We believe a Land Value Tax, based on the unimproved value of land rather than property or income, may offer a fairer, more efficient, and sustainable way to generate public revenue. Unlike property taxes, which we think penalize homeowners for improving their properties, a LVT could incentivize the productive use of land while potentially discouraging land speculation and underutilization.",

We believe this could reduce the tax burden on people's work on their property.",
