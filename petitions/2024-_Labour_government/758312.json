        "action": "Stop The Under 16s Social Media Ban",
        "additional_details": "Social media helps millions of teens stay connected, not only with friends, but also keeps them updated on news, politics and much more. A blanket ban is not only unnecessary, but very unfair to people who have grown up in the digital age. Also, this is a huge cybersecurity risk, as this doesn\u2019t just affect children, EVERYONE will have to \u201cprove their age\u201d whether it be ID or face scans. This undermines online privacy, and creates security risks that could be undermined by bad actors.",
        "background": "Banning social media for under-16s would be unfair and ineffective for the digital world, as because it ignores the real benefits these platforms provide and opens security and privacy risks.",
