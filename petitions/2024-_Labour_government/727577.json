Immigrants on existing visas have paid substantial sums of money in visa application fees and NHS subcharges, as well as made significant life-changing decisions to migrate here, with the original 5-year path to ILR in mind. If the UK government fails to preserve these terms they agreed to, then this is a retrospective application of the law, which is unfair, exploitative and essentially a rug-pull and cash-grab of people in an already difficult situation.",
        "background": "The UK government plans to extend the wait time for eligibility for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) from 5 years to 10 years. Please ensure that immigrants on existing visas remain subject to the original 5-year path to ILR; the terms they accepted, when they paid their visa fees and NHS subcharge.",
