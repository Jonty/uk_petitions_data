        "additional_details": "As a resident in Coventry, it is not right  that an elected Labour MP was elected to represent the Labour Party and her constituency. She then resigns from the Labour Party and starts her own party. The Government should make it law that any sitting MP who defects to another party to the one that they were elected to, should immediately call a local bye- election. This way they get the support to represent their new party if the local residents decide that this is what they want.",
        "background": "Any MP is elected to represent a particular party. If they swap sides during their time as a MP it should be law that they immediately call a local election. People vote for the party and not the MP who represents them.",
