We believe that some cyclists are being irresponsible on the roads and can cause serious harm to themselves, pedestrians and even cars. We have seen people on their bicycles steering with one hand and looking down on their phone. The government spent a fortune on cycle lanes, but some are still using pavements. Helmets and reflective gear should be mandatory, and cycles should have registration numbers.",
