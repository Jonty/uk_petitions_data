        "action": "Ban UK Financial Services from Outsourcing Tech Jobs to Protect British Workers",
        "additional_details": "UK financial firms like Lloyds, NatWest, Nationwide, and Barclays are outsourcing tech jobs to India, despite no products there, cutting UK roles, tax rev, and forcing young talent abroad. Lloyds alone plans 6,000 hires in India by 2026. A ban and punitive taxes will halt offshoring, protect British workers, and retain skills. Taxpayer-saved firms must prioritise British prosperity over cheap labour to ensure economic growth, fairness, and loyalty to the UK public who supported them in crises.",
        "background": "Ban UK financial services from outsourcing tech jobs abroad. Impose punitive taxes on firms like Lloyds, NatWest, Nationwide, and Barclays that offshore roles to India. Mandate hiring UK tech talent and fund training to secure local jobs, boost tax revenue, and strengthen the British economy.",
