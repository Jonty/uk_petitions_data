        "additional_details": "Nursing students are vital to the NHS, yet many are being pushed to the brink. They\u2019re expected to do over 2,300 hours of placements across their course, the same as working full-time for more than a year, with no pay. Many are struggling to afford basic living costs, relying on foodbanks or dropping out altogether. This means, most can\u2019t take on extra paid work. They miss out on key parts of student life; the chance to rest, socialise, or build soft skills through sport, volunteering, or societies. This isn\u2019t just unfair, it\u2019s unsustainable. Everyone deserves fair pay for real work.",
        "background": "Nursing students should be paid for the work they do on placement. Student nurses spend thousands of hours delivering frontline care in hospitals, clinics, and communities. They face costs like travel, parking, uniforms, and meals, while paying tuition fees. Placements are work. They deserve pay.",
