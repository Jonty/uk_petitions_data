        "action": "Make property sales in England & Wales legally binding earlier, like in Scotland",
        "additional_details": "In England and Wales, a home sale isn\u2019t legally binding until exchange of contracts, which can happen months after an offer is accepted. This leads to frequent fall-throughs, gazumping, wasted legal fees.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, once missives are concluded, typically after mortgage approval and survey, the agreement becomes legally binding, offering certainty and protection for both sides.\r\n\r\nThis approach would:\r\n\r\n- Reduce collapsed chains\r\n\r\n- Prevent gazumping\r\n\r\n- Protect buyers & sellers from financial loss",
        "background": "The UK Government should reform conveyancing laws in England and Wales to mirror the Scottish system, where property sales become legally binding much earlier. This would reduce stress, financial risk, and delays for buyers and sellers.",
