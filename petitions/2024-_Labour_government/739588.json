        "additional_details": "We feel there are disparities in the scale of fraud and sentencing. We believe too many criminals are given suspended sentences, including repeat offenders. We believe this undermines people in genuine need and alienates the taxpayers in supporting welfare. We believe the welfare budget is out of control with no deterrent to fraud. We believe there must be a deterrent to demotivate offenders and encourage them to find work to improve their lives, not steal from the taxpayer.",

Bans any further benefit claims for offenders for 5 years.\r\n3. Removes criminals\u2019 passports who travelled abroad with stolen money for 10 years.\r\n",
