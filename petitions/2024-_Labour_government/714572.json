        "additional_details": "We think the currently guidelines for Schools or Hospitals to treat or manage ARFID are poor. Children could lose their lives to malnutrition when they could have been peg fed before deterioration got worse. Eating issues may be blamed on the disability / cognitive disorder (fussy Eating) and not treated as a separate medical condition. I have started this petition in Memory of Alfie who sadly passed away at aged 7.",
        "background": "We think how children with ASD are assessed for Eating Disorders such as Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) should be reviewed. We think the review should consider how weight loss is monitored and the guidelines followed in Schools & Hospitals, to identify issues beyond fussy eating.",
