        "additional_details": "Spouse visa holders are uniquely positioned within the immigration system. They are joining their British or settled partners to build a family life in the UK\u2014a right protected under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Imposing a mandatory contributions requirement on this group risks creating unnecessary hardship for families, particularly those facing barriers to employment, childcare responsibilities, disability, or fluctuating income.",

Ensure the Earned Settlement Model supports, rather than penalises, families who are legally and legitimately making their lives in the UK.\r\nProtect family unity and fairness.",
