        "action": "PROTECT CHILDHOOD AGAIN Stop the exploitation & abuse of children for adult gain",
        "additional_details": "By condoning the daily exploitation of every part of their childhood for adult gain we robbed generations of children of the safety & innocence vital to thrive. It\u2019s the greatest political & institutional failure of 100 years & can no longer be swept under the carpet. We demand a Covenant for Childhood embedded-in-law to protect our children, prosecute every predator & hold to account all in authority who fail them. Thousands upon thousands of children will be harmed each hour that we do not act",
        "background": "We must urgently address HOW over 30 years the State could allow our country to become this place where it is acceptable for individuals & organisations to exploit, abuse, harm & fail our children rather than to protect them. And then abandon them to face the inevitable, terrible consequences alone",
