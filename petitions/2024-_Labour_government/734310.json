        "additional_details": "Many social workers live far from work due to housing costs or a lack of car access. Rail fares can exceed \u00a3250 per month as they travel to support vulnerable people. We believe this railcard could reduce financial pressure, improve morale and wellbeing, recognise social workers\u2019 frontline contributions, reduce car dependency, and align with the UK\u2019s sustainability goals. We believe this is a fair and affordable way to value social workers who are vital to supporting society\u2019s most vulnerable.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to fund a special national railcard for social workers to provide discounted rail travel. We believe it could mirror existing railcards for young people, veterans and seniors. We believe it could reduce commuting costs, support retention and encourage public transport use.",
