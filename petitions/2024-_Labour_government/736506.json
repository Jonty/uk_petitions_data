        "additional_details": "Hotels should be forced to decide if they are adult only (18+) or family friendly. Banning sexual activity in non-adult only hotels will get rid of a lot of issue that come with it, like drunk and disorderly guests, drugs and prostitution. It will also make hotels safe for children and families as well as people with certain religious beliefs who don\u2019t want to encounter this type of behaviour in a place of rest. In adult only hotels the rules will be down to the hotels discretion.",
        "background": "With the recent age restrictions on porn and other graphic content online in order to protect children, I think we should also go to lengths in the real world as well. In the UK staying in most hotels is not family friendly unless it very upper class due to he constant profanities going on.",
