Our police and politicians must do better but while they act, people need options to protect themselves. Pepper spray is a non lethal tool that could give a victim crucial seconds to escape and seek help. I'm calling on our representatives to put this on the Parliamentary agenda for a proper, evidence-based discussion about public safety and responsible self defence.",
