        "additional_details": "At least one third of care-leavers are reported to experience homelessness within the first two years of leaving care. We feel that this is why we need to take a stand. We are concerned that many people are leaving the care system and being left in the dark about the outside world, making it hard to get a job and earn money, which can lead to homelessness. We believe more needs to be done and the government needs to ensure they are provided with a clear pathway plan and support if needed.",
        "background": "We think the government needs to review and increase support measures currently in place for care leavers. Many of these young people do not have any family and have had little experience, which can make them vulnerable to things like criminal gangs and homelessness.",
