        "action": "Reduce the school week to 4 days.",
        "additional_details": "I have chosen to speak up about this as on average people spend approximately between 6 and 7 hours a day at work and school which is already to much as if you step back from the situation you will see that  many will come home only to be swarmed with more homework meaning that's more home time spent working. Then it come to the weekend and you're already exhausted from the week spent at work however you're forced to keep working and working. Therefore making the school week reduced would give people a time to relax and rewind thoroughly.",
        "background": "I would like my statement of reducing the school week of 5 days to 4 days a week making the weekend increase from 2 days to 3 to be discussed in parliament.",
