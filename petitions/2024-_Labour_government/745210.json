        "additional_details": "Too many people are feeling that their British way of life is badly threatened, in ways that were not declared during the General Election.\r\nIt is hard to understand, in what is intended to be a democracy, that just a few people, elected on a third of the vote, can have such an inviolable hold on power.\r\nA referendum is the most honest expression of democracy.",
        "background": "Considering it is very difficult to design a different kind of electoral system that pleases the majority of voters, we demand a law that uses a government petition (I suggest a million signatories) to precipitate a binding referendum on whether to have a fresh General Election.",
