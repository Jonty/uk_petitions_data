        "action": "Ban AI in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is actively destroying our planet, using massive energy and water consumption for training models in Data Centers, increasing carbon footprints, reliance on fossil fuels, intensive hardware manufacturing (mining rare minerals, e-waste), and exacerbating social inequalities through pollution in vulnerable communities, all while potentially hindering climate action through misinformation. Malicious use: People could intentionally harness powerful AIs to cause widespread harm. AI could be used to engineer new pandemics or for propaganda, censorship, and surveillance, or released to autonomously pursue harmful goals.",
