        "additional_details": "We want these rates to be reviewed by HMRC so they are up to date with the current cost of living. If a flight is delayed by an hour this can mean dropping from the 24 hour payment down to the 10 hour payment so essentially working 12 hours without a payment, this is a common occurrence in air travel, hence crew being penalised for something out of their control. We believe the scale rates need to provide a wider range of rates and time blocks so that if you fall between rates you are not penalised.",
        "background": "HMRC sets scale rate expenses for subsistence paid to employees who travel outside the UK, such as Cabin Crew. We feel the rates are not reflective or the real costs for people whose work takes them abroad, and that the way they are put into blocks of 5/10 or 24 hour blocks is completely unfair.",
