        "additional_details": "Recent changes have made it harder than ever to travel by train. Charlbury & Hanborough station car parks fill up early, nearby stations have few stopping trains, and new parking restrictions mean there\u2019s nowhere else to park. With almost no bus services, many are left without options.\r\n\r\nWe need urgent action! Sign to demand better parking, more train stops, and improved bus links.",
        "background": "expand parking at Charlbury and Hanborough stations, increase train frequency at smaller stations like Ascott-under-Wychwood, review restrictive parking policies in Charlbury, and improve bus services to and from local stations to ensure better public transport access.",
