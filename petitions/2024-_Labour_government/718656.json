        "additional_details": "We consider a centralised microchip and DNA database essential to raising breeding standards, identifying and tracking hereditary diseases, and ensuring better care and welfare for all dogs.  \r\n \r\nPublic support has emerged for \"Maggie's Law,\" which calls for the creation of such a database. Without mandatory tracking, DNA testing, and health checks, hereditary conditions and psychological distress in dogs are likely to continue. We believe the increasing levels of unregulated breeding highlight the urgent need for this database to support enforcement, strengthen legislation, and promote responsible ownership and welfare for breeding dogs, regardless of their licensing status.",
