        "additional_details": "Current UK cannabis laws force medical firms to irradiate crops and use poor growing methods, harming quality and patients. Restrictive regulations create a framework which in term is leading to a medical firm monopoly, stifling legal companies and fueling a new black market. Full legalization by 2025 will enable safe, high-quality cannabis production, open opportunities for all businesses, and reduce illegal trade, fostering a united, thriving UK community with economic and social benefits.",
        "background": "Legalise cannabis fully by 2025 for medicinal & recreational use, including growing, production, sale & adult use (18+). Regulate for safety, taxes, reduced crime & medical relief. Unlike decriminalisation, legalisation ensures quality & revenue. Act now for a safer, united UK.",
