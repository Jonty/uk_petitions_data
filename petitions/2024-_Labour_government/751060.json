        "additional_details": "Many young people particularly in rural areas- have little access to public transport and private cars are their only means of getting around efficiently. Reducing fuel duty could help them get around, allowing them to access more jobs and recreational activities cheaply. Bus fares can mean that driving is often cheaper. More young people in work could drive consumption, raise income tax and national insurance tax revenue, and increase economic growth.",
