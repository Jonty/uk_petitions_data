It is estimated that around 3 women a week die by suicide as a result of domestic abuse.\r\n \r\nBy making the information public, we think it could prevent many women and children having to endure the pain of domestic abuse, as well as saving police time having to disclose under Clare's Law and reduce domestic abuse related incidents and call outs.",
