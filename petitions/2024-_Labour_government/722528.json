        "additional_details": "These cuts will harm:\r\n\r\n\u27a1\ufe0f People with mental health conditions \u2013 Losing PIP means losing access to therapy, medication, and support, leading to higher suicide rates.\r\n\u27a1\ufe0f Disabled people \u2013 Many rely on PIP for independence and daily needs.\r\n\u27a1\ufe0f Veterans, the elderly, and the terminally ill \u2013 PIP provides essential care.\r\n\u27a1\ufe0f Carers and neurodivergent individuals \u2013 Families will be left in crisis.\r\n\r\nForcing people into hospitals will only raise costs. We must stop this.",
        "background": "The UK plans to cut PIP for 1 million disabled people, especially those with mental health conditions, to save \u00a35 billion. This will increase suicide rates, force people into crisis, and raise NHS costs. Cutting PIP isn\u2019t an economic solution\u2014it\u2019s an attack on disabled lives.",
