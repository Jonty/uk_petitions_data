        "action": "Develop government guidance encouraging councils to fly Pride & equality flags",
        "additional_details": "Some councils have banned the flying of certain flags, limiting displays to national and council flags. We believe such actions risk marginalising LGBTQ+ people and women. We believe there is increasing hostility, misogyny, and pressure on minority groups. National guidance could help ensure councils are free to show visible support for inclusion, equality, and the spirit of the Equality Act 2010.",
        "background": "We want Government to develop national guidance encouraging councils to fly inclusive flags, such as Pride, Trans, and Women\u2019s Rights flags, during awareness events. We believe these flags show solidarity and support for marginalised groups and should be welcomed in public spaces.",
