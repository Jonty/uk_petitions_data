        "action": "Introduce a yearly \"Election Referendum\" to trigger early elections if required.",
        "additional_details": "The five-year term leaves citizens powerless to address dissatisfaction with the government, leading to discontent and loss of trust. A yearly \"Election Referendum\" empowers the public to demand change if leadership fails. It ensures alignment with public interests, offering a direct, secure, and accessible way to hold governments accountable. This system removes frustration, fosters engagement, encourages transparency, and ensures leadership remains responsive to the people's needs.",
        "background": "We propose a yearly online \"Election Referendum\" to let the public decide if the government should continue or trigger an early election. Secure voting, verified via NI number and email, would prevent fraud, cost taxpayers nothing, and ensure accountability, transparency, and responsiveness.",
