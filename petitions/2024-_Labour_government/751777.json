        "additional_details": "We believe that many households cannot install EV chargers because they have no driveway and that councils often block cross-pavement solutions. We think allowing safe, discreet charging gullies would make EV ownership accessible to more people, encourage the switch to electric vehicles, support the UK\u2019s climate goals, and ensure pavements remain safe and usable. I urge the Government to update planning rules to require councils to permit this.",
        "background": "Require local councils to allow residents without driveways to install safe cross-pavement EV charging gullies. We think this would support EV adoption, reduce barriers, and help the UK meet climate targets while keeping pavements safe and accessible.",
