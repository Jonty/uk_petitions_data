        "action": "Include Tier 2 visa holders in the 30 hours/15 hours funded childcare scheme",
        "additional_details": "This exclusion is unfair and discriminatory, as the 30 hours of funded childcare is not a welfare benefit like Universal Credit or Housing Benefit. It is a targeted support measure for working families to help with childcare costs and support early years education, regardless of their background. Denying Tier 2 visa holders access to this support contradicts the very aim of the policy: to enable working parents to maintain employment and achieve a healthy work-life balance.",
        "background": "Tier 2 visa holders are skilled professionals who contribute significantly to the UK economy. They are actively employed, pay taxes\u2014including National Insurance and Income Tax\u2014and often work in essential sectors such as healthcare, engineering, IT, and education.",
