        "additional_details": "The waiting lists in England have become so horrendous for adults. It is reported that there are over 212,000 people waiting for an autism assessment in England as of February 2025, and some patients are facing waits of several years for both ADD and Autism diagnoses under the NHS. The waiting list for an ADD assessment for adults is extremely large, with estimates suggesting up to 549,000 people in England alone were awaiting an assessment as of March 2025",
        "background": "The Government should seek to improve the waiting times for people who are currently on the NHS waiting list for either Autism or ADHD. It has gotten so out of hand with how many people are waiting.",
