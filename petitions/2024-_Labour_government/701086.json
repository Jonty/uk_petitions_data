Evidence shows many reasons to legalise. In the UK, more harmful products like tobacco and alcohol are legal, so why keep cannabis illegal? It\u2019s time for the UK to take a progressive step forward. Legalisation would boost the economy, improve public safety, and reflect the will of the people.",
