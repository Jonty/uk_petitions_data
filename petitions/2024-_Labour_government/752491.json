The \u201cPudding Rule\u201d would require clear, measurable, time-specific commitments, independently monitored with public reports. If a government fails a legislated threshold, an early general election would be triggered, ensuring accountability and restoring trust.",
        "background": "Require parties to publish time-bound manifesto commitments (6-month, 1-year, full term), grouped by policy area and independently monitored. Parliament should legislate a mechanism triggering an early election if a government fails a defined threshold of key commitments.",
