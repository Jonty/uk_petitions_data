        "additional_details": "Because right now a motorist is against massive road taxes and massive maintenance costs and massive insurances and clean air zone costs and parking costs.\r\nWhile the tax can be regulated by government, and the rest are up to the driver, the insurances are outrageous. No claim bonus does not make any change when the insurances increase price exponentially! This can boost more car sales and more road tax income for government and also at bringing individual responsibility as now there s a reward.",
        "background": "Insurances to pay back 50% or negotiable % above 30% and less than 50% in the cases no claim raised at the duration of the insurance. This will be a reward and a good motivation for drivers to drive more sensible and insurances to be regulated to reasonable prices.",
