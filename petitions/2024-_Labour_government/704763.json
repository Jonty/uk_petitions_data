        "additional_details": "The parent bays provide the much needed space to get a child in and out of the car seat. Often, these spaces are misused by others without children with them because they are closer to the shop doors (usually next to disabled bays). When these spaces are misused, it makes it very difficult to safely manoeuvre a young child (under 5yrs) out of the car seat and into a pushchair/carrier. I also propose a minimum of 8 of these parking spaces on well used car parks.",
        "background": "In order to prevent the misuse of parent/child parking bays by those without a child who uses a car seat, I propose issuing \u2018green badges\u2019 to parents/guardians until the youngest child is 5yrs old in much the same way as disabled blue badges work.",
