        "additional_details": "Psilocybin mushrooms are one of the safest psychoactive substances, with low toxicity and no physical addiction risk. Research shows their potential to treat PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Legalising them for recreational use under regulation would promote mental health, reduce stigma, and create economic opportunities, aligning the UK with progressive drug policies in other countries.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to reclassify psilocybin mushrooms, removing them from Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. Legalisation would allow regulated recreational use and expand research into their proven benefits for mental health conditions like PTSD, depression, and anxiety.",
