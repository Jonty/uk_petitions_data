I think the mantra used in schools of \u20181-mark-a-minute\u2019 signifies the narrow allocated time students are funnelled through.\r\n\r\nDepth and breadth of A-Level content is wide.\r\n\r\nI think people who possess the knowledge of the syllabus are hindered, not given the chance to put it on paper.",
