        "additional_details": "Our world is changing faster than ever, yet schools are still teaching outdated material. Students need more than facts\u2014they need skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, digital literacy, and adaptability to thrive in the future. If education doesn\u2019t evolve, students will be unprepared for the challenges of tomorrow. It\u2019s time to modernize the curriculum and equip young people with the tools they need to succeed in a rapidly developing world.",
        "background": "Rework how the school system works to accommodate the fact that many students learn differently. Right now the system can have a severe impact on mental health ( Standardized testing contributes a lot) and doesn\u2019t even teach students relevant skills such as financial knowledge.",
