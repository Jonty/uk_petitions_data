        "additional_details": "Expanded polypropylene is sometimes marketed as an eco-friendly alternative to the banned expanded polystyrene. It is not green and it's not eco-friendly. It is used primarily for food on the go so can end up as litter or in general waste litter bins and not recycled. Expanded polypropylene (EPP) is not commonly recycled by most local authorities and it will end up in landfill or EFW. There are far more sustainable alternatives such as plant based packaging.",
        "background": "In October 2023 the government banned expanded polystyrene cups and take away food boxes. Some manufacturers have now started using expanded polypropylene boxes.",
