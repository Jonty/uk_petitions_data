However the children and teenagers of westbury don\u2019t resort to that. But instead play outside. Everyday you see them out with smiling faces, but the village lacks in fulfilling them and is letting our children out. It\u2019s in the middle of nowhere and everything is a car journey away, however some parents work so can\u2019t always take the kids out. We are just asking for a better park for our children",

The crime and drug problem here doesn\u2019t exist, and I believe in that to keep going. I want our children to play outside and expiernce life for what it is.",
