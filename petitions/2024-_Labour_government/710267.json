We think this will encourage developers to build homes in areas with real employment opportunities, catering to genuine housing needs.\r\n \r\nIn our view, new housing quotas are meant to deliver homes for local communities, not for speculative investment or seasonal use. We believe our proposal will help protect our environment for future generations.",
