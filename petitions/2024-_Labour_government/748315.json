        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to ban full-face coverings at public protests and counter-protests. Masks and balaclavas prevent identification, encourage intimidation, and undermine public safety. Recent Tower Hamlets footage shows organisers selling balaclavas and urging \u201cno face, no case,\u201d raising serious local concerns and creating fear and anxiety among residents. Exemptions should apply only for medical or verified occupational reasons.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to ban all full-face coverings\u2014balaclavas, ski masks, or anything that fully hides a person\u2019s face\u2014during protests or counter-protests. Only medical or work exemptions should apply. This ensures police can identify individuals, prevents intimidation, and keeps protests safe.",
