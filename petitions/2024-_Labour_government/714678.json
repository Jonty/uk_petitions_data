Without this scheme in place some of the most vulnerable people in society will be faced with losing their jobs through no fault of their own. The government should strive to ensure that disabled people currently in employment remain employed. The scheme has been closed to new participants since 2006 so the costs for the government will decline in future when existing participants leave the scheme",
