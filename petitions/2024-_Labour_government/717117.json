When confronted with the loss of a life partner, these individuals may be left fending against massive inheritance tax liabilities of 40%\r\n \r\nWe think this disparity in treatment is not only unjust but severely outdated. In the UK, research suggests around 3.6 million people cohabit, many with families. We seek equality in treatment under inheritance tax laws, allowing us to continue providing a stable environment for our families in times of grievous loss.",
