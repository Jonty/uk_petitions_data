        "action": "Make Misogyny a hate crime",
        "additional_details": "Young women, especially students, face high rates of harassment, assault, and online abuse. Misogyny fuels this violence, yet current laws fail to address it directly. Recognising misogyny as a hate crime would protect victims, deter offenders, and send a clear message that gender-based hostility is unacceptable. It would also validate survivors\u2019 experiences and help create safer environments in education and online, where young people are most vulnerable.",
        "background": "The Government should make misogyny a hate crime by amending the Sentencing Act, introduce tougher laws for online abuse, train police and prosecutors, funding support for survivors in education, and tackle anti-feminist hate groups that target and radicalise young people online.",
