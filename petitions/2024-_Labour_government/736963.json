I think that instead of womens and mens rooms, have separate cubicles that do not have a sign for a certain gender to enter them. By this I mean one individual cubicle that everyone can feel happy and safe in without judgement to how they identify.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to install cubicle toilets that are rooms itself with the toilet, sink and a hand dryer or paper towels that are gender neutral so anyone can go in them, no matter their sexual orientation.",
