        "additional_details": "Reports have indicated that some non-UK platforms allow unsafe, unregulated products to be sold in the UK, potentially putting consumers at risk. We believe they also enable mass copyright theft, potentially harming small businesses and artists. We think current enforcement is weak, allowing resellers to profit from stolen designs, and feel that stronger laws will help protect UK consumers and businesses.",
        "background": "Introduce laws requiring overseas e-commerce platforms selling to UK consumers to meet all UK safety standards, remove unsafe or copyright-infringing products quickly and face penalties for non-compliance. Strengthen enforcement of such laws to help protect consumers, small businesses and creators.",
