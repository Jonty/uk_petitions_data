        "additional_details": "It is only fair and right that, if most of the country votes to have a General Election, that a vote is held on re-joining the EU.\r\n\r\nIf Labour will not allow this, we have to use this potential opportunity in order to have our say on the UK's future and inform the public on the overwhelming benefits of re-joining a strong trading bloc, especially with the threat of war with Russia and Donald Trump becoming the next President of the USA.\r\n\r\nFair is fair and we will not be silenced.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, support holding an immediate General Election in the UK on the understanding that a vote is held on re-joining the EU regardless of which party wins.\r\n\r\nIf over two million people wish to have a General Election, those of us who back Remain should be heard as well.",
