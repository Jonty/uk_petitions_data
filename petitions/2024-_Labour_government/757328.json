We seek a foreign policy grounded in diplomacy and peace-building, rather than what can be costly and divisive military actions, that may have limited long-term success.\r\n\r\nThe financial burden of war is significant. The UK\u2019s involvement in wars and military operations over the last two decades has cost billions of pounds.",
