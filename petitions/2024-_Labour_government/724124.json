        "additional_details": "This leads them to end up having overworked/fewer teachers, bigger class sizes, and a lack of basic resources. This is highly unfair. I believe every student should have the same opportunities to succeed, no matter where they go to school. Education should be a priority to the government; if the government doesn\u2019t invest in schools properly, it\u2019s students like me who will suffer. I hope to receive enough signatures to gain the Government's attention so they can improve the funding for schools.",
        "background": "As a student who has seen the state of some primary schools, secondaries and even sixth forms, I desire a change in the UK's education by improving the school funding for it. Unfortunately there are many schools with insufficient school funding.",
