Nothing has changed to justify reversing this decision\u2014if anything, Lord Sumption accurately pointed out HK courts are weaponising Western judges to squash dissents while pretending the system still operates normally. Reinstating extradition would legitimise oppression, create Orwellian fear among HKers living in UK, and open the floodgate to China-initiated, politically motivated arrests.",
