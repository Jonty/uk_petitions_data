        "additional_details": "We are concerned about incidents in the past, including starting fires in cemeteries as well as people trashing or destroying graves. As many cemeteries do not have CCTV, we think it is unlikely the perpetrators will be caught. We believe it should be mandatory that CCTV is provided to protect the resting places of those that have passed. We believe the people that do this need to be punished for these disrespectful actions.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to pass a law which provides security measures and requires the instalment of CCTVs in all cemeteries, so those who cause damage or commit crimes can be held accountable.",
