It is unfair that couples who never work or pay into the system are not penalised in the same way, and move seamlessly from welfare benefits to state pension.  Most other countries allow an individual whose partner works, to claim for around 2 years.  People affected by this draconian rule are at the mercy of their partners to provide them with an income and this needs to stop.",
        "background": "Since 1996 working couples, despite being taxed as individuals, are only entitled to 6 months of benefits if one of them loses their employment, and have to work for a further 2 years to be eligible again.  They must rely on their partner to support them after that time.",
