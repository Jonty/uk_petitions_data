        "action": "Require the Union Flag to be flown year-round from all official buildings",
        "additional_details": "The Government should make it a legal requirement for the Union Flag to be flown from all public buildings in the UK, including local authority premises, every day of the year where possible.\r\n\r\nThe Union Flag is a national symbol representing our shared history, values, and unity. Current Government guidance from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport requires it on UK Government buildings but does not compel local councils to follow suit. This has led to removals, such as by Birmingham City Council, which weaken civic pride and national identity.",
        "background": "We call on Parliament to extend the DCMS flag flying guidance to all local authorities by law, and to protect the Union Flag from removal except for maintenance, replacement, or emergencies.",
