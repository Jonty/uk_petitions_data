        "action": "Prohibit the wearing of all full-face coverings in public spaces",
        "additional_details": "We believe face coverings hinder social cohesion, alienate communities and discourage integration. We believe they undermine British values of openness and interaction while also posing security risks. Current policies allow exemptions for some while restricting others, which may foster resentment. Also, we think they disproportionately impact women, limiting their visibility and participation in public life. We feel a clear, fair policy could enhance safety, equality and unity.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to prohibit full-face coverings in public, including niqabs, burqas, balaclavas and ski masks, to strengthen social cohesion, preserve cultural values, enhance security and promote gender equality. We believe this will ensure fairness, safety and a more unified Britain.",
