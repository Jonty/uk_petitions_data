        "additional_details": "We think tax promises must be legally binding contracts and that any broken fiscal pledges and stealth taxes (frozen thresholds) destroy economic stability. This uncertainty can force businesses to delay investment, hinder job creation, and reduce the take-home pay of working families. We believe our proposed Act provides certainty for businesses and stability for workers, restoring the essential integrity of the democratic mandate and making it more difficult for governments to unilaterally change core tax policy.",

This must require a two-thirds majority in the House of Commons for rises in Income Tax, NI, VAT, and Corporation Tax not in a government's manifesto, and an Anti-Fiscal Drag Clause to mandate threshold uprating with inflation.",
