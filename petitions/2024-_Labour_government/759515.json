        "additional_details": "Recent debates discussing a potential Parliamentary ban on Under 16's being banned from social media is the wrong age range. As a current 16 year old I belive it would be more beneficial for them to ban all Under 13s from social media and for all apps to have face id to verify that children are not using there guardians birthdays or IDs. I believe no child ages 13 and Under need social media and all they would need is apps like WhatsApp and YouTube inorder to communicate.",
        "background": ". Make sure all Under 13s only have access to media like YouTube and WhatsApp so they are still able to communicate and watch entertainment.\r\n. All short form content to be banned for Under 13s as it designed to shorten attention spans.\r\n. All Social Media apps required to have facial recognition.",
