        "additional_details": "Knife crime in the uk has soared through the roof. It\u2019s horrible to be scared to let children out any more because you\u2019re scared of what might happen. It\u2019s daily now that a child and young adult is reported stabbed by another child or young adult. \r\nI want the system to educate the children officially on what the impacts it has on families and communities and that it isn\u2019t worth it in the slightest. That they will ruin their lives as well as others.",
        "background": "To show all teenagers in secondary schools the UK the true impact of carrying a knife and using one. Show them the devastating reality of what it can do to somebody\u2019s life and their own life and the repercussions that follows. Have it put into a form of their education plan (I.e form time).",
