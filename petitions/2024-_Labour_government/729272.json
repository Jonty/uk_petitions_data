        "additional_details": "I believe always displaying the Coat of Arms on Government Lecterns for speeches and statements could better assert the authority of the Government. I believe this is particularly important for how the United Kingdom is portrayed overseas. I consider that many other countries are much more assertive in how they present themselves and believe the Government Coat of Arms should always be displayed on Government lecterns.",

I believe the Government should ensure its Coat of Arms is always displayed on Government lecterns to show the Government\u2019s authority.",
