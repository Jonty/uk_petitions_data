        "additional_details": "We are a group of 60 migrants, mostly on the 10 year route to settlement. Every 30 months we renew our visas, for one adult this costs \u00a31258 per visa. Every year we pay the IHS to access the NHS. This costs \u00a31035 per adult, and \u00a3776 per child. Our families are living in poverty and are at risk. These costs have made life in the UK unbearable and not everyone is eligible for a fee waiver. We ask the government to equalise access to the NHS, and to treat everyone in the UK with dignity.",
        "background": "Stop charging migrants to use the NHS, and remove the Immigration Health Surcharge. Until such time as that can be achieved:\r\n\r\nRemove the IHS for people that are working. Remove the IHS for people after their first application for leave to remain. Reduce the 10 year route to settlement to 5 years.",
