        "additional_details": "Compared to the recent change in law where venue ticket companies were charging extremely high amounts for re-sale tickets due to supply and demand, this was found as unfair business and should be the same for the cost of holidays to families, especially those adults working within the education sector. \r\nA lot more families would holiday in or outside of the UK if the costs were kept the same, or capped. Thus resulting in higher spending to benefit the country and others.",
        "background": "Cap or remove the increase of holiday costs during school holiday term time. Holiday companies are abusing the matter of supply and demand, knowing children/ families can only go on holiday during holiday term time, or they will incur fines or legal charges.",
