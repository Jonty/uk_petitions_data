Amid the French government\u2019s collapse, bringing the UK\u2019s large economy closer to the EU could play as a large bargaining chip to secure a good deal during this political turmoil inside the EU.",
        "background": "In 2016, the UK voted to leave the EU by a very slim margin (51% to 49%). Given this, a soft Brexit would better reflect national views, yet we got a hard Brexit. Could the government pursue joining these to give the whole of the UK the fair deal it deserves.",
