        "additional_details": "Democracy fails when lawmakers profit from the industries they regulate. It's not enough to \"declare\" interests - conflicts still corrupt decisions and fuel public distrust. Whether arms, oil, pharma or tech, private profit skews choices about our safety, health and planet.\r\n\r\nTo restore trust and protect democracy, Parliament must ban these financial ties or require assets in blind trusts, with strict penalties and full accountability for any illegal actions.",
        "background": "Stop MPs and Lords from cashing in on the very industries they oversee. From arms to oil to big pharma and tech, politicians must divest or use blind trusts. No more hidden agendas -Parliament must put the public first and end financial conflicts of interest.",
