        "action": "Protect the Abraham Lincoln memorial in Manchester, relocate the migrant camp.",
        "additional_details": "Lincoln Square is a commemorative site centred on the Grade II listed Abraham Lincoln statue and inscriptions, linked to the 1862 address from Manchester working people and Lincoln\u2019s reply. An encampment around the monument risks damage, blocks access, and undermines the dignity of a public memorial. I want government to help council services move people on safely, with proper housing, sanitation, and outreach support.",
        "background": "Work with Manchester City Council to relocate the encampment from Lincoln Square, safeguard the Grade II listed Abraham Lincoln statue and plaques, and fund humane alternative accommodation and support for those affected. Relocate the migrant camp humanely; protect the memorial and plaques.",
