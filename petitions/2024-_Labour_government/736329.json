        "additional_details": "We think retailers increasingly inflate standard prices so only loyalty card holders get fair price, Having a loyalty card requires people to give up personal data, which in some cases may then be used for profiling and marketing. \r\n \r\nLow-income families may be hit hardest, as they can\u2019t afford inflated prices. We think this undermines privacy rights, it forces people to \"pay with their data\". We think the government should act to stop pricing that punishes those who value their privacy or can\u2019t afford to pay extra.\r\n",
