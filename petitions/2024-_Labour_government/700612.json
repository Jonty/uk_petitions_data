        "additional_details": "We would like Parliament to impose fines on corporations based on carbon emissions to combat climate change. Many large companies contribute significantly to greenhouse gases but lack incentives to adopt sustainable practices. Fines of 5-15% of their annual revenue will hold them accountable and encourage emission reductions. The revenue generated can be reinvested in renewable energy, public transport, and sustainability projects, promoting a healthier environment and economic growth.",
