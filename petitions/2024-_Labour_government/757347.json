        "action": "Not Ban Social Media for Under-16s",
        "additional_details": "Banning social media for under-16s ignores how central it is to modern life. Young people use it to communicate, learn, be creative and find support. A ban would push usage underground, remove guidance, and widen gaps for isolated teens. Teaching digital skills, enforcing safety rules, and involving parents is far more effective than restricting access altogether. It prepares teens for adulthood. It also encourages responsibility, resilience, and informed choices in an increasingly digital world",
        "background": "Banning social media for under-16s oversimplifies a complex issue. It cuts off connection, creativity and support, pushes use underground, and fails to teach safe digital habits. Education, safeguards and guidance work better than bans for young people today. This helps teens grow responsibly online",
