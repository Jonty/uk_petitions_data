        "additional_details": "We believe the term \u201cgrossly offensive\u201d is vague and subjective, giving the state excessive power to criminalise speech that is merely unpopular or provocative. This can undermine free expression, chill public debate, and can lead to inconsistent prosecutions. Harmful threats and harassment are already covered by more precise laws. Repealing and replacing this wording would, we believe, restore proper limits on state power while maintaining protections against genuine abuse.",

Replace it with clearer, narrowly defined legislation that seeks to protect the public from genuine harm while safeguarding freedom of expression.",
