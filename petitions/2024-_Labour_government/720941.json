        "action": "Amend the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill to protect parental rights.",
        "additional_details": "This bill erodes parents' inherent rights and duties by granting the government unprecedented authority over children's upbringing and education. International law affirms that parents hold the primary legal and moral responsibility for their children\u2019s upbringing. This Bill enforces compliance with directives that may conflict with deeply held beliefs, forcing many to uphold their convictions in defiance of state mandates, leading to widespread distress and a profound crisis of conscience.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to protect parents' fundamental right to educate their children in accordance with their beliefs and moral convictions, free from state interference. The Bill must be revised or withdrawn to prevent excessive government control over parental decision-making in education.",
