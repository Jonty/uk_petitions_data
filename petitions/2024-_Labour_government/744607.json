        "additional_details": "I want facilities like MBR acres to cease all their breeding programmes and for the United Kingdom to end testing on dogs. We are supposed to be a civilised nation, not one built on cruelty. We should aim to become a more ethical society, building a better place to live for our children. A nation that does not treat its animals fairly is not the kind of nation that the United Kingdom should be.",
        "background": "As a first step to end animal testing, it is crucial to implement an immediate ban on testing on dogs. The United Kingdom should be a leading voice in the decision to ban ALL inhumane testing in the civilised world. There are many ethical alternatives to animal testing.",
