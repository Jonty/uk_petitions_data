        "additional_details": "Current laws on sexual crimes often fail to deter offenders or reflect the lifelong harm caused to victims. Survivors, especially children, are left feeling unprotected and unheard. By strengthening sentencing and ending plea deals in child sexual offences, we can improve justice, protect the vulnerable and rebuild public trust in the legal system.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to toughen laws on sexual crimes, abolish plea deals in child sexual offences, strengthen sentencing, and ensure victims receive justice, protection and support throughout the legal process.",
