        "additional_details": "We feel they're unable to fully address trauma with therapists while an investigation is still ongoing.\r\n \r\nWe think survivors deserve the right to speak freely about their experiences, even as investigations are underway, and not risk having this used against them in the court of law. We believe the law fails to consider survivors' mental health and their emotional recovery, and that sharing stories is a crucial avenue for healing, that should not be used in the courtroom against women and girls.",
        "background": "We want the government to amend the law on disclosure to prohibit access to pre-trial therapy notes of sexual assault survivors. We think that for these survivors, usually women and girls, the justice system is appalling and extremely challenging to navigate and they face restrictive rules.",
