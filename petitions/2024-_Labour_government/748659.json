        "action": "Reinstate 40mph on Birmingham roads",
        "additional_details": "The Government should urgently reinstate the 40mph speed limit as the current lower limits are causing significant traffic congestion and longer journey times, impacting daily commuters and local businesses. These roads were designed for higher speeds, and reducing limits hasn\u2019t effectively improved safety, since most accidents result from human error rather than speed. Restoring 40mph would improve traffic flow, reduce delays, and enhance overall road efficiency.",
        "background": "The changes have led to longer journey times for the public. These roads were designed for higher speeds, and altering speed limits has not shown a clear effect on crash or fatality rates, as most incidents result from human error regardless of speed or vehicle type.",
