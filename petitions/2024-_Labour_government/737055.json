This places an unsustainable burden on housing, public services, and border security.\r\n\r\nWe believe the only effective deterrent is to ensure that anyone who enters/resides in the country illegally is detained and deported - a programme should be set for a five year deportation scheme to remove every illegal migrant.\r\n\r\nSecure detention, followed by mass deportations are urgently required.",
