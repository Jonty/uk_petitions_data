This can lead to stress & anxiety at a crucial point in education, potentially impacting on their ability to achieve.\r\n \r\nWe believe the system is flawed, and that these kids are discriminated against on the grounds of age.",

We think current arrangements can force independence on their 18th birthday, and that children born early in the academic year are disadvantaged & discriminated against compared to peers born later in the year.",
