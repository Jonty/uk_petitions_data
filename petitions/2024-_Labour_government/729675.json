        "additional_details": "We think the government must remove the age limit on funding Level 7 solicitor apprenticeships as it creates barriers for aspiring solicitors. We think age-based restrictions disproportionately affect parents returning to education, individuals prioritising work over study, and those from disadvantaged backgrounds, legal profession already struggles with diversity; this policy worsens it. We urge policymakers to reconsider and keep apprenticeships accessible to all.",

We believe these apprenticeships provide a vital, accessible path into law and this decision limits opportunities, especially for those relying on apprenticeships for social mobility.",
