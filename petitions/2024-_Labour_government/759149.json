        "additional_details": "We believe the government should do more about this by banning the use of generative AI due to the environmental impact, (eg, water wastage, electricity, pollution) and the impact this has on the people being used against, with these bots. (such as celebrities, innocent people, and those being exploited). The evidence we have, is that water is being used in millions of gallons every year to cool these machines, and this water CANNOT be recycled. We would like this issue to be addressed.",
        "background": "We would like for the government to ban the use of generative AI in the UK, due to the amount of people being cyber harassed and violated due to these AI bots. Bots are also capable to make inappropriate images of people, and post it online. Young people are mainly impacted due to this problem.",
