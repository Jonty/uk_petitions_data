        "additional_details": "My experience with endometriosis has been harrowing, but unfortunately this is typical for many sufferers in the UK.\r\n \r\nNobody wants a life changing diagnosis. Endometriosis is associated with fertility problems, chronic pain, and life-threatening complications. The news was broken to me by being handed a scrap of paper with the word \u201cadenomyosis?\u201d (spelt incorrectly) scrawled at the bottom. Even after diagnosis, the surgery and lack of aftercare I\u2019ve received has been traumatising.\r\n \r\nNobody should have to experience this. I feel that with increased education and awareness of endometriosis, other people might be spared the pain, indignity and trauma I have experienced.",
        "background": "We think every person with endometriosis is being failed.\r\nEndometriosis diagnosis can take 8-10 years not because it is a complex process, but because we feel we are ignored by every medical professional we encounter. Even when diagnosed, we feel professionals do not understand the condition.\r\n",
