        "action": "We demand a full and independent inquiry into grooming gangs",
        "additional_details": "For decades, victims of grooming gangs have suffered abuse, often without adequate support or justice. Concerns have been raised about systemic failures by local councils, police forces, and other institutions in protecting vulnerable individuals. An independent inquiry is essential to investigate these failings, hold perpetrators and negligent authorities accountable, and recommend robust measures to prevent such atrocities in the future. This inquiry will also provide victims with the recognition and justice they deserve",
        "background": "We urge the UK government to establish a full, independent inquiry into grooming gangs. This inquiry must ensure accountability for those responsible, address failures by authorities, and provide justice and support for victims.",
