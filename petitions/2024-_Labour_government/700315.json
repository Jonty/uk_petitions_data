In 2022 I helped the then government change the rules on fast track benefit applications replacing the 6 month definition of a terminal diagnosis with a new 12 month definition. We think this penalises those that live longer so having to wait for a long time for claims to be processed. \r\n\r\nTERMINAL MEANS TERMINAL\r\n",

We think this would give people financial stability at the end of life & remove the financial stress & worry.",
