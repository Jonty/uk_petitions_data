        "additional_details": "It should not be up to each council, but decided by the government. Council tax is used to pay for local services and repairs, like waste disposal, libraries and education, police and fire departments, transport and highways and so on.\r\nAlso, single people don't put the bin out each time there is a collection if not full.\r\nSingle people, widowed, etc should not have to pay a higher amount than other people. The reduction should be 50% as a min. It should be paid by every adult not every house.",
        "background": "It carries the assumption that 4 adults live in each house.\r\nEach person is a burden to services, (potholes, fire prevention, libraries, police, etc) not each household. Council tax should be per person not per house.",
