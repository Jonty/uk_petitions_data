        "additional_details": "Animal torture networks are operating in the UK, posting videos of kittens and cats being tortured and killed. Loopholes mean abusers often walk free. This content is spreading on social media. Over 70% of violent offenders start by abusing animals. Without tougher laws and real tech accountability, more animals and people will suffer. Urgent action will save lives and stop this evil at its source.",
        "background": "Create laws with strict jail sentences for animal torture. Force tech platforms to remove/report abuse videos. Ban abusers from adopting or owning animals. Set up a task force to investigate and prosecute those involved in animal torture networks, including online.",
