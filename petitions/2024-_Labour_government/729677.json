They were promised refuge and a better life, and because the Taliban has returned to power, their lives could be in serious danger. \r\n \r\nWe think the UK should show common decency and offer them an alternative. They were allies of the UK as well and we think they deserve better. Please let's stand up for what we believe is right.",
