I believe the argument some use against children being trans is that 'we're protecting them'. The 2021 census estimated that 0.5 percent of the population aged 16 and over were transgender. Some data suggests that 84% of transgender people have contemplated suicide. We believe the government is not protecting trans children and this needs to be changed.",

I want the government to ensure they are protected from transphobic parents or guardians.",
