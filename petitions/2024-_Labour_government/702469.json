        "additional_details": "The recent reduction in Right to Buy discounts has made home ownership less accessible for council tenants. Housing association tenants under Right to Acquire face even less support, creating an unfair gap. By restoring higher discounts and aligning the two schemes, the Government can give more families the chance to own their homes, promote equality between tenants, and support long-term housing security for low-income households.",
        "background": "Restore the original, higher discounts for Right to Buy and align Right to Acquire discounts with these levels to ensure fairness for all tenants, regardless of whether they live in council or housing association properties.",
