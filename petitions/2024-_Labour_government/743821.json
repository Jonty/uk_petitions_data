        "additional_details": "To match the buying power of a low-wage worker from the 1970s, the UK minimum wage would need to be approximately \u00a342.90 per hour, a significant increase from the current rate of \u00a312.21 per hour (for those 21 and over). This calculation accounts for the fact that the average house price has risen much faster than wages over the last 50 years, making homeownership vastly less affordable. We\u2019re not asking for a raise from 12.21 to 42.90 but the difference is egregious and should be raised!",
