        "additional_details": "The UK is home to an extraordinary number of billionaires \u2013 their wealth has increased twelvefold in thirty years. While the world\u2019s ten richest men recently doubled their fortunes in the space of two years.\r\n\r\nFoodbank use is up nearly ten fold since 2012. The gap between those at the top of the wealth scale and those at the bottom is widening, with women and minority groups especially affected.\r\n\r\nThis would save having to make cuts elsewhere and help redistribute wealth to put money in working British people's pockets.",
