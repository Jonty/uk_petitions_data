Learners are pressured while poor enforcement continues. Many also face repeated lesson cancellations, causing financial loss, delays and stress",
        "background": "We call on the DVSA and Government to protect learner drivers. Only pupils should book their own tests and must have passed the theory test. Instructors must be banned from bulk-booking or reselling slots. Learners should get refunds when instructors repeatedly cancel lessons, without going to court",
