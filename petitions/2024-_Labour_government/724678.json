        "additional_details": "Blackwall Tunnel has been free since 1897, serving millions without charge. Now both it and the new Silvertown Tunnel will be tolled, unfairly targeting working people in Southeast London, East London, and Kent. Meanwhile, over 21 crossings across London remain free. This is deeply unjust. We demand that Blackwall and Silvertown Tunnels remain free, ensuring fairness and equal access for all Londoners, not just the privileged few. If it was purely to \u2018ease congestion\u2019 why do they now want a fee?",
        "background": "We want the government to cancel the tolls on Blackwall and Silvertown Tunnels. All Thames crossings should be free, not just those used by Southeast and East London. Fair access across London must be protected for everyone. It\u2019s incredibly unjust and an attack on the working class in the South East",
