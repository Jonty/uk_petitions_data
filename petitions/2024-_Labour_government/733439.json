        "additional_details": "Many pedestrians, especially the elderly, disabled, or those with children, feel unsafe due to cyclists riding on pavements. Though this is already illegal, enforcement is weak. Dangerous cycling behaviour like running red lights or riding without lights goes unpunished. As cycling increases, rules must be enforced to protect vulnerable pedestrians. We need fines, education, and stronger enforcement to ensure safer shared spaces.",

Enforce existing laws, support local authorities launch a public awareness campaign on pedestrian safety",
