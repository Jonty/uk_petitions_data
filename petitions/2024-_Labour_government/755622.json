        "additional_details": "The current school absence fine system unfairly penalises responsible working families who value education but cannot afford extreme peak time holiday prices. Families are forced to choose between financial hardship and giving their children valuable family experiences that support wellbeing and development. Attendance policy should be fair, flexible, and supportive rather than punitive.",
        "background": "Reform school absence fines and address unaffordable holiday pricing during school breaks. Working families are being penalised for taking short term time leave because peak holiday prices make travel during school holidays impossible to afford.",
