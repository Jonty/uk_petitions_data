        "additional_details": "Publicly owned water is highly successful in Europe - take Denmark for example, where the water industry is almost entirely in public hands. In Denmark, 92% of bathing water status areas are excellent, compared to just 64% in England. Innovation in Denmark's water industry is also strong, with the highest patents per capita in Europe, helping it adapt to the challenges of climate change. To conclude, renationalisation will bring cleaner water, lower bills and more innovation, not less.",
        "background": "I call on the government to bring the water industry back into public ownership. Our population is fed up: bills are rising, raw sewage is being dumped in rivers and lakes and seas, while CEOs and shareholders rake in gigantic profits. It is time for public ownership of water.",
