        "additional_details": "We believe the current economic malaise puts disproportionate pressures upon young families. Financial hardship is the primary reason couples don't have more children or separate, leading to increased child abandonment. Financial and holistic assistance would strengthen families, alleviate stress, and, in many cases, reduce neglect-the most common form of abuse faced by children.  Declining birth rates will become an existential threat in the medium term so let\u2019s start to address the causes now.",
        "background": "We call the government to introduce more family-friendly policies, including favorable stamp duty relief for families buying bigger homes, tax incentives for married couples, child care reform, and measures to combat overly inflated prices by the travel industry during school holidays!",
