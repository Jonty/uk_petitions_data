        "additional_details": "HMRC already zero-rates certified protective boots and helmets, but other essential PPE (eye, ear, hand, respiratory, high-visibility and fall-protection equipment) is not zero-rated.\r\n \r\nThere\u2019s precedent: During the pandemic the UK zero rated PPE. We think this proves it\u2019s feasible to extend beyond boots/helmets.\r\nThe government\u2019s success in building 1.5 million homes and expand the construction workforce hinges on costs. We think cutting VAT on all PPE aligns directly with these ambitions.",
        "background": "Remove VAT from all certified Personal Protective Equipment \u2014not just certified safety boots and helmets\u2014so every worker in UK construction is better able to afford the gear that keeps them safe, We think this would also support the government\u2019s drive to boost building, skills and productivity.",
