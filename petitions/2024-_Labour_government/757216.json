        "additional_details": "We call on the government to amend the law so all parents who lose a child, regardless of age, receive statutory leave and pay equal to maternity/paternity leave. This would give bereaved parents the time, dignity, and support they need to grieve.\r\n\r\nSociety recognises the birth of a child as life-changing \u2014 it must also recognise child loss as equally profound. In the UK, maternity leave can be up to 52 weeks, yet bereaved parents currently get only 2 weeks. This is not equality \u2014 it must change.",
        "background": "Every parent who loses a child should have the time and financial support to grieve \u2014 just as parents are supported when welcoming a child. UK law provides only 2 weeks statutory parental bereavement leave (often unpaid), leaving parents to return to work far too soon after unimaginable loss.",
