It brings out a nasty unattractive and I believe in British side of this nation.  We forget how many of our families came here as immigrants or refugees, and how important that was to our families' survival & safety.  We wanted to help Ukrainians in trouble, we now need to step up and lead the way, in how to help the world, help people in trouble elsewhere",
        "background": "Change the narrative about immigration and refugees.  Promote British values of compassion, understanding, kindness etc.  Concentrate, not on them arriving here, but what and why people are leaving other countries, so the public is better informed.",
