        "additional_details": "At the moment all elderly drivers are lumped together for insurance purposes, in my instance I am being penalised for my age. I am perfectly fit to drive without glasses and have all my faculties.\r\nIt would seem that all elderly people are classed as high risk as far as the insurance people are concerned, this is not so!\r\nAt the moment I have 14years no claims bonus.\r\nThe government needs to ask the insurance companies to work out a way of cheapening insurance for those safe elderly drivers.",
        "background": "People over 70 renew their driving licence every 3 years. The DVLA should tighten up renewals starting with them asking for an opticians certificate to state the the persons eyesight is acceptable for driving.\r\nThis should help to keep insurance premiums down.",
