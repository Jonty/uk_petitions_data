        "action": "Reverse decision on pay per mile for EV and hybrid drivers",
        "additional_details": "The government should cut or freeze the 3p-per-mile rate, introduce means-tested rebates or exemptions for lower-income households, and expand charging infrastructure to keep EV running costs affordable. Other countries like Norway and the Netherlands prioritise EV purchase grants, reduced toll fees and free parking over dedicated pay-per-mile taxes, making ownership easier. These approaches help families transition to cleaner transport without adding extra financial strain.",
        "background": "The 3p-per-mile EV tax adds about \u00a3255 a year for an average household, pushing up transport bills on top of loan, insurance, tax and charging costs. For many families this squeezes already tight budgets and leaves less money for essentials and savings.",
