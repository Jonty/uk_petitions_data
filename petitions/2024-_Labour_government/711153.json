        "action": "Protect VED Exemptions for qualifying Vehicles Beyond April 2025",
        "additional_details": "We think these VED changes could unfairly penalise vehicle owners who purchased in good faith, relying on promised exemptions as part of their financial planning. Early adopters of EVs helped drive the transition to greener transport. Changing the rules undermines trust and may discourage future uptake of sustainable technologies. We believe a grandfathering clause would protect these owners, maintain confidence in government incentives, and fairly balance fiscal needs with public expectations.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to honour VED exemptions for vehicles bought under current rules, ensuring they remain exempt beyond April 2025. We believe changes could undermine trust and penalise early adopters. Introduce a grandfathering clause to protect owners and uphold the integrity of EV incentives.",
