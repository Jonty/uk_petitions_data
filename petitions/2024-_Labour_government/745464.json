        "action": "Make all adults previously eligible for Covid boosters continue to be eligible",
        "additional_details": "The Covid booster has been critical in preventing severe disease, protecting the NHS, and safeguarding the workforce. Restricting eligibility now risks leaving millions without adequate protection.\r\nWe therefore urge the Government to continue booster eligibility for all adults who were previously eligible, not only those in the most limited categories \r\nThis is not just about individual health \u2014 it is about protecting families, workplaces, and the NHS from preventable pressures.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to ensure that all adults who were previously eligible for a Covid booster remain eligible in future vaccination programmes. Severe illness from Covid is around four times more likely in adults than from flu, so continued access to boosters is vital for public health.",
