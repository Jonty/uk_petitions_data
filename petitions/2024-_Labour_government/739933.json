        "additional_details": "Latinos are a growing community in the UK but are invisible in official data because we are not recognised as an ethnicity. Having to select \u201cOther\u201d denies us representation and makes it harder to understand our community\u2019s needs. Recognition in the census and on official forms would ensure fair access to services, improve data on health and education, and give Latinos the visibility and respect we deserve.",
        "background": "Growing up I always had to tick \u201cOther\u201d when asked my ethnicity. Latinos are not \u201cOther\u201d and deserve proper recognition. I want the Government to add \u201cLatino / Latin American\u201d as an ethnicity option in the UK census and all official forms.",
