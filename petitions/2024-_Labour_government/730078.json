        "action": "Abolish NET ZERO, Reopen the north sea for oil & gas ops, remove windfall tax",
        "additional_details": "There is a huge risk to tens of thousands of jobs within the UK as they are driving major global companies away from the UK, this creates more pressure on services due to unemployment, less income to the government via tax, increases the volume of people suffering from job losses. The UK needs to have the oil and gas reopened so that we can be self sufficient and generate more income from exports. Job losses are already occurring at alarming rates due to the policies in place regarding NET ZERO",
        "background": "Scrap the NET ZERO plans and remove one of the biggest threats to unemployment this country has faced for years. Reopen the north sea for drilling operations to generate jobs, financial income, stability. Remove the windfall taxes back to previous rates to encourage drilling to restart.",
