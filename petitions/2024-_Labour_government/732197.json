        "additional_details": "We all know that when we book a hotel/accommodation we pay tax, VAT on any room bookings. Liverpool on the 1st June 2025 brought in a tourist levy which is \u00a32.00 plus VAT at 20%, which amounts to \u00a32.40p additionally on top of any room bookings. It is outrageous that UK born citizens are being taxed a tourist tax for visiting cities in their own country. The tax has been implemented through ABID in Liverpool and needs to be stopped.",
        "background": "Tourist tax/levy is another price gouging taxable system to increase local government coffers. UK citizens work and pay taxes including any room taxes made through hotel bookings while contributing. We should be taxed 3 times. UK citizens should be exempt from any Tourist tax implemented in the UK.",
