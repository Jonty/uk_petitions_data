        "additional_details": "We see it all too often - a petition reaching hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of signatures and the government offering the same response outlining nothing more than that they have no plans to change anything. And even if a petition reaches one hundred thousand signatures, there is no requirement for a debate to be held - this is not okay.\r\nWe think that a new system should be put in place to give more democratic power to the people living in the country to decide how it's run.",
        "background": "We think that the government doesn't take petitions seriously enough and don't listen to the voice of its citizens, and that the current system is undemocratic.\r\nWe think the petitions system should be overhauled to force the government to be held accountable by its people.",
