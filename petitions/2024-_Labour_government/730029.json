        "additional_details": "I want the Government/Parliament to scrap this proposed change and go back to the original 3 years. After reading the feedback on Facebook and other social media platforms women are furious, feeling let down and frightened. HPV has NO symptoms and the most common way to detect is through a cervical screening. Cervical cancer kills around 850 women in the UK every year - I fear this will go up due to it not being detected quick enough.",
        "background": "I want Government/Parliament to re-look at their decision to change the period of time between cervical screenings. They have proposed to change the current time (3 years) to 5 years. The age of this screening also needs to be lower to match the age of legal sexual intercourse.",
