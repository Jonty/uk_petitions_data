        "action": "Do not require parents to seek permission to home educate.",
        "additional_details": "Currently parents are legally responsible for their children's education and parents can choose to home educate. The CWSB seeks to restrict this for SEND children. Many neurodivergent and disabled children do not cope in mainstream education but thrive in home education. Changing the law in this way discriminates against disabled children. Forcing entry into homes to check they are \"appropriate\" based only on opinion also infringes on private family life. Our children deserve to feel safe.",
        "background": "Do not introduce measures in the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill that require some parents to seek permission to home educate. This disproportionately affects SEND children. Do not introduce checks on our homes as that infringes on our right to private and family life.",
