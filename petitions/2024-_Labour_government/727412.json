        "additional_details": "The changes should not apply retroactively to legal immigrants who are currently in the UK, before these changes were announced. Implementing these changes retroactively could have a detrimental effect for both legal immigrants and the UK. Legal immigrants may face additional fees for visa renewals and challenges fully integrating into UK society. Businesses and companies who sponsor individuals may also face higher fees and increased uncertainty over the ability to retain sponsored workers.",
        "background": "The white paper published on 12 May 2025 calls for increasing the standard qualifying period for settlement and citizenship in paragraphs 264 and 271. The 5 year qualifying period for Indefinite Leave to Remain and citizenship for legal immigrants who are already in the UK should be maintained.",
