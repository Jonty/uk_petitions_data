        "additional_details": "Many people struggle for months to secure a driving test, disrupting work, family responsibilities and career progression. I experienced this while helping an NHS consultant who depends on driving for her job. These delays are driven by an inefficient booking system that limits visibility of cancellations, forces users to manually check centres one by one, and releases slots at fixed times that overload the website. Better design would reduce stress, wasted time and unfair access.",
        "background": "Reform the DVSA driving test booking system to reduce excessive wait times (often over 3 months). Add nationwide availability views, accurate nearby-centre searches and an automated cancellation system so candidates can easily find and book earlier test slots.",
