        "additional_details": "Current children\u2019s performance licence times vary from 1\u201321 days, meaning some children are repeatedly passed over because their council is slow. Kids are even advertised by agencies for \u201cfast licence turnaround,\u201d creating postcode-based inequality. Opportunities are lost not due to talent but bureaucracy, costing children life-changing earnings and vital skills.",
        "background": "Children\u2019s performance licence times vary wildly between councils, causing lost work and inequality. We want a national maximum turnaround of 10 days and a ban on \u201curgent\u201d licences so productions plan properly and all children have equal access to opportunities.",
