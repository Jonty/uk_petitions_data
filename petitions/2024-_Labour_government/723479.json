        "action": "Abolish Mandatory Car Insurance: Restore Financial Freedom and Fairness",
        "additional_details": "Mandatory car insurance forces millions to pay rising premiums to profit-driven companies, often based on unfair factors like age or postcode. Hard-working people, especially young and low-income drivers, are priced off the road, limiting jobs and independence. Abolishing this mandate restores financial freedom, stops predatory pricing, and makes driving fair and accessible for all.",
        "background": "Abolish mandatory car insurance laws & allow drivers to prove financial responsibility via alternative means such as a bond, savings or deposit. This will give us the freedom to choose how we manage risk while ensuring accountability. We also urge Parliament to investigate unfair insurance pricing.",
