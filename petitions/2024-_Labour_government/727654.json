        "additional_details": "The lack of a standard carry-on size across airlines doesn\u2019t just cause confusion \u2014 it creates waste. Travelers are forced to buy different bags to meet constantly changing airline rules, leading to unnecessary spending and the production of bags that may only be used once. This cycle of overconsumption contributes to environmental harm. A UK-wide minimum cabin bag size of 45 x 36 x 20 cm would reduce waste, promote sustainability, and create a fairer, simpler travel experience for everyone.",
        "background": "Inconsistent cabin bag rules force travelers to buy extra bags, creating waste. A UK-wide minimum size of 45 x 36 x 20 cm would cut waste, save money, and make travel fairer and more sustainable.",
