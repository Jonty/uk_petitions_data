By implementing professional mediation, successful mediation could reduce backlogged tribunals.\r\n\r\nWe think this would free up tribunals for cases which need them, organisations could be more productive, stress and wellbeing for employees could improve, and UK productivity could improve.",
        "background": "Stop the plans to recruit more Tribunal Judges and Tribunal Members and instead implement professional mediation before judicial mediation which we think could resolve most issues. Invest the saved money into addressing the root cause by developing key resolution skills within organisations.",
