        "additional_details": "I have to pay for 2 licences. I pay my full licence in my property and contribute to a second licence owned by my Housing association on a TV that is in our common room should we need to watch TV in a function or personally when we visit the common room on site. Why? It's unfair and unjust that a housing association has to add charges of this sort just to watch a TV in a common room. It's impractical. So I'm looking for this licence to be barred  and decriminalised.",
        "background": "This licence I feel is out dated and not in the interest of the public having a licence forced upon us by law when generally TV is so commercialised. It's easy for them to go commercial. BBC break to show upcoming programs so in essence we are in fact watching adverts on BBC channels anyway.",
