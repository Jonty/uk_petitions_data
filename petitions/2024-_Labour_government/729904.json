        "additional_details": "I believe this is a necessity, not only because the majority of the British people are unhappy with the current state of the country, but we as a nation cannot operate our day to day lives being treated the way we are. We cannot go on working 40/50 hour weeks and be left with nothing to spare after our bills. We need change and we need it now else we are going to be in a whole world of trouble if we keep letting it happen.",
        "background": "The people of Britain want a change, and we want it now. The need for a new system where the British public are put before anybody else. For example the 14.1 billion pound in foreign aid a year at the cost of the tax payer while we are pushed to the back of the queue time and time again.",
