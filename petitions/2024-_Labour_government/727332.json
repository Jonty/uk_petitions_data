        "additional_details": "Veterans can face housing challenges after service. Current schemes like Forces Help to Buy and First Homes help serving personnel or offer discounts but don\u2019t fund deposits for veterans. We propose a government-backed 5% deposit scheme for veterans, as a grant or repayable loan. Repayment could be deferred or linked to the property. We believe this would honour their service and support stable reintegration into civilian life.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, urge the UK Government to fund a dedicated scheme providing military veterans with financial assistance equivalent to a 5% deposit towards purchasing their first home.",
