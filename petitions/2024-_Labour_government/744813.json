        "additional_details": "We came to the UK on Skilled Worker visas with the promise of ILR after 5 years. Changing this to 10 years for those already here is unfair and breaks trust. We ask the Government: do you want Skilled Worker visa holders, who pay taxes and support vital sectors, to stay \u2014 or to leave?\r\n\r\nThis five-year settlement route has been one of the main reasons skilled talent chose the UK over other destinations.\r\n\r\nSuch a decision could drive skilled workers to reconsider their long-term plans in the UK.",
        "background": "If the UK Government changes the ILR requirement from 5 to 10 years, will this apply to Skilled Worker visa holders already on the route? Do you want us, who contribute to the UK\u2019s economy and society, to stay and build our lives here \u2014 or to leave? Should Skilled Worker Visa Holders Leave the UK?",
