        "additional_details": "Refugees made their plans and rebuilt their lives in the UK based on the Government\u2019s written commitment to a 5-year settlement route. Changing this after status has already been granted would break that promise and create serious uncertainty for families who have already fled conflict, persecution, and danger. Many refugees are children, have disabilities, or are recovering from trauma, and long delays to settlement would harm their stability, education, and mental health.\r\nIt is not fair at all",
        "background": "I want the Government to protect refugees already on the 5 year route by allowing them to finish the pathway they were promised. This is about basic fairness. People who followed the rules and relied on the Government\u2019s commitment should not be moved onto longer routes. It should not apply for them.",
