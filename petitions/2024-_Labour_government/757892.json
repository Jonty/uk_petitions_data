        "additional_details": "The reasoning behind this is the current system would have 1000s of more creative names and options that get swept away by the MET Offices' final say in the yearly storm names. This is both inefficient and boring. When a storm needs to be named, the bureau can take the top voted name resulting in the public having a majority say in the matter. The goal is to have more creative, funny, interesting and memorable names that the people enjoy. Follow stormy.mcstorm.face on Insta for more...",
        "background": "We would like the UK Government to back an initiative to create a public forum that constantly updates real time for the voting of storm names. This will introduce public creativity and better awareness about developing storms turn a bureaucratic process into an efficient voting system.",
