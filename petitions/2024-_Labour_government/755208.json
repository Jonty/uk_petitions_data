        "additional_details": "We believe Thailand\u2019s actions against Cambodian territory, including the suspension of the peace deal, has caused civilian casualties, displaced nearly half a million people, and has reportedly destroyed civilian infrastructure and cultural heritage sites. Int. law requires the protection of civilians & cultural heritage during war. We believe UK diplomatic engagement and support for international monitoring and peaceful dispute resolution would be consistent with its commitments to peace, human rights, and rule of law. This petition was submitted on the 23 December 2025.",
        "background": "We ask the UK Government to condemn Thailand\u2019s attacks on Cambodia, publicly support Cambodia\u2019s sovereignty, and urge for a peaceful resolution. We want the UK to advocate for international ceasefire monitoring through the UN & ASEAN and urge Thailand to fully implement the October Peace Deal.",
