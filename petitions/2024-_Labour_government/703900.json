        "additional_details": "It isn't appropriate to charge VAT on fees, at least for children already in private school. If necessary, place it on new starters so they have the opportunity to plan their finances based on the full knowledge of what the fees will be. \r\nMany parents have tried to move their children to state school & have been unable to because of lack of spaces, so they are stuck (and punished) with this poor decision.\r\nA \u00a3100 annual charge for all children (state & private) will raise more funds & be fairer.",
        "background": "Charging VAT for private school fees is a literal punishment for parents working hard to put their children in private school. \r\nMany parents can only just afford the fees and based their decisions for placing their children on their financial ability before the threat of VAT was thrown at them.",
