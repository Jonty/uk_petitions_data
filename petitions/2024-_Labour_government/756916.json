        "additional_details": "Because by approaching a member of the public who is misusing the space, even if done so politely, usually results in verbal abuse towards the correct user of said space. The problem is coming more common&it\u2019s putting the safety of children at risk. The spaces are larger so that us parents have more room to safely access our child and remove them/place them into the car, whilst protecting near vechiles from damage due to opening the door wide. Spaces could be moved further away to prevent this",
        "background": "Parent and Child parking spaces be clearly designated for drivers with children only. \r\nClear signage is installed stating that use is restricted to vehicles carrying children and \r\nreasonable enforcement measures are introduced to discourage misuse, for example, a parking ticket issued if misused.",
