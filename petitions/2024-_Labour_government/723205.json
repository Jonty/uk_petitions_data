These beloved cats are left at roadsides, suffering, or passed, mutilated by passing traffic or scavenged by other animals. Families left never knowing what happened with no closure.\r\nDog owners are protected under Section 170 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. \r\nA domesticated cat is a family member, loved & irreplaceable & deserve acknowledgement in death. \r\nMany motorists drive well over speed limits giving cats no chance of survival.",

It\u2019s about people, too. Microchipping cats is a legal requirement, should be a legal requirement to report if you hit a cat. These steps go hand in hand.",
