        "additional_details": "We believe we must discuss social housing matters that impact people on a regular basis. We believe that by requiring housing associations and councils to make sure their properties have a balcony, or garden may help with people\u2019s mental health, and that this is a step they should take. As I live in a flat with no personal outside space, this is my last option as many people on sites like homeswapper don't consider properties that don't have balconies; making it harder to find a swap.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to require all existing and newbuild social housing to have a personal balcony if above ground floor, as it can help reduce depression or help with future house swaps, as some house swappers may not consider sites with no balcony or garden due to a lack of outside space.",
