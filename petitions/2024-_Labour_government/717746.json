        "additional_details": "We believe that by 5 years old, children in the UK are already integrated into British society. Many of these children know no other home but the UK, and we believe delaying their legal status until age 7 creates unnecessary uncertainty. Young children need a sense of security to develop emotionally and academically. We believe fear of their immigration status may cause anxiety and stress knowing that they may be forced to leave.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to reduce the time that UK-born children must wait to apply for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) in the UK from 7 to 5 years as the current time children have to wait may cause them stress and anxiety. We believe a child aged 7 has already established their life in the UK.",
