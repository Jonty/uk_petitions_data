        "additional_details": "We think patients are put at serious risk when hospitals rely on medication and provide little or no psychological treatment due to understaffing or lack of funding. Many leave feeling unstable, and quickly relapse. Evidence shows specialised therapies during admission can drastically improve recovery and cut readmissions, saving NHS funding. Making these therapies available to every patient is urgently needed to protect vulnerable people from avoidable suffering and repeated crises.",
        "background": "Providing funding to make specialised therapy such as CBT, DBT, and trauma-focused therapy available to all NHS psychiatric inpatients. Ensure every patient gets tailored psychological treatment alongside medication if appropriate rather than these vital services only being accessible post-discharge",
