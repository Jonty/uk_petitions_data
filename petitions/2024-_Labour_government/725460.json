        "action": "Amend Equality Act to Recognise Trans Women with GRCs as Legal Women",
        "additional_details": "The Supreme Court ruling on 17 April 2025 removed legal recognition of trans women under the Equality Act, even for those with a GRC. This decision strips trans people of dignity, legal protections, and access to essential spaces. It sets a dangerous precedent and increases risks of discrimination, exclusion, and harm. Trans people deserve equality under the law. Parliament must act to restore and protect the rights of one of society\u2019s most vulnerable groups.",
        "background": "Amend the Equality Act 2010 to ensure that trans women with Gender Recognition Certificates are legally recognised as women for all purposes, including access to single-sex services, legal protections, and public facilities such as hospital wards and shelters.",
