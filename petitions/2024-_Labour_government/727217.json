This isn\u2019t just unfair, it\u2019s devastating. It threatens businesses and drives safe, qualified professionals out, pushing clients toward unsafe, underground providers. We don\u2019t want to prescribe heart meds\u2014just continue working legally and safely in aesthetics. This law risks harming the very people it claims to protect. Help us fight for fair, safe regulation.",
