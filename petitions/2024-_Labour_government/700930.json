We believe the driving standards of the UK have dropped tremendously during recent years, with countless crashes on a day to day basis. We think the UK motorway network can be the most dangerous place to drive and drivers hogging the middle lane, undertaking people and forcing people to move out of lane 3, puts other drivers at risk.",
