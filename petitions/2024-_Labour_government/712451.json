        "action": "The government should cap vet fees to make pet healthcare more affordable.",
        "additional_details": "Veterinary costs are rising, making essential care unaffordable for many pet owners. High fees often force owners to choose between their finances and their pets' health, leading to untreated conditions or surrendering animals. By capping vet fees, the government can ensure that pets receive necessary care without causing financial hardship. Affordable vet care promotes responsible pet ownership, reduces animal suffering, and supports public health by addressing zoonotic diseases and overpopulation.",
        "background": "I urge the government or parliament to regulate veterinary fees by implementing a cap to ensure fair pricing. This would make essential pet healthcare accessible, prevent financial strain on owners, and protect animal welfare by reducing barriers to necessary treatments.",
