        "additional_details": "Women\u2019s football, at Club level, nationally & internationally continues to grow exponentially-the pinnacle being their defence of the Euros 22 title this year; breaking the attendance record for a women\u2019s Final to become the first national team, of the Men\u2019s & Women\u2019s game, to win overseas. However, the opportunity for girls to play football at school continues to be stagnant.  A shift in government policy is needed to change the perception & culture of the next generation\u2019s female players.",
