We think they are well placed to support the 10-Year Health Plan by offering constructive challenge and helping co-produce solutions with those with the greatest health and care needs. We think trusted independent services that listen to local communities are essential to improving health and social care.\r\nWe listen without fear or favour and reach those whose voices are often ignored.",
