You can view what was said via the Hansard website. The Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy has also opened an inquiry into the matter and taken evidence from the Government. You can find out more about the inquiry on the Committee\u2019s website.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition setting out any further actions you think the Government or Parliament should take."
