Under the Strategic Export Licensing Criteria, exports must not proceed if there is a clear risk they could be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law. Some licences were suspended, but many remain, including military aircraft components. Full suspension is necessary to ensure compliance with UK law and prevent civilian harm.",

Existing licences pose a clear risk of contributing to serious violations. Full suspension is needed to uphold UK law and prevent civilian harm in Gaza.",
