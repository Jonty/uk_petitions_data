        "additional_details": "Slough Borough Council has a history of financial mismanagement, previously declaring bankruptcy and now facing an overspend of over \u00a320 million this year despite government bailouts. Services have been cut and new charges added, but residents have no real say. We want the Government to enforce external audits, halt fresh charges, and appoint an independent overseer to restore trust and ensure all council spending is in the public interest. Residents deserve full transparency and accountability.",
        "background": "Appoint an independent financial overseer for Slough Council, require quarterly public audits, halt new charges or service cuts for residents, and investigate all council spending and recruitment practices to guarantee accountability and transparency for taxpayers.",
