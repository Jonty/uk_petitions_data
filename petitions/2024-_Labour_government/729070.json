While this may help to engage parents, some of these pages are public and accessible to anyone online. We believe this creates serious risks; children may be identified, tracked or targeted, personal data may be exposed, safeguarding best practices may not be enforced in this context. We believe social media activity involving children should be secure and safe.",
