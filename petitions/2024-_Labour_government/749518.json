A police or CPS \u201cNo Further Action\u201d only means the criminal threshold wasn\u2019t met. Any police investigation or CPS referral signals serious concern and requires heightened safeguarding. To protect victims, we think contact should, as a minimum, be professionally supervised during investigations, with a Fact-Finding Hearing afterwards, ensuring decisions are informed, evidence-based, and centred on safety.",

If the police or CPS decide to take no further action, a Family Court Finding of Fact Hearing should automatically follow.",
