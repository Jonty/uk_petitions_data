        "additional_details": "There have been several high profile cases of grandparents viewing concerns over there grandchild/children's safety when it comes to the breakdown of a relationship and a new partner has stepped in. Grandparents play a vital part in well-being of there grandchild and can see if that child is in danger from someone in a relationship who is not the childs real parent.  There have been several cases of a child being killed by partners who are not the biological parent",
        "background": "It's a well known fact that grandparents are vital in the wellbeing of grandchildren and helping to look after them. So I would like the out dated law on rights for grandparents changed. At the moment grandparents have no rights, especially if the grandparent  suspects grandchildren is being abused",
