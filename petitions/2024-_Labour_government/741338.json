        "additional_details": "Family overcrowding is a growing crisis. Many live in cramped spaces, lacking privacy and comfort. Larger homes are in short supply, while many elderly people occupy homes too big for their needs. If downsizing is made easier for them, these homes can become available to families, easing overcrowding and improving quality of life.",
        "background": "We ask Parliament to create safe, supported ways for older people to downsize into suitable homes. Many remain in large properties they no longer need. Helping them move can free up housing for growing families and ease the pressure on the overcrowded housing market.",
