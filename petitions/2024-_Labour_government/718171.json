        "additional_details": "This petition calls on the UK government to: \r\n\r\nRecognize the Value of Care Work: Acknowledge the vital contribution carers make to society and the\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nIncrease Carer's Allowance: Raise the allowance to at least the National Minimum Wage for the actual hours of care provided, between 35 and 84 hours per week.\r\n\r\nEnsure Fair Compensation: Provide carers with fair financial support that reflects the demands and responsibilities of their role.",
        "background": "Carers provide essential support to people with disabilities, enabling them to live independently and with dignity. Despite the vital role they play, Carer's Allowance currently equates to just \u00a32.34 an hour, far below the National Minimum Wage of \u00a311.44 for those aged 21 and over.",
