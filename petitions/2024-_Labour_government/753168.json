        "additional_details": "By sanctioning the government and military command of one of its closest allies, the United Kingdom will be sending a powerful message that acts of aggression by its allies will not be supported. The UK as a major world power and one with monumental diplomatic weight must act to discourage another war started to affect regime change, particularly one initiated by the United States, whose interventions in nations such as Iraq have led to destabilising conflicts that have cost innumerable lives.",
        "background": "Should the Trump Administration breach international law and launch strikes on land controlled by Venezuela, the UK must sanction any U.S military officers and members of the U.S government responsible. The UK should also summon the U.S ambassador to explain the actions of the United States",
