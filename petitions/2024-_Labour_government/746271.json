The CMA has provisionally approved average additional rises, granting \u00a3556 million more in revenue. From CUSTOMERS, not the shareholders. This gives companies further power to burden customers rather than shareholders.\r\nFailing water companies should be allowed to fail and be brought into public ownership.

In setting price controls Ofwat's aim is to allow for a return on capital that is no more than necessary for an efficiently run company to get the funding they need, and that ensures customers only pay for a reasonable level of financing costs.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about Ofwat's price controls here:\r\nhttps://www.ofwat.gov.uk/regulated-companies/price-review/\r\n\r\nYou may also wish to sign this petition which calls for the same action:\r\n\r\nAbolish and replace Ofwat, and new legislation on investment in the water system \r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/710667"
