        "additional_details": "Early Years providers are an essential part of the education and childcare infrastructure, enabling parents to work and supporting children\u2019s development. State schools have their business rates fully funded and many high\u2011street sectors get generous discounts, but most nurseries do not. Rising wages, energy and rents mean unfunded rates are pushing settings to close or cut staff pay. Scotland and Wales already give 100% business rates relief to registered childcare settings; England should too!",
        "background": "Exempt all Ofsted\u2011registered Early Years and childcare settings in England from business rates by creating a permanent relief scheme, funded centrally as for state schools, so that providers can reinvest this money into staff pay and quality.",
