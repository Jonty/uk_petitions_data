        "additional_details": "Many countries have embraced the lawful carrying of self-defence sprays as a non-lethal option for personal protection. Pepper spray, for example, is an effective tool that can incapacitate an aggressor long enough for the victim to escape and seek help. It is a simple, yet powerful way to tip the scales in situations where one might otherwise be left vulnerable.",
        "background": "Recently, there has been a torrent of attacks targeting normal people who are merely going about their business. This unsettling trend has prompted many to seek effective ways to protect themselves without resorting to lethal measures.",
