It's time our politicians were held accountable for not putting the interest of the UK first. Foreign spending shouldn't be considered when the national debt is above 1 trillion. We shouldn't be involved in foreign conflicts without referendum. It's time there were checks and balances to make sure the countries best interest are put before foreign interests and MP's personal ideology.",
