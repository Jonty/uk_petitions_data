        "additional_details": "We moved to the UK believing we could apply for ILR after 5 years of work. We\u2019ve paid taxes, supported key sectors like healthcare and education, and built our lives here. Changing the rules to 10 years mid-way is unfair and causes stress, financial strain, and uncertainty. It breaks trust and punishes those who have already contributed so much. We ask the Government to honour its original promise and not apply these changes to those already on the Skilled Worker route.",
