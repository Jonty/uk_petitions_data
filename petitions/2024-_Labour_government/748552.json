        "action": "Fund and implement A Universal Basic Income (UBI).",
        "additional_details": "A guaranteed, unconditional income would empower individuals, providing them with dignity and freedom from financial precariousness. It could support entrepreneurs, artists, and caregivers, those whose work is often undervalued yet essential to our society. UBI could reduce stress, improve mental health, offer a safety net in an age of automation and unstable employment.\r\n\r\nUBI is a progressive, pragmatic solution to modern economic challenges, in contrast to systems that oppress and humiliate.",
        "background": "We believe that we are in an era of economic uncertainty, growing inequality, and job insecurity and it is time for Parliament to introduce a Universal Basic Income (UBI). Some Economists argue, UBI is not just a welfare measure, it is an investment in people, and a foundation for economic security.",
