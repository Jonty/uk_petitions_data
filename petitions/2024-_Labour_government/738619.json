        "action": "Stop the Welsh Assembly destroying our Welsh Countryside with onshore wind farms",
        "additional_details": "We oppose large onshore wind farms in Wales and call for investment in offshore wind instead. Onshore turbines up to 220m scar our landscapes, threaten wildlife, disrupt rural life with noise and traffic, and take farmland while profits leave communities. Offshore wind can deliver clean energy without destroying our hills and countryside. Wales has world-class offshore resources \u2013 future investment must go there, not into onshore projects that harm our heritage and environment.",
        "background": "There are currently over 20 planned wind farms for Wales, set to destroy our beautiful countryside, and as a nation don\u2019t seem to have a say. We don\u2019t want our countryside covered in wind farms and want them placed off shore.",
