Armistice Day is currently a public holiday in France, who was our ally in the last two world wars and we think we should align with them once again. Plus with Good Friday, Easter Monday, May Day and the Spring bank holiday all falling in quick succession, we think it would be good to have a bank holiday later in the year between August bank holiday and Christmas.",
