        "additional_details": "I have spent 10 years getting a diagnosis, tried many drugs, have 10 day migraines and due to it being related to hormones I find no pain relief works. It affects my work, my family and is exhausting. It seems that a man can request and have the operation to be made infertile a lot quicker, with fewer questions asked, but for someone like me I feel that it\u2019s more to do with what the medical professionals think. I think I should be allowed to easily decide if I wish to take this decision. If I could I would have it done and have a better quality of life.",
        "background": "PMDD can be managed but some women find the best option can be to remove their ovaries. However, many find you have to fight to access surgery. If it is a chronic condition I think women should be able to make that decision with no struggle.",
