        "action": "Hold a binding referendum on reintroducing the death penalty for sexual crimes",
        "additional_details": "The UK is experiencing rising rates of sexual violence, and many offenders continue to pose long-term risks. Existing sentences do not provide strong deterrence or adequate protection for victims and communities. When Parliament refuses to consider tougher measures, the public should have the right to decide. A binding referendum would give the people the final say on penalties for the most serious sexual crimes.",
        "background": "Parliament should allow the public to vote on whether the death penalty should be reinstated for the most serious sexual offences, where guilt is proven beyond doubt. This petition asks for a binding national referendum on this specific issue",
