The government should produce new legislation so that the cost of investments is shared more by shareholders and housebuilders. OFWAT should be replaced as part of the process.",

In setting price controls Ofwat's aim is to allow for a return on capital that is no more than necessary for an efficiently run company to get the funding they need, and that ensures customers only pay for a reasonable level of financing costs.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about Ofwat's price controls here: https://www.ofwat.gov.uk/households/your-water-company/profits/\r\n\r\nWe can also see you have said that you would like the government to produce new legislation so that the cost of investments is shared more by shareholders and housebuilders. We are unsure exactly how you'd like this to happen. You could start a new petition stating clearly what specific action you'd like the Government or Parliament to take.\r\n\r\nYou also mention that you'd like Ofwat to be replaced. Again, you could start a petition setting out clearly what you mean by that \u2013 for example, if you'd like Ofwat to be replaced with another body.\r\n"
