        "additional_details": "Thousands of families have followed the rules, paid high visa and IHS fees, built lives here and are months from ILR. Changing requirements now would be unfair and retrospective, disrupting stable homes, employment, children\u2019s education and long-term plans. The Government must honour the commitments made to those already here and protect the 5-year settlement routes currently in progress.",
        "background": "Guarantee transitional arrangements for all migrants already on a lawful 5-year route to settlement: including Ancestry, Partner/Family and other non-Skilled Worker visas, so no one already part-way through their ILR pathway is affected by new earned-settlement rules.",
