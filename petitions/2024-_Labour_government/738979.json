        "additional_details": "I strongly believe that the government should adjust the age restriction from 40 to 35 years old for UK domestic vehicles and have an application process for historic imports to be able to apply for historic tax and Mot exemption. The application could focus on the rarity of the vehicles and if they are used for shows and events. Many owners enjoy displaying their vehicles for the general public which can revenue for vendors, small businesses and events organisations.",
        "background": "I think the classic car collectors are focusing not only on cars built in the '50s and' 60s but also modern classics of specific heritage such as specialist imports from other countries. These vehicles are routinely on show at classic car events yet many owners pay high rates of vehicle excise duty",
