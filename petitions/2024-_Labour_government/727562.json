        "action": "Exempt Existing Skilled Migrants from the 10-Year ILR Extension",
        "additional_details": "Migrants on the Skilled Worker route contribute significantly to the UK\u2019s economy exceeding the UK average tax due to the salary threshold, resulting in high tax contributions. They are ineligible to claim benefits and pay a lot into visa application fees making them net positive contributors. Punishing these individuals with a retrospective policy change is unjust and risks discouraging top talent from coming to the UK, leading to a long-term loss of tax revenue and skilled labour shortage.",
        "background": "Call on the UK Government to exempt existing skilled migrants in the UK from the proposed extension of the Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) qualifying period from 5 to 10 years, as outlined in the 2025 Immigration White Paper.",
