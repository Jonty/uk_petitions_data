        "additional_details": "Many of us uprooted our lives and moved here as UK government invited Skilled Workers to address the Brexit impact, by removal of the cap on number of skilled visa and the mandatory Resident Labour Market Test, with a clear 5-year path to settlement. Changing the rules midway is not just inconvenient, it\u2019s a breach of trust and a source of great distress.",
        "background": "We ask the UK government to:\r\n\r\n- Maintain the 5-year ILR route for existing skilled workers in the UK.\r\n-Provide urgent clarity to reduce growing anxiety.\r\n-Honor the rules under which migrants arrived and built their lives.",
