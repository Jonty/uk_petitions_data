        "additional_details": "By installing metal detectors at all school entrances in England, we could significantly reduce the risk of weapons brought into school. This could be a practical and effective measure to prevent potential tragedies before they occur. Many schools in other countries have already implemented metal detectors and we believe this has led to significant success in reducing violence and creating safer educational environments.",
        "background": "In recent years, concern for children\u2019s safety in schools has grown significantly amongst many people in the UK, and this issue deeply resonates with me as a parent, due to the rise in incidents involving weapons on school premises. Shockingly, many students have begun to carry knives.",
