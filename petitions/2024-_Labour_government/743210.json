        "action": "Stop plans for a UK digital ID to protect privacy, freedoms and civil liberties.",
        "additional_details": "Digital ID systems raise serious concerns about privacy, data security, and civil liberties. They could increase the risk of surveillance, misuse of personal information, and exclusion of people who cannot easily access or use digital technology. Existing forms of identification are already sufficient for accessing services and verifying identity. We believe introducing digital ID would undermine trust and reduce personal freedoms, so the Government should not pursue this policy.",
        "background": "I ask the Government to abandon plans for national digital ID system and confirm that such a scheme will not be introduced. Parliament should ensure citizens rights to privacy and civil liberties are protected and that identification requirements remain limited to existing methods already sufficient",
