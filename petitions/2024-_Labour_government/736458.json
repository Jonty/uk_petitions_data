        "additional_details": "We ask the UK Government to withdraw from international treaties like the 1951 Refugee Convention that grant a right to seek asylum in the UK. These agreements are outdated and restrict the UK\u2019s control over its borders. Many now claim asylum after passing through safe countries. Exiting these treaties would restore UK sovereignty and let Parliament create a fair, modern system that reflects national priorities.",
