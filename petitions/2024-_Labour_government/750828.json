        "additional_details": "Too many young people, especially neurodivergent ones, are inactive not by choice but because they cannot access short, structured volunteering. There is a gap between school, university and apprenticeships. Using the Apprenticeship Levy for safe, registered volunteering in real workplaces, from hospitality to care, would harness ADHD energy, autistic focus and unlock skills, confidence and contribution. Young people deserve this chance.",
        "background": "Uni wasn't for me, work was, Change the law so Apprenticeship Levy can support short, structured youth volunteering (incl neurodiverse) via a 3-month HMRCapproved scheme with optional top-up payments, minimum wage protected, and a national volunteer register with tough fines for non-registration",

You could start a new petition setting out more clearly what you would like to happen.\r\n\r\nThe Government's website explains that you are not paid for your time as a volunteer. You can read more about this on GOV.UK: https://www.gov.uk/volunteering/pay-and-expenses\r\n\r\nYou may wish to know that on 8 December, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions made a statement in the House of Commons, relating to the expansion of the Government\u2019s Youth Guarantee and its Growth and Skills Levy.
