        "additional_details": "Traffic Management (TM) companies are faceless organisations that appear to be unaccountable to anyone. Roadworks are regulated by the councils, but emergency works appear to be out of control. Roadworks that do not affect a carriageway should be cleared allowing traffic to ease. There are countless examples where a TM operative is on site and sitting in a closed lane that could be opened to traffic with TM put back out when works resume. There is a lack of common sense by TM companies.",
        "background": "There are countless examples where traffic management (e.g. traffic signals and lane closures) are put out on busy, congested roads, but no work is taking place or it is off the main carriageway. There should be a requirement to remove TM where works have stopped or are off the main carriageway.",
