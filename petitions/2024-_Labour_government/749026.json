        "additional_details": "Our safety has been lost to the huge rise of knife crime, the huge rise of sexual assaults, and the huge rise of pickpocketing. People are absolutely terrified, and one must wonder how differently certain incidents may have been if people could have properly defended themselves.\r\nPeople need and deserve a stronger way to do this when faced with danger because it could be the only chance they have - there simply may not be time to contact the police. Colour-dye is something, but simply not enough.",
        "background": "Currently, pepper spray is illegal for citizens, but self-defence sprays such as the 'colour-dye identifier' sprays are legal.\r\n\r\nI would like Parliament to legalise the use of pepper spray so that citizens have more effective options to protect themselves in public.",
