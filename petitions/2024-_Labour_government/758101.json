        "additional_details": "The UK has already used sanctions to apply pressure on Syria but have recently been lifting them. This petition is asking the government to reconsider this and to add additional political pressure to help the Kurds. \r\n\r\nIf ISIS re-emerges in the region, it could endanger the UK and the rest of the world. If there is no support for the Kurds, it\u2019ll lead to weakening of a great ally in the fight against terrorism, and many innocent civilian Kurds could lose their lives and be displaced.",
        "background": "Kurdish forces were critical in the defeat of ISIS - they lost more than ten thousand people in the process. Kurds are currently under attack by Syrian forces. Recent attacks by the Syrian army have also led to ISIS fighters escaping from prison.",
