        "action": "The UK does NOT need a blasphemy law",
        "additional_details": "Reintroducing blasphemy laws would undermine free speech, a cornerstone of democracy, by penalising the critique of religious beliefs. Such laws historically caused inequality, privileging some faiths while marginalising others. They would also create fear, stifling debate, art, and academia. Existing hate speech laws ensure protections without limiting expression. The UK must champion open dialogue and equality, not regress to laws that threaten liberty and fairness.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to reject any proposals to reintroduce blasphemy laws. These laws restrict free speech, privilege specific religions, and harm social cohesion. Existing hate speech laws already protect individuals from harm without curbing the right to question or criticise beliefs.",
