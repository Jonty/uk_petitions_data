        "additional_details": "Successive government legislation has led to the disappearance of defined benefits scheme in private industry, government response to this has been to showcase how good defined contributions can be. Yet the government pension scheme remains as a defined benefit scheme. This should scrapped making the costs per employee, inc MP\u2019s more transparent and showing that MP\u2019s really do believe that defined contribution schemes are as good as defined benefit.",
        "background": "Having ended most defined benefit schemes for new members. Force central government to take their own medicine, meaning future changes to pension impact central government to the same level it does the citizens of the country they are working for.",
