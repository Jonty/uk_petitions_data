        "additional_details": "I urge the government to take action to keep student midwives and nurses on their courses. The Nursing and Midwifery Council reports that rising numbers of students are leaving because they cannot afford to continue. Many must complete demanding full time clinical placements, study, and manage living costs without enough support. Improving financial assistance could help retain future healthcare professionals and protect patient care.",
        "background": "Support student nurses and midwives by allowing them to claim 30 hours free childcare and excluding student loans from Universal Credit (UC). We believe current support isn't enough to live, travel to and park at full-time placements, or care for dependents. Its forcing many to leave their courses.",
