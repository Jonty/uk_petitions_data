The British people should have the right to the absolute truth, devoid of any omissions because they may offend the offenders, or cause hostilities towards those abusing our children, surely the community of the offenders, want to know the facts as well.",

With 1400 children from one town having been abused, why hasn't someone from that community come forward with evidence, to help the victims of these heinous crimes.",
