        "additional_details": "Applying immigration rule changes retrospectively is unjust. Thousands of migrants have built their lives, careers, and families in the UK based on existing ILR and citizenship pathways and expectations. Changing the rules mid-process undermines trust in the system, causes severe personal and financial hardship, and risks tearing apart stable communities. We urge the government to honour commitments made to those already on this lawful and clearly defined journey.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to ensure that immigration reforms outlined in the May 2025 White Paper are not applied retrospectively to individuals already on a lawful path to Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) and British citizenship",
