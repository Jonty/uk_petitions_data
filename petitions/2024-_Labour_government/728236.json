        "additional_details": "I am an animal lover, and I know our country is full of people who share this passion. It is heart-wrenching to see that when it comes to road safety laws, our beloved cats are discriminated against. Under the current law, drivers are obliged to stop and report when they hit a dog, but no such requirement exists for cats.\r\n\r\nThis discrepancy not only perpetuates the idea that cats are less valuable than dogs but also puts cats at a higher risk of being left injured on the roads.",
        "background": "By amending the law to include cats in the hit-and-run reporting requirements, we can ensure that all animals have equal protection on our roads. This change will compel drivers to consider their actions and help prevent unnecessary suffering of innocent animals.",
