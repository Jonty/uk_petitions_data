        "action": "Introduce free TfL travel for under-23s attending job interviews.",
        "additional_details": "Young Londoners face fierce competition for jobs, yet many are priced out before the interview. If we\u2019re serious about social mobility, equal opportunity, no career should hinge on the cost of a train ticket. A free one-month TfL pass for job-seeking under-23s is not a handout but an investment in their future, their contribution to the economy, and London\u2019s next generation. With fares at \u00a36\u201315 per trip, travel is often unaffordable for the unemployed, having come out of education.",
        "background": "We\u2019re calling for free TfL travel passes for under-23s attending in-person job interviews. Funded by government and run on GOV.UK and by TfL, the scheme would require proof of interview and be made a permanent support for young jobseekers.",
