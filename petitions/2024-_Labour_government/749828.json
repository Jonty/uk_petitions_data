Yet you can go to the doctors, complain of a bad back and then may be eligible for it. We think it\u2019s so wrong.\r\nThe government should ensure those going through cancer treatment are automatically entitled to PIP so they don\u2019t potentially have the added stress of having no income.",

We think people in these circumstances should be automatically entitled to PIP. Instead they may face an added stress of having to fight the system as well as fight cancer.",
