        "action": "Frozen Russian assets, held in the UK, must be used now to compensate Ukraine.",
        "additional_details": "According to New Lines Institute, around \u00a325.6 billion of frozen Russian state assets are currently held in the UK. In essence, there are only two possible beneficiaries of the immobilised Russian state assets, Russia itself or its victims. The G7 governments have already agreed that Russia must \"pay for the damage it has caused to Ukraine,\" and that \"it is not right for Russia to decide if or when it will pay for the damage it has caused in Ukraine.\" Russia's legal obligations are clear.",
        "background": "The November 2022 UN resolution affirmed that Russia bears legal responsibility for its internationally wrongful acts, including making reparations to Ukraine. \r\n\r\nThe UK can ensure that these frozen assets are secured before a final settlement is agreed, preserving Ukraine's right to compensation.",
