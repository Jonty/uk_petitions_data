If we continue to show weakness against aggression by Putin it will, and has, emboldened him. Parliament and the government need to show some backbone. The country may have to pay a high price but we will prevail and be able to, as we did post WW11 come out of the situation knowing we did the right thing. God save the King.",
        "background": "Stand up to the Russian threat to the free world by giving Ukraine stronger support. Do not bow to the Putin threats. Engage with European partners and give Putin an ultimatum, back off or we join Ukraine against you. Do not make same mistakes that led to World War 2.",
