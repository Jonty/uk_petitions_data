        "additional_details": "As cash use declines, we are being pushed towards digital payments \u2014 yet banks and payment providers take a cut of every card transaction. A simple \u00a3100 spent digitally can shrink the real value after only a few steps. We think this hidden tax can drain small businesses, raise costs for customers, and funnel wealth into banks. If the Government wants a cashless future, it must ensure payments are free and fair, not a profit stream for banks.",
