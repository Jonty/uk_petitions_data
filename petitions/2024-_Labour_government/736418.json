We urge the government to act based on recognised guidance.\r\n\r\n1. Preserve open space \r\nUsing hard and fast numbers, incorporate its requirements into the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). For the most space-deprived areas, it should have more weight than the \u201cTilted Balance\u201d.\r\n\r\n2. Restore open space\r\nImplement legally enforceable action plans for the most space-deprived areas.",
        "background": "Open spaces are precious - especially if you don't have a garden. Play is vital to children's physical and mental health. Open space nurtures biodiversity.\r\n\r\nSince the 1930s, the \u201c6-acre standard\u201d and its successors protected open space.\r\n\r\nToday, the \u201cTilted Balance\u201d seems to trump it every time.",
