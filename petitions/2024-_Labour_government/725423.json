        "additional_details": "The Ruling is unenforceable without violating the privacy of cis and transgender people. It has set a dangerous precedent and has failed to explain what will happen to people who are intersex. The term \u2018biological woman\u2019 is flawed. It leaves a lot of questions like are transgender men expected to use the women\u2019s restroom or compete in women\u2019s sports despite having testosterone levels of a cis man?",
        "background": "Ether parliament should rescind the ruling or create new legislation to ensure trans women and trans men are able to use services that match their identities.",
