        "additional_details": "I believe government must act urgently to regulate commercial delivery vehicles as the current system has created what I see as a dangerous accountability vacuum that could put public safety at risk while undermining legitimate businesses. Accidents have increased alongside the gig economy boom. Unlike licensed vehicles, these operate with fewer safety standards. When accidents occur, victims cannot always identify the vehicle/operator, leaving them without recourse.",
        "background": "We call upon Parliament to enact legislation requiring all commercial pedal-powered and light electric vehicles (bicycles, e-bikes, tricycles, cargo bikes, rickshaws, and some other spoked-wheel vehicles), to meet mandatory safety, registration, and insurance standards.",
