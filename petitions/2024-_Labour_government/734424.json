        "additional_details": "Teaching Scottish Gaelic in schools is vital because it preserves a unique part of Scotland\u2019s cultural heritage and identity. It connects young people to their history and traditions while preventing the language from disappearing. By making Gaelic part of every child\u2019s education, we build pride, strengthen Scotland\u2019s cultural diversity, and ensure the language survives for future generations. Without this commitment through education, Gaelic risks being lost forever.",
        "background": "We want the Government to make Gaelic a required subject in all public schools. Every child in Scotland should have the chance to learn the national language. We also ask for proper funding, teacher training, and learning resources to support this.",
