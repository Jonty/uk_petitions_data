        "additional_details": "I am myself a Monarchist and always sang the anthem out of respect for the late Queen, but have not sung it since and will not. The words are outdated and provocative to many, Whereas Land Of Hope And Glory is up there with Stars and Stripes and La Marseilles as something we can all rally behind. The national anthem doesn't have to be all about the Monarch, but about the peoples' hopes and aspirations in a free land.",
        "background": "Replace the current anthem which is dreary and outdated, hated by the Scots, and many English and ethnic people have little affinity with it, even Monarchists. Land Of Hope And Glory is a rousing anthem by a famous British composer and its words are far more inclusive for everyone to rally behind.",
