        "additional_details": "The practice of scalping collectable/hobbyist items such as games consoles, computer hardware, trading card games, and hobbyist books and merchandise, should be banned. Sellers who buy ridiculous amounts of stock just to resell at huge profit should be penalised. We think this practice often prices out regular consumers significantly, and sets a precedent within the marketplace that can lead to overall economic imbalance and destroys opportunity for some businesses.",
