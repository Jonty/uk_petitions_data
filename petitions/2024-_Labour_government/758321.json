        "additional_details": "Fixing the UK's roads is essential for both safety and the economy in 2026 as the national repair backlog has hit a massive \u00a316.8 billion. Deteriorating surfaces cause nearly \u00a330 billion in annual economic losses because 89% of all freight moves by road and delays increase costs for everyone. By investing in proper maintenance instead of cheap temporary patches the government can protect lives and save taxpayer money in the long run.",
        "background": "The UK Government and Parliament must stop using quick fixes and instead provide long-term funding so local councils can plan ahead. They should create a permanent fund specifically for road maintenance and set strict legal time limits for how fast potholes must be repaired once they are reported.",
