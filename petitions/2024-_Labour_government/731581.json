        "additional_details": "Working overtime can be a great way to prove your dedication to your role and company as well as earning higher pay. \r\n\r\nSome people put in extra hours work in expense of their work-life balance, to help the shortfall in staffing and also improve their income. Yet this extra effort is being taxed. \r\n\r\nI believe tax on extra hours if removed, will encourage more people to put in extra hours and cover for inadequate staffing.",
        "background": "The government should consider halving or not taxing the extra effort of staff who wishes to work extra hours to support the shortfalls in staffing. This could encourage more people to take up extra hours.",
