Veterans are leaving due to an overcrowded industry, studios are empty, and standards are gone. Ban these schools and bring back proper apprenticeships to protect both the craft and public safety.",
        "background": "We urge the government to ban tattoo schools, enforce stricter standards, and require proper apprenticeships. Licensing must demand supervised training to protect public safety, stop unqualified artists, and preserve tattooing as a safe, skilled profession.",
