        "additional_details": "Some sweets contain excessive sugar and artificial additives linked to mood swings and impulse control issues in children. We think they are designed to be addictive, encouraging overconsumption and poor dietary habits. By regulating these products, we think the government can protect children's health, reduce hidden risks, and ensure responsible selling practices. We think clear warnings and restricted access are essential. We think They are a drug!",
        "background": "We urge the government to regulate high-sugar, artificially coloured liquid and novelty sweets by placing them behind counters. We think these products may contribute to behavioural issues in children and should not be easily accessible. We think clear warning labels must be required.",
