        "additional_details": "The UN Convention on refugees of which the UK is a signatory, states claiming asylum in any country is an internationally recognised human right. Refugees have the right not to be persecuted for \"illegal\" entry and therefore there is no such thing as an \"illegal\" asylum seeker. There are currently no legal routes for those fleeing the most war ravaged & unsafe countries in the world. The ban on citizenship punishes those who have already been forced to leave their homes to seek safety in the UK.",
