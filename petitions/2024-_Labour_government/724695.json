Currently, only doctors & limited other registered roles (registered nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists) can issue fit notes, which we think can lead to delays, & inefficiencies in patient care. We think paramedics & other registered HCPs such as advanced clinical practitioners already assess, treat, & manage patients; & are well-placed to make fitness for work assessment within their scope of practice.",
