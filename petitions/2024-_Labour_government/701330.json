        "action": "Create a fast-track system to fast-track the planning of vital infrastructure.",
        "additional_details": "This would speed up many important infrastructure projects and boost the British economy faster than it would without this law. A similar law has already been put in place in New Zealand and extraordinary results have been shown with around 50 drilling, mining and more projects being fast-tracked to boost the economy and jobs in the country. I hope that similar results can be seen in this country and that the government and opposition can work together to implement this.",
        "background": "It is vital that the government implements a planning fast-track system to skip most of the bureaucratic process of planning infrastructure in this country. This would greatly speed up the planning and construction of vital infrastructure such as HS2 and the Lower Thames Crossing.",
