        "additional_details": "The prevalence of individuals and groups using mobile devices without headphones or muting the sound has increased recently on public transport. It is inconsiderate of other passengers and harmful to those with certain disabilities or mental health conditions. Lack of deterrence makes it difficult for other users of public transport to persuade disrupters to use headphones or mute their device.",
