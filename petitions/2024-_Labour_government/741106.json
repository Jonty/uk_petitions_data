        "additional_details": "Too many children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) are left without education because councils miss EHCP deadlines, remove provision unlawfully, or fail to secure Section F support. Families wait months for tribunals with no interim relief. This is a national crisis. Government must act now so no child loses their right to education through council failings",
