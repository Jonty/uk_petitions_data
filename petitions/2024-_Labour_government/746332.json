        "additional_details": "We are calling on the government to protect consumers from hidden contract terms which exploit people at a time of high cost and stress. Off-net move customers can be trapped in a contract, even when the broadband service can no longer be provided. This practice is unfair, costly, unethical, exploitative and counter-intuitive. Companies should be transparent about these exit fees on their packages via key info so customers can make an informed choice.",
        "background": "Review broadband companies charging exit fees when customers move to a new address outside of the service area (an off-net move). I moved house (off-net) and was charged \u00a3700 exit fee because the broadband couldn't be transferred! This was treated as me cancelling the contract early.",
