        "additional_details": "We think that extending smoking bans to include vapes could decrease second-hand exposure to potentially harmful chemicals for individuals with lung conditions such as asthma and for people who do not want to be exposed to vapor.\r\n \r\nRestricting vaping in public spaces could also reduce its visibility to youth decreasing its appeal and protecting younger generations from developing nicotine addictions. We think that including vapes in these smoking bans promotes fairness and consistency, creating a unified policy to safeguard public health.",
