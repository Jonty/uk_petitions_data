        "additional_details": "This act is censorship. We have already seen that this act does not work. There are lots of ways to avoid ID checks. Censoring content is not how you protect anyone, least of all children. It must be changed to remove the wishy-washy language that allows the targeting of ALL websites, remove any assumptions about internet users, and give the job of controlling what children see online to parents.\r\n\r\nAll this act does is punish everyone and protects no one. Censorship is wrong and does not work.",
        "background": "The Online Safety Act is not fit for purpose. It will never be repealed by this government, but it can and must be changed. The language used by the act is too vague and assumes that all internet users are children and all websites contain \"dangerous\" material until proven otherwise.",
