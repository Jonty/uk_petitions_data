        "additional_details": "A recent study found fear of inappropriate touching is a key reason people hesitate to help women. CPR manikins often have flat, male chests, so trainees are less likely to practise on female bodies. We believe mandating anatomically female dummies could build confidence, reduce hesitation, and help close this potentially deadly gender gap.",
        "background": "The Government should implement minimum standards for first aid training providers to ensure every trainee practises CPR and first aid on a manikin with female anatomy. All training providers should be required to include anatomically accurate female manikins alongside standard male manikins.",
