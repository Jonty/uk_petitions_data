        "additional_details": "Banning the sale of fireworks over 50dB would reduce noise pollution, reduce injury/death in animals and protect wildlife. Fireworks are typically popular due to their spectacular visuals and so using silent ones will not affect the viewers experience. Their loud noises can lead to injury or even death in pets (eg cats, dogs and horses), wildlife (eg birds), veterans and babies.",
        "background": "While fireworks are considered a part of British tradition, on guy fawkes night in particular, they pose a threat to animals, young children, the elderly and those with mental illnesses. Reducing the limit from 120dB to 50dB would have a positive impact on many.",
