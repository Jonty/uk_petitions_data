        "additional_details": "In the UK, you must work for 2 years before you're protected against unfair dismissal. That means if you're fired after just a few months, no matter how unjust, you have little to no legal protection. We think this outdated law leaves millions, especially new starters and temps, unprotected. In today's unstable job market, we think this must change. We think everyone deserves fairness from day one. Sign this petition to demand day-one protection, because we believe it could happen to anyone.",
        "background": "We are calling on the government to introduce day-one protections against unfair dismissal. We think that no one should be left vulnerable to being treated unfairly just because they haven\u2019t hit an arbitrary time limit.",
