Male, female, Intersex.\r\n\r\nSo I plead, and propose, that we re-visit and amend \u201cThe Equality Act\u201d to bring it into 2025, and beyond. Transwomen are women, Transmen are men\u2014under any modern definition outside of an outdated law.\r\n\r\nWe are not a percentage. We are many.",
        "background": "With the most recently ruling, it\u2019s been made apparent to many people over the years, and even more so now. That this law, or some parts of it, are no longer fit for purpose in our current times. It was using understandings outdated even then. We have, since, had the ICD-11 put into affect, 2022.",
