        "additional_details": "Brexit was meant to return sovereignty, yet EU laws still shape Britain\u2019s legal system. We think this undermines the referendum result and keeps us tied to EU policies. We think the government must remove all remaining EU-derived legislation, ensuring no alignment with EU rules remain. We demand full removal of EU-derived legislation to honour the vote and protect UK sovereignty.",
        "background": "Despite leaving the EU, many laws of EU origin remain in UK legislation, referred to as assimilated law. We call for the repeal or replacement of this legislation. We believe this will restore full legal independence and ensure Brexit is fully delivered.",
