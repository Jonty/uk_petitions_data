        "action": "Stop Wasting UK Taxpayer Money on Foreign Wars: Invest in Our UK needs",
        "additional_details": "I want the government to prioritise domestic needs over war spending to ensure economic stability, reduce national debt, and improve public services like the NHS, education, and social care. Redirecting funds to address the cost-of-living crisis, poverty, and long-term infrastructure projects would directly benefit citizens. Supporting peace and diplomacy over conflict aligns with humanitarian values, avoids further loss of life, and fosters sustainable growth for the future.",
        "background": "The UK has pledged \u00a312.8 billion to Ukraine since 2022, including \u00a37.8 billion in military aid. This money could fund NHS staff, improve education, social care, and tackle poverty. Parliament must prioritise domestic needs over costly wars that deepen debt and neglect urgent public services.",
