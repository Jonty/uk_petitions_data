        "additional_details": "More and more in today's society, AI is being used to help create all kinds of media (film, TV, books, posters, etc.) and it is a massive detriment to not only the arts, but our integrity as a species. AI is taking away jobs from millions of talented people who have devoted their lives and is also doing untold damage to the environment through water usage, and if we want change and to reclaim our integrity, then actions need to be taken. Would you want to live in a world where everything you see is made by a soulless computer?",
        "background": "Create a law that either prohibits/restricts generative AI usage in media and marketing or requires the creators/distributors to add a prominent disclaimer that clearly states AI was used so people can at least choose not to support AI generated content.",
