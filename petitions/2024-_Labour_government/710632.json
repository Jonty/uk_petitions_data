Renewable energy is costly, harmful to wildlife and itself has a huge negative environmental impact. Renewable energy is only economically viable with vast taxpayer subsidies which the country can ill afford. UK carbon emissions are trivial on a global scale. Germany has suffered massive economic damage in its own drive to pursue 'net zero' and if we do not act soon, the UK will follow suit.",
