        "additional_details": "We are concerned that anyone who purchases an ultrasound machine can call themselves a sonographer & begin practicing, without formal qualifications or oversight. In the UK, some unregulated sonographers in private clinics have failed to detect serious\u2014& life-threatening\u2014medical conditions, putting mothers & babies at risk.\r\n \r\nSonography must become a legally protected, regulated profession, ensuring all sonographers meet required standards of education, competency, and professional accountability\u2014both in private clinics & within the NHS.",
        "background": "Make it a legal requirement that anyone practicing in the UK as a sonographer must have passed accredited exams and hold relevant qualifications. They must be registered with an accredited registration body and undergo regular assessments while practicing.",
