        "additional_details": "City and Sandwell Hospitals were closed to consolidate services at the new MMUH Hospital. However, the new hospital lacks the capacity to fully replace both facilities, resulting in longer wait times, reduced access to care, and overcrowding. Patients, especially vulnerable groups, now face increased difficulties in obtaining timely treatment. Reopening these hospitals would restore essential services, relieve pressure on the NHS, and address the growing demand for healthcare in the region.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to reopen City and Sandwell Hospitals, which were closed to make way for the MMUH Hospital. The new hospital does not match the combined capacity of the two former hospitals, leaving local communities with reduced access to vital healthcare services.",
