        "additional_details": "Labour has committed to banning LGBTQIA+ conversion therapy, however change has not come soon enough, and the government must prioritise a conversion therapy bill that includes protection for trans people.\r\nSimon Blake, CEO of Stonewall, said: \"Each day that conversion practices remain legal, they continue to cause untold suffering to LGBTQ+ people across the country \u2013 placing LGBTQ+ people at risk of harm.\"",
        "background": "The UK government has been promising a ban on anti-LGBTQIA+ conversion therapy since 2018, and have yet to approve meaningful legislation against the practice, which experts have said amounts to \"torture\".\r\nThe current Labour government needs to act immediately to ban conversion therapy.",
