        "additional_details": "Many people are purchasing African Pygmy Hedgehogs from retailers to keep as domestic pets in enclosures which we believe are too small for them to be considered humane. Hedgehogs are nocturnal and are generally afraid of humans. We believe owning them as pets and keeping the hedgehogs in an environment where they are forcibly interacted with, and kept awake, by humans is beyond cruel. European hedgehogs are protected as a species, we want the same for their cousins, the African Pygmy.",
