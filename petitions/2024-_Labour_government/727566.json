        "action": "Protect Skilled Worker Visa Holders from Retroactive ILR Rule Changes",
        "additional_details": "Applying the new settlement rules retroactively would unfairly penalize people who have followed the rules, built careers, paid taxes, & contributed to society under the current immigration framework.\r\n\r\nSkilled migrants have contributed to the UK economy through critical sectors including healthcare, education, tech, engineering, & finance. They have stood by the UK, especially during the pandemic and now during a challenging economic period. It is only fair that the UK stands by them in return.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to:\r\n-  Introduce grandfathering protections for current Skilled Worker visa holders, allowing them to apply for ILR after 5 years as originally promised.\r\n-  Provide clarity and reassurance as soon as possible, to prevent instability for workers, families, and employers.",
