However, this can leave them muddy, overgrown, or chemical-laden, breaking walking routes and exposing people and dogs to herbicides. We believe that current rules are not sufficient and a permanent, maintained grass strip would keep paths safe, accessible year-round, and preserve the network of public rights-of-way for everyone.",
