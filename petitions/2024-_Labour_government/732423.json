        "additional_details": "The action is a reactionary attack on children's age-appropriate education of trans children, a library is for all members of the public to read all appropriate books and taking trans books away from children is taking education, causing harm and only affects those children whose parents would have let their children read them. Taking away trans resources only causes more hatred and violence to the transgender community and educating children through all life supports equality and understanding.",
