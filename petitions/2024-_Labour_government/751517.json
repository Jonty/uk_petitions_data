        "action": "Do not apply ILR qualifying period changes retrospectively to ILR applicants",
        "additional_details": "We believe applying the new, stricter rules retroactively is unfair to migrants who have already met current settlement requirements. Many have made important life decisions based on the existing system. We urge the Government to honour these commitments by exempting those currently on the ILR route and providing transitional protections. Retrospective changes could risk causing hardship, uncertainty, and financial loss, which may undermine fairness and trust in the immigration system.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, call on the UK Home Office and Government to ensure that the recent changes to the qualifying period for Indefinite Leave to Remain announced on 20 November 2025 are not applied retrospectively to individuals who are already on the route to Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR).",
