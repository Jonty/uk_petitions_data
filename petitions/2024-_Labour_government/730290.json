        "additional_details": "Trees are more than just decorative landscaping; they are a vital part of our natural infrastructure that help clean our air, regulate climate, prevent soil erosion, and provide homes for wildlife, all while enhancing our mental and physical well-being. Yet, in the UK,  living, healthy trees are being needlessly removed for development, aesthetics, and even excessive pruning, at the risk of causing significant ecological damage. We believe this short-sighted destruction must stop.",
        "background": "We call for the Government to introduce:\r\n1. a permanent ban on the removal of any living trees. To be removed, a tree must be certifiably dead or pose an immediate, verified danger to people or property.\r\n2. a requirement for mandatory independent assessments before any tree is approved for removal",
