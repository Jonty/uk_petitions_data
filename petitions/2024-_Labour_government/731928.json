        "additional_details": "I have a smear every three years and the last one I had I had HPV and abnormal cells, this was in a three year period imagine if I had to wait five years it could have been very different. I would have either had cancer that needed treatment or it might have been too late. We cannot let lives be lost just because someone decided it would be a good idea to extend the time frame. This is not moving forward in prevention it is taking a step backwards.",
        "background": "The cervical screening period has changed from having a smear test every three years to every five years. This needs to change back to every three years as extending the time frame between smears will cost lives. It does not matter wether you have a clear test to then extend the time frame.",
