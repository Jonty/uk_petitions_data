        "additional_details": "Many dogs are seized under section 1 of the DDA on the reporting from a member of the public for looks alone. They aren\u2019t banned breeds at this point, they are suspected. An owner may not be present and disclaimers could be signed by another household member or in panic by the owner not aware of their legal rights.\r\n\r\nOnce a disclaimer has been signed the dog can be euthanised without the opportunity for the owner to appeal. This risks Dogs not of a banned type being destroyed. Disclaimers should not be used at the point of seizing, but only after the dog has been assessed for type.",
        "background": "Currently police can seize dogs under section 1 of the Dangerous Dogs Act (DDA) and can then ask the owners to relinquish ownership by agreeing to sign a disclaimer. We want police not to be allowed to use these disclaimers until a dog has been assessed for type.",
