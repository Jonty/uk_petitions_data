        "additional_details": "Mandating UK supermarkets to lower costs would ease pressure on households facing rising living expenses. By enforcing fair pricing, the government can prevent excessive mark-ups, improve access to essential goods, and support vulnerable families. Lower food prices would also stimulate broader economic stability, boosting consumer confidence and reducing inequality across communities.",
        "background": "Food in the U.K. across different supermarkets has become utterly unaffordable. Prices need to be brought back into a sensible range. The average earner can barely afford a full shop and is becoming more desperate and restricted. Costs must be kept within a fair threshold. It\u2019s completely unethical.",
