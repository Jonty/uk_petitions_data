Current bail and sentencing laws allow offenders to reoffend and serve sentences that do not reflect the severity of their crimes. Stronger bail restrictions, longer sentences, and extended registration protect children and the public.",

Review sentencing guidelines to significantly increase custodial sentences. Amend the Sexual Offences Act 2003 to require a minimum 25-year sex offender registration period.",
