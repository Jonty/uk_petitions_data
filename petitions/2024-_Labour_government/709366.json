        "additional_details": "The black market sale of driving test slots has created a deeply unfair and inaccessible system for learner drivers in the UK. Despite their best efforts, many individuals are unable to book a test through the official DVSA website because third-party agencies exploit the system. These agencies use automated tools to grab available slots, which are then resold at inflated prices, often costing learners hundreds of pounds.\r\n\r\n1. Unfair Disadvantage for Learners\r\n2. Undermining Public Confidence\r\n3. Negative Impact on Road Safety\r\n4. Exacerbating Inequality",
        "background": "Investigate and stop the black market sale of driving test slots.\r\nStrengthen the DVSA booking system with anti-bot protections like CAPTCHA to prevent third-party agencies from monopolising slots.\r\nIntroduce penalties for reselling test slots and ensure fair access for genuine learners.",
