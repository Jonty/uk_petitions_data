        "additional_details": "Many dedicated care workers on Health and Care Worker visas came to the UK to serve with compassion,but they face exploitation.We are tied to one employer, forced to work long hours,often 14\u201315 a day and often paid for only part of our time. When we ask for fairness,we are threatened with visa cancellation.This system traps us in fear and silence.The government must allow care workers to work freely under the care sector,not under one employer,and protect those who report abuse or exploitation.",
        "background": "Thousands of care workers on Health and Care visas are trapped with abusive employers who threaten visa cancellation if they speak up. We care for others but are denied our own dignity. The government must allow care workers to change jobs freely within the care sector.",
