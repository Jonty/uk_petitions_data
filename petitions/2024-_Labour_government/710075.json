        "additional_details": "HGVs are safer than ever with all the technology and safety features, allowing HGVs to do 50mph in Scotland on single carriage ways will reduce congestion which will also reduce the chances of motorist making unnecessary and dangerous overtakes due to being frustrated. It also allow deliveries to be completed faster increasing profits to the local economy. In England and Wales it is legal to do 50mph on single carriage ways so Scotland should be allowed to have the same limits across the board.",
        "background": "Allowing HGVs to increase the speed limit from 40mph to 50mph on single carriage ways like in England and Wales decreasing congestion and frustration on the road which lead to fatalities which could be prevented.",
