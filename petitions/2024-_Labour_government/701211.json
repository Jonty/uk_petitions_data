        "additional_details": "We think in-game currency in games is an incredibly predatory tactic and could be used to disguise from the purchaser how much they are actually spending. We think there is no inherent benefit of premium currency and that it just confuses and distracts. Alongside this, we think premium currency is often bundled strategically so that the amount you buy is either just not enough for an in-game purchase which means you end up buying a more expensive pack or it will be just too much so you have some left and then feel inclined to buy more.",
        "background": "We the undersigned would like the government to ban video/mobile games from having in-game/premium currency, and require local currency to be used (the currency where the game is being played).",
