Some individuals spend every night at the pub, losing their wages and falling deeper into addiction. This can damage mental health and cause pain to those around people who suffer from gambling harm. Too many lives have already been destroyed by gambling, and tragically, some have ended in suicide. We think that what is often promoted as harmless fun can, in reality, be an industry that profits from human suffering.",
