No one will help us as he is only 4! His ADHD symptoms are destroying our lives and there is no help from one anyone. I have to fight and fight just to be heard. School can\u2019t cope, I can\u2019t cope. He needs professional help sooner before he harms himself or someone else. NOT ALL CHILDREN ARE THE SAME WITH SENS NEEDS.",
