        "additional_details": "The introduction of a child badge, valid for a maximum of two years per child and extendable only upon the birth of a new child, ensures that new parents with young, less-mobile children are given priority access. However, in cases where a child has special needs, parents may apply for a disability badge instead. Implementing this policy now will alleviate the pressing difficulties faced by parents, ensure the proper utilization of designated parking, and contribute to governmental revenue.",
        "background": "Parents with newborns and young children often struggle to find designated parking, leading to safety concerns, inconvenience, and stress. Without a monitored system, unauthorized individuals frequently misuse child-friendly parking spaces, leaving those who truly need them without access.",
