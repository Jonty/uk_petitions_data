The would be developer is persistent in his ambition, this development application having being in play since 2018 in some form or another. Its obscene to consider decorating Loch lomond with such a tacky Blackpool-ish 'attraction'. Lomond is part of the trossachs national park yet has been subjected to over commercialisation. We need to protect it!",

It has been resoundedly rejected on a number of occasions but from media reports now seems to be getting pushed through anyway. It will be an unwanted eyesore. At the very least ask scotgov to justify.",
