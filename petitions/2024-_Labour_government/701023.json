        "additional_details": "Many PCs can not believe that PCSOs, that have completed 20 years\u2019 service, are not honoured with a Medal for their work, just like Police Officers. I have started this Petition for all those PCSOs, who have stood side by side with Police officer colleagues and supported their communities for the last 20 years, together making a difference to the communities that they service.",
        "background": "Some police officers get a 20 year service medal for their service to their force and community and I feel that PCSO\u2019s should also get the recognition in the form of a 20 years\u2019 service medal, for their commitment to our late queen, current King and the communities they serve in the United Kingdom.",
