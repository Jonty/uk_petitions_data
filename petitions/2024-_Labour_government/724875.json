Attacks including sexual assaults are continuing to rise each year and unfortunately by the time police arrive it\u2019s too late. It seems unfair police can carry it but not citizens and if it was to be made legal people could feel safer and not able to defend themselves should an attack arise. It\u2019s non lethal and at the time could save lives",
