        "additional_details": "Riverbeds accumulate silt and debris over time, restricting water flow. Dredging can remove these obstacles, helping to improve waterways' capacity to handle heavy rainfall and to reduce flooding risks.\r\n\r\nWhile some worry about the impact on flora and fauna, we think the greater threat lies in blocked waterways, which can suffocate aquatic life and disrupt ecosystems. We view dredging as vital for community protection & wildlife preservation. We urge decision-makers to prioritize dredging efforts.",

By increasing this capacity, we could significantly help reduce the risk of flooding, which threatens businesses, homes, & lives.",
