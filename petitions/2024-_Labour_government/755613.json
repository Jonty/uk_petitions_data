        "additional_details": "Working animals are vital in humane pest control, managing pests like rabbits and rats, reducing the need for poisons, and supporting conservation efforts. Poisons not only harm target species but also non-target wildlife, pollute ecosystems and affect biodiversity. A blanket ban would increase suffering and harm jobs in agriculture and pest control. Instead, enforce clear regulations, licensing, and welfare standards to allow trained working animals to continue their important work.",
        "background": "Support the responsible use of working animals in pest control. Instead of a ban, adopt regulations and welfare standards to ensure trained animals can help manage pests humanely. This minimises poison use while safeguarding wildlife, public health, farms, infrastructure, and livelihoods.",
