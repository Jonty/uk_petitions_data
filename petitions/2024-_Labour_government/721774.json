        "action": "Implement schemes that bridge the gap between schools & mental health services.",
        "additional_details": "Trafford thrive is a scheme that provides help to young people and children who present with mental health difficulties. They support schools to help students through classroom workshops, assemblies, and training for staff. This is vital for young people, especially since a lot of schools aren\u2019t well equipped to deal with early intervention. This scheme would be beneficial when implemented nationally as already it has provided significant support to schools in Trafford.",
        "background": "Introduce schemes such as Trafford thrive in Manchester, nationally, to provide mental health support for schools. This should be compulsory for all schools, since young people are entitled to such support which isn\u2019t being provided due to increased demand for CAMHS services.",
