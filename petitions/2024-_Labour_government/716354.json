This is misleading and distorts the labour market.\r\n\r\nThis practice leads to unfair wages. Women, minorities, and vulnerable groups suffer the most, worsening pay gaps.\r\n\r\nBy enforcing penalties for deceptive postings and mandating pay disclosures, the Government can create a fairer and more honest labour market. Parliament must act now to eliminate these exploitative practices.",
