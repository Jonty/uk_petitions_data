        "additional_details": "Car parks (private and council-run) must display clear signage showing payment is required and the maximum stay allowed. If machines are broken, signs must state the preferred alternative payment method or confirm no payment is required. Where signage is unclear or missing, only the original parking fee should be reclaimed. Penalties must be capped at \u00a310\u2013\u00a320, ensuring fines are proportionate. Excessive fines for minor oversights, such as a \u00a32 unpaid charge, are unfair.",
        "background": "All drivers must be allowed a fair period to pay original toll or parking fees before any fines are applied. Excessive, opportunistic fines must not be escalated to CCJs years later with added interest or fees, as this causes undue financial harm, stress, and long-term hardship for ordinary drivers.",
