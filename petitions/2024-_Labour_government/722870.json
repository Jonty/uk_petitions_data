        "additional_details": "This scheme provides listed Churches a grant equivalent to the cost of VAT on repairs & associated professional fees. There is a growing concern that this scheme may not be extended. We believe the absence of this scheme could be detrimental to 1000+ UK Churches, which may already be struggling to finance their repair works, and it may have a sudden 'significant' shortfall in their budget. We think this will threaten the UK's Historic environment, largely shaped by Historic Churches. The long-term renewal of this scheme is vital.",
