        "action": "Ban face coverings and balaclavas in public spaces",
        "additional_details": "A ban on face coverings in public places will help law enforcement identify offenders more effectively and improve public safety. While we understand the need for medical exceptions, these should not obstruct the ability to see a person\u2019s face. The unrestricted use of face coverings poses a serious security risk to communities across the UK.\r\n\r\nWe urge the government to take immediate action to address this issue and introduce a nationwide ban to enhance safety.",
        "background": "Ban on face coverings, including balaclavas, in public spaces, except for medical reasons where the face remains visible. Criminals are increasingly using face coverings to hide their identity while committing crimes such as phone snatching and shoplifting.",
