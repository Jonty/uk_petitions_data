        "action": "Make the State Pension equal to the national average wage at age 60",
        "additional_details": "The State Pension was cut in value 40 years ago and has been left to wither. Pensioners have paid taxes all their working lives, yet are denied a fair share of national wealth. Women who raised families are not recognised for their contribution. Retirement at 60 for men and women is fair and just. A living State pension should reflect national average wages and rise accordingly. Fairness, not age discrimination, must guide our pension system.",
        "background": "Parliament must legislate for a State Pension equal to national average earnings for all British pensioners, with the retirement age set at 60 for men and women. The pension should be a living wage, not a poverty trap, restoring fairness after decades of cuts and neglect.",
