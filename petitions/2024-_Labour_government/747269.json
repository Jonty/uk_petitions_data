        "additional_details": "The UK\u2019s First Past the Post system is unfair - millions of votes don\u2019t count, and smaller parties are ignored. Proportional Representation would make every vote matter and reflect people\u2019s real choices. Countries like Germany and New Zealand use PR successfully, creating fairer, more cooperative governments. The UK should modernise its democracy so Parliament truly represents the people\u2019s voice.",
