        "additional_details": "Sudden, loud noises caused by fireworks can have a detrimental impact on both animals and some humans. Every year, a significant number of pets are lost and injured due to panic spurred by these events. The British Veterinary Association points out that 45% of dogs in the UK show signs of fear when they hear fireworks. Similarly, members of our community living with conditions such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) report experiencing heightened symptoms during firework displays.",
        "background": "We are asking for required restrictions on the audibility of fireworks, in an effort to reduce unnecessary stress and harm to animals and vulnerable individuals.",
