        "additional_details": "Under this system, once elected with the trust that politicians will form a government and run the country, they'd have 12 months to get on with it and start delivering for the public. If they do a good job, then they'd have nothing to worry about and should easily get re-elected. If they do a bad job, then the public would have the opportunity to swiftly replace them with a new government that would hopefully listen and do better if they'd like to remain in charge for longer than 12 months.",
        "background": "We believe that UK Governments do not deliver on their promises, that they do not listen to what we think the majority of the public want, and that they take their position of power for granted. We think it is time to make changes so our leaders can be held accountable through a yearly review.",
