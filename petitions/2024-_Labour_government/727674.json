        "additional_details": "To retroactively change the settlement timeline or restrict visa renewals would be unjust and damaging. \r\n\r\n3. Prioritise tackling illegal migration, not penalising law-abiding individuals who support the UK economy, care for its people, and uphold its values\r\nThose who follow the law and serve British society deserve certainty, dignity, and fairness\u2014not longer wait times or broken promises.",
        "background": "Please withdraw the proposed extension of the ILR qualifying period from 5 years to 10 years. It would unfairly impact thousands of legal migrants who have, paid taxes, supported public services and built their lives in Britain, planed their futures on the 5year path to ILR that is now under threat.",
