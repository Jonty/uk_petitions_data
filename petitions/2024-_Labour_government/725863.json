        "additional_details": "Sun dimming experiments should be discussed in Parliament and the decision on on whether said experiments should be given the go ahead much be put to the public as a vote. Sum dimming experiments have the potential to go very very wrong and firstly we dont have a body to regulate these experiments let alone knowing what the people of this country want. This is too big a decision to be left in the hands of billionaires and academics.",
        "background": "News of Sun dimming experiments being allowed to happen with zero discussion between academia and the public is a huge problem. Neither academia or government should be allowed to perform such potentially world changing experiments without the public being allowed to vote on this.",
