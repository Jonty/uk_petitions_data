        "additional_details": "The proposals unfairly ignore the fact that the Main Applicant's contributions can't be achieved without the vital role the Dependent Partners take by caring for the home&children.Applying income requirements retrospectively is unfair,tears families apart,disproportionately affects women/caregivers,and child welfare.These rules contradict the DEPENDANT visa name, fairness,British family values & PSED principles.Therefore skilled workers can't continue without secure stability for their families.",
        "background": "Do not disrupt families. Allow existing Dependent Partners and Children to qualify for ILR with the main applicant. Adding income requirements for existing Dependent Partners unfairly disrupts the family unit, their right to family life and unjustly affects women, child welfare & child caregivers.",
