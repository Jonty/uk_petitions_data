        "additional_details": "We feel that the current system fails to address disruption caused by short-formed services. When trains arrive with fewer carriages than scheduled, overcrowding can make them unboardable, leaving passengers stranded and late, especially if services are irregular. We feel this is more disruptive than delays and lacks a clear compensation path. We want the Government to ensure train operators are held accountable and create a fair compensation system to protect commuters from these recurring issues.",

Overcrowding can make these trains unboardable, causing delays, yet there\u2019s no clear compensation. We urge action to close this loophole and ensure fair redress for affected passengers.",
