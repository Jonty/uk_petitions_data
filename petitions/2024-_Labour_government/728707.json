        "action": "Make it illegal for parents to smack their children",
        "additional_details": "Smacking your child can cause psychological damage and trauma. It can cause issues later on in life such as aggression, anxiety, depression, low self-esteem etc. There are plenty of other non-violent ways to discipline children. Causing them physical pain and risking giving them trauma in the name of \u201cdiscipline\u201d is not okay and it is abuse. I know many people who have been traumatised from being smacked as a child, now they have to live with that trauma for the rest of their lives.",
        "background": "I want the government to make it illegal for parents to smack their children regardless as to whether it leaves a mark or not. Corporal punishment should not be legal when there are so many healthier forms of punishment/discipline.",
