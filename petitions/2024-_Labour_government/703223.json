        "additional_details": "School uniforms should be banned in UK state schools because they stop self-expression, a main part of individuality. They add unnecessary costs for families without any proven impact on learning or behaviour. Allowing students to wear their own clothes shows creativity and inclusivity, ensuring schools focus on education rather than enforcing outdated, strict dress codes.",
        "background": "I believe school uniform should be removed from all state schools because they limit self-expression, create large costs for parents, and don't improve learning.",
