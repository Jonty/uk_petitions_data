        "additional_details": "I want the Government to end the rule that ties migrant workers to a single employer, as it leads to exploitation, unemployment and fear. Allowing workers to change jobs within the same field and SOC code would protect their rights, reduce abuse, fill labour shortages and increase tax contributions. Keeping the 5-year ILR route will provide stability and encourage long-term contribution.",
        "background": "Maintain the 5-year ILR route and remove the rule tying migrants to one employer. Allow workers already in the UK to change jobs freely within the same field and SOC code. This will reduce exploitation, protect rights, and increase legal tax contributions.",
