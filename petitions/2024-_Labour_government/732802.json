        "additional_details": "We think there is a compelling urgency now for such a clear briefing (echoing the 'Brexit leaflet' sent to every household in 2016). This is underlined not only by the worsening condition of our environment, but also by recent reports of a spread of misinformation about climate change. We think the government has a duty to make us all aware of the reality of climate change, and the changes needed to reduce emissions and set in place measures of mitigation and resilience.",
        "background": "This leaflet would contain an evidence-based and impartial account of the reality of climate change. It should set out what is known of its causes and its likely effects on UK households under a number of scenarios for future levels of greenhouse gas emissions.",
