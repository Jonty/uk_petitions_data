        "additional_details": "Despite widespread protests on Digital ID, Mass immigration, tax and energy rises due to net zero policies, attacks on the elderly, antisemitism and personal attacks on legitimate vocal criticism, plus a refusal to reconsider digital ID after one of the biggest petitions ever conducted showed overwhelming opposition to it, with virtually all MPs other than Labour opposed to it plus many of labours own MPs also opposed, we have lost confidence in this government and would like this tested",
        "background": "With the dramatic loss of support for Labour policies, the ignoring of mass demonstrations both in London and around the country, the ignoring of millions of voters in previous petitions and the mass opposition to digital ID, we request a vote of NO confidence in this government.",
