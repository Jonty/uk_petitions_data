Indeed, this new status quo could undermine global data security.\r\n\r\nAs a computer scientist, I want to clarify: end-to-end encryption is not a nefarious spectre used only by drug dealers and terrorists; it is a foundational set of mathematical principles designed to protect everyone.\r\n\r\nDigital communication is not the enemy; in-person conversations have always been an option.",
        "background": "Successive governments have villainised end-to-end encryption as a core tenet of criminality. This is misguided and will have a negative effect on law-abiding people.\r\n\r\nI call on the government to reconsider this issue in consultation with computer scientists, cryptographers, and criminologists.",
