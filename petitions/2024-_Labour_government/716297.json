        "additional_details": "policies are rigid look into options for a flexible system even if that means reducing current holidays. this will open up options for needed time and education with families and also reduce places being so busy & expensive in peak time especially helpful for SEN children. Learning is more then classroom this would allow families to plan trips without the fear of penalty while maintaining academic integrity.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to review current attendance policies and introduce legislation that recognizes the value of family time and learning outside the classroom. A Children\u2019s Annual Leave Allowance would create a fairer, more inclusive education system that supports working families across the UK.",
