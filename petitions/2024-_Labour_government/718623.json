        "action": "Reform UK dog seizure and destruction laws to prevent wrongful euthanasia.",
        "additional_details": "I experienced firsthand how flawed the system is when my dog, Diesel, was wrongly seized by police and scheduled for destruction based on misinformation and pressure to sign a consent form while in distress. Dogs with no history of aggression deserve fair assessments. The current system lacks transparency, oversight, and fairness. Families should never have to fight police to save innocent pets. We demand legal protections to prevent this from happening again.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to reform dog seizure laws to prevent forced destruction based on coerced consent. Mandatory cooling-off periods, independent assessments, and transparent procedures must be introduced to stop unjust seizures and ensure dogs are not destroyed without due process.",
