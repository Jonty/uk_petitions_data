        "additional_details": "Many beneficiaries are having to fight. We believe executor laws are outdated and leave grieving families vulnerable. In the event that executors delay, hide information, or misuse their position, we feel beneficiaries have no real protection and no automatic remedy. Many are forced into costly litigation simply to access our rights. We believe reform is urgently needed to introduce timelines, accountability, and consequences so estates are administered fairly and families are not retraumatised.",
        "background": "Reform probate laws, including creating clear, legally binding timelines that executors must follow, mandatory will disclosure, and sanctions for delays or non-compliance. We believe beneficiaries need protection, transparency, and enforcement when executors fail in their duties.",
