        "additional_details": "Women with disabilities, particularly wheelchair users, can face significant barriers in accessing breast screening and smear tests due to a lack of accessible equipment in many medical facilities across the UK. I believe this violates the Equality Act 2010 and perpetuates health inequalities. A 2021 study found that 63% of disabled women had difficulty accessing routine screenings and another study showed almost two thirds of women with a physical disability had not been able to attend smear tests.",
        "background": "We want the government to increase funding to ensure every facility is properly equipped to provide equal care. All women, regardless of disability, should be able to access cancer screenings without fear of exclusion, humiliation, or inadequate care.",
