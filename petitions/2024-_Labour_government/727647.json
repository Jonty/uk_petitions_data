        "action": "Consider to stop Extension of ILR Qualification Period from 5 to 10 Years",
        "additional_details": "Increased Financial Strain: Longer residency requirements mean additional visa renewals and associated costs, including the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS), which is \u00a31,035 per person annually. For families, this accumulates to substantial amounts over time.\r\n\r\nEmotional and Social Impact: Prolonged uncertainty can lead to stress and hinder integration efforts, affecting mental well-being and community cohesion.\r\n\r\nRisk to Essential Sectors: Many migrants work in critical sectors like healthcare and education. Extended ILR timelines may deter skilled professionals, exacerbating workforce shortages.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to reconsider its proposal to extend the qualifying period for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) from 5 to 10 years. This change would impose significant financial and emotional burdens on migrants who have legally resided, worked, and contributed to the UK.",
