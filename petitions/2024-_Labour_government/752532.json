        "action": "Petition to Scrap the Proposed Road-Mileage Charge for Electric Vehicles",
        "additional_details": "The mileage charge will add significant annual costs to EV drivers on top of new VED charges, discouraging people from switching to cleaner vehicles. With fuel duty frozen again, this policy creates an unfair imbalance and undermines efforts to cut emissions. There are also unanswered questions about privacy, monitoring, and how mileage will be verified. A better, fairer policy is needed",
        "background": "Scrap the proposed road-mileage charge for electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles and review the policy to ensure EV drivers are not unfairly penalised. Introduce a fairer, future-proof approach that supports the UK\u2019s transition to cleaner transport.",
