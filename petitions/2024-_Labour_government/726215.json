        "additional_details": "A consultation and statutory process to devolved governments to implement a scheme for charging road tax to non English, NI, Scottish and Welsh registered vehicles. The high rise in road tax for UK registered vehicles can be supplemented by taxing foreign registered vehicles.   In comparison to many European countries the UK has few road tolls and the drivers of foreign registered cars do not contribute to the maintenance of major roads. In Switzerland a standard vehicle is charged CHF40 1 year.",
        "background": "Follow the Swiss model where all non-Swiss number plated vehicles pay road tax, when driving through Switzerland. All ferry ports, channel tunnel pay yearly road tax. The payment can be a sliding scale depending on the type of vehicle and emissions. Online payment should be made available.",
