We think it\u2019s preventing many people who simply want a better future and people who want to serve our country from joining the Armed Forces, at a time when we lack the number of personnel we need. We believe that a person should be able to serve as long as they are fit enough to serve, whether that's a man or woman. We consider that tattoos do not define a person unless obscene or offensive. Many would die for our country even.",
