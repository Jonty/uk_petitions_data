        "additional_details": "Millions of UK families are struggling to afford essentials. Baby items like nappies and formula are taxed unfairly, despite being necessities. Grocery prices have soared while supermarket profits rise. Scrapping VAT and capping food prices would ease the burden and protect the most vulnerable. These steps would restore fairness, support public health, and help families facing impossible choices between heating and eating. The time to act is now.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to scrap VAT on essential baby products and cap the prices of key groceries like bread, milk, eggs, and pasta to combat profiteering and ease the cost-of-living crisis, protecting families and ensuring fair access to basic necessities.",
