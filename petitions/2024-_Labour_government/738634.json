It does not represent value for money.\r\nOxford City's plan based purely on growth in the City is unrealistic, unsustainable and does not solve the access problem for commuters into Oxford.\r\nThe other two proposals are much better aligned with Government aims. They would bring a far more holistic approach to bringing in growth, efficiencies and opportunities to the whole area.",
        "background": "Choose one of the other two proposals for Oxfordshire, which meet Minister\u2019s criteria, and adopt it.\r\n\r\nGreater Oxford plans to annex 48 rural parishes, cut up districts and parishes, with a population <50% of a sensible economic area for growth and value for money.  It is deeply unpopular.",
