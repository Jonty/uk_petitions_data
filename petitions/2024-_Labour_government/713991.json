        "additional_details": "The prison system is overcrowded and in some cases such as those involving child rape gangs & terrorism, prisons can be breeding grounds for radicalisation. Preventing re-offending upon release is also of the utmost importance. There's also the cost of keeping a convicted criminal behind bars for years to consider as well as the victims of crime. We should show that we are tough on crime and tough on criminals as a deterrent to other potential criminals. Safety of the public is paramount.",
        "background": "The death penalty should be mandatory for Child rapists, terrorists & those convicted of treason, & should be an option for mass murderers, serial rapists, paedophiles & child killers. Only one appeal should be allowed without legal aid, which must be lodged and heard within 3 months of conviction.",
