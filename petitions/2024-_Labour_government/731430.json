        "action": "Reform the CMS to Prevent Parental Alienation and Financial Exploitation",
        "additional_details": "Under current CMS arrangements, child maintenance payments are calculated in a binary manner with little emotional\r\nIntelligence. While this is intended to protect the child\u2019s financial welfare, it creates a troubling loophole: a parent with care (PWC) can, in some cases, deliberately obstruct contact between the child and the non-resident parent (NRP) while continuing to receive higher maintenance payments. This can lead to a form of financial exploitation and parental alienation.",
        "background": "1. Incorporate a deeper understanding of the current Contact Arrangements into CMS Assessments.\r\n\r\n2. Introduce Safeguards Against Parental Alienation\r\n\r\n3. Implement a Dispute Resolution Pathway Within CMS\r\n\r\n4. Make Transparency and Accountability Central to CMS Enforcement",
