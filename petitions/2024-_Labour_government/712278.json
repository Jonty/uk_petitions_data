A thorough inquiry would:\r\n\r\nExpose systemic failings that have allowed these crimes to persist.\r\nEnsure accountability for perpetrators and enablers.\r\nProvide justice and support for victims.\r\nEstablish safeguards to protect vulnerable individuals in the future.\r\nThe lack of decisive action is deeply concerning and risks further unrest. We demand accountability, transparency, and justice.",
