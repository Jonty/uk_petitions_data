This causes unfair rejections, disadvantages those unfamiliar with ATS, and excludes qualified talent.\r\n\r\nWe urge the Government to:\r\n\t\u2022\tMandate human review alongside ATS results.\r\n\t\u2022\tRegulate ATS to reduce errors.\r\n\t\u2022\tRequire transparency on ATS use and feedback for rejected candidates.\r\n\r\nThese steps will make recruitment fairer, focusing on skills, not algorithms.",
        "background": "These automated systems often reject CVs based on formatting, keywords, or parsing errors without any human review. This means qualified candidates are unfairly excluded before their applications are even seen.",
