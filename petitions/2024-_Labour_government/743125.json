        "additional_details": "Cai Guo-Qiang\u2019s firework show\u00a0Rising Dragon has caused serious and likely irreversible environmental damage on the Tibetan Plateau, home to many endangered and endemic species.\r\n\r\nAlthough Cai claims to have used environmentally safe materials, conservationists dispute this, and debris from the event is still being cleared by local herders.\r\n\r\nWhite Cube describes him as \u201cengaging local culture and history\u201d, which is misleading as he has repeatedly left behind environmental destruction.",
        "background": "The Government should stop the Cai Guo-Qiang exhibition at White Cube. London should not be a place to celebrate ecocide. The Government should also ensure that galleries and cultural institutions in the UK consider artists\u2019 environmental records when planning future exhibitions.",
