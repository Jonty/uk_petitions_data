We believe current \"paddle\" gates are too weak, allowing many individuals to barge through or \"tailgate\" with minimal effort. This can bypass security, facilitate fare evasion\u2014costing taxpayers millions\u2014and create a dangerous environment. Station staff may face abuse or physical assault when trying to stop these individuals.
