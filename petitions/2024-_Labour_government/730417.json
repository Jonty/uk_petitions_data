        "additional_details": "Scissor traps usually kill moles and are available to buy in the UK. However, they kill moles when there are many more humane approaches to getting rid of them, including natural deterrents and traps that do not kill the mole. I think it is disgusting that in 21st century in the UK anybody can purchase a scissor trap. I think there needs to be much more serious rules in regards to the killing of moles. Scissor traps are not currently banned under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.",
        "background": "Ban the use of scissor traps for moles and impose a large fine on anybody using, distributing, or buying scissor traps in the UK. The Government and Parliament need to treat using scissor traps as a serious offence against animal rights and animal cruelty.",
