Unlike Privates, Recruits aren\u2019t deployable and don\u2019t face combat risks, so we think equal pay doesn\u2019t reflect the dangers trained soldiers face.\r\n\r\nWe think equating the pay of recruits with that of trained soldiers undermines the value of the training, experience, and commitment that Privates have invested in their careers.\r\n\r\nRecruits and Privates are not the same, and neither should their pay be.",
