Participants are pushed into high-pressure situations, leading to emotional abuse, gaslighting, and self-esteem damage. The show normalizes toxic behavior by framing conflict as entertainment, potentially promoting harmful relationship dynamics. This portrayal can influence viewers to accept abuse as part of a normal relationship, with long-term mental health consequences",
