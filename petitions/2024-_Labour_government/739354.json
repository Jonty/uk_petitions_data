The movement \u201cWe are not \u2018other\u2019, we are Latinos\u201d, which began in Elephant and Castle, highlights the lack of recognition on official forms, where Latin Americans must select \u201cother\u201d. This invisibility limits access to services and fair representation. Recognition would reflect decades of contribution and promote equality, visibility and inclusion.",
