        "additional_details": "For the Government:\r\nSignificantly reduces pressure on public funds\r\nAvoids legal and social backlash associated with changing promises\r\nFor Workers and Families:\r\nPreserves the promised 5-year settlement route\r\nProvides stability, dignity, and certainty\r\nAllows continued contributions to the UK economy and social care system.\r\nHealth and Care Workers have cared for the UK\u2019s most vulnerable with dedication. Supporting them fairly means protecting public funds without breaking past commitments.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to uphold the original 5\u2011year settlement pathway for Health & Care Worker visa holders. Maintain No Recourse to Public Funds at ILR and extend it 5 years post\u2011naturalisation, ensuring fairness, sustainability, and recognition of vital frontline contributions.",
