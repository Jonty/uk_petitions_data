        "additional_details": "I oppose any Government attempt to change or reduce jury trials because this would weaken one of the most important protections in the British justice system. Jury trials ensure ordinary people help decide guilt or innocence, preventing the state from holding unchecked power. Any reform that limits jury involvement\u2014whether for lower-level offences or otherwise\u2014risks shifting power from the public to the Government and reducing fairness and accountability.",
        "background": "I am calling on the Government to publicly commit to preserving full jury trials and to reject any reform that reduces or restricts the right to be judged by a jury of one\u2019s peers. The justice system must remain fair, independent, and accountable to the public.",
