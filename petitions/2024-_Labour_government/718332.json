        "additional_details": "This measure is essential to improve transparency, accountability, and trust in our political system. The public deserves clear and honest answers, not deflections or rehearsed rhetoric. Implementing this rule will ensure politicians engage in meaningful discussions rather than avoiding scrutiny. Politicians must provide a clear and relevant response to the question asked. If they fail to do so after three attempts, they should be required to leave the interview immediately.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to introduce a rule requiring all politicians to directly answer questions when interviewed by the media or the public. Politicians must provide a clear and relevant response to the question asked.",
