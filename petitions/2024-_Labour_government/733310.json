        "additional_details": "This condition, although rare, can be life-threatening and we believe it must be recognised by medical professionals swiftly to prevent unnecessary loss of life. We believe having informed medical personnel and immediate action can be the difference between life and death. We believe it is crucial that protocols for early recognition and treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia thrombosis are established, and that NHS and all medical personnel have an awareness of the drug.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to fund a national campaign to raise awareness of Heparin\u2019s potential side effects, and to fund training programs and continuous medical education which include comprehensive information on the drug\u2019s side effects and their management.",
