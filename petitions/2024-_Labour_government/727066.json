        "additional_details": "The labour government are quite obviously trying to force cheaply produced, poor quality, and unhealthy food from foreign countries, most recently from the United States, into the UK food supply chain.\r\nNo doubt allot will get packaged here and possibly sold as uk produce. This needs to be stopped, but equally the Red Tractor assurance scheme needs scrapping, to allow farmers to produce food in a competitive manner.",
        "background": "Removal of Farm Assurance regulations, that are making British farmers uncompetitive.\r\nThe recent trade deal is yet another example of low standard produce that would be illegal to produce in this country, freely being imported. Serious health risks are also associated with this.",
