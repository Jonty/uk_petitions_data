What they offer the electorate is the same as any tender from a business. The electorate vote on those promises or claim of intent. Therefore the electorate should be able to declare a breach of contract, after a year has passed, and get the courts to agree that a new election should be held.",

We cannot, any longer, subvert democracy by getting people to waste their precious votes on manifestos that are patently a tissue of lies.",
