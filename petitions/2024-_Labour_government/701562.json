        "additional_details": "We think the NICs increase will put immense pressure on healthcare, social care, education, leisure and community public services providers, which are already stretched by funding and staffing issues. We think the impact of the rise will result in suppliers being forced to abandon contracts, freeze pay, freeze recruitment, and make redundancies, as well as the closure of some providers. We think this will impact those reliant on vital public services. We call for swift reassurance and clarity.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to review the increase of NICs and how to protect all not-for-profit providers of vital public services from the impact of these unexpected costs. This review should consider how to ensure a level playing field for all health and social care providers in particular.",
