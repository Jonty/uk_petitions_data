        "additional_details": "Clause NC21 would strip trans people of privacy, dignity, and recognition in essential services, records, and identification.\r\n\r\nFor many trans people \u2014 especially those awaiting or unable to obtain a GRC \u2014 this clause threatens to forcibly out them and deny them access to services, protections, and legal equality. \r\n\r\nIt could impact our safety, our families, and our right to exist without surveillance or erasure.\r\n\r\nThis is not about data accuracy  it's about control, exclusion, and harm.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to reject Clause NC21 of the Data (Use and Access) Bill. which would force public authorities to prioritise sex assigned at birth over legal gender, irrespective of whether a GRC is issued.",
