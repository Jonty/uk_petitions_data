        "additional_details": "The person against whom an NCHI has been recorded is NOT always informed that this has happened. \r\n\r\nNCHIs are recorded on enhanced DBS checks, affecting employment opportunities for those who knowingly or unknowingly have an NCHI recorded against them, even if nothing further is done and the is case dropped.\r\n\r\nParliament needs to abolish the recording of NCHIs to allow the police to concentrate on actual crime. This would also help to regain public trust in our police forces.",
        "background": "Abolish the Recording of NON CRIME hate incidents. Following the recent NCHI investigation of a well known journalist, which has now been dropped, recording of NCHIs should be scrapped because they are often used for settling a grudge. Children are also being investigated by police for NCHIs.",
