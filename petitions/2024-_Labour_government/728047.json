        "additional_details": "A survey has shown many businesses in Great Britain are struggling with unsustainable energy costs, with over 80% saying the prices are one of the top challenges they face.\r\n \r\nA survey also showed that over four-fifths of companies either receive no financial support from the government or think it does not do enough to support their business. We think this means some businesses are at risk of downsizing or closing altogether.",
        "background": "We want the Government to introduce a cap on business energy prices, like the domestic energy price cap.  We think this would help protect micro, small, medium, and large-sized companies from extreme energy costs, support economic stability, and prevent business closures due to unaffordable bills.",
