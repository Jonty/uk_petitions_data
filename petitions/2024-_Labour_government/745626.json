(Additionally, children would have food at home as the voucher system would remove the option of purchasing non essential items)\r\n\u2022The NHS wins with lower demand from preventable illnesses.\r\n\u2022The economy wins by keeping money circulating within the UK.\r\n\u2022Less food poverty homes \r\n\u2022Communities win with fairer, more responsible use of benefits.",
        "background": "Reform benefits so 80% is vouchers for UK-farmed fresh food in government shops and 20% cash. No alcohol or cigarettes. Boosts farmers, improves health, cuts NHS costs, keeps money in the UK, and adds free off-peak bus passes to support work and reduce isolation.",
