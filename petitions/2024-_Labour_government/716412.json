        "additional_details": "Local elections are a fundamental part of our democratic system, allowing communities to choose their representatives, hold local authorities accountable, and have a say in decisions that affect their daily lives. Any attempt to cancel or delay these elections without a justifiable reason undermines democratic principles and erodes public trust.\r\n\r\nWe believe:\r\n\r\nLocal democracy must be protected \u2013 Elections ensure that councils represent the will of the people. Cancelling them denies citizens their voice.\r\n\r\nAccountability matters \u2013 Local leaders must answer to the public. Delaying elections allows unaccountable officials to remain in power.\r\n\r\nThere is no valid excuse \u2013 If national elections can take place, there is no reason why local elections should be cancelled.",
        "background": "We urge the government to respect the democratic process and allow local elections to proceed as scheduled. Any attempt to interfere with the electoral process is a attack on our rights as citizens of this country",
