        "additional_details": "As a first time mother of a young baby it\u2019s opened my eyes to how difficult it can be to get my baby and her accessories out of the car in a standard space. However I find many people park in parent and child bay without a child or a care. I have seen many heated arguments take place in the car park and on social media about this problem and it\u2019s time we changed it. The spaces do not need to be closer to do the door just wider and have action taken against people who park there without children.",
        "background": "Change the law to make parking in a parent and child parking bay without a child under 12 illegal with a fine of up to \u00a3100 to give parity with disabled parking spaces.",
