        "action": "Windfall tax on excess asylum-accommodation profits",
        "additional_details": "Public money must deliver value, not windfalls. In my constituency, the operator of a former hotel used for asylum accommodation made \u00a311.7m pre-tax profit on \u00a318.8m revenue over two years\u2014a 62% margin. Those figures come from Companies House filings. That is a scandalous waste of taxpayer funds. A windfall tax would deter profiteering, fund local services, and restore trust while ensuring dignified accommodation.",
        "background": "Introduce a windfall tax on excess profits from asylum-accommodation contracts: tax any margin above normal hotel levels on progressive bands (like income tax), publish benchmarks, cap margins in future contracts, and return proceeds to taxpayers and local services.",
