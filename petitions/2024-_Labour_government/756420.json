Uncontrolled dogs can cause serious injury, distress & pose risks to children, people undertaking sporting activities (runners), elderly people & those with disabilities. Leads also protect livestock and wildlife, reduce road traffic incidents, and prevent conflicts between dogs. A clear nationwide rule would remove confusion, support responsible ownership, and help councils enforce safety consistently",
