        "additional_details": "Without regulation, we believe the rapid growth of AI could replace millions of workers, causing widespread unemployment, economic inequality, and social disruption. We urge the Government to introduce clear rules, invest in reskilling and retraining programs, and ensure AI is deployed to complement human work rather than replace it, protecting jobs, livelihoods, and the long-term stability of the economy.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to urgently review and regulate AI to protect jobs. Rapid AI advances could cause major unemployment across many sectors. We want an independent assessment of risks, safeguards for workers, and plans for reskilling so AI benefits society responsibly.",
