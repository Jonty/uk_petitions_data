        "action": "Resolve delays in renewal of COS for Skilled Worker visas",
        "additional_details": "Many skilled workers, including senior carers and frontline healthcare staff, face long delays in CoS renewals that risk their lawful status despite continued employment. These delays cause financial instability, emotional distress, and fear of family separation. Many of these workers supported the UK during COVID-19 and provide essential care to elderly and vulnerable people. Disruptions to their visa renewals threaten continuity of care. Urgent action is needed to prevent avoidable harm.",
        "background": "The Government should urgently address delays in renewing Certificates of Sponsorship (CoS) for Skilled Worker visas, including clear updates on renewal delays, published processing times, priority for care workers, and an expedited route and support channel for urgent UK-based cases.",
