        "additional_details": "To protect the future of children growing up in these surroundings. Studies show that when a child has been deprived of another parent they grow up to have more mental difficulties ie. depression. It also shows that parents that have been unfairly deprived of seeing their children have a much higher rate of mental health issues including a higher suicide rate. This would see a massive reduction of mental health issues and would take a much needed relief of stress off the NHS and other services.",
        "background": "To see every parent equally, to have it that each parent has a 50/50 custody over their children to stop parents using children as a weapon against the other parent. Also reduce the mental abuse that follows to protect the children involved. This is until courts or social services to say otherwise.",
