It is important that our children remain up to date and technologically literate.\r\n \r\nWe think it would encourage learners to develop technology literacy and practise skills such as research, touch-typing, digital media amongst others. These skills would give our children a head start for future careers. In the long run, it will save on additional costs such as printing, laminating etc.",
