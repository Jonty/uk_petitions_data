        "additional_details": "Relative to the vast majority of public sector workers, the salary of Members of Parliament is exceptionally high, at a time when the public finances are stretched, and the government is having to make cuts in multiple departments. \r\n\r\nThere is no evidence to suggest that paying MPs more will have any beneficial impact on the running of the country, or help to restore the public's trust in politicians.",
        "background": "Since April 2024, the annual salary for Members of Parliament has been \u00a391,346.\r\n\r\nWe could like the government to freeze the pay of Members of Parliament at this rate, and to ignore any future recommendations from IPSA to increase it, including at the next meeting of IPSA this year.",
