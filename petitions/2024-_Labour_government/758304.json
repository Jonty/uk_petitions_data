        "additional_details": "The government can revert this change and actually do what the public want! Re-instating the 30/40 mph zones would reduce congestion, reduce travel time, and stop drivers tailgating and overtaking dangerously. It is frustrating driving at 20mph, except in school zones. The upper speed limits of 30/40 also pollute the environment LESS, which leads us to believe it is a government ploy to claim petrol/diesel cars are dirtier than they are. Change them back, nobody wants these limits.",
        "background": "The government and local councils have decided it is a safer idea to reduce speed limits to 20mph in more areas. This actually increases pollution, congestion, and aggressive driving from those who disregard the 20 zones. These need reverted. Cars are safer than years ago. 20 is just too slow!",
