This would require both driving examiners and instructors to undergo the same Level 4 standardized training to unify assessment criteria. Once qualified, instructors should be permitted to conduct driving tests for candidates they have not personally taught. This \"local swap\" model will use shared performance data to address fail hotspots, eliminate the test backlog, and maintain impartiality through DVSA-led audits.",
