        "additional_details": "In the previous general election on June 4th 2024 the Labour Party gained over 400 seats with 64% of seats whilst winning 34% of seats.This is clearly undemocratic with many votes wasted and the fact that reform, Lib Dem\u2019s and Green whilst also the majority of the public support electoral reform. As a first year politics student we are in dire need of political reform to ensure every vote counts and that democracy is upheld.",
        "background": "The government should allow the House of Commons to legislate on the issue of electoral reform and allow them to vote on it.This vote should be free similar to the assisted dying bill whereby MPs can freely vote rather than vote with their parties.",
