        "additional_details": "Currently, consumers may be charged the same price for 0% or low-alcohol beer. This is despite the fact that alcoholic drinks are subject to duties and taxes, while non-alcoholic drinks are not. We think that if some pub drinkers switched to non-alcoholic beer due to more affordable pricing, the reduction in alcohol-related harm could save the NHS money, through fewer liver disease admissions, accidents, and alcohol-related mental health crises.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, call on the UK Government to cap the price of non-alcoholic beer sold in pubs and hospitality venues, in line with its potential to reduce alcohol-related harm and subsequent strain on NHS services.",
