        "additional_details": "Many are concerned basic freedoms, including free speech, press, and communication, being restricted in Eritrea. Independent media has been banned since 2001, and there have been reports of many journalists being jailed without trial. Internet access is heavily restricted, which silencing and isolating millions. The UK values democracy and human rights, and I believe it can use its influence to push for reforms by advocating for press freedom, internet access, and the release of journalists.",
        "background": "I call on the UK Government to seek to pressure Eritrea to restore freedom of speech and independent media, release imprisoned journalists, and provide greater internet access. I believe the UK must advocate for human rights and support Eritreans in their fight for freedom and justice.",
