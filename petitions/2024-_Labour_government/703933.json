        "additional_details": "Interstitial cystitis is a severe, chronic bladder condition affecting millions globally. It can cause debilitating pelvic pain, chronic inflammation, urinary urgency, frequency, and even bladder bleeding, such as waterfall bleeding or trigonitis. \r\n \r\nWe believe many patients suffer for multiple years before receiving a diagnosis, sometimes enduring misdiagnoses and treatments that worsen symptoms instead of targeting the root cause. IC can drastically reduce quality of life and can leave patients in chronic pain with limited treatment options and inadequate support. Despite its widespread impact, we think IC remains underfunded and poorly researched. We think urgent action is needed to improve research, diagnosis, and treatment for this devastating condition.",
        "background": "We want the government to increase funding for IC research to better understand its causes and develop effective treatments. We also want them to provide training and resources for healthcare professionals to improve diagnosis and care.",
