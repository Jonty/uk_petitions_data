        "additional_details": "Thousands of women have come forward to report they have experienced a cervical ectropion as a side effect from the pill that has resulted in heavier unusual vaginal discharge or unexpected bleeding during sex. This is due to the movement of cells, brought on by contraceptives like the pill. Women then experience diathermy to remove said cells which can then in turn pose risk at pregnancy. The leaflet and medical guidance should include mention of an ectropion for awareness.",
        "background": "The leaflet given and any guidance around the combined contraceptive pill (or other estrogen based contraceptives) currently has no mention of potentially developing a cervical ectropion as a side effect, which then can cause abnormal discharge or bleeding.",
