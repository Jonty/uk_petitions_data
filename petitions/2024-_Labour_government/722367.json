        "action": "Reform The Law: Protect Children\u2019s Right to Toilet Access in Schools",
        "additional_details": "The current system creates physical and emotional harm by denying children access to toilets when needed. This can lead to health problems like UTIs, dehydration, and anxiety. It undermines children's dignity and interrupts their ability to learn. By aligning policies with human rights standards, the government can protect children's wellbeing, ensuring their right to education is not hindered by basic needs. Every child deserves the right to access toilets at school, without fear of embarrassment or restriction.",
        "background": "We want the government to amend current policies that restrict children\u2019s access to toilets in schools. The law should guarantee children\u2019s right to use the toilet whenever needed, aligning school policies with children\u2019s health and dignity, and ensuring clear guidance for schools.",
