        "additional_details": "The NHS is under huge financial pressure. A small fee for international visitors to national museums\u2014while keeping them free for UK residents\u2014could raise millions each year without burdening taxpayers. Countries like France, Italy, and Spain already charge tourists for museum entry. This would be a fair, sustainable way to support our health service while maintaining access to culture for the public.",
        "background": "Introduce a small entry fee (e.g. \u00a33.50) for international visitors to national museums, while keeping them free for UK residents. The revenue could support NHS funding. Many countries already use this model to support public services.",
