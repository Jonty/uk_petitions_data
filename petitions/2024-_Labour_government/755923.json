        "action": "Cap car insurance premiums for under-21s",
        "additional_details": "We believe this is a clear failure of government policy. Many young people are encouraged to learn how to drive for work, education, and independence, yet may be financially locked out by an insurance market with what we feel is insufficiently regulated. When legal compliance becomes unaffordable, the system can push some young people toward uninsured driving, increasing danger on the roads.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to cap car insurance pricing for under-21s through stronger regulation or alternative schemes.",
        "background": "Car insurance costs for many drivers under 21 in the UK have become excessive, exclusionary, and unsafe. Basic insurance quotes for young drivers aged 17-20 can be between \u00a33,000-\u00a35,000 or more per year, making legal driving unaffordable for many despite holding a valid driving licence.",
