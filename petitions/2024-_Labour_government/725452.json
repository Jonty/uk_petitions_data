        "additional_details": "The decision made by the supreme court to exclude trans women from the definition of women in the equality act (2010) will have negative consequences on every women's lives. This will encourage a step backwards on women's rights and will force all women to only be defined by their bodies. This will also have dangerous consequences for transgender women who need services in the medical field, as well as other services such as domestic abuse shelters. This new ruling will only escalate misogyny.",

We would like parliament to use parliament authority and pass legislation to amend the equality act to include trans women, and to research this area thoroughly.",
