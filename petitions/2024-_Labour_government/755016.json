        "additional_details": "Mandatory stunning before slaughter is widely recognised by veterinary and animal welfare organisations as essential to minimise suffering. Allowing exemptions undermines the animal welfare protections that the UK has fought hard to establish and maintain.\r\n\r\nWe believe that all animals slaughtered in the UK should receive equal protection under the law, regardless of slaughter method, and that religious or cultural practices must evolve in line with evidence-based welfare standards.",
        "background": "We ask the Government and Parliament to introduce legislation to ban non-stun slaughter of animals in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe UK has some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world, built on the principle that animals should be protected from avoidable pain, distress, and suffering.",
