        "additional_details": "Council tax increases disproportionately affect low-income households, particularly those just above the threshold for support. Many are already struggling with rising living costs, and higher taxes could push them into financial difficulty. With inflation and energy bills adding to the strain, an increase would worsen matters. Council tax is regressive and based on outdated 1991 property valuations, deepening inequalities. During economic uncertainty, higher taxes risk stifling spending and harming local economies.",
