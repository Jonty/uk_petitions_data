        "additional_details": "Weapon-related crime in the UK has been rising, raising concern about access to dangerous weapons. Crossbows are powerful, long-range weapons capable of causing fatal injuries. They can be used silently and from a distance, often without warning, which increases the risk to the public. Despite this, crossbows can be bought and owned with little regulation. A review was expected in 2024, but no change followed. This gap in the law should now be addressed as a matter of public safety and urgency.",
        "background": "We ask the UK Government to review existing legislation relating to crossbows and to introduce a licensing system to improve public safety and support effective policing.",
