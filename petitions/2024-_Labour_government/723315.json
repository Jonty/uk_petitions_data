        "action": "Increase funding for indoor sport facilities for sports like volleyball",
        "additional_details": "The UK is ranked 6th globally by GDP, we feel we shouldn't be a underperforming in indoor sports. The UK does not compete on an international level for volleyball e.g our last international appearance was in the 2012 Olympics where the women's squad finished ninth and the men 11th. As a country we take pride in our athletes who participate in sports such as athletics and football as it gives us all a strong sense of national pride. We believe expanding support for more sports would strengthen this.",
        "background": "We think many indoor sports in the UK lack funding, leading to a shortage of facilities, high court hire costs and a lack of diverse sport choices for the youth. We want the Government to allocate more funding to local sport centres/school programmes to promote participation in these indoor sports",
