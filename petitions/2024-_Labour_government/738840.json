        "additional_details": "A 2023 study suggested that 80,000 children were caught in private law cases. Delays can mean many wait 9\u201312 months, some over 2 years, without stable contact. This separation may damage children\u2019s emotional wellbeing, potentially increasing anxiety, trauma and long-term mental health risks. Parents may also face stress and depression. We believe early referrals to contact centres could reduce conflict, help protect children\u2019s bonds, support family mental health, and ease pressure on family courts.",
        "background": "Review the need for early intervention through contact centres at the point when court applications are made. We think this could help ensure children maintain relationships with both parents while legal processes are ongoing.",
