        "additional_details": "Schools are publicly funded - they rely on money from taxpayers. Requiring them to pay employer NICs means that a big portion of that funding is immediately lost, reducing the amount available for education. Taxing tax-funded institutions is an entirely unfair double tax that makes absolutely no fiscal sense.  The upcoming increase is placing even greater and unnecessary financial pressure on schools, flying in the face of manifesto promises to \"Deliver high and rising standards in education\"",
