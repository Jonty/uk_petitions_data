        "additional_details": "We believe early years providers are negatively impacted by receiving an inadequate final grade, which can lead to reputational damage, financial strain, and job losses. It can also affect the mental health of staff. In cases where Ofsted give an inadequate grade on only a single issue, we feel that these negative impacts could be reduced if providers were given a timeframe to amend this before any final grade is given.",
        "background": "We want the government to review how Ofsted conducts inspections, as well as how the results of inspections can unfairly impact early years education providers. We think that providers should have the opportunity to act on recommendations before any final grade is given. ",
