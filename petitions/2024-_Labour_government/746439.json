        "additional_details": "We are concerned that sometimes judges may listen to undocumented allegations and decide against a loving father or mother. We believe if there are allegations there needs to be evidence that a parent has a criminal conviction for that allegation and that too many living parents have lost time with their children because of what we see as false allegations where the judge doesn't ask for suitable evidence. We think family law needs to change to better help our children for their future.",
        "background": "Require that separating parents both automatically have equal, 50/50 time with their children, unless a parent has a relevant criminal conviction. We think children need both parents and it would help stop parental alienation, and having parents in a child's life helps them better progress in life.",
