        "action": "Create a fairer energy market by abolishing marginal cost pricing",
        "additional_details": "Marginal cost pricing means that households pay the price of the most expensive type of energy currently being used. This is a huge barrier to decarbonising our grid and is frankly unfair. There are currently no incentives for households consciously selecting suppliers and tariffs that are pro-renewables as ultimately they'll still be paying the high prices set by fossil fuels.",
        "background": "Switch to a different pricing model that is fairer and takes advantage of the incredibly low costs of renewable energy. Consult industry professionals on how we can develop a system that allows the low costs of renewable energy to trickle down to households.",
