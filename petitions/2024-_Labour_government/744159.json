Older vehicles have already created its carbon footprint so surely the longer you keep it the better it is on the environment.  If we are forced to replace a perfectly working vehicle with an EV or BEV which the majority of the British public do not want. The manufacture of electric vehicles inflicts far more damage to the environment than any ICE. The working life is much shorter so more unnecessary damage to our planet.",

They stifle local economy and restrict access to the lower paid by either forcing them to replace a perfectly working and cost effective vehicle and buying another at considerable cost or paying a daily charge then suddenly it\u2019s ok?",
