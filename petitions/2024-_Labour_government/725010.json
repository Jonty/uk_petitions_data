        "additional_details": "Fixed interest rates on mortgages are important because they can provide stability and predictability for homeowners. With a fixed rate for the full duration of the loan, monthly payments could remain consistent throughout, rather than switching to the standard variable rate (SVR) after the period it's fixed for, typically 2 or 5 years. We think this could make it easier for families to budget, plan for the future, and protect borrowers from sudden increases in interest rates or even foreclosure.",
        "background": "The government should take proactive steps to require mortgage providers to offer fixed interest rates on mortgages which last for the full duration of the loan. We believe this would help to ensure financial stability for homeowners.",
