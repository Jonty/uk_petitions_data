        "additional_details": "Legislate \"heritage rights\" to protect fishermen\u2019s cultural legacy, fulfill Brexit\u2019s promise, and secure livelihoods. Amending the Fisheries Act 2020 would prioritize UK vessels, especially small-scale fleets, in UK waters, countering EU access under the TCA (expiring 2026). With a UK-EU summit in May 2025, urgent action is needed to guide negotiations, prevent concessions, and preserve coastal communities. Parliament must act to ensure accountability.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to amend the Fisheries Act 2020 to recognize heritage rights for UK fishermen, ensuring their historical and cultural access to UK waters is protected as a national priority, drawing on global precedents like indigenous fishing rights.",
