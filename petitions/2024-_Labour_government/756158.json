By requiring schools to start at 10:00 AM, it could match their body clocks, cut student illnesses by up to 50%, and boost grades. It could also lower stress and keep children safe.\r\n \r\nWaking up later could also result in students being less grumpy and a happier community where children focus more on studying than staying awake or being hungry because they didn't have time to have breakfast in the morning.",
