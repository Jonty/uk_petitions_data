        "additional_details": "I believe not many people want illegal immigrants in the UK and that it's costing taxpayers when the country is already on its knees. I think there's not enough social housing for the British population as it is, many of whom may be forced to privately rent at extortionate prices, if they\u2019re even able to afford it. Some veterans are living on the streets, and some are suffering with mental health after serving and giving their all for King/Queen and country. I believe that they deserve to be put before any illegal immigrant. I don't think it is fair that illegal immigrants receive the support and accommodation that they do, at taxpayers' expense.",

Instead, I want the government to immediately return them to their home country or last safe country they travelled from. I think they've no right to enter via boats or other means without applying for and achieving a warranted visa.",
