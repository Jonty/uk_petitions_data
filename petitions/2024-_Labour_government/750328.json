Officers now take on major public-safety duties, but each mandatory qualification or refresher often costs the individual, not the employer. Some firms help, many don\u2019t. We call for a Government-led review of pay fairness, training costs, and retention so SIA-licensed staff are treated and supported as the vital public-safety professionals they are.",
        "background": "Security officers now handle first aid, safeguarding, and counter-terror duties equal to police standards. Yet pay remains low and many must fund mandatory training themselves. The Government must review pay fairness, costs, and retention to protect public safety.",
