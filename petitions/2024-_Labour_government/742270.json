        "additional_details": "Raising the tax threshold to \u00a320,000 would put money back into workers\u2019 pockets, boost the economy through spending, and restore dignity to those earning modest wages. This is a test of political will. Will the government stand with workers\u2014or keep taxing them into precarity? Fairness must be non-negotiable. We urge citizens, journalists, and MPs to amplify this call, share the petition, and demand action. Let\u2019s make economic justice a priority.",
        "background": "We urge Chancellor Rachel Reeves and the Treasury to raise the income tax threshold to \u00a320,000. The frozen \u00a312,570 allowance punishes low earners amid a cost-of-living crisis. This change is vital to ease hardship, reverse fiscal drag, and support struggling families across the UK.",
