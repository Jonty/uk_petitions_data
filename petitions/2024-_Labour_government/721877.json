        "additional_details": "We believe British citizenship application fees are unfairly high, especially for long-term residents who have contributed to the economy, raised families, and never claimed benefits. We call on the government to lower the fees for those who have lived in the UK for over 10 years. We believe it is time to recognise their commitment and make citizenship more accessible!",
        "background": "We urge the Government to lower the cost of UK citizenship application fees for residents who've lived in the UK for +10 years, who've consistently contributed to the economy through work. We believe this recognises their commitment, supports integration, and reduces the financial burden on families",
