        "action": "Hold a referendum on Brexit on 23rd June 2026 as this is the 10 year anniversary",
        "additional_details": "The political forces have told us over the years that a Brexit referendum is a once in a decade event and one cannot be held at any time beforehand.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned feel that we have done what the political establishment have told us to do, and that is to wait for a full decade to pass. Once that timeframe has passed, this reasoning will no longer hold true and we hope that the Government, no matter who is in power will honour our request.",
        "background": "If one has not been held beforehand, to hold a re-run of the Brexit referendum, to be timed for 23/06/2026 with 2 options on the ballot paper. Rejoin the EU or Stay out of the EU",
