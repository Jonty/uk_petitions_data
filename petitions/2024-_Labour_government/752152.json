        "additional_details": "\"Brick only\" schools will allow children to transition from primary to secondary without investing in expensive digital devices that are causing immense harm. \"Brick only\" still allows for emergency communications. Location 'tiles' can be placed in bags.\r\nPouching smartphones, in contrast, normalises children owning smartphones, is very expensive and locks schools into 3rd party contracts that will be difficult to leave, embedding smartphone ownership long term. Such plans should be abandoned.",
        "background": "The government should bring scrutiny to bear on the high profile movement to mandate the storing of smartphones, and, instead, make \u201cbrick only\u201d schools a statutory requirement. A review of schools that have banned smartphones from the premises should be conducted, to see such polices in action.",

The current non-statutory guidance says that schools may develop their own policies to implement a no phones in schools rule. The guidance suggests the following systems that could be adopted:\r\n\r\nNo mobile phones allowed on the school premises\r\nMobile phones handed in on arrival\r\nMobile phones kept in secure location, which pupils do not access throughout the school day\r\nPupils may keep their phones but they are \u201cnever used, seen or heard\r\n\r\nYou can find out more in this House of Commons Library note: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10241/\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for the Government to ban schools from storing mobile phones, if that's something that you'd like to see.
