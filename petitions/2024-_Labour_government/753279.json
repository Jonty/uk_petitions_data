        "additional_details": "Autistic people can face misunderstanding during police encounters, which can cause unnecessary stress or escalation. Training is inconsistent, leaving many officers without the skills to recognise autistic traits or adjust their approach. Mandatory autism training could help officers communicate calmly, reduce risks, support vulnerable people, and ensure safer, more appropriate responses for everyone involved.",
        "background": "We want the government to require the police to provide mandatory, comprehensive, accredited autism training for all police officers. This training should cover communication differences, sensory needs, de-escalation strategies and appropriate responses during incidents involving people with autism.",
