While advancements in HPV testing have improved screening accuracy, the longer gap increases the risk of missing rapidly progressing cases, especially among younger women or those with less predictable health patterns.",
        "background": "Regular 3-year screenings provide a safer buffer, allowing for timely intervention before changes become serious. Extending the interval could lead to delayed diagnoses, greater anxiety, and potentially higher treatment costs in the long run.",
