        "action": "Make reporting cat RTAs law and toughen penalties for failing or cruelty.",
        "additional_details": "Thousands of cats die on UK roads yearly, with many left to suffer alone. In my area, 4 to 5 cats are killed every week. I personally lost my own cat after he was left to die in the freezing cold rain, on a winters morning. This is happening more often, and some drivers don\u2019t care. Stronger penalties deter cruelty and neglect. Cats are beloved family, not disposable. Owners deserve to know what happened. This reform would save lives and end needless heartbreak.",
        "background": "Ammend the Road Traffic Act to make reporting collisions with cats mandatory, as it is for dogs. Raise penalties if drivers fail to stop or if harm is deliberate. Require scanning of deceased cats for microchips and fund campaigns to raise public awareness.",
