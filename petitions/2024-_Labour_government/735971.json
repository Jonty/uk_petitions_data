        "action": "Legalise and Support E-Scooters as Sustainable Public Transport",
        "additional_details": "E-scooters offer accessible transport for people who can\u2019t drive due to medical, financial, or personal reasons. They reduce emissions, ease congestion, and cause far less road wear than cars. Cyclists can travel over 30mph legally, yet e-scooters are capped at safer speeds. Rather than banning them, the UK should adopt fair regulations and invest in shared infrastructure. Modern cities worldwide support e-scooters as part of clean, efficient, and inclusive transport systems.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to legalise the private use of e-scooters and ensure they are treated similarly to bicycles under transport laws. With appropriate safety measures, they can be a clean, safe, and accessible mode of transport for those unable to drive or with limited public transport access.",
