        "additional_details": "Changing the rules now will directly affect serious mental, emotional, physical, and financial harm to millions of lives including children. It may discourage future skilled workers from choosing the UK. It may affect the trust between people and government in the future. New rules or public-fund limits should apply only to future applicants. Existing legal migrants deserve fair transitional protection from these rules.",
        "background": "We ask the UK Government to protect the 5-year ILR route for legal migrants already exist here. They followed the rules, paid fees, contributed to the country, and built their lives on this expectation. Extending it to 10 years would be unfair, harmful, and deeply inhumane to millions of families.",
