        "additional_details": "Many students revise large amounts of content for their GCSEs, often all at once. This creates high levels of stress, particularly when topics they focus on do not appear in the final exam. By giving students every topic (not question) that will come out on the GCSE exams from 2026, it gives them the opportunity to succeed and achieve the grades they want. We believe this change would support student wellbeing while maintaining the integrity and challenge of GCSE exams.",
        "background": "I want the government to allow pupils to know what topics (not questions) will come up on GSCE exams for each subject to save them from stress and feeling like they cannot achieve the grade they want to achieve. If this happens it would allow students to focus on understanding rather than guessing.",
