        "additional_details": "The PIP system is not fit for purpose. Most disabled individuals are not able to access the financial help that they need. Currently, PIP is assessed by the DWP prior to a tribunal with no review from an independent medical professional required prior to a Tribunal, where 69% of people who appealed their decision in 2023/24 won. Of this 69% who win their case, only 1% offer any new medical evidence. Further cuts and 'tightening of eligibility' will only exacerbate this problem.",
        "background": "We want the government to stop with their plan to introduce further cuts to the UK benefits system, in regards to the proposed changes to the PIP system. The PIP system is exploitative, humiliating, & not fit for purpose. The system should be assessed by health professionals prior to a tribunal.",
