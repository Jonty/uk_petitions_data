        "additional_details": "We think home schooling can be misused by some parents to isolate a child, which could increase the risk of hidden abuse or neglect. It may also be used to avoid daily routines like school drop-offs. We think that in some cases, parents attempt to home school despite lacking the skills required, which can severely limit a child\u2019s education and development. I would like more intervention to ensure a parent is capable of schooling prior to this being approved.",
