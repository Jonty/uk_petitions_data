        "additional_details": "As AI tools become more advanced, it is increasingly difficult to tell the difference between real and generated content. While these technologies offer incredible creative potential, they also pose risks, especially in news, politics, and social media, where realistic fakes can mislead or manipulate. Watermarking would preserve creative freedom while protecting public trust. It\u2019s a simple, scalable way to ensure clarity in an increasingly synthetic world.",
        "background": "We ask the UK Government to introduce legislation requiring all AI-generated images and videos to be clearly and permanently watermarked. This would help the public distinguish synthetic content from real media, reduce misinformation, and promote transparency in digital communication.",
