        "action": "Fund routine breast cancer screening from age 40 \u2013 early detection saves lives.",
        "additional_details": "Thousands of women under 50 are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the UK. Many are caught late because they fall outside the current NHS screening age range of 50\u201371.\r\n\r\nEarly detection saves lives, reduces the need for aggressive treatments such as mastectomy and chemotherapy, and lowers the long-term burden on NHS services.\r\n\r\nLowering the screening age to 40 would save lives, improve outcomes, and bring the UK in line with screening policies in other countries.",
        "background": "We want the government to lower the age of routine breast cancer screening in England from 50 to 40. The NHS Breast Screening Programme should offer regular mammograms to all women aged 40 and over to improve early detection and reduce late-stage diagnoses.",
