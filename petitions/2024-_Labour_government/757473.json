        "additional_details": "We believe it is unacceptable to expect teachers to live off their maternity leave money. Mortgages, bills, food and everyday costs are at their highest and teachers are being paid in full for only 4 weeks. It must change.\r\n \r\nDepartment of Education staff get 26 weeks full pay. The inconsistency across the public sector is something that must be addressed. ",
        "background": "We want the Government to review levels of pay for Teachers' Maternity Leave, to make those levels align with other sectors, like the prisons, fire and civil services. We believe teachers deserve:\r\n26 weeks full pay \r\n13 weeks at 90% pay\r\nand the rest at statutory maternity pay levels",
