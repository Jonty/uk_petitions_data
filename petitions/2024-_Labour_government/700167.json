        "additional_details": "The government must consider the fact that Higher Education is key to our nation\u2019s future. A Parliament debate involving MPs is crucial for raising areas of concern such as ever-increasing fees, accommodation costs, debts and an increasingly challenging job market. Parliament must consider the long-term impact on college/university students, graduates and members of the public from poorer background or those with disabilities and the difficulties they face getting a job.",
        "background": "Call on the government to reduce the University Student Tuition Fees cap from \u00a39,250 to \u00a33,000 which the Government has now decided to increase to \u00a39,535 from September 2025. This will put further financial stress on students who are already struggling with accommodation & other costs.",
