Requiring paying parents to apply for variations for travel and additional-needs costs is inconsistent and often inaccessible. This punishes involved parents and creates huge disparities between similar families. Reform is needed so payments reflect real care, shared responsibility, and the true cost of raising children \u2014 ensuring fairness and stability for both households.",
