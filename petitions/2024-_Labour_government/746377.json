        "additional_details": "The CMS system is outdated and unfair. It ignores daytime care, travel costs, and additional needs, focusing only on income and overnight stays. This punishes involved parents and creates huge disparities between similar families. Reform is needed so payments reflect real care, shared responsibility, and the true cost of raising children, ensuring fairness and stability for both households.",
        "background": "Reform the CMS so payments reflect real care and actual needs. Include ALL childcare time;\r\nBase payments real age-related costs; \r\nRecognise extra needs; i.e. medical/neurodevelopmental conditions;\r\nFactor in travel costs; \r\nApply fair caps to keep payments transparent, balanced, and child-centred.",
