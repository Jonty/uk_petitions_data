        "action": "Hold a referendum before introducing any UK-wide mandatory digital ID scheme",
        "additional_details": "Introducing a compulsory digital ID would represent one of the most significant changes to the relationship between the individual and the state in modern times. It would affect personal privacy, civil liberties, and access to essential services such as housing, employment, healthcare, and banking.\r\n\r\nBefore implementing such a scheme, the public must have the right to a direct democratic say. A referendum would ensure transparency, trust, and legitimacy on an issue that could permanently change how every UK adult interacts with government, employers, and service providers.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to guarantee that no system of mandatory national digital identification (sometimes referred to as \u201cdigital ID\u201d or \u201cBritCard\u201d) is introduced without the explicit consent of the British people through a national referendum.",
