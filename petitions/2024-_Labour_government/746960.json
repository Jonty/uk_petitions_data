        "additional_details": "Melksham has grown exponentially in the last decade and is still growing but the infrastructure hasn\u2019t. \r\nThe town sits between Bath and Swindon in Wiltshire but both general hospitals are at breaking point and people from Melksham need to travel an hour to get to the nearest A&E which is far too long plus when you get there you\u2019re sitting for up to 7 hrs to be seen. This proposal would alleviate the need for urgent care in the area.",
        "background": "Put forward a motion to upgrade the current Melksham hospital to have an A&E facility or a minor injuries unit as a minimum.",
