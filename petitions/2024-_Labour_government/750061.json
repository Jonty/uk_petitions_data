        "additional_details": "Current systems strip accents from names, forcing parents to register inaccurate spellings. This affects families with Welsh, Irish, European, and other heritage names. Supporting accented letters would modernise UK recordkeeping, reflect cultural identity, and bring the UK in line with other countries.",
        "background": "Update the General Register Office systems to allow accents and diacritic marks (\u00e9, \u00fc, \u00f1, etc.) on official birth, marriage, and death certificates. This would ensure names are recorded exactly as chosen by parents or individuals.",
