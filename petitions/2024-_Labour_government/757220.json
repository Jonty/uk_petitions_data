        "additional_details": "The government should introduce stronger regulation to reduce food waste in supermarkets. This should include mandatory requirements to prioritise redistribution of edible surplus food to charities and community organisations before disposal. Supermarkets should be required to report food waste levels publicly, meet clear reduction targets, and face penalties for repeated failure. Government support should also expand food redistribution infrastructure nationwide.",
        "background": "For five months I have investigated supermarket food waste and found large amounts of edible food being discarded. This is unacceptable during the cost-of-living crisis, worsens food insecurity, harms the environment, and shows the need for urgent government action.",
