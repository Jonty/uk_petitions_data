        "additional_details": "Many students are encouraged to get degrees required for careers like healthcare, law, engineering, teaching, and mental health professions. These degrees come with significant debt and high costs. At \u00a330,000 and above, nearly 20% of income is deducted through income tax, National Insurance, and student loan repayments. This system punishes ambition and makes it harder for people to pay off debt, save money, and build a stable future.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to urgently reform the tax and student loan system for everyone earning \u00a330,000 and above. Fairer tax rates and lower student loan repayments are needed so hardworking graduates and workers can keep more of their income, pay off debt, & improve their financial security.",
