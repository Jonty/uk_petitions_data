        "additional_details": " We believe this gives fans more control of the club and allows them to have more of a say than an outside investor(s)/ investment group.\r\n\r\nWe believe this will ensure that English football is fairer and has a better, more stable and sustainable structure of ownership for the future. We feel this will stop investors/ investment groups seeking profit over the needs of the club. \r\n \r\nWe think this form of ownership has been successful across European countries, such as Germany; which we think is a positive sign that it does work, and it works well.",
