        "additional_details": "Inquisitive working people will visit when convenient for them and their busy schedules.\r\n\r\nCurrently Art Gallery and Museum opening times are around 10am-4.30pm on average across the kingdom. Public galleries and museums were set up in the age of ennoblement - the mid 19th century.\r\n\r\nI think we can increase education levels and tax receipts from the benefits that a higher educated population brings with it from Art Gallery and Museum opening hours that would suit the unennobled such as 12pm-8pm",
        "background": "I am hoping of changing public art gallery and museum opening times to suit working peoples schedules and thus raise more money for the exchequer: from higher wages and lower crime rates which come from a higher educated population.",
