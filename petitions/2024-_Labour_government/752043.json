        "action": "Do not abolish trial by jury in any instance",
        "additional_details": "Removing trial by jury is dangerous because it hands too much power to the state, weakens public oversight, and heightens the risk of bias. Juries provide independent community judgment that protects people from wrongful conviction and ensures justice is not shaped by political or institutional pressure. The removal of the right to a trial by jury makes a mockery of this countries long and proud legal tradition, which many other developed nations have based their own justice system on.",
        "background": "We are calling on the government to ensure that every criminal trial is held before a jury to ensure fair and unbiased outcomes. Allowing a single judge to decide on a defendants guilt raises many concerns around impartiality and detracts from the rights assured for the last 800 years.",
