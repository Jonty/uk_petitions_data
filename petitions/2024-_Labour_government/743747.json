        "additional_details": "Ordinary citizens should not be required to hold Digital ID. Instead, transparency and accountability must apply to those in positions of political power. A Digital ID for MPs and ministers would protect civil liberties while improving trust in government by allowing the public to see officials\u2019 financial activity, meetings, and voting records. This will strengthen democracy and ensure greater accountability to the people.",
        "background": "We want Parliament to stop plans for Digital ID for the public and instead make a blockchain-based Digital ID mandatory for MPs, ministers, and senior officials. This ID should record financial interests, property, earnings, and official meetings, with records published publicly.",
