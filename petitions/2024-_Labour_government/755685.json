Its becoming increasingly dangerous for members of the of the general public to purchase fireworks as these can be set off anywhere. Due to the increasingly large numbers of fireworks being let off in built up areas, more residents are at risk. If a license is required for shotguns, cartridges and riffles, bullets; why is a license not needed for fireworks? They are all explosives. The volume of incidents is concerning",

Fireworks should be used as a display, in safe areas, with notice. Fireworks should not be used in built up areas due to safety precautions.",
