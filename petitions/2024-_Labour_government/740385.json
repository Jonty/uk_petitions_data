        "additional_details": "The UK is a nation of animal lovers, but rising vet costs mean too many pets miss out on vital check-ups and treatment. Just as the NHS supports people, our pets deserve a fair system that prioritises prevention, affordable healthcare, and wellbeing.\r\nThis act would ease the financial pressures of pet ownership, encourage preventative care, and recognise the positive impact pets have on our lives.\r\nAnimals are a huge part of many people\u2019s lives and we need a better system for them to stay healthy",
        "background": "We propose a National Pet Health Service, funded through a small \u201cpet tax\u201d for pet owners, which would be mandatory if you have a pet. Non-pet owners would not be required to contribute but could opt in if they wish, knowing their support helps improve animal welfare and the nation\u2019s mental health.",
