        "additional_details": "Endometriosis affects 1 in 10 women in the UK, and can cause chronic pain, and immense strain. It is also associated with fertility problems. Despite this, it takes an average of more than 6 years to receive a diagnosis. Fertility issues highlight the urgent need for accessible fertility treatments like IVF, which may remain out of reach for many.\r\n \r\nEndometriosis impacts lives, careers, and families. We think it's time for Parliament to prioritise timely, compassionate care for those affected. Act now to end the cycle of neglect and bring meaningful change.",
        "background": "We want more funding for specialists and resources for faster diagnosis and treatment for endometriosis and expand support services and fertility support. We want further investment in research to improve diagnostic tools and develop treatments. This could reduce NHS waiting times. ",
