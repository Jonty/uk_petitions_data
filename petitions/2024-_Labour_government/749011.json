        "additional_details": "Discuss legalising regulated carry of self defense irritant sprays, to thwart knife attacks, rapes and other violent crime.\r\n\r\nPepper sprays have their own risks and issues but I believe these are outweighed by the benefits of regulated carry amongst UK citizens. Study how mass knife attacks are much harder for the perpetrator to continue effectively if their eyes are involuntarily closing due to irritation. \r\n\r\nUK citizens currently have no legal tools in which to defend against these attacks.",
        "background": "Given the shocking and regular knife attacks within the UK, along with rapes and other violent individual crimes, I believe in legalising an effective self defense tool that is an incapacitating spray.\r\nLikely in the form of oleoresin capsicum (OC)/pepper spray as used my law enforcement.",
