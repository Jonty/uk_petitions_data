        "action": "Strengthen regulations for parcel delivery companies to protect consumers",
        "additional_details": "Stronger regulation is needed because unreliable parcel delivery affects both consumers and small businesses. Missing or damaged parcels create financial losses, harm customer trust, and increase operating costs for small companies. Clear national standards would improve reliability, protect consumers, and support small businesses that rely on consistent delivery services.",
        "background": "The Government should introduce stronger regulations for parcel delivery companies to ensure reliable service, proper handling of parcels, and fair treatment for consumers. Clear standards would help reduce missing items, improve accountability, and create a more consistent delivery experience.",
