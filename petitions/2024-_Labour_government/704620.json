        "action": "Assisted dying should be decided by a UK referendum",
        "additional_details": "A nationwide referendum would respect diverse opinions & show the majority decision. If approved the Government should create clear legislation with an independent overseeing body to monitor and evaluate cases, create ethical safeguards and integrate healthcare ensuring training and support systems are in place.  Conducted transparently and ethically, this approach can respect individual rights and societal values, as seen in other countries. Importantly, it would not replace end-of-life care.",
        "background": "Assisted dying involves ethics, personal beliefs, individual rights & the healthcare system. It concerns personal autonomy and dignity. Given its moral significance, a referendum would reflect the people's will and ensure public debate to amplify all voices, all beliefs, and foster democracy.",
