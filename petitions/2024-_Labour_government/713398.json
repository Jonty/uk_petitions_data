        "additional_details": "We are concerned the XL Bully Ban has massively increased seizures under DDA. We believe that many seized animals are not having their needs met, and are in some cases being returned to owners in ill health. There are reports that some seized dogs have died in kennels. We think the vast majority of seized dogs have done nothing wrong. Instead they are seized based on looks and could be held for weeks or months before assessment. We are concerned that many seized dogs may not be a banned type and could experience trauma for nothing.",
        "background": "We want the Government to create an independent national welfare team to monitor kennels used by police forces. This should include checking that staff are trained to meet the welfare standards in the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and reporting those who fail to meet those standards for prosecution.",
