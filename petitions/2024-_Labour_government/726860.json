        "additional_details": "Mandatory registration would undermine trust, interfere with home educators, and ignore why parents choose home education: the right to educate freely without interference. This is a basic human right and parental responsibility, and it infringes upon British values of educational freedom and diversity. We understand that if a child requires social services, the government could intervene, but for mainstream families, we want no interference.",
        "background": "Do not pass any part of the Bill that introduces mandatory registration, monitoring, or oversight for home-educating families. Home education should remain flexible and free from excessive government control or interference.",
