We feel that if there was an option for people to select from tuition fee loan and a maintenance loan, as with undergraduate loans, this would enhance inclusion. Additionally if tuition loans are paid directly to the University this means people receiving benefits will not be deducted money and therefore able to study at postgraduate level.",
