        "additional_details": "We think it has become increasingly difficult for job seekers to find and apply to job listings. With no standardised application process, job seekers can spend hours on applications and inputting the same information several times only to be rejected or ghosted without feedback in some cases. In other cases they can find job listings not to be accurate to what is expected by the company. This could be in terms of extensive experience levels for entry level roles, misleading information on the hybrid/remote working styles or salaries/benefits.",

We want the Government to require employers to post fair and transparent listings which include realistic experience levels and salaries/benefits, as well as a streamlined application process with feedback.",
