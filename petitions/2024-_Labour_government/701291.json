        "additional_details": "With the cost of living rising, the \u00a32 fare cap provides essential relief for families, students, and workers who need affordable, reliable transport to reach work, education, and services. Raising fares would only increase financial strain and discourage public transport use at a time when we should be doing everything possible to make it accessible to all.",
        "background": "Keep the \u00a32 bus fare cap, as raising it to \u00a33 would make public transport unaffordable for many who rely on it daily, especially low-income households and people in rural areas. Affordable fares are essential to keeping public transport accessible, reducing car usage, and cutting carbon emissions.",
