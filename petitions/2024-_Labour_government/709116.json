        "additional_details": "Britain welcomes those who seek a fresh start, those who integrate into a fair and accepting society and those who contribute to our society both economically and culturally. A large number of people feel frustrated with recent economic and governmental policies and rising living costs. Some politicians shift the blame onto illegal immigration. To prevent further division and restore the public's trust, fair legislation should be introduced to deport those that come to the UK and commit crime.",
        "background": "Introduce new legislation to deport any immigrants that are convicted of serious crime in the UK. We uphold British values: fairness, opportunity, and respect for human rights. We welcome those who seek a genuine fresh start but we also demand the safety of the public and the integrity of society.",
