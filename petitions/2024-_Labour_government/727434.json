        "additional_details": "The UK benefits from skilled professionals. The current 5-year ILR path for Skilled Worker visa holders supports growth, stability, and integration. Proposals to extend it to 10 years would unfairly penalise those who came under the 5-year rule, add stress to families, and harm the UK\u2019s global image. We urge the Government to reject this change and uphold fair, consistent immigration rules by maintaining the 5-year ILR route for current Skilled Workers.\r\nNo retrospective changes to be applied.",
        "background": "Plans to extend ILR from 5 to 10 years unfairly affect Skilled Workers who came to the UK under the 5-year rule. It adds stress, uncertainty, and financial burden to families contributing to the UK. We urge the Government to keep the 5-year path and prevent retrospective changes.",
