        "action": "Prevent the eventual evolution into a cashless society.",
        "additional_details": "Cashless societies and businesses are in nature discriminatory, certain demographics within the United Kingdom are inclined to use cash. Elderly populations use cash with approximately 1 in 5 relying on cash transactions. Homeless populations are excluded from buying necessities with cash provided to them by samaritans, the very idea of refusing a citizen access to water or food because their payment method does not align with contactless or card payments is abhorrent.  It must be abolished.",
        "background": "Legislation needs to be passed to oppose the discriminatory practice of refusing cash payments. Parliament needs to protect the rights of its citizens to use cash to purchase goods and services.",
