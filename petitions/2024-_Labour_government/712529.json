        "additional_details": "While health, policing and education in High Peak leave much to be desired, we do not see much hope of improvement allied to a struggling Manchester administration. High Peak residents identify strongly as belonging to rural Derbyshire, and share its tourism, quarrying and agriculture industries. Moreover, this merger proposal is widely considered locally as part of a blatant attempt by the Labour government to stall countrywide county council elections this coming May. It must not happen.",
        "background": "We demand that the Labour party reconsider their undemocratic plans to merge High Peak and Tameside, Greater Manchester - which we consider to be not just a mere administrative reshuffle, but an assault on local identity, local people's wishes and our democratic rights.",
