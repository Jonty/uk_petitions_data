        "additional_details": "A vote of no confidence must be debated due to widespread public outrage over two tier policing, broken promises, policy failures, and a collapse in trust. From the betrayal in Chagos to punishing farmers, U-turns on manifesto pledges, secretive immigration policies, and welfare cuts, 62% of the public now say the UK is on the wrong path. Parliament must act. Parliament is there to discuss the will and welfare of the public, this motion of no confidence is needed to restore public trust.",
        "background": "The UK faces rising public fury over lies, policy failures, from the Chagos deal and farming tax reforms, to Labour\u2019s U-turns, migrant welfare strain, and secretive resettlements. With trust broken and 62% fearing national decline, a no-confidence motion is now a democratic necessity.",
