        "action": "Make Pathological Demand Avoidance a formal diagnosis & support for families",
        "additional_details": "Despite growing awareness and research, many individuals with PDA struggle to receive appropriate support due to a lack of formal diagnostic recognition. This results in misdiagnosis, inadequate interventions, and a lack of tailored resources. Formal recognition will lead to earlier diagnosis, better understanding, and improved outcomes for individuals and their families.",
        "background": "I am petitioning for Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) to be formally recognized and diagnosed within the healthcare and educational systems. PDA is a complex profile of autism characterized by extreme anxiety which can significantly impact individuals and their families.",
