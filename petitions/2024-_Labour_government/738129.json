        "additional_details": "Restrict the ability of small businesses such as off-license shops to sponsor overseas workers unless it can be proven that no suitable UK resident is available.\r\n\r\nInvestigate cases of sponsorship abuse and hold accountable those who exploit the visa system.\r\n\r\nCreate stronger incentives for businesses to recruit from the UK\u2019s existing workforce.\r\n\r\nIt is vital that the immigration system is used fairly and responsibly, and that UK residents are given first opportunity for employment.",
        "background": "The Government should stop off-license shops misusing visa sponsorships to hire unqualified overseas workers. Instead, they must prioritise hiring UK residents, reducing unemployment, benefit reliance, and protecting the integrity of the immigration system.",
