        "additional_details": "The 2024 general election was one of the most disproportionate in British history. With declining participation in elections and faith in politics, change needs to be considered to reverse these dangerous trends.\r\n\r\nHowever, parliamentary debate on the electoral system is being stifled as time is not being allotted in the timetable, which is usually set by the single-party majoritarian government of the day.\r\n\r\nThe electoral system needs to be debated in a public forum outside of Parliament.",
        "background": "A televised debate specifically on the issue of electoral reform should be held by a public service broadcaster such as the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 or Sky so that the merits of First Past the Post and proportional representation can be evaluated by the public.",
