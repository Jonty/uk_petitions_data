        "additional_details": "Many Skilled Worker Visa holders face job shortages as some sponsors cannot provide enough shifts. This forces some to work illegally, harming the economy and reducing tax revenue. Allowing up to 40 hours per week in the same occupation instead of the 20-hour restriction, with any other company will increase productivity, boost government tax income, and reduce illegal employment in the UK. This change will also strengthen the UK workforce and economy.",
