        "additional_details": "We think the benefits of a duty rise in line with inflation could include:\r\n\r\n1. Providing a significant source of revenue for public services\r\n2. Making active travel more economically attractive, with potential concomitant health gains for the population.\r\n3. Reduced vehicle use, which could result in better air quality, environmental improvements, and quieter, cleaner, less congested cities and motorways.\r\n\r\nIt is requested that the Chancellor immediately prioritise an increase in fuel duty to help increase government revenue.",
        "background": "In 2000 fuel duty on petrol was 49p/litre. Since then, it has not risen with inflation, and currently sits at 53p/litre. We believe raising the duty to 93p/litre would raise significant revenue for the Treasury. ",
