Working taxpayers feel the system is not always fair, and Parliament has a duty to examine public concerns. A debate could lead to better, lawful solutions that ease NHS pressure, protect resources, and improve fairness for everyone.",

Supporters argue this may be fairer for working people with less flexibility to these services.Introduce nurse-led checks with DWP input checks on site which may reduce misuse, cut fraud, improve flow, & address inequality.",
