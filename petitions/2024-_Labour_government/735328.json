        "additional_details": "We urge the UK Government to extend Statutory Maternity Pay at 90% of a mother\u2019s gross weekly wage from the current 6 weeks to 16 weeks. We believe this change would allow more families to spend essential early time with their newborns without facing immediate financial hardship, supporting child development, maternal mental health, and breastfeeding continuity.",
        "background": "Increasing time with a newborn in the first 4 months can boost bonding, support emotional/brain development, aid breastfeeding, reduce parental stress and postpartum depression risk. We think extending SMP at 90% gross wage to 16\u202fweeks further enables parents to fully utilise this critical period.",
