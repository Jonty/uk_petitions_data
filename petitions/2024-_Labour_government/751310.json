        "additional_details": "The 15-year rule is unfair and punishes care workers who followed every law, paid taxes, and supported the UK during critical shortages. It creates insecurity, harms recruitment, and devalues essential work. Abuse in the system was caused by poor oversight, not workers. The government should protect honest carers, apply no retroactive changes, and create a fair, stable path to settlement.",
        "background": "We ask the Government and Parliament to scrap the 10 or 15-year settlement rule for care workers, restore a fair 5 year route, stop applying changes retroactively. Regulate employers\u2014not punishing honest workers who support the UK\u2019s vital care sector.",
