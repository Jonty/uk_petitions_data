I couldn\u2019t believe the limitations of what students are allowed to chose. Why is it that a student can partake at competition level for certain sports, such as karate but can't do the activity for GCSE? I feel it's unfair and some of the activities on the list are unreal, I feel myself karate (Martial Arts)is straight forward to assess for GCSE sports",
