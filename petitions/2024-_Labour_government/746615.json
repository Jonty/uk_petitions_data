        "additional_details": "A study conducted at Stafford University states that 56% of students considered homework to be a primary source of stress, leading to sleep deprivation, less time for being social and less extracurricular activities. From this alone it is clear to me that homework has more downsides than benefits. On that note, having a worse sleep and stressing will majorly impact the level of work students complete in school. It also adds an extra 40-90 minutes on to the average Secondary School students work.",
        "background": "We feel that homework is an additional work load that is unfair and unnecessary for students. Some students have additional support from parents or guardians whilst others do not, rendering homework unjust. There for, Parliament should abolish homework from the Secondary School curriculum.",
