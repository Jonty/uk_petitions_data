        "additional_details": "We feel that pets are cherished members of the family, not mere possessions. While the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act 2022 acknowledges that some animals are sentient beings, we feel that this is not recognised in civil and family proceedings and the law needs to catch up with how society views pets today. \r\n\r\nWe believe there is an urgent need for legislative change so that a pet is no longer regarded as a replaceable item such as a table or a waistcoat.",
        "background": "We want legislation to: \r\n1. Make a pet's welfare the paramount consideration when Courts resolve disputes over their ownership and possession. \r\n2. Recognise a pet's true value as being the value to its owner, not just its open market price. \r\n3. Require Court cases regarding pets to be expedited.",
