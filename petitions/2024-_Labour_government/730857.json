        "additional_details": "A lot of jobs have drug testing - sport especially as it has to be clean. \r\n\r\nPoliticians should be clean. \r\n\r\nDecisions made in the house have not only national, but also global reach. It is imperative that the people elected by constituents are sober and drug free. \r\n\r\nAnyone failing a breath test or drug test should be barred from the house.\r\n\r\nA law created that a by-election should take place. \r\n\r\nA WADA style doping system should be put in place.",
        "background": "MP's are the decision making centre of UK policy. \r\n\r\nIt is of national and global interest that MP's are clean and sober when making any and all decisions. A breath/swab test should be implemented before entry to the hall. \r\n\r\nDrug testing should be carried out like they do in sport.",
