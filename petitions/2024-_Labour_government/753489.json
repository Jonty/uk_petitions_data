        "action": "Do not mass rollout facial recognition cameras across the country",
        "additional_details": "A mass surveillance state is not the solution to a problem that needs solving externally [borders] not just internally. Unauthorised migration in the UK is the real problem here.\r\n\r\nStop undermining our freedoms, we do not want a dystopian digital prison. The cost of living crisis is still ongoing for many households, Digital IDs and cameras will not change any of this. This also intrudes on rights of individuals of legal status.",
        "background": "Labour cannot create a 'Big Brother Britain' with plans for a mass rollout of facial recognition cameras in cities, towns and even villages across the country. This is unacceptable. There's roughly already 1 CCTV camera for every 11 people and these numbers are growing annually (source BSIA).",
