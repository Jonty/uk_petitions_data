        "additional_details": "I have 1 family holiday a year which takes us the whole year to save for, I could not afford to go during summer holidays as the prices are around \u00a31100 more on average for a family of 4, this is more for larger families. I appreciate that education for children is vital and important for many reasons but a holiday is also a great opportunity for children to learn, develop and see the world. If they were affordable all year round then more people could have them therefore helping them also be more inclusive like other children they may attend school with.",
        "background": "There should be a ban or a restriction put in place for travel agents/holiday companies raising prices in school holidays so they remain affordable for everyone",
