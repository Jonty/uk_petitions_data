We think we need mandated defence.\r\n \r\nWe think a new cybersecurity law, modelled on previous Health & Safety legislation should be overseen by a new Cybersecurity Executive with powers of enforcement exercised centrally for large and government organisations and additional powers granted to local authorities responsible for monitoring and fining SME businesses headquartered in their areas.",
