You can find out more here:  \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/universal-credit-and-homeless-people/applying-for-universal-credit-information-for-homeless-people\r\n\r\nHomeless patients are already entitled to register with a GP using a temporary address or the practice address. You can find out more here:\r\nhttps://www.bma.org.uk/advice-and-support/gp-practices/managing-your-practice-list/patient-registration\r\n\r\nThe Financial Inclusion Strategy includes measures for homeless people to access ID and banking through pilot schemes. You can find out more here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-inclusion-strategy/financial-inclusion-strategy\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a petition calling for the Government to fund post boxes for homeless people, if that's something that you'd like to see. "
