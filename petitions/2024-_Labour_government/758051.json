        "additional_details": "Public trust in democracy depends on honesty from elected representatives. When MPs deliberately mislead the public, it undermines confidence in government and weakens democratic accountability. Voters rely on truthful information to make informed choices. This proposal would not restrict free speech, debate, or political opinion. It would apply only to knowing or reckless falsehoods, ensuring transparency, fairness, and higher standards in public office.",
        "background": "Introduce rules so MPs who knowingly provide false or misleading information face consequences. This should include independent investigation and proportionate sanctions. Wales has committed to introduce similar measures to address deliberate political deception.",
