        "action": "Create law that media outlets must refer to 'migrants' as 'migrating people'",
        "additional_details": "The Human Rights Act 1998 includes the right to life, freedom from torture and inhuman treatment, the right to a fair trial, and freedom of expression. It also protects against discrimination in the enjoyment of these rights for all. Mainstream media outlets consistently refer to migrating people as 'migrants'. This contravenes the Human Rights Act as it dehumanises people and can lead to unfair discrimination by those who consume the media. Creating this law will build a fairer, safer UK.",
        "background": "Create legislation for all UK based media outlets where they must refer to 'migrating people' instead of 'migrants' in any published materials, to comply with the Human Rights Act 1998. Using the term 'migrants' dehumanises migrating people, and could lead to discrimination and a risk to safety.",
