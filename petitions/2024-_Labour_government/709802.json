        "additional_details": "Inheritance Tax (IHT) is already a punitive measure, taxing assets that have been built through years of hard work and careful financial planning. Applying IHT to pensions adds further injustice, undermining retirement savings intended to support loved ones after death.\r\n\r\nRemoving IHT on pensions would:\r\n\t\u2022\tEnsure families can benefit from retirement savings as intended.\r\n\t\u2022\tEncourage long-term saving and financial security in retirement planning.\r\n\t\u2022\tReduce the complexity and administrative burden of IHT.\r\n\r\nIHT on pensions places an unfair burden on families. Abolishing it would protect hard-earned retirement savings and provide greater financial stability for future generations.",
