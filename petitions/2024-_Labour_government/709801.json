        "additional_details": "Large areas of tropical rainforests are sometimes cleared to make way for oil palm plantations, which can contribute to habitat loss for endangered species like orangutans, tigers, and rhinos.\r\n\r\nThe palm oil industry has also sometimes been linked to human rights abuses, including poor working conditions, child labour, and land grabbing. Indigenous and local communities have lost their land to plantations without proper compensation.\r\n \r\nPalm oil is high in saturated fats, which have been linked to heart disease and other health issues when consumed in large quantities. While palm oil is not inherently harmful, we think its widespread use in processed foods and snacks raises concerns about the overall impact on the public.",
        "background": "I want the importation and use of palm oil to be banned. Palm oil production is one of the leading causes of deforestation. ",
