It\u2019s becoming a nuisance in communities, stressful for pets, they\u2019re dangerous and it puts unnecessary pressure on firefighters. Every year it\u2019s getting worse. There was article in the paper last week of teens setting them off against people\u2019s homes. Something needs to change.",
