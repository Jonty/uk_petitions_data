        "additional_details": "There are many reports on the news about individuals being spiked. We think making spiking an indictable offence could help deter people from doing it and increase the number of people who report it to the police. We think this could help root out repeat offenders and make nightlife safer.",
        "background": "We think that drink spiking should be a specific indictable offence and we believe that new legislation on drink spiking should include a minimum sentence of 3 months for offenders, which we think would increase with repeat offences. We also believe that area banning orders should be used. ",
