        "action": "Ban tree nuts and peanuts on flights in and out of the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Nut induced anaphylaxis is the leading cause of death within those suffering allergies. A significant proportion of the population has this allergy and it is seriously life changing; and dissuades those with allergies from leaving the UK, reducing their quality of life and ability to travel.\r\n\r\nThis is a significant problem for me; as I have an anaphylactic nut allergy, of which I told the staff on the plane about, and of which they then continued to serve nuts which was extremely irresponsible.",
        "background": "I would like the government or parliament to introduce legislation to ban tree nuts and peanuts from flights. Legislation could include enforcing no nut rules on planes, with fines to airlines that do not comply; and significantly reducing nut-related products within UK airports.",
