        "additional_details": "As a young person who is writing this, my concern lies within the future of myself and others who work hard to accomplish academically. I'm worried that the effort we put in to earn our qualifications can be made redundant since, by the time we do earn them, careers we may wish to pursue could have already been taken by AI. With the recent growth of AI, it seems increasingly likely that companies will continue finding ways to implement it into more aspects which previously required human input.",
