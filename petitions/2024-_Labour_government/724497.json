        "additional_details": "Cuts are being made across the county. It is time MPs live on minimum wage. We ask MPs to stop taking pay rises so money can be better spent. All MPs are to live on minimum wage, no expenses, no second houses expenses, no heating allowance for second homes, no food or travel expenses. We simply ask MPs are expected to live on the same money as other UK residents.",
        "background": "The government are looking at cut backs. Currently what they are proposing will leave many in poverty, disabled unable to care for themselves and possibly lead to death when people cannot cope. We want MPs to stop taking pay rises and living expenses and live on lower wages like the rest of us.",
