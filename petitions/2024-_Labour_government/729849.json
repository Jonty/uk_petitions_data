This undermines the integrity of parliamentary democracy and sets a poor example to young people.\r\nWe believe the Prime Minister should be held to a higher standard of accountability and professionalism. There should be clear expectations and consequences to ensure that PMQs serve their intended purpose: holding the government to account in a respectful way.",
