In the current climate where the workplace is making strides in combatting neurodivergence and absence at work with more awareness it seems unfair that schools are not doing the same. Added pressure on parents financially especially those on low incomes makes no sense. Parents often have to have time off losing either holiday or pay to look after children who are off for this reason.",
