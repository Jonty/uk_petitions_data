        "additional_details": "We think these categories assign parent blame and therefore want a new category \"unmet needs\".\r\n\r\nWhen parents of children with disabilities (CWD) seek help, they can end up on a safeguarding pathway. The minimum criteria for a CWD Social Worker (SW) is high e.g. must have autism and a learning difficulty, which can result in families being assigned SW's with safeguarding as their primary training, rather than disabilities. These families can get trapped in a safeguarding loop which we feel breaks down trust and currently, if placed on Child Protection, this can have lifelong DBS consequences including loss of work. We want change.",

When a local authority issues a child protection plan, professionals working with the family have to assign one of five categories e.g. physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect or multiple.
