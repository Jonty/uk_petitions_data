A lot of parties had modest vote share but had nearly 0 MPs.\r\n\r\nIn MRP, you vote for a party list and a local MP. List seats match list vote share (22% vote \u2192 22% seats), with a 3\u20135% threshold with expectations (Northen Ireland, Scottish and Welsh nationalist parties) MP seats use FPTP; if a party wins 60% of MPs with 40% of votes, other parties get compensatory (overhang) seats to align seat share with votes\r\n.",
