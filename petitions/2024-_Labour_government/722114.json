        "additional_details": "In the age bracket of over 18's but under 50's there are very limited options for care. If a person if physically /mentally disabled there is a very limited scope of care that is provided. For example, The pip money given to this age range is very restricted and it is difficult to afford carers and everything that is needed for that specific illness. However, if there was a care home that focused on this age range it would be easier to get the help they need instead of being turned away.",
        "background": "In the UK the care system is not only expensive but also very hard to get accepted into. The steps in place are there to eliminate the sick from them so they do not have to pay for them. This petition is focusing on the middle age bracket in care to make sure they are being provided for correctly.",
