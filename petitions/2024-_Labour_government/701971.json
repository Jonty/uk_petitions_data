        "action": "Scrap the APD increase for essential regional flights and consider a reform",
        "additional_details": "APD disproportionately affects regional flights as it is levied on both legs of a return journey. This means that regional airline operations become financially unsustainable.\r\n \r\nRegional flights can massively benefit small communities where other modes of transport are not viable for day returns either for business or visiting friends and relatives.\r\n \r\nAPD is not and never has been an environmental tax. We believe that the UK regional sector is already at the forefront of decarbonisation efforts.",
        "background": "Reverse the increases made in the Budget to Air Passenger Duty (APD) on regional air routes which are essential to connectivity in the UK, whilst also considering a reform which will safeguard these routes for future generations with lower APD offered on a case-by-case basis.",
