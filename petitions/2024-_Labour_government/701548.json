        "additional_details": "12,000 men die of prostate cancer every year. Black men, men with a family history of prostate cancer, & men from deprived areas are disproportionately impacted. Diagnosing prostate cancer is now safer & more accurate - Prostate Cancer UK\u2019s research shows harms have been reduced by 79%. It is time to review NHS guidance on the PSA blood test, invest in proactive early diagnosis programmes for men at highest risk & drive forward the science towards a world where no man dies of prostate cancer.",
        "background": "The Government should change guidance for prostate cancer testing to make it fairer and save more lives, as well as review emerging evidence from the TRANSFORM trial to inform and improve future national screening approaches for prostate cancer.",
