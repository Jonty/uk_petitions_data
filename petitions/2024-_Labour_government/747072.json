However, one thing I was not prepared for was a severe lack of education about vision impairment and their impact on individuals. I have lost count of the amount of times that someone has grabbed me and dragged me across the road. I always explained to people that I\u2019m capable but feel this very much falls on deaf ears. I would appreciate your support to improve education around disability.",
