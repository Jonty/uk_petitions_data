        "additional_details": "With suicide being one of the leading causes of death amongst young adults in the UK, we feel as though there is not a strong enough support system for those suffering from anxiety, depression, poor mental health and more. Although there is already a Minister for Children, Families and Wellbeing, we believe that this neglects those over the age of 18, which we feel leaves a gap in the governmental acknowledgment of widespread cynicism in young adults - the future of this country.",
        "background": "Introduce a Minister, with their own team and department, focused on the mental wellbeing of young adults in the UK, decreasing indices such as suicide and self-harm rates, and increasing the overall optimism amongst the youth of this country.",
