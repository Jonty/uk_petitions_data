        "action": "Strengthen Employment Rights for Workers with Less Than Two Years\u2019 Service\r\n",
        "additional_details": "Current law can leave employees with less than two years\u2019 service almost unprotected, even if they are bullied, harassed or dismissed unfairly. Solicitors can advise against legal action, as they have less rights than those employed for two years or more. This can silence victims and enable poor employers to exploit staff. Fairness and dignity at work should be a basic right from day one, not something only earned after two years.\r\n",
        "background": "Extend unfair dismissal protections to all employees regardless of length of service and require dismissal appeals to be reviewed by an independent and impartial person. Ensure fair treatment and access to justice for employees facing bullying or harassment early in their employment.\r\n",
