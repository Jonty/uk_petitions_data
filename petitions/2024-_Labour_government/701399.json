        "additional_details": "The proposed RtB discount reduction will make homeownership unaffordable. For example, a \u00a3275,000 property would see a cost increase by \u00a390,400 - \u00a3118,400, requiring a mortgage increase of 61 to 106%. Tenants would need significantly higher buying power to afford the new mortgage, making homeownership out of reach. This change ignores stagnant wages and rising property costs, undoing years of planning. By saving earned discounts, Parliament ensures tenants keep what they have rightfully earned.",
        "background": "We urge Parliament to retain the current higher Right to Buy discount levels for tenants who have already met eligibility criteria. Reducing these discounts would create an unjust financial barrier to homeownership, undo years of planning, and harm long-standing tenants' ability to buy their homes.",
