        "additional_details": "We think stamp duty puts unfair Burden on Buyers: Buyers already face high property prices, legal fees, and mortgage costs. Stamp Duty adds thousands of pounds in upfront costs, which we think makes it harder to get on the ladder.\r\nWe think stamp duty causes Housing Market Stagnation: we think the tax discourages homeowners from moving, reducing housing supply, trapping older homeowners in homes too large for them, and limiting choices for younger families.\r\n",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to abolish Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) on residential property purchases. We think stamp Duty is an outdated tax that discourages mobility, penalises homebuyers\u2014especially growing families\u2014and adds unnecessary barriers to homeownership.",
