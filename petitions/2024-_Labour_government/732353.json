        "additional_details": "We think free, unlimited email causes inefficiency, digital overload, and environmental harm. We think a business email tax would reduce unnecessary messages, improve workplace wellbeing, and cut server energy use and the huge carbon footprint its responsible for. The revenue raised could support new schools, hospitals and homes\u2014funded by waste, not wages, and business efficiency and UK growth will boom. We think our country must lead the way in digital reform to deliver a model for a truly sustainable global future.",
        "background": "Introduce a micro-tax on business emails. This would apply a small charge per email sent. We believe this could help return to more efficient communication, reduce digital waste, and generate revenue for essential public services like housing, healthcare, and education.",
