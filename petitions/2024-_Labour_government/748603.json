        "additional_details": "With the rising numbers of assault/ sexual assault against women and children and the appalling rate of which men are being caught and sentenced, I feel it fair to allow women to carry pepper spray as not only will it make women feel safer but also hopefully deter abusers/predators from attacking when they are faced with the possibility of a painful and uncomfortable retaliation. The idea of a woman carrying pepper spray will be far more feared than jail time as that rarely ever happens.",
