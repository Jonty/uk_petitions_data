        "action": "Prevent the reduction of the right to buy discount for long term tenants.",
        "additional_details": "It is imperative to maintain the integrity of the Right to Buy scheme, without reducing the discounts that have been pivotal in facilitating the purchase of homes for individuals like myself. Therefore, I am calling for support from all to oppose these proposed cuts, ensuring that homeownership remains accessible to all council tenants. I encourage you to sign this petition, join our cause, and stand by us as we strive for homeownership.",
        "background": "Stop the drastic reduction of the maximum right to buy discount for long term tenants. The proposed minimal discounts are highly unfair for the people that have paid rent and been council tenants for 10 years or more. I would like the Labour Party to reconsider for long term council tenants.",
