The simple result is that the governing party will vote against the no confidence vote and remain in power regardless of their failures or conduct while governing the country. Thus leaving parliament and the country at risk of all types of failures. Because a no confidence vote is pointless.",
        "background": "When the governing party has an overwhelming majority of MP\u2019s over all other party MPs. Any vote of no confidence will result in a biased result. I feel that parliament should then call on a number of public members to vote in order to even out the biased result. Or request the nation to vote.",
