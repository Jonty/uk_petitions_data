It would also improve enforcement of animal disqualification orders, support safeguarding efforts, enhance public and animal safety, and strengthen existing animal welfare legislation. Appropriate safeguards should be included to ensure compliance with privacy and human rights laws. At present enforcement relies on fragmented records and inconsistent checks.",
