        "action": "Change childcare funding eligibility to be based on household income up to \u00a3200k",
        "additional_details": "We think basing eligibility on household income would create a fairer system, ensuring that support goes to families who need it most, regardless of how their income is divided.\r\nAffordable childcare is essential to enable parents to remain in work, support the economy, & give children the best start in life.\r\nWe urge the Government to review and update the funding criteria so that it can better reflect a wider range of modern family circumstances & help provide equal access to childcare support.",
        "background": "Change the criteria for funded childcare so that eligibility is based on joint household income of up to \u00a3200k rather than individual thresholds. Current rules exclude many families where one parent earns above the limit, meaning a lot of households and individuals can face financial pressures.",
