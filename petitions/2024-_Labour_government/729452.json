        "additional_details": "We also want an inquiry into historic and current forced adoption practices. Current adoption laws can cut children off from birth families via \"letterbox\" contact. This can cause lasting trauma and grief. Some judges, MPs, and adoption experts say this system is harmful and must change. We think children deserve open, safe contact and families deserve support, not permanent separation.",
        "background": "We want the Government to review the rules around contact with birth parents after children are adopted. We want them to consider replacing \u201cletterbox\u201d contact with flexible, child-led communication; mandate regular contact reviews; support birth families to avoid unnecessary adoption.",
