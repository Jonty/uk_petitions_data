        "additional_details": "There are reports that some industries, especially fashion, media, and PR, rely on unpaid or low-paid interns. From personal experience in fashion PR, these roles are essential for gaining insight and building a career, but they often come at a personal financial cost. This creates a barrier for talented people from less privileged backgrounds who can\u2019t afford to work for free. I believe fair pay would promote social mobility and boost the economy, as paid interns would increase local spending.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to review how employment rights are enforced for interns to ensure all those carrying out work are being paid at least the minimum wage. I think this would promote fairer, more inclusive employment practices.",
