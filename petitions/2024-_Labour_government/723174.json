        "additional_details": "AI is extremely harmful to nearly everything, society, education, the arts as well as the environment. In schools and colleges, AI is becoming more common, teachers using it for lesson plans and marking, employers relying on it for cheap advertisement rather than hiring talented designers. Jobs and passions will continue to be displaced at this rate, primarily the arts and communications, with seemingly everyone (Including you, the Government) using AI art. End the use before it goes too far.",
        "background": "Limit or all together ban the use of AI in education and the workplace, put measures on the creation and distribution on AI arts, and hold companies who use it to accountability regarding their carbon footprint through the use of AI.",
