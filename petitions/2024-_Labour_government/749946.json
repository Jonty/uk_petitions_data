        "additional_details": "We believe this would create lifelong savings for every citizen while reducing future pension costs and that funds would grow through diversified investments, promoting saving, financial literacy and UK market growth. We think that over time, it could replace the state pension with a more sustainable, self-funded system that strengthens both individual security and the economy. We see it as a slightly higher cost now but with potential major long-term savings for future generations.",
