        "additional_details": "EDCs in everyday products are linked to infertility, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and pregnancy complications. Black women are disproportionately exposed and nearly 4x more likely to die during pregnancy. NHS guidance is silent on this preventable health risk, leaving women and babies unprotected. Early intervention can prevent harm, reduce health inequalities and close racial health gaps. This supports ongoing parliamentary inquiries into reproductive health reform.",
        "background": "Update NICE guidelines to include EDC exposure as a modifiable risk factor. Introduce mandatory training for GPs, midwives, and obstetricians. Support Community Health Workers to provide culturally sensitive advice to at-risk communities.",
