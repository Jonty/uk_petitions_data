        "additional_details": ". EV and hybrid drivers already pay higher VAT, higher purchase costs, rising insurance and VED, including the \u00a350k Expensive Car Supplement. Adding a mileage tax unfairly targets those choosing cleaner vehicles. If fairness is the goal, the Government should raise fuel duty equally for petrol and diesel drivers, not introduce a new tax that only affects EV and hybrid owners. Withdraw eVED and create a fair system.",
