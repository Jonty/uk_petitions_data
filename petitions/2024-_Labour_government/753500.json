        "action": "Reduce or remove overtime tax to support workers",
        "additional_details": "Many people are working extra hours just to cope with rising living costs, but the high tax on overtime means they keep far less of the money they earn. This makes it harder for households to manage essential bills even when they are putting in more effort. Reducing overtime tax would provide real financial relief, make extra work worthwhile, and support workers who are doing everything they can to stay afloat.",
        "background": "I want the Government to reduce or remove tax on overtime so workers can keep more of what they earn. Many people rely on overtime to manage rising living costs, and high tax rates reduce the benefit of working extra hours. Cutting overtime tax would support households and improve incomes.",
