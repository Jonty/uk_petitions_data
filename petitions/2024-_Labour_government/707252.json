        "additional_details": "We think this ban would make it fairer and easier for victims of these terrible crimes to be able to come forward, to be able to have their voice heard. Victims should not be scared of justice but should be able to trust justice, without worrying about being judged through cross examination. Victims of these terrible crimes have had enough trauma then may end up having more trauma, from the system that is supposed to listen and care and protect.",
        "background": "We think banning cross-examination of victims of sexual abuse in court would be right and be fair to the victims of these dreadful crimes. Victims should be heard, it takes courage to stand up and speak out. We think cross examination is cruel and unfair on victims of these dreadful crimes",
