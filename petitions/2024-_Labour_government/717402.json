        "additional_details": "The Government identifies gambling as a national issue contributing to the mental health crisis. Despite this, gambling adverts are prominently repeated and shown during daytime TV.\r\nThis exposure exacerbates addiction struggles and related mental health issues, costing the nation millions annually. And we wonder why there is a crisis?\r\nStricter regulation of gambling advertisements is essential to mitigate the negative impact of gambling and support those affected.\r\n\r\nTV shouldn't push gambling.",
        "background": "I want the regulations regarding gambling advertising to be reviewed and changed to restrict the times they're shown and the frequency.\r\nSeeing these adverts on TV constantly is demoralizing and it is no wonder we have a gambling crisis.\r\nWhy endure a slew of gambling ads back-to-back on daytime TV?",
