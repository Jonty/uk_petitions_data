        "additional_details": "Request urgent review of the Bill due to breaches of GDPR Art. 5(2), HRA Arts. 6 & 8, and FOIA. Clause 14 enables access to personal data without consent; Clause 22 permits unchecked AI-based decisions. These provisions undermine due process, privacy, and the rule of law (CRA 2005 s.1), risk UK GDPR adequacy, and breach Convention 108+. The Bill also lacks independent oversight, accountability safeguards, and proportionality",
        "background": "Demand immediate pause & review of the Bill to ensure compliance with HRA 1998 (Art. 6/8), DPA 2018, Trusts Act 1925 & Equality Act 2010. Halt commodifying public data. Enforce transparency & public trust. Require equity impact & full public hearings",
