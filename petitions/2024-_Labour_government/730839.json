The law in England on campsite licenses does not restrict how many days a campsite can operate for, but a license is required if camping takes place over a set amount of days in a year. You can find more information about this here: https://www.gov.uk/find-licences/camping-licence-wales\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
