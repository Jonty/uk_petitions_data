        "action": "End Lethal Dose Animal Tests and urgently phase out all animal testing",
        "additional_details": "Animal-derived data can\u2019t be reliably translated to humans - it delays scientific progress, potentially endangering human health. A roadmap to \u2018phase out animal testing\u2019 is achievable, with stakeholder engagement and funding and expertise being diverted from animal experiments to non-animal methods. The results would see the UK as a global scientific leader; future-proofed careers and a strengthened life science sector. The move to non-animal methods is supported by the majority of the public.",
        "background": "Devised in 1927 the Lethal Dose 50% test involves giving animals increasing doses of a substance until half of them die! This horrific test is still used today, although non-animal methods exist. The govt. must urgently enact their pledge to \u2018phase out animal testing\u2019 starting with lethal dose tests",
