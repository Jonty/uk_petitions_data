I\u2019ve read a few articles saying that wales and Ireland will be doing it but no date has been set for this. This is something that should be available for everyone in the UK not just England. I\u2019ve spoken to a few people that feel this would help massively and bring comfort to parents that have lost a pregnancy/baby before 24 weeks",
