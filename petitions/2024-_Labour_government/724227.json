Unmanaged symptoms may lead to chronic illness, mental health decline, and women leaving work. The UK loses an estimated \u00a311B+ a year to due to absence for severe period pain and heavy periods as well as endometriosis, fibroids and ovarian cysts, yet a pledge to establish a Women\u2019s health hub in every area has been scrapped. We think it\u2019s not just a health gap - it\u2019s a national emergency. We can't afford to ignore it.",
