With increasing levels of frustration, it falls to the police to maintain and restore order. Lack of respect for them wastes police time too often. The police should have the right to detain all who taunt while they are responsible for upholding any law of the land.",
        "background": "Our police need to enjoy complete respect whilst helping and protecting all members of society at any time. Being taunted as representatives of authority undermines our rule of law and, in an increasingly lawless country, all police need to be able to operate with unequivocal national consent.",
