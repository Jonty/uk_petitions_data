        "additional_details": "ID cards are a huge step and one which is deeply unpopular with a large number of the electorate. Whilst the government has a large parliamentary majority it was voted for by a relatively small percentage of the eligible population.\r\n\r\nA referendum is the fairest form of democracy and the government should allow one on a change of this magnitude. If the government truly believes in democracy thrn it should let the people decide. \r\n\r\nFailure to put this to the country will destroy faith in democracy",
        "background": "The introduction of mandatory digital ID has been shown by previous petition to be a devicive issue. It is a huge change to the way we live our lives and as with Brexit, a decision of such magnitude should be put to the people in the ultimate form of democracy, a referendum.",
