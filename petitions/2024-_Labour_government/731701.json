        "additional_details": "It would allow in certain circumstances a minor to make there own decisions. Some minors don\u2019t live with there parents or are in care, and make enough to get by or want to start making enough to get by. We think this would allow more freedom from the standard system stopping minors feeling trapped, limiting mental heath responses to waiting to do things and reducing runaways, by allowing runways a legal way of not running away but solving it.",
        "background": "Emancipation is a law in the US and some other counties that allows minors to gain legal independence allowing them to be treated as adults. This could be done by proving competence or financial independence. After Emancipation they could sign legally enforceable contracts & make credit agreements.",
