        "additional_details": "AI music defeats the purpose of what music is, music is filled with emotion and personality with all of it changing from person to person. AI has no life experience and no feeling, music is empty without a soul to occupy it. AI should thus be removed due to the taking millions of jobs and the pressure it puts on the hundreds at the top who have worked for what they have earned.",
        "background": "Place a law that will stop the production and releasing of AI music to the public and on streaming platforms to stop the possibility of it charting on the billboards in the near future.",
