        "action": "Abolish 'Non-Crime Hate Incidents' (NCHIs) in England & Wales.",
        "additional_details": "The UK is rapidly turning into an Orwellian totalitarian state in which people are investigated and harassed by the police for their lawful (\"Non-Crime\") comments. According to Freedom of Information requests in 2019, the police had already recorded 119,934 NCHIs since 2014. That number has probably doubled since 2019. NCHIs are having a chilling effect on free speech, encouraging people to report those whose views they simply do not like, and diverting police resources from dealing with crime.",
        "background": "We would like the Westminster government to abolish 'Non-Crime Hate Incidents' (NCHIs) in England & Wales. We are targeting England and Wales since the recording and retention of NCHIs in Scotland and Northern Ireland is devolved to them and not therefore a matter for the government in Westminster.",
