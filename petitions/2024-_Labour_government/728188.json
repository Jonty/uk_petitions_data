        "additional_details": "We want this review to investigate mandating informed consent, improving clinician training and making anaesthesia or sedation available as standard options.\r\n \r\nMany women undergo invasive procedures like hysteroscopies or IUD insertions with little or no pain relief, which could cause severe pain and trauma. We feel current NHS standards are inconsistent and informed consent can be lacking. We urge the Government to review these guidelines to look into requiring full disclosure of pain risks, offering proper anaesthesia or sedation, and training clinicians in pain management and trauma-informed care. We believe women deserve safe, respectful treatment.",
