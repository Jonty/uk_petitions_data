        "additional_details": "Holding excessive US debt risks devaluing UK reserves. Trump's policies tariffs, deficit spending threaten Treasury values. With China offloading debt, the UK must act to protect its position and reinvest in infrastructure, inflation relief, NHS, tax relief, national expansion, and military growth. If Japan follows, Britain risks holding a declining asset. A structured selloff would fund transport upgrades, pothole repairs, energy security, defence, and economic recovery, ensuring stability.",

Selling \u00a360 billion of \u00a3690 billion owned, Parliament should adopt a structured divestment strategy to maximise returns. Funds should be reinvested in inflation relief, NHS, military expansion and others.",
