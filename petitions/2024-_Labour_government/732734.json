        "additional_details": "In 2023 the ONS found that 92% of university students reported increased living costs compared to the previous year whilst 90% of students surveyed by the National Union of Students reported that the rising cost of living had negatively impacted their mental health. I want the Government to recognize this nationwide issue. I think our education system is the world's best yet some of our young generation are unable to finance this without major debt and tolls on their physical and mental health.",
        "background": "I propose that the Government provides extra funding for housing and basic essentials to students limited by the cost of living crisis through a Student program.\r\nI believe students should also be offered free financial counselling to aid with the cost of living crisis\r\n",
