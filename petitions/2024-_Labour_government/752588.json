        "additional_details": "A significant number of men die every day from prostate cancer when we know that if detected soon enough this can be avoided.  Also, although many do not die they have to go through rigorous treatment if the disease had been diagnosed earlier.  The cost to the NHS of early diagnosis would be immensely reduced.  The expert panel on this advises against without good enough reason to sustain their decision and save lives.",
        "background": "Government should require NHS to introduce and conduct a national screening programme to detect prostate cancer early for men over age 55 years.",
