        "additional_details": "Currently the state is acting as if it is a dictatorship by telling the public they will have no choice but to accept digital ID.  To remedy this status quo a referendum is the right action to take.  Let the public decide if they do or do not want digital ID.  If the public vote no then it will end but if they vote yes the process of it going through parliament and the House of Lords would start.",
        "background": "As this digital id issue is not only life changing for everyone in this time it is also changing how our children, grand children and great great grandchildren will live we must each have a say.  The U.K. is a democracy so a vote would be the right action to offer the public on this issue.",
