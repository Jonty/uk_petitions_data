        "action": "Use existing evidence and experts to inform planning and nature recovery changes",
        "additional_details": "Many expert environmental professionals, bodies, learned societies and house builders wrote detailed, well-considered feedback to the Government's recent working paper on nature recovery and planning. They expressed grave concern about negative effects on nature and society, and lack of supporting evidence for the proposals. These expert views have been disregarded with the introduction of the Bill so soon after they responded.  It is undemocratic and reckless, and requires Parliamentary debate.",
        "background": "The Government recently introduced the Planning and Infrastructure Bill. It includes radical proposals to change nature protection law and policy to 'speed up' development and has done so without following a democratic, objective process expected of public office",
