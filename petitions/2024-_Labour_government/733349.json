        "additional_details": "In today\u2019s time especially during inflation and higher prices, I think it\u2019s unfair for the allowance to be \u00a312,570. I think it\u2019s extremely unfair and that minimum pay has not risen enough, which may result in Brits having to apply for even 3 jobs. I think this issue has caused some Brits to stop starting families and enjoy livelihood. Everyone should have the opportunity to work and enjoy life",
        "background": "A previous petition asking to raise income tax allowance to \u00a320,000 was debated in May. The government said this would cost them funding to support hospitals, schools and other public institutions which I think sounds fair. I think raising it to \u00a318,000 will leave the govt funding it still needs.",
