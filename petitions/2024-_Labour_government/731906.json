        "additional_details": "The BBC is increasingly seen as politically biased, especially in its international coverage. Combined with rising fees and the removal of free licences for pensioners, many feel forced to pay for content they don\u2019t trust or want. The public deserves a neutral, accountable broadcaster, funded fairly in a modern media environment.",
        "background": "Abolish the BBC licence fee and demand reform of its funding and editorial standards. The BBC must stop biased reporting and return to its duty of impartial, fair public broadcasting in a way that reflects today\u2019s media landscape.",
