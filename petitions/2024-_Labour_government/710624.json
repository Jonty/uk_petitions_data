        "additional_details": "The new scheme imposes unfair costs on pet owners. Vets are given free rein on how much they can charge for the Animal Health Certificate which ranges between \u00a3120 and \u00a3300 each time. Furthermore the certificate is only valid for 1 entry into the EU within 10 days of the certificate being issued.  \r\n\r\nIt discriminates agaist disabled people traveling with guide dogs, as well as pet owners on lower incomes, especially during this cost of living crisis.",
        "background": "Having to obtain an Animal Health Certificate each time to travel to the EU with your pet, costing \u00a3200+ per certificate, is not viable. The Government should negotiate a deal with the EU to rejoin the EU pet passport scheme or for an extended validity of health certificates with multiple entries.",
