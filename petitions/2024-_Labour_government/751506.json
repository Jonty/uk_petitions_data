        "additional_details": "Applying the new 20-year uncertainty retrospectively to refugees who built lives (work, school, banking) relying on the 5-year ILR route creates a socio-pedagogical crisis. This policy fosters severe marginalisation and lack of belonging. The 20-year rule must apply to future applicants, not those who trusted the 5-year route. A child born here living in uncertainty until 20 hinders identity and belonging, preventing productive British citizenship. Stability is foundational to integration.",

Don\u2019t disrupt life plans or place new uncertainty in the path of their integration. Don't create a troubled generation lacking belonging.",
