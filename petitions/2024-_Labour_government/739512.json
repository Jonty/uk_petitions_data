        "additional_details": "We believe the home buying/selling process in England is archaic, slow, uncertain and costly. Sales can often fail due to legal loopholes like gazumping & late stage withdrawals. We think these could be prevented by making accepted offers legally binding earlier, and introducing set timescales to complete transactions.\r\nWe believe these changes would help protect buyers and sellers, reduce wasted costs, and could mean the government will receive more taxes quicker.\r\n",
        "background": "We ask the UK Government to reform property law in England to align more closely with the Scottish model. The process in Scotland makes offers legally binding earlier, which we think helps reduce fall-throughs and creates a more secure, fair process for all.",
