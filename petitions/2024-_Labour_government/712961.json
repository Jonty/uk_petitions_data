        "additional_details": "For years, survivors have been failed by authorities prioritizing political sensitivities over child safety. Despite previous investigations, public trust is eroded by a lack of transparency and consistent action. A National Inquiry will provide accountability, uncover truths, and ensure uniform implementation of safeguards. Urgent action is needed to protect vulnerable communities, deliver justice for victims, and restore faith in safeguarding institutions.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to commission a National Inquiry into grooming gangs, focusing on systemic failings, holding institutions accountable, and implementing safeguards to protect children. The inquiry must ensure transparency, justice for victims, and the prevention of future exploitation.",
