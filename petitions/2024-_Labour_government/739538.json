        "additional_details": "CMS bases assessments on a paying parent\u2019s GROSS income, without taking into account the significant deductions that are made before a person actually receives their take-home pay such as Income Tax & NI.\r\nThis creates financial burden that's unfairly disproportionate for parents already struggling with the rising cost of living. Parents pay thousands of pounds a year in tax and National Insurance \u2013 money that is never physically seen. It is unjust to base child maintenance on the pre-tax figure.",
