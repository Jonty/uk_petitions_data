        "additional_details": "The current TV licence is a clearly defined, separate charge. If merged into council tax, it would become just another line in a complex bill. \r\nRight now, the BBC is directly funded through the licence fee, meaning the public has a clear financial relationship with the broadcaster. This structure encourages accountability. If the fee is buried in council tax, the BBC becomes further removed from the people who fund it.\r\nCouncil tax is based on property value, not TV usage.",
