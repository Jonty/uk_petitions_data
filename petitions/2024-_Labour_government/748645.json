        "additional_details": "After speaking to many people, and having many experiences myself - although you may leave time to make the last train home which is (usually 12.40am), the traffic in London to get from one destination to another safely makes it nearly impossible to make it to the station in time. It\u2019s either paying between \u00a3120-\u00a3200 to get home at a reasonable time for a Cab/Uber, or waiting till 4/5am sometimes 6/7am for a train home. I feel there should be one train around 2/3am in future.",
