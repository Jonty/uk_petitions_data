        "action": "Ban glyphosate use in public spaces across the UK",
        "additional_details": "Glyphosate harms bees by disrupting their navigation and weakening their immune systems, contributing to pollinator decline. It also contaminates soil and water, reducing biodiversity. The WHO's IARC classified it as \"probably carcinogenic to humans\", raising public health concerns. Banning glyphosate in public spaces will protect pollinators, reduce human exposure, and promote eco-friendly alternatives, creating safe, pesticide-free environments for future generations.",
        "background": "Glyphosate, a harmful weed-killer, threatens bees, biodiversity, and public health. It weakens pollinators, contaminates soil, and may pose cancer risks. We urge the UK Government to ban glyphosate in public spaces and promote eco-friendly alternatives to protect nature and our communities.",
