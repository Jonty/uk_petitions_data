        "action": "Redirect UK Funding from the Ukraine War to Support Vulnerable UK Citizens",
        "additional_details": "Amid rising living costs and a growing number of people struggling to heat their homes or access essential care, it's imperative that taxpayer money is prioritised for domestic needs. Many elderly and disabled individuals have been left behind due to recent changes in benefit eligibility and support schemes. Reallocating overseas military aid to support these groups would help restore dignity and security to those most in need within our own communities.\r\nThe UK must show leadership not only abroad but at home, by ensuring our citizens are not left in hardship while billions are spent overseas.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to end financial support for the war in Ukraine and reallocate those funds to urgently assist vulnerable citizens at home, particularly those who have lost the Winter Fuel Allowance or disability benefits.",
