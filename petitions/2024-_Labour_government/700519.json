        "additional_details": "Fireworks present significant risks to pets, wildlife, people, and the environment when used in an uncontrolled manner.\r\n\r\nFor pets, especially dogs, the noise and flashing lights can induce intense fear and stress, leading them to hide, pace, or even escape from homes, which is common around New Year\u2019s and Bonfire Night. Fireworks have caused tragic deaths of pets in panic. Animal shelters often see a spike in lost pets around these times, and some pets even require medication to manage anxiety.",
        "background": "I would like the government to introduce stricter regulations on the sale and use of fireworks. Specifically, I propose banning the sale of fireworks to the general public, allowing only licensed venues or councils to use them for specific, approved events.",
