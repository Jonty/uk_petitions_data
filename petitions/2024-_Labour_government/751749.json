        "action": "Keep the 5-Year ILR Route as a Legal Duty to Those Who Started It as Promised",
        "additional_details": "Because thousands of families have made life decisions and long-term plans based on the 5-year ILR route granted by the Home Office. Changing the rules after people have already started the process would be unfair and harmful. Families who followed the law should not be penalised. Stable immigration policy is essential for integration, wellbeing, and trust. Retrospective changes put vulnerable families at risk. Protecting the existing route is the fairest and most responsible approach.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to keep the current 5-year route to ILR for all Humanitarian Protection holders who have already started it, and to treat this route as a legal duty and a promise that must be honoured without retrospective changes. The route must stay stable to protect trust in the system.",
