        "additional_details": "The National Lottery generates almost \u00a32 billion annually for good causes, yet current rules prevent it funding social housing provided by local authorities or community-led, not-for-profit organisations despite the severe housing crisis. Many people wait years for a home, some in temporary or unsafe accommodation. Allowing lottery funds to support genuine social housing at social rent, regardless of provider, would unlock a vital, sustainable source of funding. It is unfair that a public resource cannot directly help those in need.",
