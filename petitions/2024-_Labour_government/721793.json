        "background": "We call on the Government to give the UK population the opportunity to vote on whether or not paedophiles should be sentenced to death after being convicted of any crime related to paedophilia.\r\n\r\nIf the result favours the death penalty, Parliament should also discuss if it should be retroactive.",
