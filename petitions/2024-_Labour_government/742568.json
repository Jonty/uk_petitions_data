        "additional_details": "If a privately owned electric scooter and a council hired scooter ride along side each other in public, the police can enforce the law against the privately owed scooter, by seizing it, yet the council version is allowed to continue the journey as it is legal.\r\n\r\nWe are requesting that this law should be amended, so all privately owned electric scooters are legal to use in public, with the common sense of being responsible.\r\n\r\nA law with this agenda does not belong in our great country.",
        "background": "In the UK, electric scooters are illegal to use on public roads and footpaths.\r\n\r\nThe council have them available for public  hire, to use in public completely legal.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to change this law, so the people that use them responsibly can use their own.",
