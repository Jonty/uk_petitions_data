The NHS, schools, housing to name a few are dangerously on the verge of collapse. \r\n\r\nI'm sure the people signing this would rather see the money spent on our services first. Or on our elderly who had the winter fuel allowance cancelled. \r\n\r\nWe want the British peoples concerns addressed before migrants.",
