        "additional_details": "The widespread availability of pornography has been linked to several social, psychological, and moral issues such as normalising exploitation, and encouraging the objectification of individuals. Studies have shown that pornography can negatively affect mental health, leading to addiction, and depression. By banning pornographic content, we can encourage a healthier, more respectful society and promote the development of strong moral values.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to ban the production, and distribution of pornographic content. This includes introducing legislation to criminalise websites, platforms, and services that host or promote explicit material.",
