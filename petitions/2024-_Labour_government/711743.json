        "additional_details": "A reaction in the speed limit will significantly reduce the risk of accidents involving motor vehicles and pedestrians when using the public roads through Brill. A speed reduction to 20mph would potenially reduce the severity of injury should accounts still occur.  Vehicles travelling at 20mph emit less emissions than those travelling up to 40mph. Brill is currently discriminated against as it does not receive the protection afforded to similar areas of population in the area.",
        "background": "The roads that run through Brill are narrow, winding, unlit at night and have few pavements to protect pedestrians.  The road have tight bends limiting visibility for vehicles and pedestrians. Children living in Brill who walk to the Primary School in Constantine are not protected by pavements.",
