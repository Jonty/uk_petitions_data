It will damage all children's educational opportunities. The Bill is silent on children\u2019s voice and children's right to education. It undermines parents and school leaders. We think it forces a digital ID on children which is unethical and morally wrong. We do not want our children's personal and private details stored for anyone to use. This Bill is another form of control.",
