        "additional_details": "Cheerleading should be recognised in all PE specifications as it promotes fitness, teamwork, discipline, and creativity. Combining dance, gymnastics, and strength training, it builds coordination, flexibility, and confidence. National recognition would ensure equal opportunities, encourage inclusivity, and highlight its value as both competitive and recreational. Supporting cheerleading would create a more varied, engaging PE curriculum that inspires students to stay active.",
