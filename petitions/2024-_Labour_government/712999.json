According to the Department for Transport, two pedestrians die and 34 are seriously injured by vehicles on rural roads each week.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn\u2019t be dangerous to walk home from school, the pub or seeing family.\r\n\r\nThis positive vision can boost health, connect communities, save people money, reduce emissions, tackle loneliness, support economies, spread joy and more.",
        "background": "If it\u2019s possible to drive somewhere, it should be possible to walk there safely too.\r\n\r\nIf there's no path and it\u2019s too dangerous to road walk, a safe and reasonably accessible alternative must be provided. Routes should be funded, easy to follow and sensitive to landowner, wildlife and local needs.",
