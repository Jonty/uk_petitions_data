        "additional_details": "We call on the UK Parliament to hold a formal debate on the rising tax burden faced by UK workers and to review the Government\u2019s definition of \u201cworking people\u201d used to justify recent fiscal policies.\r\nmany workers have experienced higher overall tax and contribution costs through changes. These increases have reduced take-home pay for millions who rely primarily on wages or salaries. The Prime Minister has repeatedly stated that \u201cworking people\u201d would be protected from higher taxes.",
        "background": "We believe Parliament should debate whether this definition accurately reflects the UK workforce, whether recent tax decisions are consistent with public commitments made to voters, and whether further action is needed to protect working people from rising financial pressure.",
