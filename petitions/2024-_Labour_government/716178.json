Being able to get a part time job whilst homeschooled can be rewarding and a blessing. It may also help families with money struggles. Kids who are in HS already struggle with getting jobs when they're 16  as they have no qualifications or experience, make it easier for them by giving them time to gain experience with a part time at 16, or even create government jobs such as cleaning streets ect.",
