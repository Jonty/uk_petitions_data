Loud explosions also cause severe distress to pets, wildlife, and veterans with PTSD. Replacing fireworks with cleaner alternatives like drone shows or laser displays could reduce environmental harm, protect vulnerable groups, and promote safer, more inclusive celebrations that everyone can enjoy without fear, disruption, or health risks.\r\n \r\nUpdate firework rules to support cleaner and quieter alternatives that reduce air, noise and light pollution.\r\n",
