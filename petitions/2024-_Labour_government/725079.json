        "additional_details": "I call on the Government to reduce the age that NHS staff receive their NHS pension to 55. Working in the NHS can be physically and emotionally tough. Doing so for decades may have a negative impact on the health of NHS staff. Many staff in their 50s and 60s are suffering with musculoskeletal problems and mental health issues. We think reducing the retirement age could ease the strain on older staff, open up more opportunities for younger staff and boost staff morale.",
        "background": "Many members of the Police, Fire and our Armed Forces currently have a retirement age of 55. NHS staff do not currently have the same retirement age, with most staff needing to work until 65 to retire.",
