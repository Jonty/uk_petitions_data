        "action": "Prioritise NHS workers for medical care",
        "additional_details": "Staff shortages impact on other staff causing excessive workloads and pressure which adds to the sickness levels.  It is imperative that NHS workers are off work for the least time to enable other patients to be treated as soon as possible.  The cost to the NHS for sickness would be reduced and could go towards recruitment to even further reduce waiting lists.  Staff are waiting many months for treatment so recovery takes longer when they could have been treated and back to work helping patients",
        "background": "By prioritising NHS workers to get early treatment they can get back to work earlier and help reduce the waiting lists which are impacted by staff shortages.  In Covid, NHS workers were prioritised for vaccines so it has already been recognised the importance of supporting the health of NHS workers.",
