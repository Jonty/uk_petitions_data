If insurance prices become unaffordable, people risk driving uninsured (which raises costs for everyone) or being unable to get to work, education, or healthcare. This deepens inequality and limits economic participation, especially for low-income families, young drivers, and rural residents.\r\n\r\nSo, capping or making insurance more affordable isn\u2019t just consumer protection \u2014 it\u2019s an investment in economic inclusion and social mobility.",
