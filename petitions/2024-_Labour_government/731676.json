She was a beautiful soul, a loving mother  and now her little girl is grew up without her mum! Domestic violence doesn\u2019t just affect adults it shatters children\u2019s lives too. Kids witness abuse, grow up in fear, and many are left to deal with trauma, grief, or even the loss of a parent. Yet in schools, we barely talk about it.",
