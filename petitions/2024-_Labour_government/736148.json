The EUSS allows EU nationals (parents) that obtained British citizenship through naturalisation to apply for children under 25yr to join them in the UK. We think the same rules afforded to EU nationals should apply to British citizens to sponsor their adult children. We believe the current rules result in unintended discrimination.",
