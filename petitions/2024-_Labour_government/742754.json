        "additional_details": "The six-week summer holiday is difficult for working parents to manage and costly for families. It can also make returning to school harder, especially for children with neurodiversities. A five-week summer break with a flexible week would ease childcare pressures, allow families to holiday outside peak times, and support smoother transitions for children back into school.",
        "background": "Reduce the summer holiday from 6 to 5 weeks and allow schools to use the extra week flexibly during the academic year, outside exam periods and excluding Years 10 and 11 to allow full exam prep.",
