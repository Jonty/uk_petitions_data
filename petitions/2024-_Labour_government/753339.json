Legal recognition of Femicide will expose the true scale of the crisis, send a clear judicial message that misogynistic murder is unacceptable, and provide the clarity needed for effective, life-saving prevention strategies across the UK.",
        "background": "Femicide is the misogynistic killing of women and girls, intrinsically linked to their gender. It encompasses not only intimate partner violence but also other forms of targeted gender-based violence, such as honour killings and the murder of women involved in sex work.",
