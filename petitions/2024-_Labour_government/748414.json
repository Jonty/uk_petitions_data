        "additional_details": "Shortly after my marriage, I was contacted with an urgent 'need to know' Clare's Law procedure. Had this been read to me only 4 months earlier, I would have had a very good reason to not go through with a marriage. I would have had something to protect me and my children. I have since been left with complex PTSD, a DRO from the severity of the emotional, mental, financial and physical abuse in that relationship. Had Clare's Law been interlinked with giving notice of marriage this could have been prevented.",
        "background": "Such an alliance with registry offices will hopefully prevent the physical and financial abuse that can be prevented by alerting a woman to the fact that she is about to marry a known abuser. ",
