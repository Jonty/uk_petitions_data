Recognizing aging as a disease would shift focus to preventative healthcare and promote treatments targeting aging, not just its symptoms.\r\n\r\nThis change would enable funded clinical trials to develop therapies to slow, halt, or reverse aging. Doctors could prescribe these treatments, improving health, and extending lifespan.",
