        "additional_details": "I think we need more freedom to do activities on land such as, camping. I believe the current 'right-to-roam' law is very limited to what you can do on land. Activities like: canoeing, rowing, sailing, and swimming such be allowed on inland water, also including walking, cycling, horse-riding, and wild camping. I think allowing this will encourage more people to be outdoors without the fear of being asked to move along or potentially being fined and could encourage physical fitness.",
        "background": "I believe we should have a 'right-to-roam' law similar to Scotland's. This because I do not think we have enough freedom on land. Such as, wild camping for example. This will allow people to access most land and inland water for non-motorized activities.",
