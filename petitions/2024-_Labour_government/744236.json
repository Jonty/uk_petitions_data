        "additional_details": "Ever since the 2024 election, virtually every decision and non-decision made by the Labour Government has been non-democratic in that it has been contrary to the wishes of the British people, financially catastrophic or at best utterly inept, culturally incompetent and apparently designed to reduce the quality of life of every citizen while ensuring that the population becomes as impoverished as possible, as quickly as possible. The word 'treachery' seems an entirely appropriate description.",
        "background": "The Labour majority is not only undeserved but is also a major impediment to the change of government that the country so desperately needs. Britain is already bankrupt and I believe the nation is doomed unless we can achieve competence governance, and as quickly as possible.",
