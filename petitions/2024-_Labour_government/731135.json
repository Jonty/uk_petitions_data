        "action": "Do not fund the BBC through taxation or extend the licence to streaming services",
        "additional_details": "Funding the BBC through taxation (including Council Tax) removes the public\u2019s ability to opt out and unfairly forces payment from those who may not use TV services. This turns the licence fee into a compulsory tax, which we strongly oppose. We also call on the Government to reject any proposals to extend the scope of the BBC licence fee to include the use of commercial streaming platforms like Netflix and others. \r\nPeople who do not use BBC services should not be required to pay a licence fee.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to protect individual choice by:\r\nKeeping the BBC licence fee separate from Council Tax or any form of general taxation and not extending the BBC licence fee to cover streaming services \r\nI would like that the licence fee not to be included on other channels Like ITV UKTV",
