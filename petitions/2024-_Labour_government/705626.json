        "action": "Legalise marijuana for people over the age of 18.",
        "additional_details": "I believe that with the legalisation of marijuana in the UK crime rates will drop and people will have lessened urges to go out and cause trouble.\r\nThe market is already worth an incredible amount of money and the economy could benefit from taxing this trade. Keir Starmer has driven this country and our economy into the ground and legalisation may be our saving grace. I understand that this is a big law to change, but I hope people understand my point of view, and I hope parliament does too",
        "background": "Parliament should legalise marijuana in the UK, open dispensaries, and only allow people 18 years of age or older to purchase it. Selling marijuana without a proper licence should remain illegal, however purchasing from a legitimate business should not be illegal.",
