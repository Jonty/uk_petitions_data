        "additional_details": "Since 1965 the motorway speed limit has sat at 70mph since the temporary trial. Although there was a reduction in crashes due to the lower speed, this is not representative of the modern day. Average braking distances in 1965 at 70mph did not factor in modern tyres and anti-lock braking systems as well as technological advancements as we see in cars today such as Audi pre sense. I believe that the speed limit should be raised to 80mph as technology has advanced but the rules of the road haven't.",
