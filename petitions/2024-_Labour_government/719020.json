        "additional_details": "Tamworth Council, in a change of decision made by the previous council, has unjustifiably moved the location of a popular street vendor, known as Spudman, causing him considerable upheaval and loss of business. Spudman, beloved in our community for years, has faithfully served customers at his original location. It's also worth noting that small businesses, such as Spudman's, hold significant importance to local economies.",
