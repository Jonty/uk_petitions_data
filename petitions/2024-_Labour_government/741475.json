        "additional_details": "I was diagnosed with ARFID when I was a teen. I was dismissed from the eating disorder team due to them not treating ARFID (an eating disorder). My BMI reached 13.9 and I was in and out of hospital. Due to not getting the support I needed while growing up the effects it had on me were iron deficiency anaemia, other vitamin deficiencies and borderline bone density. I am very lucky to be alive but I still face struggles and cannot get adequate support on the NHS.",
        "background": "In many cases, support from NHS eating disorder services is not given to people with ARFID. We think this support is crucial and should be mandatory. If left untreated, ARFID can be life threatening. People can miss out on education and life events, and can lack energy to do basic daily activities.",
