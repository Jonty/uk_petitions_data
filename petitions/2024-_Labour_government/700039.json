On top of this, you have to pay for the visa itself. \r\n \r\nWe believe the current cost of the IHS is not fair to families who want to be together, and that there is no justification for an increase in the IHS fee from \u00a31,872 to \u00a33,105 for a 3-year family visa, other than to prevent families from being together. I understand many people want immigration to be reduced, but families need to be together. \r\n",
