        "additional_details": "I urge the UK government to reassess pet travel restrictions that challenge pet owners. Allowing pets to travel between the UK and Continental Europe with valid health documentation would promote family unity and responsible ownership. A trial program at key airports, such as Liverpool, would be a valuable first step in modernising our approach to pet travel, reflecting the needs of today\u2019s pet owners.",
        "background": "I urge the UK government to reconsider the current pet travel restrictions by permitting pets to enter and exit the UK from Europe with valid passports and health certificates, including proof of vaccinations and deworming. A pilot program at Liverpool Airport could facilitate this change.",
