        "additional_details": "I believe that Road Safety is a vital part of every child\u2019s education, but teaching it currently seems to be optional. As already stated, there is a high volume of road traffic accidents which can result in devastating consequences. I believe that our education system has a responsibility to protect lives, inform young people about inherent dangers especially given the distraction of mobile phones. Some 6th Formers can drive to school and I wish to see greater emphasis on ensuring their safety.",
        "background": "I petition that the Department of Education includes Road Safety awareness as a mandatory part of the National Curriculum. There are statistics suggesting a disproportionate number of young people are either killed, sustain life changing injuries or are seriously hurt on the roads.",
