        "additional_details": "Universal Credit fraud has greatly impacted UK taxpayers, with \u00a35.6 billion lost in 2022 alone.  To address this, the government should restrict overseas travel for claimants who can work but choose not to, preventing misuse of public funds on foreign holidays. Domestic travel within the UK would remain permitted, supporting the local economy. Exemptions can be made for emergencies, such as bereavements. This would encourage employment and ensure benefits are directed to those genuinely in need.",
        "background": "The government should restrict overseas travel for those on Universal Credit who can work but choose not to. This would stop taxpayer-funded holidays while still allowing UK travel, keeping money in the local economy. This would incentivise work and reduce system abuse.",
