        "additional_details": "Currently nurses who work in the NHS have to pay the NMC annual fee for their professional nursing PINs to work. This costs over \u00a3100 a year (soon to be increased). \r\n \r\nThis is another cost added on for nurses in the NHS and we think it is unfair because they are delivering a service. By offering funding to pay for NMC PINs, the government could remove additional financial stress but also encourage other nurses to join the NHS. This could help drive up the number of nurses and improve services and safe care.",
