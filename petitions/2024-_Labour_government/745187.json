        "additional_details": "We call on His Majesty\u2019s Government to hold an immediate general election. Trust has collapsed as citizens\u2019 concerns are disregarded and freedoms threatened. \r\n\r\nDemocracy requires accountability. When petitions with millions of signatures are disregarded and surveillance measures continue to expand without transparent debate, confidence in our democratic system is lost. \r\n\r\nA new mandate is urgently needed to restore accountability and safeguard liberty.",
        "background": "We are being consistently ignored, monitored and dismissed. Millions spoke out against digital ID, yet government presses ahead. The UK is sliding towards dictatorship. We demand an immediate general election to protect our freedom and our democracy. We have lost all trust.",
