        "action": "Remove Standing Charges from fuel without raising unit costs",
        "additional_details": "I want the Government to remove Standing Charges on fuel because Charges bear no relation to the amount of fuel used. They increase bills. They hurt consumers already beset with the cost of living. Many disabled, of all ages; pensioners who have worked all their lives, have an occupational pension which stops them, getting Pension Credit, people living in damp, mouldy houses which they can't afford to repair, all need heating, or they may end up in hospital repeatedly ,thus burdening the NHS.",
        "background": "Fuel companies use standing charges to pay for provision of services, yet make huge profits which should be used for the purpose.  Offgem is considering raising unit charges  even more to offset the loss to the fuel companies, but this will place more burden on the consumer.",
