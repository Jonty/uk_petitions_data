        "additional_details": "Many voters cast their vote based on a party\u2019s values, manifesto, and leadership \u2014 not solely the individual candidate. When an MP changes party or becomes independent mid-term, the political mandate given by their constituents is undermined.\r\n\r\nThis ensures accountability, maintains public trust, and respects the democratic process. A change of political alignment should be validated by the people who elected that representative.",
        "background": "Require that any MP who leaves the political party they were elected under must trigger an automatic by-election. Voters should not be represented by someone who no longer aligns with the party they originally supported at the ballot box.",
