        "additional_details": "London is the seat of power\u2014home to Parliament, the monarchy, and major institutions. Its mayor influences national policy, spending, and global representation. Yet only Londoners vote. This creates imbalance and fuels resentment. A national vote would restore fairness, reflect reality, and give all citizens a voice in who leads the capital.",
