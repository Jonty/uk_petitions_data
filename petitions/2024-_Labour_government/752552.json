With the UK\u2019s falling birth rate and the Government\u2019s aim to get parents working, procedures must not undermine it. We ask for:\r\n \r\n\u2022 Ability to backdate eligibility codes when parents can prove they were eligible.\r\n\u2022 Annual reconfirmation, or require parents to notify HMRC when no longer eligible\r\n\u2022 Clearer eligibility codes with explicit start dates\r\n\u2022 An accessible online route to request backdating\r\n\u2022 Let nurseries verify codes at term start.\r\n",
        "background": "We call on the Government to introduce legislative and operational changes to the administration of 30 hours free childcare entitlement so that eligible parents are not exposed to avoidable financial hardship and emotional distress caused by short reconfirmation windows and unclear wording.",
