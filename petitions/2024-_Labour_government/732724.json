        "additional_details": "Cutting the Right to Buy discount so steeply stops many from ever owning a home. People who grew up in care and those in low-income families are likely to have no family wealth or inheritance to rely on. Keeping the higher discount helps them get on the property ladder and build security. This is completely the wrong direction and we need to break cycles of disadvantage. Please reverse this unfair change or at the very least reach a fair compromise for those with considerable challenges.",
        "background": "Reinstate the higher Right to Buy discount, reversing the drastic cut to \u00a316,000. This scheme should keep the original maximum of \u00a3134,000 to ensure council tenants, especially vulnerable groups such as care leavers or domestic abuse survivors, can afford to buy their homes.",
