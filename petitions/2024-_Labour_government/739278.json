        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to introduce legislation making it a criminal offence to burn, deface, or otherwise desecrate the Union Flag or the national flags of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nThis law would send a clear signal that our flags deserve dignity and respect. It would not prevent legitimate protest or free speech but would ensure that our national symbols cannot be wilfully disrespected in ways that divide communities and dishonour those who have served under them.",
        "background": "The Union Flag and the national flags of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland are powerful symbols of our shared history, values, and identity. They represent the sacrifices of past generations and the unity of our communities today.",
