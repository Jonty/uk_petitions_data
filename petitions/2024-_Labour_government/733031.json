        "action": "Remove the 20-hour work limit for sponsored care workers to ease staff crisis",
        "additional_details": "Care homes across the UK face severe staff shortages while many sponsored care workers want to work more hours but are restricted by the 20-hour weekly limit. Often, their main sponsor offers low or no hours, leaving them unable to earn enough while shifts go unfilled. Removing this cap will help workers support themselves, ease pressure on care providers, and ensure vulnerable people get the care they need. It\u2019s a practical step to address the staffing crisis in health and social care.",
        "background": "We want the Government to remove or increase the 20-hour weekly work limit for sponsored care workers so they can take more hours with agencies when their main sponsor offers low or no hours. This will help ease the care staffing crisis and allow workers to support themselves.",
