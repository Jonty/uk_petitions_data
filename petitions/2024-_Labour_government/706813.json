        "action": "Abolish the TV licensing fee.",
        "additional_details": "In this era of digital and internet technology, the majority of the population may have shifted towards the several alternatives available for watching online content, instead of relying on traditional television. Due to the outdated system of the TV licensing fee, people are unnecessarily subjected to financial pressure which could be alleviated by revising or completely scrapping this rule.",
        "background": "The TV licensing fee is a personal matter of concern for me and many others because of its archaic nature. We believe this old-fashioned fee, which can put many families into financial hardship, is no longer relevant in our modern digital age.",
