        "additional_details": "It is unclear as to the level of care Mauritius feel towards the Chagossian people. Mauritius is 2,000 kilometres from the Chagos Islands. How is that workable? It is not. Turning the Chagos Islands over to Mauritius is a dangerous and ridiculous proposition. Other dangerous countries; China or Russia for example, will take the Islands over for their own nefarious use which will put the whole of the World in peril.",
        "background": "The government must cease their plan to hand over the Chagos Islands to a foreign country (Mauritius) that has no claim on the Islands. The Island belongs to the Chagossians. They and they only must make the final decision as to what will happen to their homeland.",
