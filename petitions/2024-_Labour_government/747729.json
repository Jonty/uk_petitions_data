To force anyone of Christian faith to accept combined digital ID with any form of payment bartering/system or to prevent anyone from been able to make payment for any service or goods without digital ID is forcefully indoctrinating revelations 13:17 tearing them away from God, the church and condemning them to eternal damnation.",

Forcing digital payment on any Christian would be discriminatory against the FAITH.",
