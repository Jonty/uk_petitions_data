        "additional_details": "These vehicles are preserved at considerable personal expense.\r\nMany classic cars have a lower overall carbon footprint than new vehicles when their decades of existing service are factored in. Most are driven sparingly. \r\nThe tax savings owners receive go directly towards maintenance, insurance, and proper storage, ensuring these cars survive for future generations to appreciate and study.\r\nThe classic car sector contributes nearly \u00a33 billion in taxes annually to the UK economy.",
        "background": "There is a discussion that the government will start taxing classic cars over 40 years old. Classic cars must continue to be tax exempt.",
