        "additional_details": "ONS data shows a 10% rise in overall crime last year. Yet, significant police resources are allocated to non-crime hate incidents, social media posts, and speech matters. This diverts attention from serious crimes and undermines the UK\u2019s proud tradition of free and open debate, fostering concerns of Orwellian overreach. We urge the Government to prioritize tackling harmful criminal threats while protecting the right to robust discussion without fear of disproportionate state intervention.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to ensure police prioritize serious crimes like violent offenses, organized crime, knife crime, domestic abuse, theft, and cybercrime. Police resources should focus on real threats to public safety, not on non-crime hate incidents or subjective speech matters.",
