        "additional_details": "I would like the government to implement a personal care cap as I find it unjust that people who worked all their lives and saved for their old age, but unfortunately are unable to remain living independently due to illness or disability, are obliged to pay 100% for their care until their capital falls below the means-test threshold of \u00a323,250. A cap would mean that you still contribute to your personal care but people may be able to retain ownership of property or some savings.",
        "background": "A care cap was due to come into force in England in October 2025. It would have meant that no one would have to pay more than \u00a386,000 in England for their personal care. This was postponed and finally abolished by the previous and current governments. I feel strongly that it should be implemented. ",
