        "action": "Increase the maximum assisted speed for e-bikes from 15.5 mph to 18.5 mph",
        "additional_details": "We believe a maximum assisted speed of 18.5 mph offers a more natural and comfortable riding pace, and would better enable e-bike users to fully utilize their gears and the bike's potential, and enhance the riding experience. A higher speed limit could also reduce the inclination to illegally modify e-bikes to bypass the current restrictive limit. The change aims to improve safety, efficiency, and enjoyment for e-bike users, fostering a modern approach to transportation.",
        "background": "By increasing the speed to 18.5 mph (30 km/h) this will increase road safety by enabling Ebikes to keep pace with motorised vehicles, helping traffic flow and reducing frustration of both road users. 30 km/h matches many European city limits, so easy for manufacturers to make one modification.",
