        "additional_details": "The Racing industry is a living breathing organism involving punters, owners, trainers, jockeys, stable staff, racecourse staff and supporting staff and bookmakers. Any weakness in this chain could destroy the industry. Putting a Betting Tax on Horse racing, which is totally different to online casinos and games of chance, as it requires judgement and skill, would result in lower attendances at racecourses and betting shops affecting turnover that can be pumped back into the industry.",
        "background": "Stop the Government from putting a Betting Tax on British Horse Race Betting.  Such a Tax could prove disastrous for the British Racing industry which employs more than 85000 staff, ranging from owners, punters, trainers, jockeys, stable staff, racecourse staff, supporting staff and bookmakers.",
