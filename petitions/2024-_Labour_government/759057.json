She sustained horrific, traumatic injuries, she did not make it after fighting for her life. I had to see that, whilst people were eating tea we were digging a hole in the ground. It\u2019s disgusting that someone can do that, cause that hurt and just go about their day & life. Why dogs and not cats?",

They are loved pets just as much, they deserve that dignity just as much! Stopping, taking action & reporting should be a legal requirement!",
