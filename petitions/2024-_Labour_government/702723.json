        "additional_details": "By reducing the pension age people are less likely to be worn out! They also find it difficult to maintain a full time job. Finding work also becomes an issue as no one wants to employ tired older people. This is hard for manual labour jobs, trying to find easier jobs which are less physically demanding is hard. This will free up working positions for the younger generation. Less stress on the NHS because their will be less stress.",
        "background": "Reduce the pension age. People who have worked since the age of 16 are tired. Their bodies can't physically do it. Especially those who have worked all their lives and given full contributions. More so for those who have done manual labour and physical jobs.",
