        "additional_details": "I think the Day is a significant piece of British cultural heritage, and making it a public holiday would help preserve this aspect of our national identity.\r\n \r\nI believe in an era of rising climate awareness, a holiday celebrating our historic connection to weather patterns would promote eco-consciousness and our traditional relationship with nature.\r\n \r\nI also think a new summer holiday could boost domestic tourism and create economic opportunities for the hospitality and entertainment sectors.",
        "background": "I feel St Swithin's Day takes us back to ancient core values of the British and the origins of paganism. An old saying is that this day's weather dictates the weather for 40 days after. More importantly, I think we need a Bank Holiday to break up the distance from Spring to end of Summer holidays.",
