        "additional_details": "Drivers are being punished by confusing signage, tiny unreadable print and zero grace time. Some companies issue \u00a3100 fines within seconds even when drivers never leave their cars and stop only to understand the rules or escape safely. We think this system is unjust, predatory and damaging public trust. Urgent regulation is needed to protect motorists from abuse. These practices hit ordinary workers, families and vulnerable people the hardest and make driving stressful and unsafe.",
        "background": "Review and strengthen private parking regulation to stop unfair fines. Ban tickets for brief stops to read signs or turn safely. Require mandatory grace periods, automatic refunds for unfair charges, penalties and criminal liability for abusive parking companies so drivers are treated fairly.",
