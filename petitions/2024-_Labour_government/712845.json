        "additional_details": "I think that performance awards should consider:\r\n \r\n- Time served in office\r\n \r\n- Relative wellbeing of the populace and overall satisfaction of the PM\u2019s performance\r\n \r\n- General diplomatic ability\r\n \r\n- Performance on the world stage, including economic success, consideration of any warmongering and other avoidable scandals\r\n \r\nI think election manifestos should be balanced against end of term outcomes.",
        "background": "I think the government must be held accountable, should deliver upon manifesto pledges and should lead by example. I propose pensions for former PMs be performance-based, starting at basic state pension with extra points awarded for the general state of the country upon retirement from office.",
