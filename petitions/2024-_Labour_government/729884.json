Staff will be contacting representatives from these groups & others requesting support - we need your support. Darzi is ignored, reorganisation, his recommendations focus on making the existing structure work better without upheaval. Mergers & TUPE  transfers continue, this hindered rather than helped the NHS",
        "background": "ACT - ASAP - NHS staff face unfair job losses after a transfer, they are leaving, anxious & sick with worry about their future and the impact on NHS patients. If redundancies continue unchecked, the ripple effect could harm patient care & beak the NHS Job Losses and the endless cuts.",
