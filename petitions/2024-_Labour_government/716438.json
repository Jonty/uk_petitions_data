We think this is unfair, especially for some families who may face high costs during school holidays potentially to avoid term-time absence fines. We believe it may affect low-income families hardest. We think if the seat will still be used, it\u2019s reasonable to allow a name change or refund. We would allow airlines to charge a fair fee to cover admin costs, balancing consumer rights with business needs. ",
