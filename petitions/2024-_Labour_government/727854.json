In the UK, the laws against people who make false rape claims are very light or they get no justice at all. We want people who make fake rape allegations to be registered as sex offenders as their crimes relate to sexual activity and also for the public and employers to know about these people and be wary of them",

We want all employers to know that this person has had a history of filing false rape charges against another innocent person and for the public to know of people such as them.",
