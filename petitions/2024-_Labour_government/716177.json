        "additional_details": "Football is an outlet for many that brings ups and downs, our great sport has been plight with referees inconsistent decisions over similar instances over the years. Why are they not held to account for their actions? Players & mangers have to put up with this from the media & public on a weekly basis yet officials can greatly effect the outcome of games with an incorrect decision only to release a half asked non apologetic statement. As a nation of great sporting history we should act as such.",
        "background": "I would like parliament to sanction the creation of an independent regulator to oversee/over haul our rather inept standards of officiating in English football. To also hold referees accountable for their actions, in the same way players & mangers are scrutinised by media & public after every game.",
