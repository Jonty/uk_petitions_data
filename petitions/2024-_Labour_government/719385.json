        "additional_details": "Gambling harms are a serious public health issue, causing financial, relationship, and psychological distress, and are associated with suicide. The Government has reformed research funding to prevent conflicts of interest, yet politicians\u2014who shape gambling laws\u2014can still accept industry donations and hospitality. We think this compromises policy integrity and public trust. We think MPs and political parties should be held to the same ethical standards and policy rules that are now applied to public health funding.",
        "background": "We welcome recent policy change, including a statutory levy on gambling companies. We think it will ensure research, prevention, and treatment are free from undue influence. However, political parties and MPs can accept donations and hospitality from industry. We think this loophole must be closed.",
