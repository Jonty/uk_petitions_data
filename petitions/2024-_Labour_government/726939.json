Bratton\u2019s rural character will vanish, replaced by urban sprawl. Nearby areas like Shawbirch and Allcott are already struggling with overdevelopment. Instead, the government should use brownfield sites, ensuring sustainable growth without destroying farmland and green spaces.",

Prioritize brownfield sites over green spaces, protect Bratton\u2019s rural character, and prevent overcrowded roads, schools, and services. Choose sustainable growth, not urban sprawl. Preserve our community and environment.",
