        "additional_details": "Firework usage in local communities has become excessive, with neighbourhoods having to be exposed to fireworks throughout the winter period often nightly. This has a significant effect of pets in the local areas, as well as disruption of peace when police are unable to enforce curfews over the night. In Glasgow, fireworks are often used in illegal ways, but due to the prohibited sale of fireworks these laws are unable to be reinforced and therefore not sufficient.",
