        "additional_details": "We came to the UK legally, on the promise of ILR after 5 years. Many of us are skilled workers, taxpayers, parents, and frontline staff who\u2019ve built our lives here. Changing the rules mid-journey is unjust and deeply destabilizing. It breaks legal expectation, disrupts families, and sends the wrong message to those who contribute in good faith. We urge the government to protect existing migrants and honour the original 5-year ILR route.",
        "background": "Urge the UK Government to exempt all current Skilled Worker visa holders and dependents from the proposed 10-year ILR rule. Honor the 5-year ILR pathway for those already in the UK and provide clarity to protect legal migrants, families, and essential contributors to the UK.",
