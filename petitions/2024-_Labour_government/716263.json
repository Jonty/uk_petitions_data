        "additional_details": "The Government can influence the NHS Plan. I want those responsible for removing mention of dementia and the diagnosis target to explain why they have done so in a public arena. I also want it reinstating because, without diagnosis, government will be unaware of the number of people with dementia as it is the target that ensures diagnosis. And that also means that Government will be unable to plan for post-diagnostic services that people with dementia are entitled to as a disability right",
        "background": "Dementia and the 66% diagnosis target has been removed from the NHS England Operational Planning Guidance 2025-26, meaning that dementia will no longer be viewed as a priority and that, without diagnosis, people will not be offered treatment and rehabilitation. We want you to reinstate this",
