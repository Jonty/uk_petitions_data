        "additional_details": "We want the GOVT to Introduce Mandatory prison sentences to act as a deterrent to knife carriers; current legislation is weak and ineffective; our courts fail to address our Knife Epidemic; 168,000 children/youths regularly carried a knife in 2024 each can potentially use it if involved in a confrontation and can so easily lose their life or take another's; Mandatory sentences will force our judiciary to take knife crime more seriously that it currently does",
        "background": "There is knife crime epidemic in Britain; Last year 50,973 offences were recorded; 7% up on 2023 & 57% up in 10yrs; Murders Stabbings & Maimings destroy lives and cause communities to live in fear; Parents are planning funerals instead of bright futures; we want the Government to tackle this head on",
