We think this ambiguity is unfair and dangerous. We think companies use it as a legal shield to avoid responsibility for allergic reactions \u2014 even deaths \u2014 that clear, accurate labelling could help prevent. We think this practice puts lives at risk and must be banned to protect consumers. No one should be left guessing what\u2019s in their food. We deserve transparency.",
