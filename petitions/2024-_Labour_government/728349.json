        "additional_details": "Seals around the UK are protected wild animals. Legislation does not allow any suffering, killing or injuring of our heritage seals. However, this may be caused by flying rings. Flying rings may be lost or discarded on beaches, and may end up in the sea. We think the use of existing solid discs, preferably biodegradable, are seal safe alternatives.",
        "background": "Young seals sometimes find lost or discarded flying rings (any type of throwing ring). Being inquisitive, they sometimes play with them, putting their heads through the hole & may become trapped. As they grow, the rings can cut into their necks, causing life threatening open wounds & sometimes death",
