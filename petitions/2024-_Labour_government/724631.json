        "action": "Increase Taxation For The Ultra Rich",
        "additional_details": "The ultra rich are a tiny minority that have been slowly but surely acquiring the country\u2019s assets and leaving the British people and government with less and less. This means more debt and less to spend for the average consumer as well as the state for public services.\r\nThis would not cause businesses and wealthy individuals to exit the UK, and those that do will be leaving behind their assets and infrastructure. Therefore others will fill their industry gaps leading to innovation and growth.",
        "background": "Introducing stricter laws and higher percentages on taxation of the ultra rich would lower costs of assets like housing and provide more money for public services. Doing so would not detriment the working class, middle or even upper middle classes as they would not meet the threshold.",
