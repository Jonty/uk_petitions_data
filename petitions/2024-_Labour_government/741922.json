        "additional_details": "We believe veterans deserve equal recognition and equal treatment to serving personnel, yet many must apply in writing for medals they\u2019ve already earned. We think this unfairly creates barriers, especially as some veterans don\u2019t even know they\u2019re eligible and that automatic issue ensures dignity, consistency, and justice for their service. This could ensure there is no overlooked recognition, and that the sacrifices of veterans are honoured without bureaucracy, and closes the gap between veterans and those still in uniform.",
        "background": "Currently, serving armed forces personnel are issued earned medals automatically, without having to apply. Veterans first need to know they are eligible, then need apply, in hard copy. The automatic issuing of medals should be extended to all eligible personnel, both serving and veterans.",
