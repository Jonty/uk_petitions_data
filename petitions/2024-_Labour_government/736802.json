        "action": "Reform the Family Courts, Child Maintenance System and Childrens Social Care.",
        "additional_details": "Family courts often sideline loving parents\u2014both fathers and mothers\u2014who stay involved. The system punishes caring dads and mums alike, ignores abuse warnings, and enforces unfair maintenance based on income\u2014not time spent with kids. How can this be right when it harms children\u2019s wellbeing, mental health, and family stability? We demand urgent reform: equal 50/50 shared parenting, fair maintenance, stronger safeguarding, and full transparency. Kids deserve justice\u2014now.",
        "background": "We call on Parliament to reform family law to ensure 50/50 shared parenting presumption, enforce contact orders, make child maintenance reflect parenting time, strengthen safeguarding for all parents, increase court transparency, and criminalize parental alienation to protect children\u2019s wellbeing.",
