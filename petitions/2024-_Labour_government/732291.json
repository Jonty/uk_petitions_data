        "additional_details": "We think women have long been underserved and dismissed in healthcare. From periods to menopause, millions can face delays, misdiagnosis, and lack of support. One poll suggested that 93% of women feel dismissed when seeking help. Younger women can be told they're \u201ctoo young,\u201d older women can be ignored, and racial disparities can persist. We demand equal access, credible information, investment, and action. Women\u2019s health must be treated as essential.",
        "background": "This could involve improving access to specialist care from puberty to post-menopause, training healthcare professionals to better acknowledge and validate women\u2019s symptoms, removing barriers linked to age, race or income, increasing investment, and involving more women in decisions.",
