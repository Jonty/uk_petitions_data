        "additional_details": "We think over-reliance on AI has lead to rampant misinformation, false-advertising and scams becoming commonplace. We feel you can no longer perform a simple image search without being bombarded with AI generated results which do not disclose the fact they were made with AI.\r\n\r\nAI deepfakes are being used to create pornographic imagery of non-consenting women. We think this must be made illegal and the use of all Generative AI whether for commercial or personal use must be disclosed.",
        "background": "We think Generative AI for commercial use like advertising must be banned and companies must disclose using AI and list the prompts used. We think it must be made illegal to access AI \"nudify\" apps and websites, and AI generated imagery must require a watermark disclosing that it is AI generated.",
