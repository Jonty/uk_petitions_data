        "action": "Reverse the change to International Baccalaureate funding for state schools.",
        "additional_details": "Funding the IB Diploma in state schools gives students access to a globally respected qualification that builds critical thinking, leadership, and global awareness\u2014skills essential to the UK workforce. IB students are 3\u00d7 more likely to attend top UK universities and 40% more likely to earn top degrees than A Level peers. Removing funding limits opportunity, reduces social mobility, and weakens the UK\u2019s talent pipeline.",
        "background": "I want the UK Government to reverse their decision on cutting funding for International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme in state schools because it does not bring back lots of money into the economy, degrades international education and removes an incentive for foreign students to learn in the UK.",
