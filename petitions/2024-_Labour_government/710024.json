        "additional_details": "Manifesto pledges must be backed by evidence if unfulfilled, reviewed by an independent body. Failure to provide valid reasons should result in fines. Manifestos guide voters, yet there\u2019s no legal accountability for broken promises, damaging public trust in democracy. Ensuring transparency, promote realistic policy-making, and hold parties accountable to the people.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to make it illegal for political parties to break manifesto promises without evidence of valid reasons. Parties must justify unfulfilled pledges with documented proof reviewed by an independent body or face fines. Restoring trust and accountability in UK politics.",
