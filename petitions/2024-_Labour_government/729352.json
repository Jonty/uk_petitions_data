        "additional_details": "the reason why we want it done is because nothing was done about it last time this was brought up in parliament. many young people cant afford it and it leads to people wanting to break the law and drive illegally and to be honest nobody wants that do they? since covid-19 the prices have sky rocketed up. people on tiktok have mentioned the prices on quotes for low powered \"eco\" cars and they have all said in the \u00a36000 mark. that is too much. We want this sorted. not all of us have \u00a36000 spare.",
        "background": "the price of car insurance for new drivers is outrageous and with there being barley any jobs for young uk citizens to work at, especially in rural areas. me and 1000s of other young drivers would like the cost of insurance to actually be lowered to the \u00a31200 depending on the score of driving test",
