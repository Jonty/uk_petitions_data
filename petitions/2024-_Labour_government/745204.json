        "additional_details": "Technology-facilitated abuse is rife. Digital ID cards, requiring smartphone-based digital identification, will fundamentally become additional weapons of abuse. \r\nThey will: enable coercive control; compromise anonymity; exacerbate digital exclusion, and increase data vulnerability. \r\nThe core safeguarding principles enshrined in UK law will be contradicted, and the Government's promise to halving violence against women and girls, broken.\r\nReject the cards to protect domestic abuse survivors!",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to abandon the plans for mandatory Digital ID cards. Promoted as a vehicle to tackle illegal immigration, we are dismayed that narratives around this proposed scheme have not included any reference to the danger and risks posed to domestic abuse survivors.",
