        "additional_details": "It is estimated that Russia has made over $130 billion in oil sales to India since 2022, which we believe has helped fund Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. The FTA is projected to boost UK GDP by \u00a34.8 billion per year, but the UK has committed \u00a321.8 billion to help Ukraine against Russia, which we believe is being supported by India. We believe this makes no sense, and that the sooner Russia is crippled economically, the sooner the war will end.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to cancel the UK-India Free Trade Agreement as punishment for India buying Russian oil, which we believe is helping fund Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine. We believe the FTA should only be renewed if India halts all purchases of Russian oil.",
