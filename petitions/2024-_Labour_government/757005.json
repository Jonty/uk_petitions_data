        "additional_details": "This review would assess the current system, and the impact of the Bill on any existing issues in the system. In our view, social work and social care systems are under severe pressure, resulting in delayed, unsuitable or denied support for children and families, including children in care. We believe these are systemic issues, not isolated cases or individual failings and that proceeding with major reform without independent scrutiny risks entrenching harm rather than addressing it. Given the significance of this we think Parents and grassroots organisations must be central to this inquiry.",
