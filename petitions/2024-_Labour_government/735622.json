My generation are finding it increasingly difficult to actually get hired and the fact no employer gives feedback means we are stuck in an endless loop of applying for jobs, waiting 2 weeks, and hearing absolutely nothing back concerning the application. I believe if a person has taken the time to browse job openings, create a cv, and take time to apply for a job, they should be entitled to any feedback from the employer.",
        "background": "In the last 2 weeks alone I've applied for 18 different jobs, each with a different company. Only one of these jobs had the decency to reply with the others completely ignoring my application. I know I am not alone in saying that employers should be mandated to inform an applicant of any feedback",
