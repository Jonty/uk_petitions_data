        "additional_details": "The government\u2019s decision to stop legally recognising transgender women as women strips them of identity, rights, and access to gender-appropriate services. It promotes discrimination and increases the risk of violence and exclusion. Gender identity is not a debate\u2014it is a lived reality, supported by medical and human rights standards. Trans people deserve equal recognition and protection under the law.",

Reinstate and protect the rights of transgender individuals to have their gender identity legally acknowledged in line with the Gender Recognition Act and the Equality Act 2010.",
