I feel pushed aside with poor excuses that change with each update, that I have to chase, as to why they cannot enforce payments. In this digital day and age I feel there is no excuse as to why a legal obligation does not have a more serious process and consequence, considering the child maintenance service can access bank accounts and see funds and spending.",
