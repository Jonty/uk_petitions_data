        "additional_details": "We believe the law is unfair and outdated. We ask Parliament to change the law so that marriage no longer automatically revokes a will or to create a fairer legal safeguard; for example, a clear opt-in choice when registering a marriage to ensure people are not unintentionally disinheriting their families. This isn\u2019t about taking sides between first or second families but about fairness and awareness. People should not lose control over their legacy simply because they weren\u2019t aware of this little known rule.",
        "background": "Under the current law when someone gets married any will they made before that marriage is automatically cancelled. Most people do not know this they believe their existing will still stands. But this is not the case if they remarry and die.",
