        "additional_details": "To truly analyse the impact than enforcing a ban will cause. Local hunts provide so much to each of their local economies, from pub breakfasts, charity fund raising events and not mention horse industry businesses who heavily rely on the season. That's not to mention what would happen to thousands of hounds and horses whose jobs are specific to trail hunting. It is a way of life passed down through generations, a sport who welcomes everyone irrelevant of class, upbringing or financial stature.",
        "background": "To consider what impact banning trail hunting will have on the economy, livelihoods, horses, hounds and also the loss on traditional values. Trail hunting uses humans to lay the scent, not foxes!",
