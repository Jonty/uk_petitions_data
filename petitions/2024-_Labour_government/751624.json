        "additional_details": "We think this would support responsible saving and social mobility\r\n\r\nMany people who work hard and progress into higher earning roles still cannot buy a first home due to factors such as high tax, rising rents and large deposit requirements. We believe home ownership has declined sharply among working professionals, especially those without inherited wealth. A savings account like this could give first-time buyers a fair way to build a deposit, reduce rental pressure and support genuine social mobility.",
