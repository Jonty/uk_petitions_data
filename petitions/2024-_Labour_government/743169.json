        "additional_details": "The government need to tackle illegal immigration in this country but not through the proposal of a Digital ID Card. The issue is not with employers who operate under the guise of the law but those who work around it. This proposal will not stop the levels of illegal migrants working where they should not be but rather deter people who would choose to come to this country through legal passages due to an imposing government wanting to know their every move.",
        "background": "For many years the government have been slowly reducing our ability to anonymity in this country and have been increasingly focused on making it more difficult to live a private life. The introduction of the Digital ID Card is simply a way to gain more access and more control over the population.",
