This allows families to create memories and give experiences that educate children in different ways. Not only does this allow for memories, but we think it can help promote healthier mental wellbeing for the whole family. This in turn could help to relieve some of the stresses and burden on other services. We think parents should be able to have the choice to be able to take their children away on holiday.",
