        "action": "Introduce prison sentences for deliberate cruelty to wild birds including pigeon",
        "additional_details": "Under current law, deliberately killing or injuring a wild bird is already a criminal offence, yet penalties often fail to reflect the seriousness of the act or act as a sufficient deterrent. Deliberate acts of cruelty carried out for amusement or gratification demonstrate a clear disregard for animal life, public safety and the law. Despite the protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 section 1(1)(a) individuals who target and kill pigeons face minimal or zero consequences.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to amend existing wildlife and animal welfare legislation to introduce custodial prison sentences for any individual who deliberately goes out with the intention of injuring or killing wild bird, specifically including pigeons, using catapults or similar weapons.",
