        "additional_details": "I think existing laws often lack clear definitions and criteria for assessing threat to children, potentially resulting in unsafe judicial decisions made in family courts. I think such threats can foreshadow further attempts of abuse toward the targeted victim which may result in loss of life. I think reviewing these laws will help ensure victims and their children fleeing abuse are truly kept safe. I feel the loopholes are a major factor in domestically violent crimes.",
        "background": "I would like the government to conduct a comprehensive review of existing laws and amend them so as to close any loopholes that may allow perpetrators to manipulate legal systems and gain access to children and previous victims of domestic violence.",
