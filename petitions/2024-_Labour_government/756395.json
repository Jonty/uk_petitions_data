        "action": "Abolish the Old Basic State Pension \u2014 Give All Pensioners the New Pension",
        "additional_details": "Many older pensioners now receive significantly less income purely because of their date of birth, despite having paid National Insurance for decades. This injustice leaves some of the oldest members of society struggling to meet basic living costs while others receive higher payments under newer rules. Equalising the State Pension would restore fairness, reduce pensioner poverty, simplify the system, and ensure every pensioner can live with dignity and security. End this unfairness now.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to end the unfair two-tier State Pension system by abolishing the old Basic State Pension and awarding the full New State Pension to all pensioners. The difference between the two grows each year. It is unfair and increasingly it a source of grievance.",
