The nation has less electrified track than other developed countries. We believe that better investment - comparable with England and Scotland - could provide an economic boost, reduce carbon emissions, reduce congestion on busy roads and improve people's quality of life.\r\n \r\nWe want better and faster rail connection throughout Wales, not just to London.",
