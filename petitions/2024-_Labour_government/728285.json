Yet as vet costs rise, some families may not be able afford care. In a cost of living crisis, we think that we can\u2019t keep relying on overstretched charities. We think that as a nation of animal lovers, we should do better. We think a National Pet Health Service would protect animals and the people who depend on them.",

We think pets improve public health, and some animals are even used as medical aids yet vet costs are rising fast and becoming unaffordable for many.",
