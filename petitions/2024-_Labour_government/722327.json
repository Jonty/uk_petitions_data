        "additional_details": "We believe this gap risks irreversible harm to biodiversity, ecosystems, food security & rural communities. We urge amending the law to mandate individuals/entities purchasing 10+ acres (incl. cumulative, adjacent/ecologically linked plots within 24 months) or smaller plots in biodiversity-rich/eco-sensitive areas, complete an accredited course in countryside, environment & land management before transition, and show land meets ELMS goals ensuring responsible stewardship for future generations.",
        "background": "Large-scale land ownership requires key environmental, social, and economic duties. The law doesn\u2019t require buyers of sizeable landholdings to prove basic countryside management, environmental or sustainable practices, allowing transactions to proceed without ecological expertise mandates.",
