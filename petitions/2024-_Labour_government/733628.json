        "additional_details": "The current London free public transport for senior citizens is unfair to the rest of the population just because they live outside of London Boroughs. As well as being financially beneficial for the over 60`s nationally, it would remove a lot of vehicles off the roads and improve use of public transport, that the Governments have continually asked the public to do",
        "background": "Why cant the rest of the country have the same free travel as London for its senior citizens. There could be a National Transport Policy for senior citizens with photographic ID cards to prevent fraud.",
