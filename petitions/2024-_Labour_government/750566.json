        "additional_details": "Millions of homeowners continue to pay ground rent, often under clauses that increase every 10 to 25 years, making homes harder to sell, re-mortgage, or mortgage. Although it has been abolished for most new leases, existing leaseholders remain liable, creating an unequal system where similar homeowners are treated differently solely based on when their lease began.\r\n \r\nWe believe ending ground rent could remove an unjust financial burden, improve market fairness, and support a fairer, more transparent home ownership system.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to abolish ground rent for all existing residential leasehold properties in England and Wales. Ground rent is an outdated and, we believe, unfair charge that provides no service or benefit to leaseholders.",
