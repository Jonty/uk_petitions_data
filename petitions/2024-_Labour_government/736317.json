        "action": "Reverse the decision to give councils the green light to sell off allotments",
        "additional_details": "The UK is facing a crisis of shrinking green spaces and ecosystems to make way for housing developments, and many towns have already lost a staggering amount of allotments over the past decades that are hugely valuable as community assets. These sites improve biodiversity, are great for learning and mental health, and are vital community hubs. They can also provide food for communities in a cost-of-living crisis. National and local governments should strive to protect what sites are left.",
        "background": "News that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has given local councils the green light to sell off community assets, including allotments, if they are \"strapped for cash\" is unacceptable. With or without statutory status, it is vital that current allotment sites are kept and the decision reversed.",
