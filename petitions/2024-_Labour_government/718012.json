        "additional_details": "Migrants who take dangerous journeys do so out of desperation, fleeing war, persecution, and extreme poverty. The UK has a moral duty to offer them safety and a chance to rebuild their lives. Granting them a pathway to citizenship recognizes their resilience, contributions, and the UK\u2019s tradition of compassion and fairness.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to allow migrants arriving via dangerous journeys to apply for citizenship. Many flee war and persecution with no safe alternatives. Instead of criminalization, they deserve a fair asylum process, legal pathways, and a chance to contribute to society.",
