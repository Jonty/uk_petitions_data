        "additional_details": "AI is developing at unprecedented speed and is already shaping jobs, public services, and the information we see online. Without strong oversight, it risks enabling fraud, spreading misinformation, making biased decisions, and causing real harm to people and society. Current laws are not keeping pace. An independent regulator with legal powers is urgently needed to ensure AI in the UK is developed and used safely, fairly, and with full accountability.",
        "background": "Create an independent UK regulator with legal powers to set AI safety standards, require testing before release, hold companies liable for harm, monitor AI for fraud, bias, and misinformation, enforce penalties, and publish public reports on risks and compliance.",
