        "additional_details": "Overhead pylons (an outdated technology first used in 1928) would permanently scar countryside, destroy wildlife habitats, damage heritage sites, and harm tourism and rural communities. They are also more vulnerable to accidents, sabotage, or extreme weather, posing national security risks. Under-grounding the lines along Motorway and A road corridor\u2019s minimises environmental and visual harm, protects communities, safeguards landscapes, and ensures energy is delivered securely and sustainably.",
        "background": "Require National Grid to deliver the National Grid Upgrade via underground cables, and route the line alongside existing infrastructure such as motorways. This avoids new pylons cutting through and destroying countryside and communities and reduces risks to national infrastructure security.",
