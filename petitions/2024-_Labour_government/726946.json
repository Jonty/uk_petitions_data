        "additional_details": "We would like Government to ban this as there are reports that it is affecting people who are taking part in clinical trials, meaning they are being penalised for helping advance medical science, and treatments.   Due to excessive hikes in premiums, some people may not be able to travel, or might withdraw or not take part at all, due to awareness of this occurring.   We are concerned about the impact on patients and on clinical trial uptake. We think Parliament needs to step in.",
