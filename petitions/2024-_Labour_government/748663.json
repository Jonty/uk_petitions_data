We don\u2019t know how many reject messages with desexed language or whose health is harmed. We don\u2019t know the impact on women with low English skills, education, or health knowledge. We urge the Government to fund research on the impact of desexed language in women\u2019s health and how to best communicate with our diverse population of women, including those with special language needs.",
