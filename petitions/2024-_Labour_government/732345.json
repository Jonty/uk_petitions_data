        "additional_details": "Some PDIs may be waiting over 6 to 10 months for tests by the time they get the tests through they are near the end of their theory test limit, therefore not allowing full opportunity to pass on the 3rd attempt on the pt2 or pt3 tests.\r\n \r\nAlso if injuries are suffered during those 2 years there is no extension of the theory time limit thereby forcing potential instructors to leave their career path to start a new career, which we think is expensive.",
        "background": "Change the time limit to allow for all attempts at the pt2 and pt3 before the theory runs out due to long periods of waiting times for Potential Driving Instructors (PDI). Extend the pink licence to reflect waiting times of tests due to backlogs.",
