        "additional_details": "We urge the UK Government to address Manchester\u2019s homelessness crisis, symbolized by tents in St Peter\u2019s Square. Despite billions invested in the city\u2019s growth and Manchester\u2019s \u00a3100bn GDP, over 5,000 people remain homeless in the region. This failure harms tourism, damages the city\u2019s reputation, and highlights systemic inequality. Images of these scenes are shared internationally, mocking the UK\u2019s decline. We demand urgent investment in housing, mental health services, and long-term solutions.",

Despite a \u00a3100bn GDP, efforts fail to provide solutions. Demand transparency, investment in housing, and an end to this humanitarian failure.",
