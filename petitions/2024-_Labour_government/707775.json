        "action": "Cap the amount young drivers pay in car insurance to an affordable rate",
        "additional_details": "Young drivers often face prohibitively high insurance costs, with quotes exceeding \u00a35,000 annually for even a modest 1.0-litre vehicle. Paying monthly further inflates this cost. Coupled with the rising cost of living, these premiums place a significant financial burden on young people, many of whom are in full-time education and earning only the national living wage. This creates a nearly impossible situation for young drivers to afford insurance. Urgent action is needed to address this.",
        "background": "Young drivers who have passed there test within the first 2 years are struggling to pay for insurance. Insurance premiums are ridiculously high and unaffordable for the average 17-21 year old in the UK. Insurance companies are profiting way too much from young drivers.",
