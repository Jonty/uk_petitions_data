        "action": "Create a Law that protects children from being used as pawns during separations.",
        "additional_details": "This is something that has been happening for years and years. Namely mothers, using their children as some sort of weapon to cause malice or hurt in attempts to have control. The fact that a parent has to pay thousands and spend months and months going through courts in attempt to gain visitation to their own children, is an absolute disgrace and shouldn\u2019t have to happen. \r\nSo many children and young adults are not being supported enough. They\u2019re the ones who are being damaged the most.",
        "background": "I wish for Parliament to enforce a law that helps protect innocent children from being emotional abused during separations between their parents. So, so many people, adult and child, are affected and it has such a huge negative impact on those involved.",
