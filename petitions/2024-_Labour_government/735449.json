        "additional_details": "In today\u2019s digital age, a vast majority of teens own a smartphone, and many rely on devices for learning, communication, and emergency contact. Some studies show tech use in classrooms can enhance engagement and digital literacy when properly managed. Yet many schools still enforce bans, leading to confiscation and limited access. We believe protecting student tech rights ensures equity, safety, and prepares them for a tech-driven world. We believe the law must reflect this reality.",

We believe they are essential tools, not distractions, and that schools must adapt. We believe students deserve protection of property, privacy, and digital rights.",
