        "action": "Introduce compulsory politics classes to years 7-9",
        "additional_details": "Due to the lack of knowledge among younger voters about the way the country works, teaching politics would ensure wise decisions and to ensure that the younger voters make educated decisions and hear all points of view. It is also inportant to note the low voter turnout among younger voters which may be due to feeling overwhelmed by the mass information that they are never taught during school hours and feeling like they are unaware about key topics discussed during the build up to elections.",
        "background": "I believe a politics class should be added throughout year groups 7-9 to teach the younger generation about current affairs, how the political system works and what each party does. Additionally it could be used to teach students how to spot fake news and how to make educated decisions.",
