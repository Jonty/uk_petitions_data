Over the years the government has indicated that they monitor rises and will take action if necessary but we are concerned that nothing has come of this.",
        "background": "District, County and Unitary councils have their council tax rises capped - any proposed increase above this must be approved in a local referendum. We want a cap to also be set for the precept for town and parish councils because some have increased theirs well above inflation over the last decade.",
