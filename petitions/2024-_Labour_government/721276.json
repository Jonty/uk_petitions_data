        "action": "Petition to Reform Family Courts for Equal Parenting Rights",
        "additional_details": "Why This Matters:\r\nFathers across the UK are routinely denied fair treatment in family courts. Many experience alienation from their children due to biased court decisions, unchallenged breaches of court orders, and the misuse of legal aid through unfounded non-molestation orders. Our children deserve to have both parents actively involved in their lives. The law must be changed to ensure fairness, accountability, and the best interests of the child.",
        "background": "We demand: legal presumption of 50/50 shared parenting, consequences for breaching court orders, police enforcement, recognition of parental alienation, fair non-molestation orders, equal legal aid, and balanced child maintenance enforcement.",
