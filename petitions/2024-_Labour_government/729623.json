Many of them are not absent by choice \u2014 they are autistic, have ADHD, anxiety, sensory processing disorder, trauma, chronic illness, or learning disabilities. We feel that the current school system is not built for them.\r\n \r\nWe think that a government-funded virtual school could change lives \u2014 and give families a real option. Private online schools do exist but fees can be high. This can mean that they are out of reach for many families.",
