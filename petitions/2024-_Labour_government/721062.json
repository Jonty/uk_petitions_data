        "additional_details": "Donations could be made as a one-off or a monthly subscription - people might opt to cancel monthly subscriptions, such as streaming and online shopping services, and donate that money to the fund with minimal impact to their own finances. This provides the citizens of the UK a safe way to directly support the people of Ukraine. It also ensures that the money spent directly supports UK business & industry and is not being sent to countries actively working with the Russian aggressor.",
        "background": "The UK government should create a fund to which its citizens can donate money which would be ring-fenced for the defense of Ukraine. The fund's should only be used to supply UK manufactured products which would help to boost the UK's own economy. All donations should have Gift Aid applied.",
