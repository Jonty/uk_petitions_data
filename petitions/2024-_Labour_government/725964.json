        "additional_details": "The circle line uses the same tracks as other lines, operating only in Central London. Removing the circle line will allow more money and trains for TFL to use on the district, H&C and metropolitian line. These lines are very congested with many passnges going to areas such as Uxbridge, Richmond and Dagenham - more trains on these lines will cause more passnges to get around the capital quicker with lower wait times for rains.",
        "background": "Remove the circle line because it is pointless; it runs the same rails as the District, H&C and the Metropolitian line so there isn't any need for the trains. Instead, passenges can use the other sub surface lines. Relieving the circle line will leave more trains for other sub surface lines.",
