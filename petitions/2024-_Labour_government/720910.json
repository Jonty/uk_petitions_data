        "additional_details": "Currently it is nearly impossible for members of the public to book a driving test themselves. As soon as the tests are released at 6am on Monday mornings the test slots are booked instantly. The queued logins are in the tens of thousands every time. Scalpers are block booking the tests and reselling the slots to the public for hundreds of pounds. This is grossly unfair and has been going on for years. The current anti-bot booking measures are not working.",
        "background": "Only allow real driving instructors to book driving tests using the provisional driving license number of the individual they are booking the test for. The system should only allow one booking at a time per license number. Block booking must be stopped.",
