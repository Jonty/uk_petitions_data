        "action": "Include South Middlesex in the new West Surrey County name",
        "additional_details": "South Middlesex has a long-standing cultural and historical identity distinct from Surrey and identifying the county as \u201cWest Surrey & South Middlesex\u201d acknowledges that heritage. A dual name supports alignment despite boundary reorganisation to 'preserve legacy' and prevent erasure of an area steeped in tradition and local history that government would do well not to ignore\r\n\r\nIncluding South Middlesex follows 'established practice' for newly formed authorities with diverse historical identities.",
        "background": "This petition recommends \u201cSouth Middlesex\u201d be included in the proposed county name \u201cWest Surrey\u201d as the current proposal does not reflect the geography, or composition of our area. South Middlesex identity remains important to residents and it should be recognised in this new county official title.",
