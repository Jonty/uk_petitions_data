        "action": "Change the school week from 5 days to 4 day",
        "additional_details": "We need this to happen because from our evidence, 91.3% of people feel burnt out after 5 days of school, and you may think that extra 90 minutes may tire students, but 78.2% of students said a 4 day school week would prevent burnout. Along with this, 65.2% of students said that school is detrimental to their mental health. As well as this, teachers would have more time to prepare lessons, and 60% said their focus and grades would improve. We urge this to happen, and improve school life for all.",
        "background": "We request the Government to make all schools make the school week four instead of five days- and to fit the 32.5 hour requirement, make school days 1.5 hours longer. There would also be an optional day for students to come in, to help families who cant take care of their kid(s) for the extra day.",
