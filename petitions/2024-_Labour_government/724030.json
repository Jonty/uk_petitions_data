        "additional_details": "Eid is a time of communal prayer, charity, and family gatherings. A single day off is not enough for children to fully participate in these traditions. Many families travel to visit relatives, prepare special meals, and engage in acts of charity, all of which require more time than is currently allocated. Granting a full week off would allow Muslim students to celebrate properly without feeling rushed or excluded.",
        "background": "We urge the UK government to grant a full week off for both Eid celebrations (eid al adha and eid al fitr) in schools.",
