        "action": "Support year abroad students - re-establish our EU education opportunities",
        "additional_details": "I am a university student, disappointed with the lack of support and help towards our year abroads, after Brexit. The additional costs that have been created because we left the EU, are not covered by The Turing Scheme, leaving year abroad students with difficulties at visa appointments, trying to evidence that they have sufficient funds to live/study/work abroad. Some countries expect us to have thousands of pounds in our own bank accounts as proof that we can afford our year abroad.",
        "background": "The UK needs to improve how they financially support year abroads, and give funding earlier. Embassies should 'fast-track' students on specific days during Spring/Summer months, to help students apply for the visas they need. The UK must re-establish higher education connections with EU countries.",
