        "action": "Grant non-molestation orders based on past abuse, not just risk of future harm",
        "additional_details": "Survivors are often refused non-molestation orders because judges say abuse is not \"recent\". This leaves victims exposed if abusers are briefly on \"good behaviour\" e.g. during court cases. Even some survivors of near-fatal attacks are told they must wait to be harmed again before getting protection. A lot of domestic abuse is cyclical so pauses don't remove risk. The law must recognise this & close the loophole: allow survivors protection based on past abuse without waiting for further violence.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to change the law so that non-molestation orders are always granted based on evidence of past domestic abuse, even if there has not been a recent incident. Currently, victims must prove not only that abuse has taken place but that there is an ongoing risk of future harm.",
