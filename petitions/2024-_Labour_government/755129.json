        "additional_details": "We believe that too many cases are dismissed despite clear evidence of coercive control, malicious communications, and sustained emotional, psychological, and physical abuse. Non-physical abuse causes severe and often irreversible harm, yet, in our view, victims are repeatedly denied justice because CPS practice prioritises visible injuries over ongoing patterns of control and harm.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to urgently review CPS investigations and charging decisions in domestic abuse and coercive control cases, to ensure the law is being applied correctly and all forms of abuse are taken seriously, not just extreme physical violence.",
