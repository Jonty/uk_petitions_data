Student nurses are used daily to cover HCA role due to short staffing and should be recognise for covering these shortages. It could improve training and improve health outcomes in the future. Student nurses don\u2019t get long summers off to work additional jobs to provide for themselves or their families. Let improve the education system for nurse and build a stronger workforce for the future.",

However students should be learning with the nurses to ensure the nurses of the future are equipped with the right skills to help prevent further health inequalities in the UK.",
