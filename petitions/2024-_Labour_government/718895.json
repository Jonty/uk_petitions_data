        "additional_details": "In my opinion this allowance harms society by costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds each year which could go towards those worst off rather than going towards people, who in my view have more than enough money to cover their own costs. As of 2024, Prime ministers are paid \u00a3166,786 per year and MPs are \u00a391,346 per year. I think that ex-prime ministers have accumulated enough wealth during their time as a member of parliament and can afford to cover their own expenses. ",
        "background": "I am starting a petition to stop to ex-prime ministers from claiming the PDCA (public duty cost allowance). The PDCA allows a former prime minister to claim up to \u00a3115,000 a year- for life - for the 'necessary office costs and secretarial costs arising from their special position in public life'.",
