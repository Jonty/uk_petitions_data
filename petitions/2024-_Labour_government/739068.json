        "additional_details": "We believe the coverage being received by far right political parties is emboldening far right groups in the UK and this has started to cause division, unrest and violence in communities. \r\n \r\nThere are concerns that news outlets are increasingly using dramatic headlines that lean towards the far right in order to gain viewers and readers. It has become too easy for far right groups to manufacture situations, such as the migrant hotel protests, in order to give them even more due weight, causing a feedback loop of far right rhetoric.",
        "background": "Conduct a review of policy at Ofcom. We think that political news reporting on all channels has become unrepresentative of the public vote at the last general election and that political reporting using the \u2018due weight\u2019 policy is allowing extreme growth in far right coverage.",
