        "additional_details": "Adverse Reactions: Many dogs experience severe side effects from the leptospirosis vaccine, causing distress for pets & owners.\r\nLimited Efficacy: The vaccine\u2019s effectiveness varies, & not all dogs are at risk of exposure to leptospirosis.\r\nInformed Choice: Pet owners should have the right to make healthcare decisions for their pets without mandatory requirements.\r\nAlternative Measures: Improved sanitation & monitoring can effectively reduce the risk of leptospirosis without mandatory vaccination.",
        "background": "We respectfully request the removal of the mandatory leptospirosis vaccination requirement for dogs in daycare & boarding facilities.\r\nMy dog had a bad reaction to the Leptospirosis Vaccine & a large patch of her skin fell off, she now has a permanent bald patch, others have experienced much worse.",
