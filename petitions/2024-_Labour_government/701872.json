        "additional_details": "Legalising cannabis will bring economic growth, generate tax revenue for public services, and create jobs in agriculture, retail, and tech. It ensures public safety through regulated sales, quality control, and education on responsible use. Decriminalisation reduces law enforcement costs and prevents unfair criminal records. Legal markets combat organised crime and protect communities. It aligns with modern public opinion, promotes social equity, and supports medical research and sustainability.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to legalise & regulate recreational cannabis to unlock economic, social, & public health benefits. Tax revenues can fund public services, create jobs, & reduce policing costs. Decriminalisation will ensure equity, public education, & safety while curbing illegal markets.",
