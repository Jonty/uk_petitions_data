        "additional_details": "For NHS to perform and care better for patients, primary care is key. Primary care is not just limited to someone seeing a clinician. It also involves administrative medical support. To improve the patient offering as pledged by the Govt, the key is retention and attraction of \"right skilled\" and \"Motivated\" staff. To achieve this, starting point would be to improve the remuneration offering and reward fairly. Why would a skilled person stay at GP surgery when they can earn fair wage elsewhere.",
        "background": "A highly skilled GP surgery frontline staff is paid minimum wage which is 15% less than supermarket frontline pay.A GP surgery administrator is typically expected to have graduate level IT,admin,technical and people skills. These roles don't attract people of required calibre due to pay constraints.",
