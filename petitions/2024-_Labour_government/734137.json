        "additional_details": "Lipoedema affects 1 in 10 women that\u2019s over 3.9 million in the UK  and it can also impact men and non-binary people. It causes pain, swelling, immobility and emotional harm, yet it\u2019s barely mentioned in NICE guidance, has no care pathway, is often misdiagnosed as obesity, and isn\u2019t consistently recorded. Other countries recognise and fund care. UK patients self-diagnose via Instagram and often pay thousands abroad. We need recognition, early diagnosis, NHS support and to stop being left behind.",
        "background": "Recognise lipoedema as a distinct chronic disease. Train all NHS staff to diagnose and treat it. Include it in school health education. Update national policy so it's no longer mislabelled or ignored, and ensure healthcare providers understand the pain and appropriate terminology and the impact.",
