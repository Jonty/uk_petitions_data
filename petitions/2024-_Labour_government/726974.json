        "additional_details": "1) People deserve to own what they make. No one made land, so it is fairer to tax land than production.\r\n\r\n2) Supply of production changes to suit demand, self-regulating its price. This is not true of land, which has fixed supply: By now, land is 60% of UK wealth. 70% of land is owned by 1% of the population.\r\n\r\n3) A tax on production lowers its supply but not demand, raising its price by the amount taxed. A tax on land would lower its demand but not supply, lowering its price by the amount taxed.",
        "background": "Reduce taxes on production such as income tax, VAT and corporation tax. Abolish taxes on buildings.\r\n\r\nImplement a land value tax. That is, an annual tax on land ownership, but not on any man-made improvements on the land.\r\n\r\nWe provide three reasons for doing this. Please click to see below:",
