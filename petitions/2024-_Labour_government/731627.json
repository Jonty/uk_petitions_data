        "additional_details": "Of course! Here's the revised version, still under 500 characters, with eBay included:\r\n\r\nToo many people breed dogs at home for profit without declaring income or paying tax. Unlike platforms like eBay, where sellers must now report earnings, dog breeders face little oversight. This fuels tax evasion, poor welfare, and rising abandonment, overwhelming shelters. We urge the Government to tighten laws, enforce tax compliance, and restrict breeding to licensed professionals or registered charities",
        "background": "Too many people breed dogs at home for profit without declaring income or paying tax. This leads to illegal earnings, poor breeding practices, and more abandoned dogs, putting huge strain on rescue centres and charities.",
