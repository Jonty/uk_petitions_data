        "additional_details": "I believe medicinal users should be allowed to grow their own cannabis, there are multiple benefits for this:\r\n1.It allows prescription holders to have a comfortable and consistent supply of medicine\r\n2.A lot of prescription holders/people that would be eligible can not financially afford to pay for the private healthcare options offered to medicinal users at the moment\r\n3.It teaches people gardening and individual skills as you have to care for a plant and make sure it\u2019s grown completely healthy",
        "background": "Medical users of cannabis should be allowed to grow their own plants, for personal use. Medicinal users should be allowed 3-8 plants to make sure they have a consistent supply of their medicine as well. This would help a lot of people financially, medically and helps people learn more skills",
