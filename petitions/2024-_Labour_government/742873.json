        "additional_details": "We believe survivors of domestic abuse in the UK are being left at risk. Police funding cuts, overcrowded prisons, and weak monitoring can mean too many abusers are released without proper oversight. We feel that measures like Clare\u2019s Law and electronic tagging are steps in the right direction, but they don\u2019t go far enough. We need a national public register of convicted domestic abusers to shine a light on repeat offenders, protect communities, and prevent future abuse.",
