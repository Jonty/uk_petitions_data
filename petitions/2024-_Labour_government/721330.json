        "action": "All Russian assets in Britain should be siezed to aid Ukraine's defence",
        "additional_details": "America has switched sides and unless Europe steps up to the task, Ukraine will fall and then Russia and America will target the rest of eastern Europe. This is an existential fight for the survival of democracy.\r\n\r\nThis is Britain's chance to provide the tough leadership that the free world needs. If we don't grasp the nettle now, it will be our children and grand children fighting, and it will be our schools, hospitals and shopping centres being hit with Russian missiles. We MUST act now.",
        "background": "The Government should sieze Russian assets held in the UK and use the money to help to fund Ukraine's ongoing defence against Russian aggression. They should be used to buy the necessary materiel from UK and European contractors but in special cases from other parts of the world including the USA.",
