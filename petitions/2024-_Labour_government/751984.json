        "action": "Stop the Removal of Jury Trials in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The radical removal of jury trials betrays 800+ years of British justice, centralises power in the state, floods overcrowded prisons, and destroys public trust. \r\nJury trials are a cornerstone of common law and global justice; removing them undermines fairness, citizen participation, and the UK\u2019s standing in the world and encourages discriminatory outcomes. This is a direct attack on our rights, our traditions, and the very foundations of British society.",
        "background": "We demand Parliament halt all plans to remove jury trials for less serious offences, ensure justice reforms preserve citizen participation, transparency, and public trust, and prioritise expanding court capacity or decriminalising low-harm offences over dismantling centuries of safeguards.",
