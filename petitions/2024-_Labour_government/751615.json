        "additional_details": "Please recognise the essential role we play. We pay taxes and contribute to the system. 15years feel like we are unwanted or a burden on system which lowers the morale of people who have come to UK thinking UK has a fair policy and have regards for human rights. This route will force a lot of care workers to look else where bringing the system back to desperation for new carers. Referring to carers as low qualified is very demeaning considering many foreign carers in UK are university graduates.",
        "background": "Please withdraw the 15-year settlement proposal for care workers and keep a fair and reasonable residency route.Care workers already on route should continue on 5 years route to settlement.Do not offer any benefits to them. English proficiency test can be kept in place for people with no degree",
