        "additional_details": "Early Years providers are expected to create and provide bespoke support plans to the individual needs of each child (often full time 1:1 care), sometimes at a financial loss for the setting. Early Years are expected to have everything the child needs, in place ready for school, ensuring the schools are in immediate receipt of any support and funding that we are denied.",
        "background": "We call for the Government to increase SEND funding for Early Years providers so they receive the same level of funding and support as primary schools. We have found in recent years that it has become increasingly difficult to obtain funding and support for the SEND children in early years settings.",
