        "additional_details": "The government is removing support for the world's most vulnerable people [1]. Aid is to be stripped to 0.3% of GNI, leading to the weakest expected overseas aid contribution in the G7 [2].\r\n\r\nThe US is also withdrawing aid, led by the world's richest man. This has grim consequences for poverty, health, hunger, education, and women and girls. Following suit is sickening. Instead, the UK should have the courage not to abandon the people who need it most.\r\n\r\n[1] tinyurl.com/UKai1\r\n[2] tinyurl.com/UKai2",
        "background": "The UK is severing foreign aid by an astonishing 40%. Cutting lifelines for the world's poorest and most vulnerable people is cowardly and short-sighted, and the government should urgently reconsider. To fund defence, we must economise elsewhere. We call for aid funding to be protected.",
