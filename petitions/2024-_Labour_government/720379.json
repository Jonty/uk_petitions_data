        "additional_details": "America\u2019s current policy of America first has abandoned the long mutual relationship nurtured with the UK and Europe. The US has lost its respect and world standing and their latest position: Russian appeasement and hostility to Ukraine, has robbed them of their right to be an ally to the UK. Their abandonment of the position of Ukrainian sovereignty threatens peace in Europe and emboldens Russia in its greed to re-acquire former Soviet bloc land, destabilising the world in the process.",
        "background": "Publicly and through diplomatic channels declare the Special Relationship nullified during the Trump presidency, and move to close bilateral treaties/agreements that serve US interests above our own. Censure the US for Ukraine position and declare them pariah internationally for their reversal.",
