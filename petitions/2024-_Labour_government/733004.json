        "action": "Ban hotel accommodation for illegal migrants and require removal within 100 days",
        "additional_details": "The British public faces rising living costs, housing pressures, and NHS backlogs. Yet thousands of people who entered the UK illegally are being placed in hotels at an unsustainable cost \u2014 over \u00a38 million per day.\r\n\r\nThis undermines trust in our immigration system. We believe those who enter illegally should not be rewarded with free accommodation, especially after travelling through safe countries.\r\n\r\nWe urge the Government to:\r\n\r\nBan the use of taxpayer money to house illegal migrants in hotels\r\n\r\nIntroduce a legal duty to remove illegal entrants within 100 days unless their asylum claim is resolved\r\n\r\nThis would reduce costs, deter illegal crossings, and restore fairness to our immigration laws.",
        "background": "We want the Government to immediately stop using public funds to house illegal migrants in hotels and introduce a legal duty to remove all illegal entrants within 100 days of arrival unless their asylum case is resolved in that time.",
