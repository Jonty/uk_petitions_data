        "additional_details": "Living in London is becoming increasingly dangerous. Street crime has become a daily threat, and many of us feel unsafe simply walking outside. The fear of being attacked, robbed, or targeted is real and constant. This is not normal. It\u2019s the Government\u2019s responsibility to step in, restore public safety, and hold those in charge\u2014especially the Mayor of London\u2014accountable for this failure. Without urgent action, confidence in policing and leadership will continue to collapse.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to urgently address the surge in phone and street theft in London. The Mayor of London has failed to protect Londoners. We demand increased police funding and national oversight to hold local authorities accountable when public safety standards are not met.",
