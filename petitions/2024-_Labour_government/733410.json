Currently, there are no requirements or registrations needed for a \"rescue\" to set up and definitely no checks being made while they are operating and devastating discoveries like this can be avoided with welfare checks conducted by authorities to ensure they are following and abiding by the animal welfare act 2006.We are their voice, so let's speak up and ensure the lives of these precious animals are protected",
        "background": "In the light of 37 dogs found dead in a \"rescue\" in Essex, sadly not an isolated incident, periodic welfare checks by authorities such as RSPCA should be a requiremnt. Currently, it's reliant on reports and this is when it's sadly too late. Periodic welfare will ensure their havens are indeed safe.",
