        "additional_details": "Trial by jury is a constitutional right. It can trace roots back to Henry II and was featured in the Magna Carta. It has functioned effectively for eight centuries. \r\n\r\nThe jury trial is fundamental to our constitution in creating a buffer between the state and individual.\r\n\r\nPlans have been established by the Leveson Inquiry to scrap trial by jury for non-serious criminal offences in order to remove the backlog in the courts. This is prioritising efficiency over basic rights.",
        "background": "The government should cease any plans to introduce legislation that will remove the right to trial by jury in England and Wales for non-serious criminal cases in response the judicial backlog. The aim is valid, but should be met by other solutions.",
