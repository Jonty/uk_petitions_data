        "action": "Limit fireworks to organised displays & ban fireworks from sale to the public.",
        "additional_details": "Fireworks cause noise pollution & can have a detrimental impact on many people, particularly, but not limited to, neurodivergent people & those with PTSD, they can be frightening for young children. They also impact on pets, livestock & wildlife. Organised displays advertise themselves weeks before an event, so people are aware & can take precautions but there is no obligation for anyone having fireworks in their back garden to do this.",
        "background": "Make fireworks less accessible to the general public, by banning their sale in shops, so that backyard displays held with no prior warning are no longer permitted.",
