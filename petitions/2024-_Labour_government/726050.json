        "additional_details": "Married couples share life, home, bills, and responsibilities, yet can only transfer 10% of their tax-free allowance. It\u2019s like a husband being \u00a3100 short at the supermarket, but his wife is only allowed to give \u00a310 to help. Families live and work as one team. Marriage is about partnership, but the tax system still treats them separately. Allowing full sharing would reflect real family life and fairness, with no extra cost to the Government, as the total family tax-free amount stays the same.",
        "background": "Allow married couples and civil partners to fully share their unused personal tax-free allowance. The current 10% limit does not reflect real family life. Full sharing would recognise marriage as a true partnership built on love, sacrifice, and shared responsibility \u2014 key British family values.",
