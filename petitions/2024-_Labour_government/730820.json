        "additional_details": "The decision to decriminalise abortion was made with little notice or public debate. Regardless of personal views, such a significant legal and moral change should not be rushed through without full parliamentary scrutiny and public input.\r\n\r\nThis petition is not about division, but about democracy. We urge the government to revisit the decision, allow proper debate, and consider a public referendum so that all voices can be heard on this deeply important issue.",
        "background": "We urge the government to reconsider the decision made on the 17th June to decriminalise abortion, a matter of profound moral, ethical, and societal significance. The speed that this  decision was made raises concerns about the lack of debate, public consultation and democratic accountability.",
