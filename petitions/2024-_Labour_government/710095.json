        "additional_details": "The industry temptation to use these AI technologies are also leaving the workforce in a precarious position not only in terms of income, but also in terms of the creative process whereby the artist or entertainer enters into a contract with an audience member/reader/receiver to consider the human experience. AI can\u2019t simulate this aspect as it is not human. The government needs to respond to protect the Arts.",
        "background": "Writers, visual artists, illustrators, screenwriters, musicians, DJs, actors, directors, animators, designers, vocalists, storytellers and other artists are regularly having works plagiarised with current AI technology and freely available apps. We need legislation to protect artistic works.",
