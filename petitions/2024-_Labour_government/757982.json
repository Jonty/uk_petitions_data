        "action": "Establish lawful regulation for electric unicycles and personal EVs",
        "additional_details": "Because electric unicycles sit in a legal grey area where ownership is lawful but compliance is impossible. This creates uncertainty for the public and enforcement bodies, discourages innovation, and leads to disproportionate outcomes. Clear rules would improve safety, fairness, and legal certainty.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to create clear legislation for electric unicycles and similar devices. They are treated as motor vehicles but cannot be registered or insured, making compliance impossible. A proportionate framework with safety standards and lawful routes to compliance is needed.",
