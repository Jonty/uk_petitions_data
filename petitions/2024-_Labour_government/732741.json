        "additional_details": "UK fans pay around \u00a373/month for Sky, TNT Sports, and Amazon to watch Premier League games yet not all matches are shown due to the 3pm blackout. In Canada, fans get full access via FuboTV for just \u00a314/month. The Premier League is a British institution, but home fans are priced out. Other countries enjoy more affordable and complete coverage. We urge the Government to investigate pricing, address exclusivity deals, so that football can be watched by more people in the UK, fairly and affordably.",
        "background": "Make sports packages, especially Premier League coverage, more affordable for UK viewers. Prices are too high and many games aren\u2019t shown. The British public should have better access to a sport that originated here and is loved across the nation.",
