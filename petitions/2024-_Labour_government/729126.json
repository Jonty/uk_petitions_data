        "additional_details": "Many NHS professionals live far from their workplaces due to housing costs, and rail fares can exceed \u00a3300 per month.  A railcard would ease financial stress, support morale, support wellbeing, and recognise frontline workers in a practical way. It could also reduce car dependency and align with the UK\u2019s environmental goals. We think is a fair, affordable step to value NHS staff, who keep our health system running.",
        "background": "Fund a National NHS Railcard to give healthcare staff discounted rail travel. This card could be similar to existing railcards for young people, veterans and seniors. We think this would ease commuting costs, support retention, and encourage public transport use.",
