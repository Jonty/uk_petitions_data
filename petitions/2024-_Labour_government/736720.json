        "additional_details": "A potential upcoming loss of rescue spaces could place a greater burden of abandonment on local authorities. Any new restrictions on rehoming from UK rescues and restricted rescuing from abroad could lead to more demand for purchased pups and encourage back street breeding with no Rescue Back Up. We want Government to centralise data as currently there is no obligation to provide accurate euthanasia numbers outside of local authorities. We believe transparency is needed from all stakeholders",
        "background": "With some reports suggesting a rise in euthanasia rates, we think research must be undertaken by government and relevant bodies to centrally record how many dogs and cats are being euthanised: where, why, age, breed, gender and microchip status. All veterinarians must be required to report this data",
