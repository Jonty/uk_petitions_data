        "additional_details": "GP surgeries face major staff shortages, yet experienced SAS doctors are barred from working in primary care. Many have years of clinical expertise, yet can't practice in GP settings while non-doctor physician associates can. We urge the Government to create a safe, supported route for SAS doctors to work in general practice and help ease NHS pressure.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to allow experienced SAS doctors to work in GP surgeries. With physician associates already in primary care although they are not fully qualified doctors, it\u2019s only fair to create a safe, supported route for fully qualified SAS doctors to help ease the GP workforce crisis.",
