        "additional_details": "The government are currently consulting on removing the LCWRA Universal Credit component for under 22's. Unfortunately, being so unwell that you are unable to work isn't reserved for those 22+. As an advice worker, I've worked with many under 22's unable to work due to cancer, severe learning disability and many other conditions. We believe that taking away the LCWRA won't help disabled young people into work, but will instead plunged disabled young people into poverty.",

Why should someone who is 22 and living with cancer be entitled to LCWRA support, where someone who is 20 and living with cancer isn't. We call on the LCWRA component for 18\u201321-year-olds to remain.",
