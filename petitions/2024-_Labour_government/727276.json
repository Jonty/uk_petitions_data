We think these devices could harm wildlife and pose safety risks, yet remain largely unregulated. Despite their limited effectiveness, only non-binding National Farmers Union guidance exists. We call for a ban to help safeguard residents, animals, and the environment.",
        "background": "We think audible propane bird scarers, known as gas gun bird scarers, should be banned due to their disruptive nature. While used by farmers to scare birds away, we feel they cause significant noise pollution, disturbing residents, animals, and passers by.",
