        "additional_details": "There is growing public concern that the BBC is no longer consistently impartial. Recent controversies, including the editing and presentation of political footage, have reduced trust in its role as a national broadcaster. People should not be required to fund an organisation they may no longer have confidence in. A voluntary subscription model would ensure the BBC is accountable to its audience and must earn public support through trust, accuracy and quality.",
        "background": "End the compulsory BBC TV licence fee and replace it with a voluntary subscription model. The Government should require the BBC to operate on a paid subscription basis, allowing people to choose whether to pay for its services.",
