        "action": "Make Children\u2019s Zip Oyster Cards Available Digitally",
        "additional_details": "Children rely on public transport daily for school, activities, and getting home safely. Physical Zip Oyster cards are easy to lose or forget, which can lead to fines or children being unable to travel despite being entitled to free or discounted travel. This also causes accidental fare evasion. A digital Zip card would reduce stress for families, prevent unfair penalties, and modernise the system to reflect how people travel today.",
        "background": "We want the Government to work with TfL to introduce a digital option for children\u2019s Zip Oyster cards, allowing them to be used on phones. This should include proper checks and remain optional, so physical cards are still available.",
