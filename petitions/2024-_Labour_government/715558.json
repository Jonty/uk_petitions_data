        "additional_details": "We think consideration should also be given to setting a specific number or percentage of orphaned babies eligible to come to the UK to provide clarity and direction.\r\n \r\nWe think Palestinian orphans are facing a severe crisis after losing their parents in conflict, leaving them vulnerable and without stability. We think the UK has an opportunity to help by facilitating their adoption, reflecting its values of compassion and responsibility. We think this action would address an urgent humanitarian need, uphold children's rights, and promote global solidarity. By providing these children with a safe home, we think the UK can offer them a chance to rebuild their lives and contribute to society.",
        "background": "We think the Government should establish a clear and accessible process for bringing orphaned babies to the UK, ensuring that prospective adoptive parents, charities, or other responsible entities can apply for visas on their behalf. ",
