        "action": "Restore Early-May Study Leave for GCSE Students Across the UK",
        "additional_details": "Moving study leave to early June disadvantages GCSE students, as most exams will already be completed by then. Previously, students had 2\u20133 weeks of study leave to revise independently and only attended school for exams. Requiring attendance throughout the exam period reduces revision time and creates unfairness compared to previous years.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to reinstate early-May study leave for GCSE students. Removing early study leave limits revision time, increases stress, and may negatively affect exam performance and overall GCSE results across the UK.",
