        "additional_details": "The parliament should be aware of the contributions of legally working skilled workers. We work hard, pay taxes, don't claim benefits and contribute towards the country's overall development. We were sold the dream of ILR in 5 years and now home secretary wants us to go 10 years for the same which is considered an act of scam and betrayal. The government should be fair and support the right one instead of supporting the home secretary who herself is an immigrant and from the background of asylum",
        "background": "Extending ILR to 10 years unfairly impacts Skilled Worker visa holders who planned around 5-year rules. Keep 5-year route, require financial independence for new ILR holders before benefits access. This ensures fairness and maintains immigration system stability.\"",
