        "additional_details": "The crown estate profits from resources in Wales, yet the profits don't go to Wales directly. We feel that this is a clear example of wealth that's being generated in Wales being extracted away over the border.\r\n\r\nWe believe the money generated in Wales through the Crown Estate can and should be used exclusively to help invest in communities in Wales and help invest in matters like infrastructure, the NHS, Community projects etc.",
        "background": "We are calling on the Government to devolve the Crown estate from Westminster to Wales, like it was devolved to Scotland in 2017. We believe that the appointment of a Crown Estate Commissioner doesn't go far enough, and that a radical change is needed by devolving the Crown Estate.",
