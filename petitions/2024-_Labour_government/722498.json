        "additional_details": "The Supreme Court stated \u201cpolicies must be non-discriminatory and account for the specific disadvantages faced by disabled people, reinforcing systemic inequality rather than alleviating it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe failure to increase and freeze PIP also breaches Article 28 of the UNCRPD, which guarantees an adequate standard of living and social protection for disabled individuals. The UK government has ratified this treaty, meaning it has a legal and moral obligation to uphold these rights.",
