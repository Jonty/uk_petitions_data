        "additional_details": "The firework season can be distressing for many. The RSPCA receives about 400 calls a year about fireworks, with countless unreported cases of frightened animals. It\u2019s also tough for veterans; over two-thirds want stricter regulations due to PTSD triggers. Plus, more than 550 kids under 16 visit A&E around Bonfire Night due to firework injuries. Banning the sale of fireworks to the public would reduce these risks, allowing for safer, community-organised displays that everyone can enjoy without the chaos and danger of personal use.",
        "background": "I really think the UK should ban the sale of fireworks to the public. They\u2019re dangerous, cause a lot of stress for pets, and can be pretty bad for the environment. Let\u2019s keep celebrations safe and fun by having community displays instead\u2014much better for everyone!",
