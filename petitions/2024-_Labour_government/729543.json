        "additional_details": "These criminals are totally responsible for their actions. I know that judges can lift the order and name them in some cases however, I don't feel they should all automatically be protected. Most of the killings are needless and senseless and some are premeditated. The Act has not been updated since 1999.  Violent crime committed by this age group has got considerably worse since then. Defendants under 18 charged with murder, attempted murder and manslaughter should be named - same as an adult.",
        "background": "More and more 'children' have been committing murder, attempted murder and manslaughter in recent years yet they are protected by Section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 which means they cannot be named in the media. This should end since they're old enough to commit horrific crimes.",
