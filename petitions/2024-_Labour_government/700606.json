        "additional_details": "Insurance has gotten to the point, particularly for younger generations, that it inhibits them from leading a normal life via travel. This reduces economic activity and reduces spending, with no tangible benefits bar Insurer shareholders receiving dividends. Not only is it morally unfair and deplorable, it is economically nonsensical for the British Government.",
        "background": "Establish  a car insurance watchdog body with 'teeth' which limits the rampant growth of insurer profit, ensuring that consumer costs are minimised. A good start would be such that insurance does not exceed 25% of car value.",
