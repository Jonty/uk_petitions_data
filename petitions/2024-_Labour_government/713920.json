Increase police and court resources for speedier resolutions.\r\n\r\nWe feel that victims of rape are being scandalously failed by the justice system. More than 99% of rapes reported to police do not end in a conviction. We feel there are far too many delays, with cases usually taking more than a year, sometimes three. Trials can be postponed, sometimes on the day, often repeatedly. Victims can be retraumatised by the process, to the extent that many give up.\r\n \r\nWe think this situation is shameful and unacceptable.",
