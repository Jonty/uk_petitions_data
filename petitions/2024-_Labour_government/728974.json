        "additional_details": "As automatic cars become the norm, especially with the 2030 petrol/diesel ban many new drivers will only train in automatics. Yet millions of manual cars will remain. Current rules require a full practical retest to upgrade licences. We propose a simpler upgrade path for experienced automatic drivers, such as a short assessment. We think this would ease pressure on the test system and offer drivers more flexibility.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to consider introducing a straightforward process for drivers who passed their test in an automatic car to upgrade to a manual licence, without needing to retake the full practical driving test.",
