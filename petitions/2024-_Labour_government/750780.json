        "additional_details": "Rising living costs, increased household bills and higher mortgage payments are creating growing pressure for many people earning \u00a350k\u2013\u00a3100k, yet they are taxed at 40%. A 30% mid-rate band could provide fairer taxation, greater stability for working families, and better reflect today\u2019s economic realities.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to introduce a new 30% income tax band that applies to earnings between \u00a350,271 and \u00a3100,000. This could ensure a smoother, fairer progression in tax rates. Our aim is to create a more balanced, modern and equitable tax structure for middle-income earners.",
