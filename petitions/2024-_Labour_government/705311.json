But only around one in five voters voted for the current government. Around two in five didn\u2019t vote, in some cases because they feel their vote doesn't count.\r\n\r\nWe believe more voter participation and fairer Commons representation for all shades of opinion would generate more democratic legitimacy, improve law-making, and reduce group-think policy errors we feel have been seen in the last decade by enabling more effective Commons scrutiny.\r\n",
