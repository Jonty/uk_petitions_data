        "additional_details": "To qualify for their long service medal a member of the Emergency Services must complete 20 years service. I think Emergency Service members that are medically retired due to injuries received on duty before the completion of 20 years service leave with no recognition for their dedication and sacrifice made to the public. I believe a medal acknowledging them would be a much welcomed token of gratitude from the public and accepted with much pride and honour.",
        "background": "I propose a medal for Emergency Service workers that are injured on duty resulting in medical retirement. I would also ask that Emergency Service members that have been medically retired due to injuries received on duty prior to the creation of such a medal be eligible.",
