        "additional_details": "I was diagnosed with Primary Mediastianal Non Hodgkin Lymphoma in pregnancy when I was 23 years old. I had a cancer that was 90% curable with first line treatment (chemo & radio) after brutal failed treatments for 2 years, I was finally eligible for Car T Cell therapy, which was so much easier on my body and got me into remission in 90 days. I believe if you fail chemotherapy & radiotherapy and are eligible for CAR-T, you should be allowed it next. Not put on trials and more toxic drugs.\r\n",
        "background": "CAR T Cell therapy is currently allowed for some cancer patients on the NHS when other options have been unsuccessful. I think that people who are eligible should be offered it as a second line of treatment.",
