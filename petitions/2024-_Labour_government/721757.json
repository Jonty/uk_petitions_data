        "additional_details": "A three-day weekend boosts productivity, reduces stress, and improves mental health. Studies show employees accomplish more in four days than five. Burnout drops, job satisfaction rises, and turnover decreases. More rest enhances creativity, focus, and efficiency. With modern technology, five-day workweeks are outdated. A three-day weekend means more family time, hobbies, and relaxation. Happier workers perform better, benefiting businesses and society. It\u2019s time to embrace this change for a healthier, more productive future. Demand a three-day weekend now!",
        "background": "I am writing today to formally address the current issue in our society. Me and many other people that I work with believe that we should have a 3 day weekend to improve our mental health and make everyone more relaxed.",
