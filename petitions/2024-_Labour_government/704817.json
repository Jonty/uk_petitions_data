Between university classes, exams, essays, placements, and NiPad (our placement record), we\u2019re juggling a lot. We can do up to five shifts a week, but even if we work extra, our bursary is still far from enough to cover living expenses\u2014especially for those with families, rent, or mortgages to pay. It works out at \u00a32/hour - nowhere near minimum wage. It isn\u2019t fair",
