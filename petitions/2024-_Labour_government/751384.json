        "additional_details": "We believe cancelling local elections is an unacceptable assault on democratic norms. There is no national emergency to justify suspending the public\u2019s right to vote, and doing so sets a dangerous precedent that weakens accountability and concentrates power. Communities deserve timely, transparent elections. The Government must restore all local elections immediately and uphold the democratic standards this country is built on.",
        "background": "The Government must reinstate all cancelled local elections now.  Local communities need fair, timely elections, not political decisions made behind closed doors. We believe cancelling democratic votes without a national emergency is dangerous and undermines trust.",
