        "additional_details": "Extending the settlement route from 5 to 10 years would create hardship for refugees and humanitarian protection holders who are rebuilding their lives after fleeing danger. Many have already structured their plans, education, work, and family stability around the current 5-year pathway. Changing the rules would increase uncertainty, delay integration, and place additional emotional and financial pressures on vulnerable people. Keeping the 5-year route protects fairness and stability.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to maintain the current 5-year route to settlement for refugees and people granted humanitarian protection, and not extend it to 10 years. This ensures stability, fairness, and consistency for individuals who built their plans based on existing rules.",
