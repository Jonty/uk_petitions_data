        "additional_details": "I want the Government to introduce business rate relief for small businesses when they\u2019re not making a profit. Currently they must pay a fixed tax monthly even when they are struggling. This can cause independent shops to close, which may impact mental health and risk job losses. The Government should offer relief on rates to businesses that are not making a profit and resume payments once they are stable, making a profit and able to pay bills. I believe it is unfair that a business must close because of rates.",
        "background": "The Government should rethink how business rates apply to small businesses. Even when businesses may be struggling or operating at a loss, they\u2019re expected to pay the same rates. This can put pressure on them when they can least afford it; increasing the risk of closures on our high streets.",
