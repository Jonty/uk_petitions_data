        "action": "Call on the UK Government to protect Kurdish rights in North East Syria",
        "additional_details": "Kurdish-led forces were the main partner in defeating ISIS, helping remove its territorial control and reduce its global threat over many years. Their role contained security risks in North East Syria and prevented wider displacement. Recent shifts in control risk renewed instability, civilian harm and disruption of humanitarian access. UK action urging respect for the ceasefire and pressure on the Syrian government would help prevent further conflict and support regional stability.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to put political pressure on the Syrian government to protect Kurdish rights in North East Syria by upholding the ceasefire, ensuring Kurdish participation in political processes, preventing harm to civilians, and allowing humanitarian aid to reach affected areas.",
