        "additional_details": "We believe reducing nicotine strength allows citizens to gradually reduce nicotine dependence. Some vaporisers are currently prefilled to a strength of 20mg/ml, potentially causing vascular distress and other health conditions as 20mg/ml far exceeds the nicotine strength of cigarettes. We believe this will reduce health harm while still supporting citizens attempting to quit cigarettes.",
        "background": "Enact a law limiting the strength of prefilled nicotine vaporisers to a maximum of 5mg/ml and require companies to offer graduated products of 2.5mg/ml and 1mg/ml to more closely align with goals to stop smoking.",
