        "action": "Provide free school meals to all students in secondary schools.",
        "additional_details": "The government should provide free school meals so that students focus on their learning. Hunger makes it hard for students to concentrate, remember things, and stay motivated in class. Free meals would give every child an equal chance to succeed and improve their mental and physical health. When students are well-fed, they perform better and achieve their goals. For the youth, eating 3 meals a day is essential as it helps them grow physically and grow in their learning and their future.",
        "background": "We want students to thrive in the school environment but this is being limited as their worries and focus is more on not being able to afford school lunch or food outside of school.If students receive free school meals they will be able to concentrate more in the classrooms and improve their health.",
