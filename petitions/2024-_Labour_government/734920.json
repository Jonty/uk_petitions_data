        "additional_details": "As a part of the teenage community, we often feel at risk of injustice due to the lack of education provided regarding political parties. Many don\u2019t know the difference between parties, and since we are the people affected most by any future leaderships and changes, we have the right to know what we\u2019re voting for, why, and the importance of our individual decisions. Unbiased education for younger students about UK politics would fight misinformation and misunderstanding in readiness for voting.",
        "background": "Teenagers are misinformed and uneducated about the importance and details of voting in General Elections. As a representative of this community, we face fake news and a dire lack of education on the different political parties. We need education in schools to help us make well considered decisions.",
