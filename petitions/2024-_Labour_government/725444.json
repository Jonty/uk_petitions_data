Our society has been built on the principles of Christianity, which has created a flourishing nation. Banning Christian practices in public spaces is discrimination against a particular group of people as no such bans are being forced on other religious groups and ideologies. If such laws are passed, this will be a massive detriment to our way of living and society as we know it will crumble.",
