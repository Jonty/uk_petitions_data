        "additional_details": "Thousands of skilled migrants came to the UK in good faith, many from former colonies \u2014working in vital sectors, paying taxes, and building lives on the clear promise of ILR after 5 years. Changing the rules now shatters trust, disrupts families and children, and risks pushing long-term residents out of communities they support. Those who followed every rule shouldn\u2019t be punished by shifting goalposts, and such changes will harm the UK\u2019s reputation and ability to attract future talent.",

We came in good faith, filled vital roles, paid taxes, and built lives here based on a 5-year pathway. Keep your promise \u2014apply changes only to new applicants, not those already settled in the UK.",
