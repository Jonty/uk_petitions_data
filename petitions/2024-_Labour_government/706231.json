        "additional_details": "From working within the nhs you see how tired and hard working the staff are and what they have to deal with, they barely get paid enough for what they are worth, for example people go to school for years then college, then off too university and study for years to get to the level they are at and they don\u2019t get paid enough for it. So to charge them for turning up to work and to leave isn\u2019t respect for what they do it\u2019s greed from the government therefore it should be free for all staff.",
        "background": "All nhs staff should not have to pay for parking, they work 12 hour shifts with only little breaks, they put up with way too much on a day to day basis and there would be no nhs without this staff so they should be treated and shown more respect for what they do.",
