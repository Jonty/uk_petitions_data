It is not fair that they have to come back from risking their lives for us and have to live on the streets and it is way more common than anyone realises. These brave souls risk their lives for this country daily and how do we repay them? We don\u2019t. It is unacceptable to say the least.",
        "background": "I want there to be a program specifically for veterans, with support and help finding a stable, easy to run home for when they future back from combat/overseas! These people risk their lives for us and our future and our safety on a daily basis and yet they\u2019re still homeless!!",
