        "action": "Increase the number of questions the opposition can ask the government at PMQ\u2019s.",
        "additional_details": "We want the Government to increase the number of questions the opposition can ask in PMQs to ensure greater accountability and transparency in our democracy. This provides more opportunities to challenge the Government\u2019s decisions and raise concerns that matter to the public. By expanding the process, we can strengthen democratic debate and ensure that the voices of people across the country are better represented. It is essential that the Government is fully held to account for a better future.",
        "background": "Increasing the number of questions the opposition can ask at PMQs from 6 to a minimum of 12 will enhance accountability, ensure the government addresses more pressing issues, and allow greater scrutiny of its decisions and actions. This promotes a more transparent and effective democratic process.",
