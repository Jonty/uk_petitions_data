        "additional_details": "All applicants and recipients of PIP are under the care of doctors, and often specialist doctors. Even with training, we think a nurse (for example) is not qualified to make a life changing determination on how an applicant's disability affects them. These are complex questions, and due to the importance of the decision, it is vital that they are assessed appropriately, which we feel the current system fails to do. We think this failure could be discriminatory to the disabled community.",
        "background": "Currently people we think are under-qualified are carrying out PIP assessments & reviews. We feel this is unfair as PIP claimants should be assessed by practising doctors and in complex cases, specialist doctors, not occupational therapists, nurses, physiotherapists, paramedics, or pharmacists.",
