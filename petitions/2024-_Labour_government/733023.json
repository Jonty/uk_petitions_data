        "action": "Universal basic electricity allowance for all households, with usage thresholds",
        "additional_details": "I think a basic free electricity allowance, for all 'on grid' households, would help thousands of people in fuel poverty. I propose the energy use thresholds (includes electricity, oil and gas usage), as I think there's a familiarity around income tax 'thresholds' and contributing more to society, the more you earn. I believe the initiative would encourage higher energy use households to make savings, invest in low carbon technology and help drive local jobs. I'd also propose households who require high energy use for health reasons (there may be other circumstances to include) are capped at a lower 'threshold'. This scheme could also be extended to small business owners.",
        "background": "Set into law that all households be given free, basic electricity allowances, eg 4kWh daily, funded by energy companies through a series of energy use thresholds, where cost per kWh increases (for electricity, oil & gas). Capped for households with high energy use for legitimate health reasons.",
