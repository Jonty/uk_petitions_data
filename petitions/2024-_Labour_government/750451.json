        "additional_details": "I want the Government to take action as going to and from places which need to be accessed such as shopping for groceries, is becoming more and more dangerous. In my personal experiences alone, I have been forced to go on the road multiple times, where cars do not see you as a wheelchair user, I have had my wheel broken due to uneven paving, forcing me to not be able to get about until fixed, and there are many times I have near fallen off of my wheelchair.",
        "background": "I would like the government to review roads every few years, making sure that they are accessible for wheelchair users. Examples of inaccessibility in streets: lack of drop curbs, uneven paving and paving that has worn down greatly (making drop curbs not usable) Forcing users to go on the road",
