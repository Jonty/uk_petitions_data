        "additional_details": "People with disabilities find it difficult enough to live with daily life challenges not to mention any pain they may be suffering with on a day-to-day basis.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely unfair that the government are targeting the disabled because of cut backs when it is clear the disabled person has limited options to the abled person.\r\n\r\nDisability benefits are low and it most times they don\u2019t even cover the bills.\r\n\r\nWe ask the government NOT to financially target the disabled and to review these plans.",
        "background": "We are calling on the government to reconsider cutting PIP benefits in-line with inflation rates and to understand that people with disabilities are very limited in what they can do which is not by choice - Therefore, should not be financially penalised as a result as this is extremely unfair.",
