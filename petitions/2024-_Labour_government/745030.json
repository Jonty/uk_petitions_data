        "additional_details": "Parliament should ban firework sales to the public and require event licenses with a minimum \u00a3100 fee.

This would protect animals, veterans, vulnerable people, and reduce anti-social use while still allowing controlled community celebrations.",
        "background": "We call for a ban on the sale of fireworks to the general public and the introduction of a licensing system, with a nominal fee per event. This measure would ensure responsible use of fireworks , while reducing the distress and harm caused to animals, vulnerable people, and local communities.",
