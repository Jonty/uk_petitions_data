        "additional_details": "It is immoral for a party to make pledges, secure votes from them and win elections, and then - as there's no legal requirement to keep  any of those promises - they aren't kept. It must be a legal requirement to perform auditable checks on whether they can commit to these pledges before they are made, and then to uphold those pledges if they win the election. Unless there are extraordinary, unavoidable, unforeseen circumstances, then if pledges aren't kept then the election needs to be rerun.",
        "background": "Parties need to legally do any and all checks before making each election pledge, and then legally they have to keep those pledges. If the manifesto pledges are subsequently broken unless through entirely unforeseeable circumstances then the election needs to be re-run.",
