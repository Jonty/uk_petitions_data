        "additional_details": "Parliament should ensure tax reform strengthens opportunity whilst safeguarding an independent school sector renowned worldwide. Instead of a flat 20% tax, schools should earn relief through proven community benefit. This could help keep private schools accessible beyond the super wealthy, support partnerships with state education, and protect against closures and local economic impact. Clear obligations with fair incentives could strengthen state schools while preserving the private sector.",
        "background": " VAT on private schools should apply only if they fail certain charitable criteria, such as offering free/reduced places, teaching support, or shared facilities. We believe this could promote fairness, integration, and access, avoiding elitism and protecting families\u2019 educational choice.\r\n \r\n",
