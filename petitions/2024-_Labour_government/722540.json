        "additional_details": "Domiciliary care workers provide life-saving care, yet they are not paid for on-call night shifts unless actively working. Meanwhile, on-call firefighters receive compensation for their availability. We think this disparity is unfair and exploitative. We think care workers face exhaustion and financial strain while ensuring vulnerable individuals receive essential overnight care. We think fair pay will improve retention, quality of care, and dignity for both workers and those they support.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to require companies to pay domiciliary care workers fair wages for on-call night shifts, similar to on-call firefighters. We think this change would recognise their essential role and ensure they are compensated for being available to respond to emergencies.",
