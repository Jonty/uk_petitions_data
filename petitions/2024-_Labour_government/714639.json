        "action": "Regulate the housing market more strictly",
        "additional_details": "Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees respect for private and family life, including the home. We think current mortgage laws often undermine this right. We think landmark cases like Manchester CC v Pinnock recognized the need for protections, but inconsistencies remain. We think the housing crisis in London exacerbates the issue. We think we must ensure fair housing policies to prevent exploitation and support key workers. We think the government must address the unregulated real estate market, which has spiralled out of control, making it impossible for young people to afford decent living conditions or purchase property due to skyrocketing and unrealistic prices. We think these measures will uphold human dignity and provide a stable living environment.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to regulate the housing market and end predatory mortgage practices. Enact stricter laws, ensure fair mortgage practices, align housing prices with conditions and wages, provide rent subsidies or reduced mortgage rates for essential workers, and prevent exploitation.",
