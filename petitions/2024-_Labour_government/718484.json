        "additional_details": "Large corporations in England and Wales often use complex tax structures to minimize their UK tax. This is unfair to smaller businesses and individual taxpayers who carry a disproportionate burden. This would ensure they contribute more fairly based on their actual economic activity.  It's about all businesses paying their fair share.",
        "background": "The current tax system struggles to capture revenue from large corporations in the UK economy.  A 10% sales tax on corporations with over \u00a31 billion turnover from England and Wales sales would help lower the increasing burden on the majority of the people. This cap considers all other taxes paid.",
