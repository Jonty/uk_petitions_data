        "action": "Do not abandon the jury system for crown court trials in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Juries allow citizens to play a role in criminal justice. This reinforces the idea that criminal justice belongs to the people, not just legal professionals or the state. Verdicts delivered by 12 citizens have greater democratic legitimacy than decisions made by a judge.\r\nJuries are a safeguard against state overreach or bias. Because jurors are lay people with no professional connection to the police, prosecution, or government, they are less likely to be influenced by institutional pressures.",
        "background": "The jury system remains one of the strongest bulwarks against arbitrary state power and a uniquely British contribution to fair criminal justice. While not perfect, its strengths in legitimacy, independence, and community representation are seen as outweighing the occasional anomalies.",
