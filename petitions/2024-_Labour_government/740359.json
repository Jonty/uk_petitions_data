        "additional_details": "I believe that all streets outside of educational or childcare facilities, including private day nurseries, should have a 20mph speed limit or less. Additionally, I think that speed bumps and metal railings at entrances are necessary to ensure children's safety. I've noticed that 30mph limits are often ignored, and the lack of railings increases the risk. These measures should be mandatory for all such areas.",
