Additional housing would put further strain on an already congested road network.\r\n\t\u2022\tPressure on Local Services: Local schools, GP surgeries, and emergency services are already overstretched and cannot sustain a large influx of new residents.\r\n\t\u2022\tFlooding and Drainage Concerns: The land in question may not be suitable for large-scale development due to water runoff and potential flood risk.",
