        "additional_details": "\u2018Grey belt\u2019 was initially described as poor-quality Green Belt land like disused car parks. We believe the new definition in the NPPF is so broad it could include almost any Green Belt land. The Green Belt prevents urban sprawl, protects nature & supports our health. We urge the Government to restore protections by ensuring that \u2018grey belt\u2019 proposals are judged against all 5 Green Belt purposes consistently throughout the NPPF to balance development needs against the many benefits of conservation.",
        "background": "We want an urgent change to the \u2018grey belt\u2019 definition in the NPPF. We think the grey belt glossary definition [which] could result in the loss of our countryside forever - vital for health and wellbeing, combatting climate change and supporting wildlife - needs revising.",
