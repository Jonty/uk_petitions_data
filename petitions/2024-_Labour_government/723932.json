        "additional_details": "Implementing a self-swab option for HPV-negative patients like myself could be a revolutionary change that allows us to participate in these essential screenings comfortably. This minor but meaningful adjustment to clinical procedures can considerably enhance the healthcare experience for thousands of HPV-negative women, particularly those living with vaginismus and endometriosis, a condition that affects approximately 1.5 million women and those assigned female at birth in the UK.",
        "background": "Recently, I was diagnosed with vaginismus, a condition that makes any form of insertion into the vagina a painful and uncomfortable experience. This diagnosis has made it challenging to undergo necessary health checks, including the crucial screening for cervical cancer.",
