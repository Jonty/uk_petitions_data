        "additional_details": "Sir Winston Churchill\u2019s leadership was key to the survival of the United Kingdom during the Second World War, and ultimately the defeat of Nazism. His image is emblematic of the national struggle for survival and the courage and sacrifices of that generation, to whom we all owe our freedom.  His place on the \u2018fiver\u2019 is a daily reminder to ordinary people of that pivotal moment in our history. The BoE proposes redesigns of our bank notes. Please let\u2019s not lose Churchill in the process.",
        "background": "The Government should use its authority to instruct the Bank of England to retain the image of Sir Winston Churchill on the five pound note. If the Government does not have that authority, it should put a motion before the House of Commons urging the BoE to retain Churchill.",
