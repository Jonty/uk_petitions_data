        "additional_details": "We think the law should insist a formal contract is signed by the original owner before the owner loses the legal right to reclaim their dog. In cases where no formal contract exists, such as informal agreements, the original owner should have the legal chance to reclaim their dog.\r\n \r\nThis is because dogs are sentient beings (not property). We believe it will help avoid owners being misled, unclear about agreements, or scammed into rehoming their dogs. It will add clarity to agreements & safeguard people and dogs.",
