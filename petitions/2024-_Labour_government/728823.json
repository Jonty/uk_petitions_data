Prison life needs to be more of a deterrent.\r\n2. Insufficient consideration has been given to the impact on victims of crime.\r\n3. Early release is not the answer, it is a get out of jail free card.\r\n4. Reduced crowding should be addressed by building prisons, using vacant buildings, and more deportations of foreign criminals. \r\n5. We cannot pander to those already convicted and sentenced.",
