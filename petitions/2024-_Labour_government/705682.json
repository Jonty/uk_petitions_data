        "additional_details": "These veterans, despite their dedication and sacrifice, were excluded from the pension benefits introduced in later schemes.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of the AFPS 1975 and AFPS 2015, shorter service periods (e.g. two years) have been deemed sufficient for pension rights. We think it is unjust that pre-1975 veterans remain excluded and receive no pension for their service. ",
        "background": "We call on government to address what we view as a longstanding injustice for veterans who served their country and left before April 1 1975 who don\u2019t receive any preserved pension benefits from the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS). We would like these made retrospective to include those veterans.",
