        "additional_details": "Many 16\u201318s with EHCPs are being charged \u00a3600+ to reach college, unlike peers under 16 or over 19. This breaches the Equality Act 2010 and undermines the Education & Skills Act 2008. These students often can\u2019t travel independently. Carers are being pushed out of work or into debt. The current policy is unjust, unequal, and economically damaging. This loophole must be closed with urgent national reform.",
        "background": "We want the Government to urgently review and change national post-16 transport policy so that all young people aged 16\u201318 with an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) receive free or fully subsidised transport to their named college or educational placement.",
