        "additional_details": "We want the Government and Parliament to act as we believe current housing standards don\u2019t protect people with pets, forcing many to choose between the shelter and their companion. Pets can provide vital emotional support, reduce stress and loneliness, and help people cope with homelessness. Updating the Social Housing Consumer Standards to require shelters to allow pets could prevent unnecessary relinquishment, and create a fairer, more humane system and ultimately reduce homelessness.",
        "background": "An estimated one in four people experiencing homeless has a pet \u2013 not just a companion, but a lifeline. Yet many hostels exclude them, shutting out people who may rely on them most.",
