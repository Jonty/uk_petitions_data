We think it may too enable: manipulation of individual voting at scale via social media microtargeting, spreading fake news, increasing big tech power, mistrust of govs, opinion polarisation, victimisation. RTB system data can be accessed by anyone, not just advertisers (as reported by ICCL)!",

Data is sold through Real Time Bidding (RTB) system which is easily accessible and data may be de-anonymised. We think fines show GDPR may not be adhered to.",
