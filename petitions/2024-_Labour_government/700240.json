        "additional_details": "I believe the previous government did well to crack down on protecting children from smoking and smoke environments through various legislation, taxation and a law that was introduced in 2015 to make it illegal to smoke inside of cars with children under the age of 18. The NHS website also states that passive/second hand smoke is especially harmful for children and increases their risk of serious conditions such as meningitis, bronchitis and asthma. People who breathe in secondhand smoke regularly are more likely to get lung cancer.",
        "background": "I think it should be illegal for adults to smoke indoors where children under 18 live, due to the danger of passive smoking. I think that more must be done to protect our children.",
