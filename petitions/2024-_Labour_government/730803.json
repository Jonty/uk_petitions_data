This should be raised to university age (e.g. at least 21).\r\n \r\nWe believe everyone is feeling the impact of the current cost of living crisis, especially students - many of whom already sacrifice their studying to work. Prescriptions are an additional expense students could do without.\r\n \r\nThe age for English students in full time education getting free prescriptions should be raised from 18 to university age (at least 21).",
