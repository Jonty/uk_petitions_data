        "additional_details": "I believe this is a matter of public safety due to injury\u2019s caused as well as for the safety and wellbeing of all animals.\r\nThe impact fireworks have on pets/wildlife is devastating, the anxiety and panic it causes due to them not understanding what is happening is unnecessary. If fireworks are limited to organised licensed events and to the 5th November only then owners can prepare and protect their pets/animals as well as not having as much of an impact on wildlife due to the reduced locations.",
