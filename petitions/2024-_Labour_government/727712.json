        "action": "Do NOT apply the new 10 year requirement for obtaining IRL retrospectively.",
        "additional_details": "Many people have come here on work visas and planned their lives based on existing rules. Thousands have been already working in the UK for years, many being skilled or essential workers, all valuable members of our society. Many took on a lot of debt to make that move. While the law may potentially have to change to address immigration issues, it seems deeply unfair for all those fellow members of British society to have their lives upended retrospectively by moving the goal posts now.",
        "background": "The government announced plans to extend the time required in the UK before being eligible to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain from 5 years to 10. Apply this only to new arrivals once the law is passed instead of retrospectively changing the requirements for people already in the country.",
