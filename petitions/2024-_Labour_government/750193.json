        "additional_details": "Climate change drives more frequent floods and storms, endangering UK homes, communities, and infrastructure. Net Zero goals are key for long-term sustainability but we feel they are ambitious and may not act fast enough. Physical barriers like dykes provide proven, immediate safeguards as a backup to future plans. For example, 10% from \u00a363bn clean energy capital could boost the \u00a310.5bn flood program to 2036, backing Environment Agency.",

Pass legislation or a budget amendment for this, with transparent annual reports on progress and projects to guard against rising seas and erosion.",
