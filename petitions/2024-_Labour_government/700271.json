        "additional_details": "The change will have a crippling effect on farmers' families due to the introduction of an unaffordable tax bill upon a farmer's death.  \r\n\r\nThe change will force farming families off the land for which they have given everything, wiping out the next generation's opportunity to carry on and cultivate the family farming business.\r\n\r\nThe removal of 100% relief on agricultural property needs to be reversed so that farmers and their families are protected to offer the next generation a future.",
        "background": "During the Autumn 2024 budget the Government announced taxation changes, which will see the removal of 100% relief on agricultual property.\r\n\r\nThe change will have devastating consequences on the livelihoods of farmers and their families.",
