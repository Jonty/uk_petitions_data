        "action": "Introduce mandatory prostate cancer testing for all men in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in UK men, with 52,000 diagnoses and 12,000 deaths each year. \r\n\r\nCurrently there is no national screening programme, and access to PSA testing and MRI varies by region. Mandatory testing would end this postcode lottery, ensure equal access, and save lives through earlier detection and treatment. \r\n\r\nAny fears or concerns surrounding the accuracy of the current PSA test can be allayed by current trials underway for a more accurate one in due course.",
        "background": "The Government should introduce a mandatory national programme of prostate cancer testing for all men over 50, or younger if at higher risk, using PSA blood tests supported by MRI and other diagnostic tools where appropriate.",
