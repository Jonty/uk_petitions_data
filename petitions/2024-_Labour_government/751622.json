        "additional_details": "TA and SEN LSA staff play a crucial role in supporting pupils with SEN and those falling behind, yet their pay, progression and conditions lag far behind teachers despite rising responsibilities. Recruitment and retention are in crisis, worsening outcomes for vulnerable pupils. National reform is needed to ensure fair pay, clear job standards, consistent London weighting, equal cost-of-living awards and sustainable workloads.",
        "background": "We ask the Government for a national reform for TA and SEN LSA roles: national pay scale, end term-time-only, equal cost-of-living awards, SEN allowance, Green Book reform, correct London weighting, national job description, workload review and automatic pay progression.",
