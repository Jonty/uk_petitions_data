        "action": "Introduce Statutory Menstrual Leave For People With Fibroids and PCOS",
        "additional_details": "There is already a petition for endometriosis and adenomyosis, but fibroids and PCOS can also cause debilitating periods and must be recognised. Fibroids affect 2 in 3 women and lead to heavy, painful periods. PCOS affects 1 in 10 women and can cause irregular, painful periods and long-term health issues. We believe without protections; people may face inequality and financial penalty for managing their health. We believe this petition ensures that these menstrual conditions are represented.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to introduce statutory paid menstrual leave of up to 3 days per month for people with fibroids and PCOS, similar to Portugal\u2019s model. We believe leave should come with strong workplace protections, be confidential and require a single annual medical certificate.",
