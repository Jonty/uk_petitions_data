        "additional_details": "Current cannabis laws are outdated, unjust, and harm society. Prohibition criminalises patients, wastes police resources, fuels organised crime, and ignores medical evidence. Legalisation will generate billions in tax, create jobs, reduce harm, protect public health, and align the UK with countries where regulated cannabis works safely and successfully.",
        "background": "Pass legislation to legalise cannabis for adults, permitting licensed retail sales, personal home growing, and cannabis social clubs. Include automatic expungement of past cannabis convictions and regulation similar to alcohol.",
