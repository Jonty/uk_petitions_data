        "additional_details": "We think systemic failures in oversight have led to the exploitation of migrant workers in the healthcare sector, who are left stranded and vulnerable when employers have their Visa Sponsorships cancelled due to misconduct. These workers face financial hardship and potential deportation while rogue employers avoid accountability. We think immediate action is needed to protect workers. By establishing better oversight, and protections, the government could address this issue and uphold justice.",
        "background": "Implement protections for migrant care workers whose Certificates of Sponsorship are cancelled due to employer misconduct. Require inspections of care providers, establish penalties for fraudulent operators, allow affected workers to switch sectors, and provide temporary visa extension.",
