        "background": "I live in bestwood village NG6 and have for 3 years. One of the main roads (Moor road) has a ridiculous amount of speed bumps. Its ruins the suspension and tyres on everyone\u2019s cars. There is a more built up road nearby that doesn\u2019t even have any. I\u2019m asking for there to be changed to cameras please.",
