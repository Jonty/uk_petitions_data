        "additional_details": "This prolonged fee stagnation poses challenges for MOT providers. Operational costs including equipment maintenance, staff wages, and facility overheads have risen substantially over the past 15 years. Without corresponding fee adjustments, providers may struggle to maintain service quality and safety standards.",
        "background": "The maximum fee for an MOT test in the UK has remained unchanged since April 6, 2010. Over this period, cumulative inflation has significantly eroded the real value of this fee. Adjusting for inflation, the fee from 2010 would be equivalent to approximately \u00a385 today (for a class 4 vehicle).",
