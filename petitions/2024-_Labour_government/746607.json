        "additional_details": "Health and care workers cannot avoid exposure to infection in their duties. Employers have a legal and moral duty of care to protect staff from preventable harm, including infectious diseases.\r\n\r\nRequiring staff to pay for essential vaccines would undermine that duty, reduce uptake, and increase illness, transmission and absence. The Government should confirm that all health and care staff will always be eligible for a free COVID-19 vaccine in order to maintain a safe and effective workforce.",
        "background": "The Government must ensure that all NHS and social care workers continue to be offered COVID-19 vaccinations free of charge whenever vaccination programmes are in place, protecting staff and patients and upholding the employer duty of care.",
