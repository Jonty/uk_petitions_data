        "additional_details": "Under the proposed system, those who currently have a vote in the London Mayoral election would retain their full voting rights. In addition, residents elsewhere in the UK would each have a vote, but with a reduced weighting \u2014 four votes from outside London would count as the equivalent of one London vote.\r\n\r\nThis approach would ensure that the voices of Londoners remain central, while also giving people across the UK a say in choosing the Mayor of their Capital City.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to change the voting system for the election of the London Mayor.\r\n\r\nLondon is the Capital City of the UK and represents not only Londoners but the nation as a whole. We believe that people across the country should have some representation in the election of its Mayor.",
