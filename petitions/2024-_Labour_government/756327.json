        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to reform Employment Tribunal enforcement, government helplines, and benefit rules. Claimants should receive awards directly, with the state recovering money from employers. Helplines must provide practical guidance, and individuals who have paid taxes and National Insurance for years should receive support in their own right, not based on a partner\u2019s income.\r\nConclusion:\r\nCurrent systems place the burden, cost, and risk on law-abiding individuals while allowing employers and institutions to avoid responsibility. Reform in these areas would promote fairness, restore confidence in public systems, and ensure justice and support are real and effective.",
