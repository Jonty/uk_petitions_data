        "additional_details": "The current MOT backlog in Knowsley is forcing private hire drivers to wait months for tests, making them unable to work legally. This is causing serious financial hardship, many are losing income, falling behind on bills, and even facing eviction. Other councils accept DVLA MOTs, which are safe and reliable. We ask the Government to step in, ensure fairness, and allow DVLA MOTs temporarily so drivers can keep working and providing for their families during this crisis.",
        "background": "Issuing national guidance or policy, if needed, to allow all councils flexibility in accepting DVLA MOTs during periods of high demand or local service disruption \u2014 to prevent loss of income and hardship for drivers.",
