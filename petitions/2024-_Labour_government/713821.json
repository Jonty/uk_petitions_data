        "additional_details": "No race holds an exclusive claim as a victim or perpetrator of racism. Diversity hiring perpetuates systemic bias, rewarding identity over merit and excluding qualified individuals. This practice undermines national productivity by prioritizing characteristics over skills, weakening the workforce, and reducing efficiency. Employment should reward talent and effort. Ending diversity hiring will restore fairness, improve efficiency, and foster a more united, productive society.",
        "background": "Outlaw diversity hiring to encourage employment decisions based on merit, abilities, and qualifications, not protected characteristics. Racism isn\u2019t a value\u2014it\u2019s an act of discrimination. Even well-intentioned, it creates division and inequality.",
