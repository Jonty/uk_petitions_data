        "additional_details": "Employment agencies are modern day exploitation of workers in the country, all they are bothered about is making money for themselves and not giving a second thought to the people that are going out to work. It's 1 person going out to work and earning 2 wages, 1 for the agency and 1 for the worker. They won't negotiate wages with you, saying the employer won't pay anymore, but the workers have a contract with the agency and not the employer, its the agencies that are responsible for the workers wages not the companies.\r\nTherefore, there is really nothing an agency can do that can't be agreed between a worker and a company.",
        "background": "Abolish employment agencies and go back to the job centre system, were people can directly deal with companies requiring workers.",
