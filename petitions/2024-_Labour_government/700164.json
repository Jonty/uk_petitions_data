Votes should count the same wherever you live. \r\n\r\nWe demand the government replaces the antiquated First Past the Post system with a version of Proportional Representation. This is the most common form of democracy in the world and yet Britain lags behind.\r\n\r\nTactical voting undermines true representation and shouldn't be necessary. Every voter should be able to vote \u2018for\u2019 good politicians and the policies they believe in, not just against bad parties.",
        "background": "Replace the First-Past-the-Post voting system for Westminster. Repair the crisis of trust in Politics with a proportional system so all votes count equally.\r\n\r\nThe 2024 UK general election was the least representative in our history. 1 in 5 voted tactically, and 74% of votes were \u2018wasted\u2019.",
