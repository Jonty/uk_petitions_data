        "additional_details": "Many students provide 35 hours or more of unpaid care each week for disabled parents or relatives but are excluded from Carer\u2019s Allowance solely because they are in full-time education. This forces carers to choose between education and financial support, even though the care must still be provided. The rule is outdated and unfairly treats student carers differently from others providing the same level of care. Eligibility should be based on hours of care, not education status.",
        "background": "Amend the eligibility rules for Carer\u2019s Allowance so that people in full-time education who provide at least 35 hours of care per week can receive Carer\u2019s Allowance, provided all other conditions are met.",
