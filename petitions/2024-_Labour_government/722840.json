        "additional_details": "The Tour de France is one of the showpiece events in all of sports. In 2027 for the first time both the Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s tours will begin in Britain, a major success for British Cycling.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, from 2026, UK viewers will need an expensive multi-sport subscription in order to watch live coverage of the races.\r\n\r\nBy opening up the coverage to as many people as possible, the cultural and health benefits to the nation of this unique opportunity will be maximised.",
        "background": "The 2027 Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Tours de France will start in Britain, but live coverage will be paywalled.\r\n\r\nThe government should use its influence with organisers and broadcasters to ensure that the British stages of these events are made available to watch live on free-to-air television in the UK.",
