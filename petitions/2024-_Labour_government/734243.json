        "additional_details": "Parents of disabled children should not be forced to spend thousands of pounds and go through a stressful court process just to continue caring for their child after they turn 18. If a young person lacks capacity and still lives under their parent\u2019s care, their parent should automatically be allowed to advocate, attend appointments and make best-interest decisions. The current system is outdated, discriminatory and creates unnecessary trauma. A simple legal amendment could give peace of mind to thousands of families and reduce the pressure on already overstretched services.",
        "background": "Change UK law to automatically allow parents or carers to retain parental responsibility when their disabled child turns 18, if the child lacks capacity and remains in the parent\u2019s care. This should remove the need for costly and unnecessary applications to the Court of Protection.",
