        "additional_details": "may appear harmless, but they closely resemble gambling and can be harmful to vulnerable people. Although they include a free entry route to avoid regulation, in reality, most people enter through paid methods \u2014 often repeatedly \u2014 with low chances of winning. This setup exploits a legal grey area that allows gambling-like behaviour to go unchecked.\r\n\r\nThe lack of regulation means these websites can:\r\n\t\u2022\tEncourage excessive spending without affordability checks.\r\n\t\u2022\tAvoid safer gambling obligations.",
        "background": "These online raffles mimic gambling but avoid regulation by offering free entry routes. This loophole puts vulnerable people at risk. Without oversight, there\u2019s no protection from harm, no transparency, and no accountability. Regulation is needed to ensure fairness and consumer safety.",
