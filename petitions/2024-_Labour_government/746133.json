        "action": "End the weaponisation of abuse allegations in family court",
        "additional_details": "In family court, allegations of harm or abuse can lead to immediate restrictions on a parent\u2019s contact, even when no evidence has been verified. While protecting children from genuine harm is essential, safeguards are needed to prevent misuse. False or unfounded claims can cause lasting emotional harm to families and undermine trust in the justice system. In some cases, such allegations are used as a form of control, effectively weaponising the process against the other parent.",
        "background": "We want the Government to reform family court procedures so that unproven allegations cannot be used to restrict a parent\u2019s rights or contact with their child. Decisions should be based on credible evidence following fair and balanced investigation.",
