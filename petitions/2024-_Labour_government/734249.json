        "additional_details": "The humanitarian situation in Gaza is deplorable.  An entire nation has seen their homeland reduced to nothing more than rubble by a force with far superior resources and military capabilities.  The people of Gaza are now being systematically deprived of food, water, essential medicines and basic provisions, threatening their very existence.  No person on the planet should think the situation in Gaza is acceptable, and no child should think that we stood by and let it happen.",
        "background": "Under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the UK Government should formally request the United Nations deploy peacekeeping forces and equipment to Gaza, to establish meaningful and safe distribution of aid.",
