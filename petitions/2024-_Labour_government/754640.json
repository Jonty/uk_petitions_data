        "additional_details": "We believe some illegal migrants are coming to the United Kingdom & having their applications rejected but at the same time having children. Then they are waiting for the child to become seven & then by law they can apply for a residency for the child because the child was born in the UK & then they themselves can apply to get residency through the child. We believe this is a loophole that many illegal migrants are using so we must stop this.",
        "background": "We would like the government to scrap this route which gives parents the right to apply for residency for their child if born in the UK & remained for seven years. We are concerned this is a loophole for illegal migrants to stay in the UK even if their applications have been refused many times.",
