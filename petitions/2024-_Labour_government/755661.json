Where antisocial behaviour is persistent and well documented, current eviction processes can often be slow and complex, allowing harm to neighbours to continue. We ask the Government to reform the law to empower local councils to take swifter action in these cases, while retaining safeguards, so councils can act proportionately, protect residents, and maintain safe communities.",
