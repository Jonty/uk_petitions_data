        "additional_details": "The UK tax system penalises families where one parent earns most or all of the income. Two people on \u00a333k each pay far less tax than one earner on \u00a366k supporting a partner and children. Optional Joint Filing fixes this unfairness, makes one wage go further, reduces reliance on Universal Credit, and brings us in line with family-friendly systems like Germany and France.",
        "background": "Introduce Optional Joint Filing for married couples and civil partners. Let households pool income, split it equally, and apply both partners\u2019 tax allowances and bands. Keep individual filing as default so no one is worse off.",
