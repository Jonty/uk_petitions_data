        "action": "Stop the Government using general tax to fund the BBC",
        "additional_details": "I believe it's important to stop any funding of a mainstream media source from general taxation. The BBC was once the shining example of journalism, but in more recent times, like many other mainstream media sources, it has become untrustworthy. Since the news of Jimmy Saville, & more recently Huw Edwards broke, many have CHOSEN to stop paying the TV licence to prevent our money supporting this broken institution. Funding through general tax would take away that important choice.",
        "background": "The Labour Government want to change how the BBC is funded, by scrapping the TV licence & funding the BBC from general taxation. They have set out plans to implement this from 2027. The BBC needs to go, it is broken beyond repair.",
