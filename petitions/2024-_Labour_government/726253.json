        "action": "Introduce free bus passes at age 60 in England, like Scotland, Wales and NI",
        "additional_details": "At 60, many people face health challenges, financial strain, and social isolation. In Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, free bus travel helps people stay connected and active. England\u2019s older citizens deserve the same support and fairness. Providing free bus travel from age 60 would help people stay engaged, reduce isolation, ease financial pressure, and promote the use of greener, more sustainable transport, benefiting both individuals and communities, improving quality of life.",
        "background": "We want the Government to allow people in England to get a concessionary bus pass at age 60, as they do in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This would improve fairness, support older people\u2019s wellbeing, and encourage greater use of public transport.",
