        "additional_details": "All know the thing that in last 10-20 years population of UK constantly grew. A big part of this population still live in a terraced house, and can\u2019t afford to rent or to buy a house with a driveway even. So on these streets residents also need to have a car for their daily life. Parking spaces become a nightmare in time. They are people that own and 3-4 cars parked on one street, others no beings residents on the street can leave the car on the road because simply it is public highway. But someone with 1 car in family is difficult to find one space.",
        "background": "Change in all important documents like national public highways , other regulations regarding parking on streets with terraced houses. This will allow councils to alocate and made properly markings for parking every resident to have his parking space in front of his property.",
