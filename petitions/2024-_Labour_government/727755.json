        "additional_details": "The change to move the goalposts for thousands of people who have followed the rules in good faith, made the UK their home, and contributed to our society risks creating unnecessary insecurity, undermining integration, and contradicting Britain\u2019s proud tradition of fairness and respect for those who build their lives here.\r\n\r\nWe urge the Government to maintain the existing five-year settlement route and ensure any changes apply only prospectively \u2014 not to those already part of our communities.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government and Parliament to reject the proposal in the 2025 Immigration White Paper to extend the settlement requirement from five to ten years for migrants already living and working in the UK.",
