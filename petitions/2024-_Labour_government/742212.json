        "additional_details": "The hard shoulder provides a continuous refuge in an emergency. It is there pretty much whenever you need it. It can get you off the live carriageway and is far safer than sitting in a live lane frequented by HGV\u2019s who may not see you until the last minute. It can give you that precious time to evacuate your vehicle and get behind the barrier to await rescue. It can also provide a critical path for emergency services to get to an accident when traffic blocks the road. Bring them back for all motorways.",
        "background": "Since smart motorways have done away with the hard shoulder, people have lost their lives in collisions resulting from being stranded with nowhere to go.\r\nSafety bays are no use if your car suddenly cuts out or has a tyre blow out.\r\n",
