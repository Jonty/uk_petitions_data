        "additional_details": "With the cost of living crisis, we think the national bus fare cap limit of \u00a33 for a single journey is being exploited by bus companies providing shorter journeys. For those travelling less than 5 miles in a single journey, we think the limit should be \u00a31.75, in line with the TFL bus fares. For any single journey longer than 5 miles, we think the rate should be frozen at \u00a33 for minimum 3 years. We think the 50% rise of the cap from \u00a32 to \u00a33 is not reflected in the majority of salary increases and must be reduced to help those commuting.",
        "background": "Review the national bus fare cap and reduce for shorter journeys. Currently the cap is \u00a33 for a single, which means passengers may be paying \u00a36 a day return. Reduce the cap for shorter journeys (under 5 miles) to \u00a31.75 and freeze the current \u00a33 limit for at least 3 years for journeys over 5 miles.",
