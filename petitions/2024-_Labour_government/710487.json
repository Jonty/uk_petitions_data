        "additional_details": "We believe electric vehicle adoption is being held back by unreliable and unpredictable charging infrastructure. We feel the system is currently very chaotic - some chargers work only for those signed up to the network in question. Recent chargers are supposed to offer contactless payment, but this does not always work. We think failures at chargers are very common for a variety of payment and technical issues, without appropriate penalties.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to introduce new national regulations: \r\n1. If a charger fails for any reason, the provider should  be fined for each non-functioning day\r\n2. Providers would be compelled to offer contactless payment and be linked to national payment systems.",
