        "additional_details": "Regulations surrounding school attendance should be relaxed, particularly regarding penalties for parents who choose to take their children out of school for short breaks or day trips during term time. Imposing fines and criminal records for such actions is excessive, especially when these occurrences are infrequent and unlikely to significantly impact a child's education. A few days away from the classroom each year can provide valuable family experiences without detrimental effects on learning",
        "background": "It raises a significant question as to why schools are permitted to organise holidays or outings during term time, yet parents face criminal charges and fines for doing the same with their children.",
