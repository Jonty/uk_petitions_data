If this had been the case 10 years ago I may not be here now. I have always gone to my cervical screenings on time (3 yearly) one year I got the all clear I went back again 3 years later for another smear test which resulted in cells needing to be removed as they was precancerous. If that had not been found for another 2 years it likely would have turned into cancer",
