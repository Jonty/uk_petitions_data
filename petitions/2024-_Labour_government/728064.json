        "additional_details": "We think flat thresholds are not the only access issue, but are a visible one of inclusion.\r\n\r\nWe think that if the steps to public buildings, like Downing Street, were removed it would show the government to be inclusive, remind people access work still needs to be done and show people even historic buildings can become fully accessible. We think it is actually disgraceful that visitors still rely on portable ramps, these are quite demeaning to use and can be difficult. We think permanent changes to features are better and can be done on historic buildings.",
        "background": "The disability discrimination act promised disabled people equality of access yet 30 years later still some public buildings, like 10 Downing Street, have steps and visitors may using face portable ramps that we think are embarrassing. \r\n",
