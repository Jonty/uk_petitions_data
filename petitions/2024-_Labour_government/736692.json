        "additional_details": "Currently, learners can ride on public roads after passing a CBT, which only teaches basic bike control and basic road rules.\r\n\r\nWe think that making it mandatory to pass the theory test first would ensure a thorough understanding of traffic laws, signs, and hazards before riding. We believe this improves safety, allows training to focus on practical skills, and reduces crashes. Statistically, motorcyclists are more vulnerable on the road than car drivers, so holding them to the same knowledge standards when unaccompanied could save lives and make roads safer for everyone.",
        "background": "We call on the government to require all new riders to pass the Driving Theory Test before Compulsory Basic Training (CBT) to ensure they understand road rules and hazards before riding unaccompanied. ",
