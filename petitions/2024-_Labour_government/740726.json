        "additional_details": "Those of us with a physical disabilities often have limited access to exercise and movement. This can make it very difficult to manage our weight. We think the criteria for receiving weight loss medication on the NHS is too tight and it should include those who have limited mobility. If disabled people don't get the help with weight and their health worsens, then they could be more reliant on the NHS for treatments anyway such as diabetes, heart conditions, high fat in the blood stream etc.",
        "background": "We want the government to fund more weight loss medication on the NHS for those with limited mobility, disabled or those suffering with lipoedema. Those with lipoedema know that diet and exercise cannot cure it. However, weight management can help manage symptoms.",
