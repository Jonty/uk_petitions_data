We think the criteria for receiving weight loss medication on the NHS is too tight and it should include those who have limited mobility. If disabled people don't get the help with weight and their health worsens, then they could be more reliant on the NHS for treatments anyway such as diabetes, heart conditions, high fat in the blood stream etc.",
