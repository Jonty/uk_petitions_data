        "additional_details": "The TV licence should be abolished because it\u2019s an outdated system that no longer fits how people watch TV today. Most viewers use streaming services like Netflix or YouTube, so it\u2019s unfair to force everyone to pay for the BBC even if they don\u2019t watch it. The enforcement is also harsh, with fines and court cases for non-payment, and the BBC could easily switch to adverts or subscriptions like other platforms instead of charging a compulsory fee.",
