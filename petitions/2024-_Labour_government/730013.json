        "additional_details": "Cancer does not discriminate age, women may be clear of HPV one year but contract it the next. HPV is not the only thing that can be checked during a cervical screening. \r\nThis will endanger so many women lives. We all pay tax and we all have the right to be regularly checked and have peace of mind. \r\nJade Goody's campaign would be in vain.",
        "background": "From July, younger women (aged 25 to 49) who test negative for HPV, meaning they are at very low risk of cervical cancer over the next 10 years, will safely be invited every 5 years rather than every 3. This needs to be STOPPED and rethought.",
