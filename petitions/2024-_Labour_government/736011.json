        "additional_details": "Quickly build secure tented camp accommodation or use the model for nightingale hospitals. Remove all illegal migrants from hotels and rented accommodation and move them to secure detention centres to be processed. \r\n\r\nThe cost of housing them in hotels and rented houses is too great and the inflated rents payed to landlords is accelerating the housing crisis for working families. The government must cease all such operations immediately.",
        "background": "Illegal migrants and asylum seekers should be detained in secure tented camps or similar secure accommodation not hotels or rented property. They should not be allowed to road freely due to the danger to the public based on the growing number of serious crimes migrants have committed.",
