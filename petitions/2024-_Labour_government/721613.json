        "additional_details": "During this period of financial hardship where pensioners have had winter fuel benefits cut, businesses have been hit with NI increases & the government is looking for ways of decreasing the welfare bill by making it more difficult to claim benefits like PIP it is immoral & totally wrong that people like the Speaker of the House, MP's & Civil Servants can spend hundreds of thousands of pounds each year on plush hotels, lavish meals & 1st class travel. This extravagance must end.",
        "background": "Severely cut the amount of public money that MP's & government employees / officials can spend on travel, hotel bills & meals etc. There should at the very least be a low cap on how much can be claimed in any one year.",
