        "additional_details": "Isolation is widely used in schools despite growing evidence that it can harm children\u2019s mental health, wellbeing and engagement with learning, particularly for vulnerable pupils and those with SEND. It does not address underlying behaviour causes and can increase distress, anxiety and disengagement. Supportive and inclusive approaches have been proven to be more effective and safer.",
        "background": "We want the Government to end the use of isolation rooms and isolation as a form of punishment in state-funded schools and to issue national guidance requiring evidence-based, inclusive behaviour support that protects children\u2019s wellbeing, mental health and learning.",
