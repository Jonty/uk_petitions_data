These impractical targets are thrusting hardship upon ordinary, every day working people, thus contributing to the already grim cost of living crisis.",
        "background": "Current net zero targets are completely unrealistic as the UK only contributes less than 1% of global emissions. \r\nI want the UK to be more energy independent by using the resources we already have while developing cleaner forms of energy such as Nuclear, at a more realistic and affordable pace.",
