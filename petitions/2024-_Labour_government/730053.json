        "additional_details": "Vulnerable groups, including low-income and minority women, may already face barriers to healthcare, and reducing screenings exacerbates these disparities.\r\nThis change reflects a lack of commitment to women's health, putting lives at risk for the sake of cost-saving, and undermines progress in cervical cancer prevention. Women's health deserves more attention, not less.\r\nExtending the gap between smear tests risks missing early cancer detection, putting women's health at risk. Please sign",
        "background": "Extending the smear test interval to every 5 years risks missing early detection of cervical cancer, which is most treatable when caught early. Many women, especially those at higher risk or with previous abnormalities, will be overlooked.",
