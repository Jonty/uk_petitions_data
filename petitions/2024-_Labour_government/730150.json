The government has put in place some measures to stop the abuse, the dumping of raw sewage in our rivers and see but has not stopped this year unacceptable and unrealistic increase. This increase will impact negatively on thousands of UK citizens and their quality of life and living standard. This has to be reviewed and stopped.",

In setting price controls Ofwat's aim is to allow for a return on capital that is no more than necessary for an efficiently run company to get the funding they need, and that ensures customers only pay for a reasonable level of financing costs.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about Ofwat's price controls here: \r\nhttps://www.ofwat.gov.uk/regulated-companies/price-review/\r\n\r\nYou may wish to sign this petition which calls for a similar action:\r\nReview regulation of water companies \r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/724126\r\n"
