Back In the 80s the bus was 20 or 30p and they still got about there daily life",

I\u2019m not one to complain but where I\u2019m from the bus is \u00a34 for an all day that\u2019s absolutely outrageous and \u00a32 for a single and I understand the goverment/parliament isn\u2019t fully responsible for the prices going higher however it\u2019s getting harder to go around",

You can read more about this here: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/national-bus-fare-cap\r\n\r\nIf you would like the Government to change the cap, you could start a new petition explaining clearly how you would like the fare cap to change.\r\n\r\nYou may also wish to sign these petitions which call for similar actions:\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/715593\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/730337"
