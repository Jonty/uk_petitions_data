        "additional_details": "The original purpose of changing the clocks no longer fits modern life. It disrupts sleep, affects health, and causes confusion twice a year. Keeping British Summer Time permanently would give us longer, brighter evenings, improving wellbeing, safety, and productivity. It would also support tourism, reduce energy use, and make life more enjoyable for everyone.",
        "background": "We want the UK Government to stop changing the clocks twice a year and keep British Summer Time (BST) permanently. This means the clocks would no longer go back in October, and the UK would stay on BST all year.",
