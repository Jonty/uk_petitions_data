The risk of offending someone must not be the reason to take the flag down. If you don't like it, learn to respect the country you are in or leave. You can debated and challenge all you want, but you are in England, and this is the flag. If people want to show patriotism and pride in the country, let them, it should be a legal right!",

But of course in the quite unlikely event there could be serious physical harm or damage done flying the flag then it may be taken down and moved",
