We are unclear whether you want MPs found to have breached the Code of Conduct to be forced to resign, to be automatically suspended, or if the sanction should be based on the extent of the breach(es). \r\n\r\nThe Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards is responsible for investigating complaints that a MP has breached the Code of Conduct. Where a case is referred to the Committee on Standards and they find that there has been a breach they can recommend sanctions ranging from requiring an apology, through suspension and up to expulsion from the House depending on the seriousness of the breach. The Procedural Protocol relating to the Code of Conduct sets out the process in more detail and is available here https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/cmcode/1084/report.html \r\n \r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
