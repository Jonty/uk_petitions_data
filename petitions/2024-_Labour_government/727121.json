        "additional_details": "We believe this would help students gain a better concept of how to balance work and life, as well as allow them to study during the lead up to GCSEs in a calm and peaceful environment at home. Many schools not having study leave can make it very difficult to find enough time and many schools do not have a suitable environment for students to revise effectively.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to require all England state schools to give students study leave for GCSEs in order to help students with getting the best revision and study time they can as well as to help them gain a better understanding of time management and work-life balance for the future.",
