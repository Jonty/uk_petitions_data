Not being biological at birth,  due to sex assigned is not grounds for discrimination against a gender. This is also an issue for intersex births. People should have the right to their own bodies not what someone else deems what a man or women should look like or be. Society has become to ingrossed in beauty standards and culture wars, this hate and separation has to begin in parliament.",
