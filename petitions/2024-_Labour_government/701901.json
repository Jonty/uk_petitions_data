        "action": "Fund more school places for autistic children without learning disabilities",
        "additional_details": "I believe most state special schools are geared towards pupils with learning disabilities and/or serious physical conditions and therefore deliver too few high level qualifications such as GCSEs and A-levels. As such, we feel that many autistic pupils cannot be suitably educated in the state special OR mainstream system. I think the private companies opening schools to fill this gap in provision turn large profits, which the Government could avoid by funding more school places.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to fund more school places for children who have autism, but not learning disabilities. Mainstream school can be completely unsuitable due to sensory issues, social difficulties and anxiety, which could prevent these children being educated to their full potential.",
