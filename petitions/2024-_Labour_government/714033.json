        "additional_details": "The hospitality sector is critical to the UK economy, but fragmented oversight across multiple departments leads to inconsistent policies and missed opportunities. A dedicated ministerial portfolio would prioritise challenges like staffing shortages, rising costs, and sustainability. This unified approach would enable cohesive decision-making, better support businesses, and maximise the sector\u2019s potential to create jobs, drive local economies, and strengthen communities across the UK.",
        "background": "Hospitality contributes \u00a393bn annually and employs 3.5m people, yet it lacks dedicated representation in government. We urge the Government to include hospitality in a single ministerial portfolio, ensuring cohesive policies, support for recovery, and recognition of its vital role in the UK economy.",
