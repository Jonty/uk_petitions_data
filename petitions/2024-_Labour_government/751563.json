        "additional_details": "People who have already been in the UK for over two years have built stability, community ties, and expectations based on the existing rules. Changing the ILR route for these families would be a retroactive change that creates uncertainty and disrupts lives. We ask the Government to protect fairness and legal consistency by honouring the rules that applied when these families entered the asylum system.",
        "background": "We want the Government to allow asylum seekers and their families who are already living in the UK to remain on the current 5-year route to Indefinite Leave to Remain. Any new settlement rules, including a proposed 10-year ILR route, should apply only to people who arrive in the UK in the future.",
