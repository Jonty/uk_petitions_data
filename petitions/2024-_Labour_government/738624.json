        "additional_details": "Legal migrants bring clear benefits to the UK: they pay taxes, fill skill shortages, and create businesses that generate employment and growth.\r\n\r\nPolicies designed to control illegal migration, such as extending the Skilled Worker 5-year settlement route to 10 years or raising thresholds and surcharges, unfairly penalise legal, hardworking migrants.\r\n\r\nWe need an immigration system that is firm on illegal migration but fair to those who follow the rules and contribute to Britain\u2019s future.",
        "background": "The Government should strengthen border controls and enforcement to stop illegal migration, while ensuring that immigration policies do not punish legal migrants who come to the UK lawfully, pay taxes, and contribute to society.",
