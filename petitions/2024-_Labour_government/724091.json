Across the country, charging cables are being cut, stolen, or vandalised, leaving EV owners stranded and discouraging others from making the switch. We feel the Government have done little to tackle the issue, which we think allows criminals to act with impunity. EV owners are left stranded when they cannot charge their vehicles.",
