We call on the UK Government to act swiftly and decisively to ensure that a just peace is achieved, with Ukraine at the heart of any future peace negotiations.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to show your support for justice and a sustainable peace for Ukraine.",
        "background": "The US and Russia have recently attempted to broker a sham ceasefire in Ukraine, without Ukraine present. This petition calls upon the UK Government to use all of its influence to ensure both Ukraine and the UK are represented at any future negotiating table - no talks about Ukraine without Ukraine!",
