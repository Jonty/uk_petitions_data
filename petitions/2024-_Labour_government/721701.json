We believe allowing a product to be sold within our borders violates our ethical standards.\r\n \r\nWe call for ethical consistency: as a nation that prides itself on high animal welfare standards, we believe the UK must ensure that all aspects of its food supply\u2014domestic or imported\u2014reflect our commitment to compassion and humane treatment of animals.",
        "background": "We believe the production of foie gras involve cruel methods: it is produced by force-feeding ducks or geese, which may cause severe distress, organ failure, and a dramatically reduced quality of life. We believe this practice is inhumane and any foie gras products must be banned.",
