        "additional_details": "In addition, the way the maintenance loan is calculated uses parental Pre-Tax Income which does not reflect take home pay and does not take what Parents actually spend on basic outgoings into account (such as rent and utilities and other children). We think earning a part time income whilst studying isn't always sustainable or possible.\r\n \r\nWe think the Government should review the current system and reform it to make living costs easier for students, while also reducing stress from financial problems.",
        "background": "We think the current system of maintenance loan for students is problematic, and it should be reviewed. We think yearly increases to maintenance loan are not good at reflecting living costs for students (such as rent increases by landlords, prices of utilities and food prices).",
