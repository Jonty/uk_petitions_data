        "additional_details": "Our beloved dog Stanley died due to alleged veterinary negligence. Yet under current UK law, dogs are still considered property. This outdated classification fails to reflect their emotional significance in families and limits the legal accountability of veterinary professionals. \r\n\r\nWhen mistakes are made that lead to unnecessary suffering or death, grieving families deserve justice\u2014and future harm must be prevented.\r\n\r\nHelp us make sure what happened to Stanley never happens again - Stanley\u2019s Law",
        "background": "We are asking Parliament to take two urgent actions:\r\n1. Change the legal status of dogs from \u201cproperty\u201d to \u201csentient beings\u201d with appropriate legal recognition.\r\n2. Reform veterinary accountability laws so veterinary surgeons are subject to the same standards of legal scrutiny as medical doctors.",
