        "action": "Allow licensed citizens to carry approved non-lethal devices for self-defence",
        "additional_details": "Knife attacks are rising - 50,000+ last year alone. Police numbers are falling, ordinary citizens are left defenceless. We seek a balanced, modern approach - allowing defensive parity between citizens and attackers, under strict legal and ethical boundaries. The UK already trusts citizens to hold driving licences, own sporting firearms, and operate machinery - all of which carry risks. It is reasonable to extend that trust, under control, to the responsible and limited use of defensive devices.",
        "background": "Introduce a Personal Protection Licensing Scheme allowing vetted, trained UK citizens to lawfully carry approved non-lethal defensive devices for self-defence, to close the gap between citizen vulnerability and reduced police protection. Citizens deserve the right to defend themselves responsibly.",
