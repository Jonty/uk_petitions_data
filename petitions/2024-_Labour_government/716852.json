        "additional_details": "Lucy Letby's conviction has been deemed by many medical professionals and experts alike as \"unsafe\" and at the current rate a re-trial could take well over a decade as we've seen in other cases. This means a potentially innocent person is put away far longer than they should be. A free and fair society should not do this to its citizens. If the CPS took these cases as a priority, it should mean re-trials come sooner.",
        "background": "The Government must speed up the waiting times for re-trials in cases where the convictions are deemed unsafe. After more news is coming out surrounding Lucy Letby's conviction, it would be of public benefit for re-trials to take place in a timely manner.",
