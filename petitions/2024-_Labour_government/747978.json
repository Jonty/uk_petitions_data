Children are leaving school without the basic knowledge they need to manage as adults things like how to open a bank account, budget money, apply for a mortgage, or find stable work. These are essential skills every person needs, yet they\u2019re rarely taught in classrooms.\r\nAt the same time,neurodivergent children (those with autism, ADHD and dyslexia) are too often misunderstood, unsupported, or pushed out of mainstream education",
        "background": "We\u2019re asking the Government to:\r\n\r\n1. Make practical life skills education a mandatory part of the national curriculum.\r\n\r\n2. Provide mandatory neurodiversity training for all teachers and school staff, so they can properly support neurodivergent pupils.",
