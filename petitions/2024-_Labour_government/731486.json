        "additional_details": "We need these discussions in schools so girls can be met with understanding and care ,not to be told it's all in our heads .the system is outdated and we need more better understanding in sexual health not just periods or sex but in health and awareness of diseases that are not created through sex but something that comes from either genetics or hormonal and other issues .pcos and endrometris happens in 1 in 10 women in the UK alone but only small percentage of them know what's happening.",
        "background": "Alot of your girls and women are being told that it's just a period it's nothing but ten years later finding out they have endometriosis when it's too late girls should know what is happening to them and get help a soon as possible.schools teach only about periods and sex education",
