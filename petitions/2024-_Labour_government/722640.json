        "action": "Lifetime ban on owning animals if convicted of mistreatment or cruelty.",
        "additional_details": "Animals are at the mercy of humans and cannot speak up for themselves. It is imperative that anyone who has been convicted of any form of animal mistreatment must not be allowed to own an animal again in the future. Banning people from owning animals for a short time is not a sufficient deterrent to prevent the horrendous cycle of abuse. Equally, these animals are not dignified with a punishment proportionate to the crime committed.",
        "background": "To impose a lifetime ban placed on anyone who has been convicted of abusing or mistreating animals. The fact that some individuals are given the privilege to own animals again when they have a history of mistreating them is nothing short of heartbreaking and dangerous.",
