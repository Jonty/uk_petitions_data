        "additional_details": "In 2024, the EU accounted for 41% of UK Exports, and 51% of imports. The OBR estimates that both exports and imports will be around 15% lower in the long run than if the UK remained in the EU. We believe a reduction in income for the UK will inevitably force the Government to raise taxes and reduce spending on public services. We believe the EU referendum result could have meant people may have wanted a softer Brexit, which we think rejoining the Single Market could deliver.",
