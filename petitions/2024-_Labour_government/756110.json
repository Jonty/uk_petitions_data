        "additional_details": "There is a growing shortage of skilled tradespeople across the UK, leading to higher household costs, repair delays, and reduced economic productivity. Many individuals face financial barriers when attempting to retrain or acquire new vocational qualifications. A government-backed scheme offering free training, accredited courses, and practical placements would help fill critical workforce gaps, reduce reliance on imported labour, and support people into long-term, skilled employment.",
        "background": "We ask the UK Government to introduce a fully funded national retraining programme, delivered in partnership with the DWP or CITB, to support people in gaining NVQ3 qualifications in electrician, plumbing, or mechanical engineering.",
