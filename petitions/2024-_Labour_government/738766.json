        "additional_details": "The supplement was intended to tax wealthy owners of luxury cars, but now we believe it penalises ordinary families who buy mid-market hybrids and EVs. With many cars priced above \u00a340,000 simply due to inflation and battery costs, we feel this tax is unfair and regressive. We think it risks slowing EV adoption and undermining net zero goals. We believe reform is needed to prevent discouraging greener choices and to ensure working households are not treated the same as luxury buyers.",
        "background": "Review the Expensive Car Supplement and whether it only applies to genuinely luxury vehicles. Consider Raising the \u00a340,000 threshold or exempting EVs and hybrids, as many family cars can now exceed this price due to inflation and technology costs. Ensure VED policy is fair and supports EV adoption.",
