Chocolate wrappers and toothbrush packaging should not last hundreds of years after purchase, we are choking the planet. Our apathy has led to the future becoming uncertain and so now more than ever we must change for the better and make future generations proud.",
        "background": "We need to stop using plastic material to create items we simply throw away after one use. Nearly every single product we buy is packaged in single use and often pointless packaging. We MUST instead look toward eco friendly alternatives.",
