        "additional_details": "And nor can I afford to drive the rented electric scooters in the city where I live as I think they are very expensive. If privately owned e-scooters were legal on public roads for Category A licence holders like myself, I could have my own scooter, charge it at work, arrive fast to my house to drive the car to the daycare in case of emergency and not have to pay any clean air taxes. I think people that know how to drive a motorbike should be allowed to drive a 10 -15 kg electric scooter.",

I have a toddler and need to drop him off at daycare and for that I need my car with me. Or a fast way to get to the day care in case anything happens. I can't afford parking.",
