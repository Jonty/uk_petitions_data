Wind farms at Garreg Fawr and Banc y Celyn fall inside a pre-agreed 10 km safeguarding zone and would pose a serious hazard to flight safety. If built, they would undermine vital training and compromise national security. The Government must enforce the 10 km exclusion zone and stop these developments.",

Giant 220 metre high turbines within the 10 km safeguarding zone pose a serious hazard to low-flying aircraft and risk undermining vital UK military training and national security.",
