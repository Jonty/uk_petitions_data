        "action": "Regulate ride-hailing apps to ensure fair pay and limit commissions",
        "additional_details": "Drivers pay for fuel, insurance, vehicle costs, maintenance, and licensing, yet current pay models often exclude waiting, travel to pick-ups, or any unpaid driving. This leads to long unpaid hours and financial pressure. Ride-hailing apps face limited regulation compared with licensed taxis. Introducing minimum fares per mile and minute for all mileage and time, commission caps, and transparent fare breakdowns showing what passengers pay and what drivers receive would support fair work",
        "background": "Ride-hailing apps are vital to UK transport, but many drivers are not paid fairly. Platforms retain a large share of fares while drivers cover all costs. Pay counts only trip time. We ask Parliament to set minimum pay per mile and minute for all driving and cap platform commissions.",
