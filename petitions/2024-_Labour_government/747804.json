        "additional_details": "Under the UC system, choosing to live with/marry a partner could mean reducing or stopping a disabled person's benefits due to the total household income including their partner. This means disabled people MAY become wholly reliant on their able-bodied partners, losing their financial independence and putting strain on relationships.\r\n\r\nThis could put disabled people at an incredible risk of abuse and exploitation, and disincentivise disabled people from staying in relationships.\r\n\r\nWe demand the right to love.",
        "background": "We want the government to completely remove the policy that stops disabled people who are living with/married to their partners from receiving their out-of-work benefits. The claimant's income must not include the partner. We believe this is dangerous and puts people at risk of financial abuse.",
