        "additional_details": "We ask the UK Government to reform property law in England & Wales to align with the Scottish model. This should include:\r\nMaking accepted offers legally binding earlier.\r\nIntroducing mandatory property information packs (e.g. Home Reports)\r\nPreventing practices like gazumping and gazundering.\r\nSetting time limits to complete transactions.\r\nThese changes would protect buyers and sellers, reduce wasted costs, and improve the housing market.",
        "background": "The home buying process in England & Wales is slow, uncertain and costly. Around one in three sales fail due to legal loopholes like gazumping & late stage withdrawals. Scotland\u2019s system makes offers legally binding earlier, reducing fall-throughs and creating a more secure, fair process for all.",
