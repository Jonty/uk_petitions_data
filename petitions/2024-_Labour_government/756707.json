        "additional_details": "Post-separation abuse is one of the most overlooked forms of domestic abuse. For many survivors, leaving does not end the harm \u2014 it escalates. Perpetrators use child contact, the courts, finances and ongoing harassment to maintain control. Without recognition as a specific offence, this abuse is minimised and misunderstood. Naming post-separation abuse in law would validate survivors\u2019 experiences, close dangerous gaps, and ensure accountability where it belongs.",

This law highlights that domestic abuse is often a purposeful pattern of behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe Domestic Abuse Act (2021) for England and Wales extended this offence to include post-separation abuse. This changed the law so that controlling or coercive behaviour can now potentially be prosecuted as a criminal offence even if the parties are no longer in a relationship and are not living together."
