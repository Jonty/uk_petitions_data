        "additional_details": "I believe that current fines are not enough to discourage people from littering. I am calling on the  Government to tighten litter laws and help protect our environment and wildlife. Surveys have found that 48% of people in the UK admit to dropping litter. The RSPCA gets over 5000 calls a year about animals being injured or killed by litter. Most litterers never get caught or face fines. I believe that if the laws were stricter people would be more reluctant to litter.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to increase the minimum littering fine to \u00a3250. And to also invest in more bins and enforcement officers especially in popular walking areas and parks. I also think the government should provide funding for more CCTV. ",
