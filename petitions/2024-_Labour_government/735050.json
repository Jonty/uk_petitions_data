        "additional_details": "Given England's women's football team's back to back successes in the Euros and in reaching the final in the last World Cup, it seems somewhat jarring to see them wear three lions on their shirt. It would be more fitting for the badge to be replaced with lionesses. Furthermore, the updated badge should also be worn by the men's team until the day they win a major trophy, recognising that England's men are just not as good on the international stage as the women's team.",
