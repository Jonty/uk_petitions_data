Many of the children that attend these schools and settings are non-verbal or/and have a limited ability to communicate with parents/carers/guardians if something is happening to them.  We believe this is leaving them our children incredibly vulnerable. We believe cameras in all SEN settings would give our children an extra layer of protection and hold staff accountable.",
