We urge Parliament to require that all UK schools teach age appropriate modules on:\r\n\r\n- Women\u2019s rights and gender equality\r\n\r\n- Healthy relationships and consent\r\n\r\n- Forms of abuse, including coercive and online abuse\r\n\r\nThese lessons help prevent violence against women and girls, an obligation under UK and international law. They are also key to the DfE\u2019s preventative education agenda and RSHE review.",

It includes an emphasis on opening conversations with young people about positive masculinity and femininity, and ensuring that nobody is stigmatised in these conversations. The guidance is clear that teaching about sexual ethics must go beyond teaching about consent, so that young people understand how to act with kindness and respect in all of their relationships.\"\r\n\r\nYou can read more about this here: https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2025-07-16/hcws825#:~:text=The%20guidance%20includes%20significant%20new,in%20all%20of%20their%20relationships."
