        "additional_details": "The current handling of illegal migration by the UK government is failing both the public and the nation\u2019s security. Ineffective policies have led to rising concerns about safety, resources, and public trust. The lack of clear communication and decisive action is fueling frustration. We need policies that address illegal immigration robustly, protect citizens, and ensure that the UK\u2019s laws and borders are respected. Government accountability and action are now urgent for national stability.",
        "background": "We urge the UK government and Parliament to take immediate action on illegal migration. Current policies are ineffective and do not address the concerns of the UK population. We demand stronger enforcement, clearer communication, and policies that prioritise national security and public safety.",
