        "additional_details": "A review few people expect has moved the expected delivery of the first line to the late 30s. Nobody understands why it takes so long. There's no good reason for it. Trams are a commodity. People deserve to be told why there's a delay - not why a report says we need a delay, but why there's no desire from Westminster to deliver infrastructure in The North",
        "background": "West Yorkshire has already lost two tram projects. Leeds in particular is too populated to not have a mass transit system. \r\n\r\nGuarantee the start of the project in good time, so the people of West Yorkshire can be confident it will eventually arrive",
