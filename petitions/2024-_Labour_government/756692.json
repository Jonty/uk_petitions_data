        "additional_details": "Survivors of domestic abuse and violent crime are often left with visible dental injuries caused by violence. We are concerned that many may be told the treatment they need is \u201ccosmetic\u201d and must be paid for privately, even though the damage was inflicted through abuse or assault. These injuries can affect mental health, confidence, work, and daily life, and can be constant reminders of trauma. Injuries caused by violence are not cosmetic. Survivors deserve NHS-funded dental care that recognises trauma and supports recovery.",
        "background": "The Government should provide dedicated funding and require the NHS to provide for free any dental treatment needed because of injuries caused by domestic abuse or violent assault, and issue clear national guidance stating that such injuries be recognised as medical and trauma-related, not cosmetic.",
