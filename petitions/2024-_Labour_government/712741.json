        "additional_details": "We think protection of \"gender critical beliefs\" provides a way for people to discriminate against a minoritised group (trans/non-binary people). We think it makes it hard to address discrimination and can deter organisations from doing due diligence. Law tells them to both protect trans/non-binary people as well as people with \"gender critical beliefs\".\r\n\r\nWe believe \"gender critical beliefs\" being protected under the Act encourages inappropriate response to discrimination and hinders progress towards equality.\r\n \r\n",
        "background": "We think removing the protection of the Equality Act for \"gender critical beliefs\" could better protect trans, non-binary and gender diverse people. It could support organisations to properly protect this marginalised community, whose rights we believe are currently being attacked and politicised.\r\n",
