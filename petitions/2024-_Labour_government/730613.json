        "additional_details": "Often, people may leave churches, homes, land etc to charities believing they are serving their communities. These are gifts of trust and sacrifice, not assets to sell off in silence. We believe the Charities Act 2022 removed key protections, and that we now need the law to ensure donor's wishes are respected, protect local spaces and keep the money from property where it was meant to make a difference, in the community. We think we need a legal duty to protect donor intent, safeguard legacy spaces and keep wealth in the communities it was meant to serve.",
