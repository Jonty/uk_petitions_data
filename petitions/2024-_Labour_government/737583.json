        "additional_details": "UK insurers often raise premiums after non-fault accidents, including collisions with uninsured drivers. Even with proof of innocence, drivers face higher costs. This is unfair: \r\n- Drivers had no control, \r\n-They already bear repair and stress costs, and \r\n- Careful driving is penalised while risky behaviour is not. \r\nVerified non-fault claims should not affect premiums.",
        "background": "Require insurers to exclude verified non-fault accidents from premium calculations.\r\n-Limit the retention period for non-fault claims in the Claims and Underwriting Exchange database to a maximum of 2 years.\r\n-Ensure transparency so drivers can prove non-fault claims and avoid unjust premium hikes.",
