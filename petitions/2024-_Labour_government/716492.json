        "additional_details": "As the cost of living continues to rise, we think young people are being disproportionately impacted. Equalising the minimum wage for 18-20 year olds could help young people meet their financial needs without being held back by age-based pay. It could allow them to focus more on their education and career growth, rather than struggling to cover basic living expenses.",
        "background": "Currently, young people aged 18-20 can be paid less than those aged 21 and above, despite often performing the same job tasks. We think this pay disparity undervalues their contribution to the workplace while also meaning young people might struggle to cover basic living expenses.",
