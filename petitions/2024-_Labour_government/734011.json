The ECHR has repeatedly undermined the UK\u2019s ability to protect borders, enforce immigration law, and uphold democratic decisions. British rights should be protected by British law, in British courts. It's time to restore legal and democratic control by triggering Article 58 and leaving the ECHR.",
