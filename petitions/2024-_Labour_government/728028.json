        "additional_details": "Regulation removes the element of organised crime. The allowance to grow under regulation of THC levels allows for the production of less psychoactive cannabis consumption. I would put in safeguards  so those whom are growing cannabis then allow law enforcement the right to enter premises without warrant to allow monitoring of cultivation activity. Finally the economy could benefit from the associated income from the production of cannabis",
        "background": "I believe it to be safer for the government to legalize and regulate the production. I suggest that it made legal that persons under license is allowed to grow 12 plants with a agrees THC strength annually and smoke cannabis on grounds in such a fashion that it does not interfere with the community",
