        "additional_details": "The current vapes now being sold are deemed as 'unsatisfactory'. The ban is seemed as pointless as littering and pollution will still go on to happen whether it is vapes or not, and there are still non-recyclable products flowing through the UK market.Regardless the same businesses the youth can get disposables from,they will be able to acquire the new reusable vapes from the same businesses.Some of the public who have stopped smoking cigarettes have resorted back to smoking cigarettes.",
        "background": "Banning them has more harm than you might think.My nephew quit smoking due to the old disposable vapes.Now they are not being sold and he has relapsed.The reusable vapes are not suitable for everyone and with proper regulations they can be sold.",
