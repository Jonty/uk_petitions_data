        "additional_details": "Some students (like me and my peers) are struggling to afford the cost of living at university. We feel that not enough is done to support us financially when embarking on higher education. We do not think that the minimum student loan is comparable to the price of rent for the majority of university students. Maintenance loans should be able to cover rent at a minimum as well as food and travel. We feel that the government should be doing more to relieve financial strain on students to allow them to focus on their studies.",
        "background": "We think that student maintenance loans are highly unfair. We think the debt of parents/guardians including mortgage repayments, outstanding student loans, car payments etc should be considered in determining the maintenance loan given to a student.",
