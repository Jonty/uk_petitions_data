        "additional_details": "Skilled migrants play a vital role in the success and stability of the UK. The decision to move under the Skilled Worker route involves uprooting families, leaving home countries, and making deep financial, emotional, and professional commitments based on existing immigration rules. Changing the settlement pathway midway is more than a policy shift\u2014it\u2019s a breach of trust. It undermines confidence in the UK\u2019s legal system and places a heavy burden on families who followed every rule in good faith.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to keep the 5-year ILR route for skilled migrants already in the UK, provide urgent clarification, and honour the terms under which we came. Changing rules midway is unfair, breaks trust, and places undue burden on families who followed all rules.",
