        "action": "Ban Public Firework Sales to Prevent Their Use as Weapons and Protect Animals",
        "additional_details": "Fireworks are often used antisocially, including being thrown at people, vehicles, and property. The RSPCA, British Veterinary Association, and National Farmers\u2019 Union have all called for tighter controls. Animals suffer fear, injury, and even death from uncontrolled fireworks. Restricting them to licensed displays would reduce harm while allowing safe celebration. The open sale of fireworks lets them fall into irresponsible hands. We urge the Government to ban their retail sale to the public.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to ban the sale of fireworks to the general public. Fireworks are increasingly being misused as weapons on UK streets, putting people, animals, and property at serious risk. They also cause widespread distress and injury to livestock, pets, and wildlife.",
