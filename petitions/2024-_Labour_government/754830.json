        "additional_details": "We demand the UK government establish an ongoing visa and evacuation scheme for Palestinian students from Gaza akin to the Ukrainian home visa scheme. In our view, the current inconsistent process has forced countless students to defer or lose university offers, pushing them to seek later intakes. We call for a long-term continuous safe passage corridor to ensure students can reach the UK, free from unrealistic financial barriers, by offering scholarships and accepting self-funded cases.",
        "background": "We demand that the Government extend the Gazan student evacuation policy that ended on the 31st December 2025 indefinitely, grant further scholarships for studies and facilitate twinning partnerships between UK and Gazan Universities.",
