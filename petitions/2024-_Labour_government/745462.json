Many disabled people go over the limit, as the costs can sometimes be around \u00a32000 a week, which is equivalent to living in a London-rented property for some. We believe the Government should pass a law that allows disabled people to have free social care that is fully funded under the NHS so that disabled people can work. Currently, many disabled people can't work as they can't afford it.",
