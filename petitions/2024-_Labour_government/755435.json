        "action": "Stop pay per mile vehicle tax",
        "additional_details": "Pay-per-mile taxes on electric vehicles are a bad idea. EV owners already pay higher upfront costs to reduce pollution and oil dependence. A mileage tax discourages clean transportation, penalizes rural and low-income drivers, raises privacy concerns through tracking, and slows adoption of technology that benefits public health and the climate. Fair funding should support, not punish, clean vehicles",
        "background": "Do not introduce pay per mile tax for electric/hybrid vehicles, we believe this will punish clean drivers, forcing people back to petrol and diesel, causing people that already own an electric or hybrid vehicle to sell, thus causing less demand",
