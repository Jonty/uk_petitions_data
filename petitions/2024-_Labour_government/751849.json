        "additional_details": "Without an exemption, the Bill will block otherwise healthy puppies and adult dogs from entering the UK \u2014 even when they are victims of mutilation abroad and waiting in shelters for adoption. The consequence will be tragic: thousands of dogs will be left behind in overcrowded kill shelters overseas, facing neglect or euthanasia simply because of their appearance. These dogs are victims, not perpetrators, and they deserve the chance of a safe home.",
        "background": "We call on Parliament to amend the Animal Welfare (Import of Dogs, Cats and Ferrets) Bill to allow exemptions for genuine rescue dogs with cropped ears or docked tails. Exemptions should apply only to registered organisations with proof of shelter origin.",
