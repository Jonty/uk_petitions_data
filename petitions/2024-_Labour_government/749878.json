        "additional_details": "For over 30 years, Combe Pafford School in Torquay has supported children with moderate learning difficulties (MLD). Torbay Council now plans to change its main need to Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC), leaving no local provision for MLD pupils. With 257 students and long waiting lists, this school is essential. We call on Torbay Council to keep Combe Pafford as an MLD school and build a new ASC school instead.",
        "background": "We Require the Department for Education to stop local authorities from removing Moderate Learning Difficulty (MLD) school places without ensuring alternative provision, and to fund new Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) schools instead of redesigning existing MLD schools.",
