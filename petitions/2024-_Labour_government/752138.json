We believe the system has been exploited by health tourists coming to the UK knowing they could get free world class treatment.\r\n \r\nWe believe the pressure to cover the increasing cost of the service when more and more people are overloading the system is unsustainable. Rather than constantly financing the increasing demand, we believe we should limit who can access it.",
