        "additional_details": "In 2024, Labour was elected into Government with a manifesto for change. One aspect was to uphold democracy by giving 16-and 17-year-olds the right to vote in all UK elections. This was not included in the King's Speech last year, however. This is a key issue shown by the General Elections held at my school where 2/3 of the people turned out to vote, and I know this was the case with friends at other schools across the country. Young people are the future and care about what happens to this country.",
        "background": "The government should commit to their Manifesto and pass legislation through Parliament that will lower the minimum age of voting in all UK elections to 16 years.",
