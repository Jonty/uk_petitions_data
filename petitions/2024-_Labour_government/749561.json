        "action": "Limit the use of fireworks to the main day of traditional celebrations only!",
        "additional_details": "Every year, countless pets & wildlife are terrified or injured, people with PTSD or sensory sensitivities suffer panic & anxiety. Emergency services face a rise in callouts for fires & injuries; many involving children. Loud, fireworks can reach noise levels over 150 decibels, similar to a jet engine and release harmful chemicals into the air. By limiting fireworks we can still enjoy traditional celebrations while protecting animals, vulnerable people & our communities from unnecessary harm.",
        "background": "Limit the use of fireworks to November 5th, New years Eve and the main day of Chinese new year and Diwali only. Limit the sales period to 2 weeks before these events from licenced sellers. To licensed buyers, for council organised public events at large licensed venues.",
