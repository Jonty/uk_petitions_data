        "additional_details": "This is to ensure they contribute to society while their status is regularised. Deporting undocumented migrants can cost the UK millions of pounds. We believe a conditional amnesty policy would generate revenue through fines and taxes. By doing this, legalised individuals can pay into the system instead of working illegally. This proposal could lead to economic benefits while discouraging future illegal immigration through a strict eligibility criteria.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to grant conditional amnesty to undocumented migrants who have lived in the UK for over 10 years, on the condition that they pay a financial penalty (e.g., \u00a310,000), mandatory tax contributions, and have no access to public benefits for 10 years.",
