But, Geoffrey Hinton, the Nobel Prize winner often called the \u2018Godfather of AI,\u2019 has warned there\u2019s a 10% to 20% chance of AI leading to our extinction within 30 years.\r\n \r\nI think the dangers of AI are enormous, with a possible loss of millions of jobs, that could upend society. I think citizens should decide how the technology is developed, by whom, for what purposes, the safety standards, and how to regulate AI and the tech industry.",
        "background": "I believe AI is being rapidly developed and released, without regulations to protect us from risks. Given the potentially profound implications, I think society must urgently be consulted through a national Citizens\u2019 Assembly. The government must enact all recommendations, including on regulations.",
