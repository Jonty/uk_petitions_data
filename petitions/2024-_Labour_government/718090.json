        "additional_details": "St George, best known for the legend of slaying a dragon, symbolises courage, charity, and chivalry - values that have shaped England\u2019s identity.\r\n\r\nSt. George is a great symbol of modern England. He is possibly our most successful\r\nimmigrant. Born in a foreign land, welcomed by the English, and has worked hard for over 800\r\nyears in his adopted country. He has integrated so well that he is now an English icon.\r\n\r\nIt's a chance to reflect on our shared culture and take pride in English traditions.",
        "background": "I want the Government to create a bank holiday for people in England on the Friday closest to 23 April.\r\n\r\nScotland and N. Ireland already have national bank holidays, England needs the same so people can celebrate what binds us together. It would boost tourism, the leisure industry, and cohesion.",
