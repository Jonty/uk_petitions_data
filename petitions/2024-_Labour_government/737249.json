        "action": "Pass legislation to adopt an official national anthem for the UK.",
        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom is one of the few countries without an official, legally defined national anthem. While \u201cGod Save the King\u201d is widely used at official events, it has never been formally adopted by Parliament.\r\nWe believe that, like most nations, the UK should have its national anthem confirmed in law to ensure clarity, consistency, and public recognition at home and abroad.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to legislate for an official national anthem for the United Kingdom, following a transparent process that allows for public consultation. This would bring us in line with international practice and ensure the anthem chosen truly represents our country in the 21st century.",
