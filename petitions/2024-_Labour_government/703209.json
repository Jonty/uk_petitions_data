        "additional_details": "We are not advocating for absolute monarchical power, but for a balanced system where powers are available as a crisis remediation mechanism. We think this change would respect the essence of our constitutional monarchy, adapting it to the complexities of the modern world. We think history harbours numerous instances of monarchs playing decisive roles during crises. We think it's time we revisited our governing mechanisms to ensure our national wellbeing.",
        "background": "We think the current political environment has put forward an intriguing proposition: and believe the Government should review the monarch's powers, including enabling them to intervene and override government decisions in crises, such as a hung parliament or global conflict.",
