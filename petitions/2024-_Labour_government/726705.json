        "additional_details": "We believe funding doesn't effectively cover the full cost of supporting a SEND child. In some cases, minimum-wage learning support staff can exceed funding offered, this is without extra costs like therapies, training, equipment, and resources. Some schools are left struggling to meet legal obligations without adequate support. We believe increased EHCP funding is urgently needed to ensure proper care and inclusion.",
        "background": "We want EHCP funding to be increased for schools. For some, funding doesn\u2019t cover the support required in the EHCP. We think that funding shouldn\u2019t be based on banding but actual costs. EHCPs must fully fund staff, therapies, equipment, and training to meet a child\u2019s needs effectively and lawfully.",
