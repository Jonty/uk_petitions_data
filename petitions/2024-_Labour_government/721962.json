        "action": "Mandate foundational tech curriculum for kids to bridge the digital divide.",
        "additional_details": "1 in 5 children lacks digital access at home, widening inequality. Only 15% of teachers feel confident teaching computing, leaving many students without crucial skills. With 80% of future jobs requiring digital literacy, failing to act now will harm the UK\u2019s economy and workforce. A full tech education safeguards children from online harm, misinformation, and cyber threats. The UK government needs to mandate a minimum literacy and readiness curriculum to help kids thrive in a digital world.",
        "background": "Tech shapes our world, 40% of UK schools lack structured computing lessons. Without early exposure, children face digital exclusion, job market disadvantages & online risks.  We urge Parliament to mandate foundational tech education, ensuring children gain essential digital skills for their future.",
