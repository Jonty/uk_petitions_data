        "additional_details": "Current SWEP policies usually focus on temperature thresholds, leaving rough sleepers unprotected during severe storms. We believe this puts vulnerable individuals at risk of hypothermia, injury, or even death. Named storms can bring extreme conditions that endanger lives. Funding local authorities to have SWEP guidelines that include all severe weather events will ensure councils act swiftly to provide shelter and save lives. We believe that no one should be left outside in dangerous weather.",
