        "action": "Raise the maximum age for children's public transport fares to 18",
        "additional_details": "16 year olds are not considered legally an adult. They are not able to drive, and even at 17, many cannot afford to do so with rising costs of living. Currently, transport fares class you as an adult at 16, but children aged 16-18 are still travelling for compulsory full time education. Although there is the railcard scheme, this costs \u00a330 per year and many young people would struggle to afford this or travel enough to make the money back.",
        "background": "Pass new legislation raising the age of adulthood on train and bus fares across the UK to 18. This will enable young people to commute to college easier and develop their independence by exploring the country they live in.",
