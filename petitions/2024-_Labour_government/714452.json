        "action": "Tax exemption, or increased tax-free allowance for pensioners",
        "additional_details": "We are not proposing for a sweeping tax exemption for all pensioners. What we suggest is that there should be a tax-free allowance similar to the working tax-free allowance but doubled. \r\nBy implementing tax exemption for pensioners or increasing the tax-free allowance, we are helpinging a significant group of people who have done their part for society through lifelong employment and contribution. I urge you to join me in voicing this concern. Sign the petition and help our pensioners.",
        "background": "Pensioners have worked all their life, paying their dues and diligently saving for a comfortable retirement; a right they have honestly earned. It is contrary to penalize them for their foresightedness by taxing their pensions which in essence, has already weathered taxation in its previous form.",
