        "additional_details": "The recent mass stabbing on a UK train, which left nine people critically injured, highlights the urgent need for regulated self-defence tools. Vulnerable individuals deserve access to non-lethal deterrents\u2014like pepper spray or tasers\u2014to protect themselves in public spaces. Licensing and training can ensure safety without escalating violence. Other countries already permit such tools safely; the UK should follow suit to improve public safety and equality.",
        "background": "Legalise non-lethal self-defence tools\u2014pepper spray, dye sprays, and low-voltage tasers\u2014under strict licensing and training. Personal alarms are legal but passive; we propose active deterrents for vulnerable people with safeguards against misuse.",
