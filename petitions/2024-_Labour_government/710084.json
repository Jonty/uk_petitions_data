        "action": "Allow Graduate Visa to be extended",
        "additional_details": "We think the current two-year Graduate Route visa is too short for many skilled graduates to secure jobs due to market competition and post-COVID hiring delays. We believe graduates who have worked for at least 1 year, paid taxes, and followed UK laws deserve a fair chance to remain and contribute further. Extending their visa by 1-2 years could help fill labour gaps, retain global talent, and boost the economy. We think this policy would enhance the UK\u2019s reputation as a world-leading destination for education and innovation.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to allow graduate visa holders to extend their visa by 1\u20132 years if they have worked for at least one year, paid taxes, and have a clean record. This could help graduates secure skilled jobs, contribute to the economy, and support the UK\u2019s talent retention goals.",
