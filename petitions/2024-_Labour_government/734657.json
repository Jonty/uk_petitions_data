        "action": "Make it a crime for officials and institutions to knowingly lie to the UK public",
        "additional_details": "There is currently no law preventing public officials or institutions from knowingly lying to the public. This undermines democracy, damages trust, and allows misinformation to spread unchecked. Citizens are held accountable for dishonesty, those in power should be too. When officials knowingly mislead the public, it erodes confidence in government, weakens institutions, and harms unity. Truth in public life is essential. Intentional deception should carry legal consequences.",
        "background": "Make it a criminal offence for public officials and institutions to knowingly lie or mislead the public in their official capacity. Create clear definitions, independent enforcement, and appropriate penalties such as fines, removal, or prosecution",
