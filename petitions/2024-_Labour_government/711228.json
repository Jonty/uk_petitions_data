We feel its wealth is unjustifiable and could (and should) be used to help solve a wide variety of social issues. \r\n \r\nSuch as homelessness, poverty, food insecurity, housing and funding the NHS. In our view, the monarchy is held together by little more than moral arguments instead of actual evidence, and we believe many people feel the same way.\r\n",
