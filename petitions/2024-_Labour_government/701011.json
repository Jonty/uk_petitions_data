        "additional_details": "We think it is fundamentally wrong that the age of first-time buyers in the UK is now in the mid 30s. We believe these are individuals who work incredibly hard and still cannot afford a home, against a backdrop of regulations that allow substantial rental-only private developments, or similar such business ventures that we think exploit people who need housing but cannot afford to buy. We think it\u2019s time for the government to take urgent, radical action to help these people secure a stable future.",
        "background": "We think there is a housing crisis in this country and there are millions of young, working people who are unable to afford the most basic of life essentials - a home. We think the government needs to implement a proper scheme to support these people in the form of a low interest deposit loan.",
