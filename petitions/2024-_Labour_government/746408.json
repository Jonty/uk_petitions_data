        "additional_details": "The JFK Memorial was presented to the United States in 1965 for perpetual use, commemorating President Kennedy\u2019s legacy and the shared democratic values of our nations. While the site remains under UK sovereignty, it already functions as a perpetual gift and is maintained by the U.S. government.\r\n\r\nA formal cession of this small parcel of land would have no practical impact on British territorial integrity but would represent a powerful diplomatic gesture, reaffirming the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d.",
        "background": "We call upon His Majesty\u2019s Government to explore, in consultation with the United States Government, the possibility of formally transferring sovereignty of the John F. Kennedy Memorial site at Runnymede to the United States as a unique and enduring symbol of Anglo-American friendship.",
