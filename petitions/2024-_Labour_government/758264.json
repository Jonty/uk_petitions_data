        "additional_details": "I would like them to do it as I believe this will cause mass uprising of unhappiness for the younger people of the nation.\r\nThis ban would leave many 13-15 people all alone with none of their friends to talk to.\r\nAll users would have their progress they've been building up (followers, subscribers etc.) destroyed with no appeal, and no recovery once they are 16.\r\nThey could end up losing important things they have saved on these services, meaning they would be left deeply upset without them.",
        "background": "We want the digital age of consent to not be raised to 16, ripping away apps and taking away progress from children would be devastating for them, and would cause stress upon them. The raising would make people who find difficulty in talking to real life friends face-to-face difficult for them.",
