        "additional_details": "The issue of migrants and asylum seekers has shifted from a humanitarian cause into a political tool. The UK, once a leader in human rights, now sees the topic exploited by far-right politicians to fuel hostility and gain power, and by far-left politicians to secure migrant votes and appeal to human-rights supporters. A moral issue has been reduced to a political commodity. This shift has damaged public trust and overshadowed the genuine humanitarian needs of vulnerable people seeking safety.",
        "background": "Far-right elements are fueling hatred and spreading division in British society. This is only getting worse, especially with the professional use of propaganda, misinformation, and false statistics to serve a specific purpose: gaining financial gain or power.",
