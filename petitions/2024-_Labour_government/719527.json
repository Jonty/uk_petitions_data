        "action": "Create a dedicated hotline or site to report hate crimes to the police.",
        "additional_details": "As i said previously many minority groups are repeatedly heckled in public spaces and feel as though there is nowhere to turn as the crime is so brief that many feel it is completely unimportant and many PO's see it as a waste of there time, a dedicated public site or hotline for this would make may Brits feel much more comfortable within themselves as well as helping the government and public grasp how serious the discrimination these groups face is and how far spread it is.",
        "background": "Minority groups in the UK usually end up not reporting xenophobic verbal harassment or hate crime due to it being seen as not serious enough to warrant a report, and so i am calling upon the British government to create a hotline or website dedicated to reporting these crimes.",
