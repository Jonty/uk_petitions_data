        "additional_details": "When we applied for the Skilled Worker visa, we were promised ILR after 5 years. Changing this to 10 years now disrupts lives, creates uncertainty, and breaks trust. Families have made life plans based on the 5-year rule\u2014homes, schools, jobs. Retrospective changes are unfair and morally wrong. We seek fairness, stability, and respect for commitments already made. Apply the new rule only to future applicants, not to those who came in good faith under existing terms.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to honour the original 5-year ILR route for existing Skilled Worker visa holders. Changing it to 10 years retrospectively is unjust and breaks the promise made. Apply new rules only to future applicants, not those already on a defined path to settlement.",
