        "action": "Introduce statutory term limits for the office of Mayor of London.",
        "additional_details": "The Mayor of London oversees key areas such as policing, transport, housing and the capital\u2019s strategic direction. With no cap on terms, power can become too concentrated, affecting London and the UK as a whole. A two-term limit would prevent entrenched leadership, boost fairness, encourage fresh ideas and keep governance accountable, transparent and responsive, strengthening public trust nationwide. Democracies impose term limits to ensure regular change and prevent prolonged tenures in office",
        "background": "Introduce legislation to legally cap the office of Mayor of London at a maximum of two consecutive terms. Parliament should amend relevant statutes to prevent unlimited re-elections, ensuring regular leadership turnover to avoid power concentration and strengthen democratic accountability.",
