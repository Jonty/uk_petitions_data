        "additional_details": "BCC has cut our 40 mph roads down to 30, claiming it makes us safer. Studies show dropping just 10 mph doesn\u2019t make roads safer, it just causes traffic jams, longer commutes, higher fuel use and slower emergency response times. \r\n\r\nOur cars aren\u2019t built to crawl at 20\u201330 mph. That strain damages engines, shortens vehicle life and the council won\u2019t be paying our repair bills. \r\n\r\nToday it\u2019s 30 mph. Next, it\u2019ll be 20. BCC consulted residents, only 35% agreed and they still went ahead with the change!!",
