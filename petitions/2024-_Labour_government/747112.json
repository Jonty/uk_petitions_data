        "additional_details": "The Red Route scheme will severely damage local businesses, restrict access for residents, and worsen community relations in one of the UK\u2019s most diverse areas. Evidence suggests the proposal is driven by council financial strain rather than genuine transport needs. We ask for government intervention to protect Bury Park\u2019s economy and community integrity.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to review and suspend Luton Borough Council\u2019s Red Route proposal in Bury Park pending an independent inquiry into its consultation process, financial motives, and community impact. Local residents and businesses deserve fair and transparent decision-making.",
