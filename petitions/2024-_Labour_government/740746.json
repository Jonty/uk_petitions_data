Many work in customer service, regularly pay landlords, and support housing and local economies. Yet we face ongoing uncertainty and repeated threats to leave if permits are not secured. We are not a burden but committed contributors who we think deserve fairness, stability, and the clear post-study pathway that was originally available.",
