        "additional_details": "The Commons holds to an 18th-century convention that changing parties doesn\u2019t force resignation and by-election on the principle that MPs are individually elected and free to develop their own agendas. Yet candidates and winners are supported, promoted, and controlled by parties/whips. Polls show citizens vote for parties &/or platforms. Those under the banner and manifesto of one party, or who promise independence but then join one, are not what was voted for. It is misleading and undemocratic.",
        "background": "Whether leaving one party to join another, or winning a seat as an independent but then joining a party or vice-versa, politicians at local, regional, and national levels in England should not be permitted to do so without giving constituents the democratic right to choose party and platform again.",
