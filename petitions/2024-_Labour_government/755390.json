        "additional_details": "Some horses and hounds are bred for a purpose, and hunting fulfills their instincts and wellbeing in a way little else can. Trail hunting provides that outlet without killing foxes. While illegal hunting may occur, there\u2019s little evidence it\u2019s widespread. Meanwhile, domestic dogs and cats routinely kill wildlife with far less scrutiny. Where do we draw the line on instinct, responsibility, and value of life? For most, hunting days are about tradition, horsemanship, dog husbandry, and community.",
        "background": "Stop the ban of train hunting as people will still do it but disguise it is something else, wouldn't you want to know people are doing it rather than not know. A tradition is trying to be taken from our country!",
