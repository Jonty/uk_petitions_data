This includes paying for bank holidays when nurseries are closed and even general closures at nursery's discretion. We feel that childcare is so expensive that this could discourage many from working as they would be better off financially, by not working. We also want the Government to cap daily fees for private childcare so nurseries don't offset this limit by raising prices.",
