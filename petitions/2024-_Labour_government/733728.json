        "action": "To reduce the rates of youth criminal violence in the UK",
        "additional_details": "I want the Government to do this because I believe that this will help reduce the numbers of young people involving themselves in gangs or criminal activities as young people are able to gather with people who can support them and even relate to what they are going through. This allows youth to be in a space where they are able to feel as if they are being heard and where they can express themselves. This can also help them learn and realise that what they are doing is wrong and that they should stop it.",
        "background": "I want the Government to help reduce the rates  youth criminal violence  by creating more social interventions such as youth clubs, counselling therapy, community programs, and school-based interventions.",
