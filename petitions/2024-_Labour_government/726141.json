        "additional_details": "The Government has breached fundamental freedoms - parental rights, family privacy, and freedom of belief - as exemplified by measures contained in the Children\u2019s Wellbeing and Schools Bill, on which it voted 3 times in the House of Commons. By violating these principles, it has broken its constitutional covenant with the British people, betrayed their trust, and thereby forfeited its moral and legal legitimacy to govern. Parliament is duty-bound to act urgently to defend constitutional order.",
        "background": "We call on Parliament to recognise the Government\u2019s serious breaches of fundamental freedoms and to initiate appropriate Parliamentary proceedings to restore lawful governance, end violations of parental rights, family privacy, and religious freedom, and curb unprecedented excessive state overreach.",
