        "additional_details": "The Leonard Stocks Centre in Torquay should be shut down due to its role as a hub for criminal activities like shoplifting, stabbings, and violence towards locals and tourists. This persistent pattern of crime not only endangers public safety but also deters visitors from exploring and enjoying Torquay's town centre, ultimately harming the local economy and community morale. Shutdown of the centre is essential to restore peace, security, and a welcoming atmosphere to the area.",
