        "additional_details": "With the current cost of living crisis, many pet owners are struggling to feed & care for their pets & some have had to make the heart-breaking decision to give up their pets as they can no longer afford the associated costs. Some rescue centres are overflowing with animals, and many are struggling to keep going.\r\n\r\nRemoving VAT from pet food & prescription meds could help hard pressed pet owners, as well as bringing these items into line with their human equivalents.",
        "background": "Currently, pet food & prescription meds attract a rate of 20% VAT, in direct contrast to their human equivalents where VAT is usually not charged. Pets are much loved family members, so why should pet owners be discriminated against? Removing VAT could help struggling pet owners.",
