        "additional_details": "Australia have been exploring the idea of donation limits and this proposal is inspired by these suggestions. Any individual may donate a maximum of \u00a320,000 to a single candidate. An individual or corporation may not donate more than \u00a3600,000 per election cycle. Alongside this, any donations above \u00a31000 should be openly and publicly recorded for transparency. This will ensure that no British political party is influenced by any one benefactor.",
        "background": "Too many billionaires are influencing the outcomes of elections for their own personal gain and profit. Maximum donation limits should be introduced for individuals and corporations so that the election and campaign processes remain democratic.",
