Corruption, lobbying, and the \u201crevolving door\u201d between government and industry damage democracy and trust. The law should ensure transparency, and attract individuals driven by service\u2014not profit. We believe a review and new independent body could improve integrity, policy outcomes, and restore faith in public institutions.",
