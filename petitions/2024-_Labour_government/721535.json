        "additional_details": "We want the Government to implement a law to give everyone a fair chance when it comes to adoption of animals. We feel that people should not be getting denied if they do not meet unreasonable standards of some rehoming shelters. Particularly if they will not under any circumstances let someone adopt a dog if they do not have a garden. Many people live in flats, and might not have access to a garden but they can have very active lifestyles, therefore change is needed.",
        "background": "We feel that the adoption process is far too difficult right now with people getting declined due to not having a garden even if they are active people, you could be a marathon runner but because you have a flat you might be considered unsuitable for adopting an animal from a shelter.",
