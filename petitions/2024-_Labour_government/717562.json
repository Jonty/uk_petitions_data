        "additional_details": "The residents of Botley and its surroundings have been hamstrung by the closure of Oxford\u2019s Botley Road for almost 2 years. Thousands of people are affected daily, the hardest hit being the elderly and disabled. Lord Hendy\u2019s announcement that the road will be closed for another 19 months is intolerable and this must not occur. The many affected people want a complete halt to this extreme disruption of their lives. Enough is enough.",
