        "additional_details": "I think this could also reduce stress, financial losses, and uncertainty. \r\n \r\nI want the Government to adopt Scotland's house buying and selling process in England and Wales as the current system can be archaic, slow, stressful, and often results in wasted time and financial losses due to the burden on conveyancers. \r\n \r\nAdapting the process could reduce uncertainty and make transactions quicker and more efficient. I think this change would minimize the risk of mishandling a large volume of cases, ensuring smoother property sales and boosting the economy through faster market turnover. \r\n",
