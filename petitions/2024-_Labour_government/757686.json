You can read the full guidance here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-uniform/school-uniforms\r\n\r\nWe can only accept petitions about things the Government or Parliament are directly responsible for. You could start a new petition explaining clearly what change you would like the Government to make to its guidance to schools."
