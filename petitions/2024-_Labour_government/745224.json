        "additional_details": "10 Years ago,  after visiting Denmark and hearing about the Synagogue shooting attack there, I returned to the UK and created a petition to call for armed security at UK Jewish institutions, just like they have in most European countries.  At the time, it was believed it was not needed. The security situation since then has worsened significantly.\r\nI repeat what I said then. \r\nIt is impossible for a policeman  or security guard without a weapon to protect sites from terrorists who carry weapons.",
        "background": "The level of UK antisemitism is at its highest in recorded history. It is clear now after the Manchester attack that the current level of unarmed protection is not sufficient. Armed protection is the only way to provide real, effective reassurance and safety for the Jewish community.",
