We feel we need a restorative, trauma-informed approach that prioritises emotional safety, inclusion and long-term wellbeing in education. With around 1 in 5 young people in the UK experiencing a mental health condition and permanent exclusions at around 10,883 in England in 23/24, we believe we cannot ignore this crisis.",
