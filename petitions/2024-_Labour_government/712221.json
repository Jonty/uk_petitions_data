        "additional_details": "The decision to not hold a public enquiry into Rape Gangs seems to have been to protect certain groups within our communities, but this just serves to foster mistrust and misunderstanding. There needs to be a full, open investigation which presents all communities with the facts, so the mistakes made by politicians, councils, social serves and the Police can be fully understood, and changes made to protect vulnerable young people in the future",
        "background": "The Labour Party has refused to initiate a Nationwide Inquiry into Rape Gangs in towns such as Oldham, Bradford, Oxford, Bristol and Aylesbury. This decision should be reversed so the public can understand what really happened and protect future generations from such barbaric abuse",
