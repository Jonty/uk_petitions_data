        "action": "Allow children to use the toilet as & when needed at school",
        "additional_details": "We want the government to reform restrictive school policies limiting toilet access, which harm children\u2019s physical health, like causing urinary issues, and emotional well-being, such as anxiety and embarrassment. These policies disproportionately impact menstruating students, leading to shame, discomfort, and even missed school days, affecting attendance and academic progress. We urge flexible, child-centered guidelines to ensure dignity, health, and equal opportunities for all students.",
        "background": "We want the government to mandate policies ensuring children can use the toilet when needed, free from restrictive measures. This promotes their health, dignity, and ability to focus in school. Clear guidelines should balance student needs with classroom management effectively.",
