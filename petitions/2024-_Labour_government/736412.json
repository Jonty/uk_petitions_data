        "additional_details": "Currently, access to gluten-free food on prescription is inconsistent across the UK. Many areas, including mine (for my 4 year old son), no longer provide gluten free prescriptions, despite coeliac disease being a serious autoimmune condition with no cure only strict lifelong dietary management. Gluten free food is significantly more expensive than regular food, which puts a financial burden on people managing a medical condition through no fault of their own.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to introduce a national Gluten Free Subsidy Card, similar to the scheme in Wales, to help people with diagnosed coeliac disease or gluten intolerance access affordable gluten free food. Not for everything just essential gluten free staples such as bread, pasta, and flour.",
