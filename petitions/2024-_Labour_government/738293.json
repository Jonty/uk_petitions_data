        "additional_details": "These changes could price family farmers out of their land and open the door to land investors. Farming isn\u2019t just business \u2014 it\u2019s stewardship, heritage, and self-reliance. If we lose our farmers, we lose food security, skills, and the living culture of responsibility they represent. A resilient country needs local food, local knowledge, and strong rural foundations. This policy threatens all three \u2014 and once they\u2019re lost, they cannot be rebuilt.",
        "background": "Reconsider 2026 tax changes. Protect farms from forced sales and breakup. This isn\u2019t just a financial issue. It\u2019s about protecting the foundation of Britain\u2019s food security, rural economy, and cultural identity. They are not passive assets; they are living systems of work, care, and responsibility.",
