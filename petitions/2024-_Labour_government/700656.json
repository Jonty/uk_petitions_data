        "additional_details": "We think if less third party sites were scouring the DVSA site, there would be more dates available for people to book  themselves. There was arguably a need for help booking tests after the pandemic when there was a backlog of applicants to compete against. However, it seems now people compete against groups of profit making third parties with limitless time and a financial incentive to book dates. We think applicants are unjustly forced to pay steeply for these sites to book a test for them.",
