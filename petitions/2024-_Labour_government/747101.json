        "additional_details": "I believe it would be fitting to allow parents/carers to choose to allocate that towards private education. This could help alleviate the burden created on working class families due to the new tax on private school fees, and it may open up private schools as an option to more families.\r\nAdding that the pupil premium grant for disadvantaged children would allocate even more funding, this could help level up our society and create real opportunities for disadvantaged children.\r\nThis could also alleviate the burden on some state schools, and allow competition to encourage improvements.\r\n",
