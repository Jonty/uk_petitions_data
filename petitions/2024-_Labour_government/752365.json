We believe converting these buildings into affordable housing is faster, cheaper, and greener than new builds. It could provide safe, permanent homes, support communities, and ensure public assets are used to help those who need them most.",
        "background": "We want the Government to identify vacant public and commercial buildings and fund their conversion into affordable housing which prioritises homeless people, young people leaving care and low-income families, so empty buildings help communities instead of standing unused.",
