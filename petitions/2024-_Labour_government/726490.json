        "action": "Make UK rape laws gender-neutral under one section.",
        "additional_details": "The current law only allows men to be charged with rape, ignoring that women can also commit this crime. Instead, women are charged with assault by penetration, a term that sounds less serious and is grouped under general sexual assault. This downplays the offence and its impact. Rape should be defined by the act, not the gender. To promote true equality and justice, women must be held to same legal standard, with offences treated equally in name, charge and consequence.",
        "background": "We want the law to treat all rape equally, no matter who commits it. Right now, women can't be charged with rape, only assault. This isn't fair. We want a gender-neutral law that gives all victims equal justice and matches international human rights standards.",
