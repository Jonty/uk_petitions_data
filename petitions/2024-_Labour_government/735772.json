We think inquiries like IICSA, Grenfell, the Post Office and Infected Blood gave survivors truth \u2014 but not justice. Ignored recommendations can retraumatise and allow harm to repeat. Children are being sexually abused and exploited. This must stop. Child protection is a duty of care we all need to meet.",
