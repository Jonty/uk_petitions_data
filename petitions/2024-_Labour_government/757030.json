        "action": "Stop the increase of residents parking permits in Southampton.",
        "additional_details": "The proposed increases to parking permits in Southampton raise costs sharply for residents, from \u00a330 to \u00a345 for a standard permit and from \u00a36 to \u00a312 for visitor scratch cards. This comes at a time when many households are struggling with rising living expenses. These changes risk making essential parking unaffordable. Lower or free permits would reduce financial pressure and support local residents.",
        "background": "The increase in residents\u2019 parking permit charges in Southampton is causing financial pressure on local households. I want the Government to require local authorities to stop these rises, reduce current costs, and make residents\u2019 permits free where possible.",
