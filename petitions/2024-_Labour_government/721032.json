        "additional_details": "The ASGSF provides support for nearly 52,000 adoptive families, supporting children who were previously neglected, abused, or suffered violence before adoption. Around 80% of adopted children experience some sort of abuse, and spend an average of 15 months in care before moving on to a foster family. The purpose of the fund is to improve the life chances of some of the most vulnerable children. Failing to continue it will cause irreversible damage to many children and struggling families.",
        "background": "The government must pledge that the Adoption and Special Guardianship Support Fund will be extended past March 2025 and be made permanent, instead of removing support from thousands of struggling children and families.",
