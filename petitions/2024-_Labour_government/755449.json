        "additional_details": "Ensuring Christian places of worship are offered to other denominations allows those denominations who wish to expand, plant or establish themselves in a community, the ability to do so. Places of worship are more than liturgical spaces for Sunday but are community hubs throughout the week, as opposed to the permanent offices or housing that they risk becoming. We believe having a strong local Christian community to serve a local community is vital.",
        "background": "Ensure by law that all existing Christian places of worship are offered for sale to other denominations before redevelopment into other uses, such as housing or offices. This ensures that other Christian groups may have access to available buildings, helping places of worship remain in communities.",
