Add on the 48% of people who voted Remain, results in 70% in favour of ESM access!\r\n\r\nAn EFTA deal honours the referendum and keeps the UK out of the EU while retaining the ESM benefits that most people wanted then and still want know, avoiding joining the Eurozone and Schengen Area, and keeping new FTAs with countries like India and Australia. It's a no brainer!",

As per the 2016 referendum, the government has withdrawn from the EU, but the deal we wanted wasn't so clear. The country now knows what we want.",
