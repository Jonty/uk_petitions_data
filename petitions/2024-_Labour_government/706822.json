        "additional_details": "The change I propose would make the vehicle insurance requirements in the UK simillar and simpler to match that of other countries such as mainland Europe, the main change is that only the VEHICLE is required to be insured against 3rd party risks as opposed to the complicated current system of VEHICLE + DRIVER. I believe this system is now outdated since this requirement has been present since the original RTA was passed into law in 1930. Motoring has changed a lot in the 94 years since.",
