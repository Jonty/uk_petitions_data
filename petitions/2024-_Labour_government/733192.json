        "additional_details": "Publishing profits is a breach of privacy, like sharing a personal payslip with the country. \r\nIt exposes owners to pricing pressure - customers could associate healthy profit with overcharging. \r\nIt exposes owners to loss of business in tough times - loss of confidence could lead customers to take business elsewhere. \r\nWithout context, figures are easily misread. \r\nHMRC already has access to this data, public disclosure serves no benefit. \r\nThis policy harms, not helps, the UK's smallest businesses.",
        "background": "From Apr 2027, Companies House intends to force small and micro businesses to publish their full profit and loss accounts online. This marks a significant and unnecessary intrusion into the financial privacy of hundreds of thousands of small businesses across the UK.",
