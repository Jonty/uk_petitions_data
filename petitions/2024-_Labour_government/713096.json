        "additional_details": "The ECHR has often limited our ability to control immigration, enforce laws, & deliver justice. It prevents swift deportation of foreign criminals & failed asylum seekers, blocks full use of the 2023 Migration Act, & allows interference from foreign courts. \r\n\r\nMany are frustrated with illegal immigration, misuse of hospitality, & the loss of traditional values.\r\n\r\nA National Referendum would give the people a say in restoring UK sovereignty over laws, ensuring British courts & Parliament decide the future of justice & national policy.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to hold a referendum on whether the UK should remain in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  This would let the public decide if UK laws on immigration, deportation, \r\n& sentencing should be governed by UK courts & Parliament alone, ensuring judicial sovereignty.",
