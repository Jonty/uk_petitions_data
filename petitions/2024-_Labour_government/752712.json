        "additional_details": "We believe the NHS is supposed to be cost-free \u2013 this is its pride and glory; we have to pay \u00a39.90 per item. Rules state that you are exempt from charges if you are 16, 17 or 18 AND a student \u2013 however, many people become university students from 18 and up. We therefore feel students aren\u2019t really exempt from this fee. We believe the point of the NHS is that you don't have to pay to receive medical care, but now we do, even if it is a small sum, it's still a cost, and a significant one for many students.",
