        "additional_details": "\"Age doesn't always equate to wisdom, but experience does. At 16, one is just beginning to explore the world beyond the confines of school and home. The complexities of politics, the nuances of policy-making, and the implications of voting are often beyond the grasp of a typical 16-year-old. It's not about intelligence or capability, but about the depth of understanding that comes with time ,and i believe 16 yr old children need more time in todays complicated society .",
        "background": "To cancel their idea of giving 16& 17 year old's the right to vote in the next General  election and ones after , i believe this is a very dangerous move  and would cause much more mental health issues with young child . its just to much responsibility for such a young person  in todays society",
