        "additional_details": "Surveys in the latest \u2018State of Britain's Hedgehogs\u2019 report estimate that hedgehog numbers have decreased by up to 75% in rural areas since the turn of the century. Much of this decline can be attributed to human expansion and the erection of fencing which hedgehogs (and other treasured wildlife) cannot gain access through.",
        "background": "Hedgehogs travel around one mile every night through our parks and gardens in their quest to find enough food and a mate. We can make their life a little easier by removing the barriers within our control. For example, by mandating the use of holes/hedgehog friendly gravel boards on all new fencing.",
