We urge the UK government to:\r\n\r\nMandate AI Watermarking \u2013 All AI-generated images and videos must have a tamper-proof watermark and be legally enforced.\r\nBan Copyright for AI Content \u2013 Only human-made works should be copyrighted. AI-generated media must remain public domain.\r\nThis will protect artists, consumers, and public trust. Act now to regulate AI media.",
        "background": "We call on the UK government to introduce legislation that mandates the watermarking of all AI-generated images and videos and prohibits the copyrighting of AI-generated visual and audio content. AI is making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between human-created and AI-generated media.",
