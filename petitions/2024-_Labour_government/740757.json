        "additional_details": "Pensioners are staying at home more due to the cost of living. One of their enjoyments is watching television. If the tv license was made free of charge it may enable pensioners to get out of their houses and socialize more and spend some of the money that they save on the license fee. There appears to be more repeated programs especially on daytime tv. Over the last few months pensioners have suffered the brunt of spending cuts.",
