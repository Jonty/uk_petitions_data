Current measures are clearly not sufficient to tackle this heinous crime which strips victims of their dignity and freedom. We believe that the institution and implementation of stricter, harsher punishments of the highest degree will act both as a warning and a deterrent to those involved at any level and will help to break the chain of trafficking taking place on our doorsteps.",

We ask for the institution of mandatory life sentences for anyone involved in these crimes to deter those operating at all levels of human trafficking networks.",
