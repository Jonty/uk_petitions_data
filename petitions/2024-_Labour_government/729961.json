        "additional_details": "The current planning system is not functioning properly for the public. Housing developments are being constructed without adequate infrastructure and services being in place. Currently developers pay various funds to mitigate against the impact their development is causing. This is not leading to satisfactory outcomes in reality. An example of the dysfunctional system is the lack of GP Surgeries with trained staff and capacity to take on new residents from new housing developments.",
        "background": "Prevent housing development taking place without adequate services being in place.  This must include local access to properly functioning amenities including GPs, hospital, dentists, education, good transport links, green space, parks, sport, retail and entertainment establishments.",
