        "action": "Ensure all NHS staff do not pay to park at work.",
        "additional_details": "The NHS has a chronic, significant & worsening shortage of permanent staff. Workforce morale is low & burnout is high, especially post-pandemic. The financial cost of the increasing dependence on temporary staff is huge. \r\n\r\nCharging staff to pay to park, where driving is often the only feasible way to commute, further perpetuates this problem. The revenue generated from staff parking permits is very likely a false economy.\r\n\r\nThe workforce is the backbone of the NHS & should be supported.",
        "background": "NHS staff parking is free in Wales & Scotland but some Trusts in England & NI charge. \r\nThis inconsistent & unfair system should be changed so that Trusts can no longer charge their employees to park at NHS facilities. \r\nAlternative, safe transport options also need to be improved for shift workers.",
