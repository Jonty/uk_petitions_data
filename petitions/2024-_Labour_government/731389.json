        "additional_details": "This would help the government's plans to \"smash the gangs\" and would save more lives at sea. Last year alone, 73 people died   crossing the channel. I believe this would stop a lot of illegal immigrants trying to cross. Doing this could also be used as a navy training exercise to train new recruits as to what life is like at sea. In conclusion this is essential for the national security of the uk and to make sure those who cross the channel don't put their lives at risk.",
        "background": "I want to put Royal Navy vessels in the English Channel to turn away the small boats . We can then stop putting the lives of volunteer servicemen and women at danger by  taking them to Dover.This could also be used to train the new recruits in the Royal Navy at what life is like at sea.",
