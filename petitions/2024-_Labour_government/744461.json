        "action": "Allow ILR after 5 years for skilled workers without access to public funds",
        "additional_details": "Hard-working migrants and their families live under stress, unsure about visa renewals due to frequent rule changes. We ask only for permanent residency (ILR) after 5 years, with full taxes and National Insurance paid, and no access to Universal Credit or any public funds. This secures families' futures, reduces stress, allows migrants to continue contributing fully, and brings revenue to the Government through ILR application fees without costing the public.",
        "background": "Protect the 5-year ILR route for skilled workers already in the UK. After 5 years, migrants should get ILR without access to public funds. Citizenship can follow its own timeline. This ensures fairness, prevents exploitation, and secures stability for workers and their families.",
