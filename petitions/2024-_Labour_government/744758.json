        "additional_details": "Migrants already pay taxes, work hard, and face some of the highest visa fees in the world, often without access to public funds. Extending settlement, scrapping ILR, or forcing renunciation of citizenship will tear families apart, spread fear, and divide communities. The real causes of pressure on services are austerity and inequality, not migrants. We need policies of fairness, dignity, and compassion that protect everyone, not scapegoating that fuels hate.",
        "background": "1. Keep ILR protected and accessible\r\n2. Do not extend settlement from 5 years to 10 years (or more)\r\n3. Reject any move to force renunciation of other citizenships\r\n4. End scapegoating and build policies based on fairness, compassion, and security for all",
