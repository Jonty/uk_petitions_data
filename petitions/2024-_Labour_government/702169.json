        "additional_details": "I believe that the electorate should be given more say in the running of the country and that the current system of government with a fixed term of office can become undemocratic given the timescales between the electorate having a voice to raise their concerns between general elections. This allows for the ruling party to force unpopular decision onto the electorate without the electorate having the ability to respond.",
        "background": "Change the law allowing UK citizens to hold a referendum where there's widespread concern & confidence within the electorate over the governments performance, policies & conformance to their published manifesto. The referendum should be a yes/no vote followed by a general election if successful.",
