        "additional_details": "In our view, visually impaired people can encounter more challenges in their life compared to people without visual impairments person. So allowing them to drive with bioptics could make their life so much easier. Driving is often a requirement in day-to-day lives, and allowing visually impaired people to drive with bioptic glasses could boost their sense of independence. For example, they could do jobs further away from their house, or even work jobs like delivery drivers etc.",
