        "additional_details": "Action needs to be taken as we can no longer keep this up, it cause us to either rely on public transport or taking other modes of transport which can cause you to be late as you have no control of the transport stopping for example or a bus terminating randomly.",
        "background": "All that young people ask for is a bit of independence, this being the cars we buy are affordable to run and sustainable for us to use. Car insurance prices are extortionate leading to a small percentage being able to pay. This is also another reason as to why there are so many uninsured drivers.",
