        "additional_details": "As most speeding offences are recorded by cameras and not actual police officers on the ground, in my view there is not enough context or discretion available when an infraction could be minor. This could lead to drivers losing a licence for several potentially minor infractions, which may impact on their jobs, housing, and health, especially for disabled drivers.",
        "background": "Abolish licence penalty points for minor speeding offences where the police issue Fixed Penalty Notices without going to court. I think fines should be kept for deterrence but penalty points reserved for serious or dangerous speeding violations which I think would reflect the level of risk involved.",
