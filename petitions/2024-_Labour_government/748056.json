        "additional_details": "Putting all medical history on a horse passport shows exactly what medical issues they've had and can prevent deception in the horse world. People are buying horses where there is no legal obligation to release medical paperwork and no way prospective buyers can check. Even after 5 stage vetting they may find the buyer has lied. This change can protect animal welfare and stops fraudulent sales and reduces the amount of cases going to court",
        "background": "I want greater protection for horse welfare and for buyers from neglectful sellers within the equine world; where profit exceeds care. Legal requirement for all medical history to be listed on a horse passport to make it harder for sellers to be deceitful.",
