We are therefore unclear as to what action you wish the Government or Parliament to take.\r\n\r\nSection 3 of the Terrorism Act 2000 enables the Secretary of State to make Orders adding or removing organisations from the list of prescribed groups in Schedule 2 or amending the Schedule in some other way. These orders are subject to the affirmative procedure (section 123(4) of the Act), which means that they need to be actively approved by both Houses of Parliament. \r\n\r\nYou may wish to sign this petition which is already open, titled 'Amend terror law to remove \"damage to property\" as an element of terrorism': https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/731733 "
