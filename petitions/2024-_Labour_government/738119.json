        "additional_details": "We believe that the UK's policy towards Cyprus has not changed meaningfully since it refused to recognise the TRNC in 1983, and that this has left Turkish Cypriots isolated. Some estimate the number of Turkish Cypriots displaced between 1963\u201374 to be 25,000. A UN-backed reunification plan did not lead to change. Over the years, we feel that both Turkish and Greek Cypriots have suffered, but that Turkish Cypriots remain excluded. We think that the Government must now reassess its policy.",
        "background": "We believe that the UK's policy not to recognise the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TNRC) has left Turkish Cypriots, including British citizens, isolated for over 4 decades. We think this should be reviewed, to help end exclusion and help ensure fairness and equality for all Turkish Cypriots.",
