        "additional_details": "GPSR imposes stringent requirements that many UK small businesses cannot afford to meet, effectively barring them from trading in the EU. We believe that this not only threatens their survival but also undermines the UK economy by reducing exports and stifling growth. Small businesses are vital to innovation and employment; we consider that they need support to adapt to these regulations without incurring unsustainable costs. A review and tailored support can help ensure they remain competitive and thrive in international markets.",

We urge the Government to review, provide financial support, streamline compliance and negotiate exemptions to help small businesses trade sustainably and safely in the EU.",
