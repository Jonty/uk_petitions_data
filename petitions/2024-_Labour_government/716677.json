        "action": "Scrap undemocratic Clause 24 of the Children's Wellbeing and Schools (CWS) Bill",
        "additional_details": "The CNIS provisions in the bill undermine s.7 of Education Act 1996 whereby the duty for education lies with the parent. Clause 24 introduces excessive measures on parents who educate their children outside of school as well as those they contract with, undermining fundamental rights and freedoms. We urge an immediate review to withdraw the \u201cchildren not in school\u201d clauses which will not achieve the stated aim of locating children \u201cmissing education\u201d but will breach privacy and parental rights.",
        "background": "The CWS Bill is being rushed through Parliament with little time for scrutiny. Clause 24 introduces unjustified state interference in parental duties, which threatens freedom and democracy in England. It is discriminatory, and expands state control over children\u2019s education in an unprecedented way.",
