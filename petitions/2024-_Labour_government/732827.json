        "additional_details": "Make businesses use motor insurance only available to full licence holders. We think this would ensure that anyone using their motor vehicle for business use are adequately licenced and qualified. We think the point of L plates is to learn how to ride/drive, not to let you run a business. We think the CBT makes it too easy for unlicenced (and often unqualified) riders to work for fast food delivery companies and conduct their business. We think they are involved in accidents which could be causing premiums for everyone else to rise.",
        "background": "Many food delivery riders on L plates haven\u2019t passed a test; just a CBT every 2 years which shows they can move & stop a bike safely, we feel it doesn't show they have road safety awareness. We think they may be causing insurance premiums to rise due to the number of accidents they cause.",
