        "additional_details": "These breeds face serious welfare issues. The Scottish Fold\u2019s mutation causes lifelong cartilage and bone disease, while the Manx tailless gene can lead to spinal defects, incontinence and early death. Dwarf cats also suffer skeletal problems. Major registries refuse to recognise some of these breeds due to welfare concerns. Many countries ban these breeds, such as Australia and Austria. We believe legislation is needed to prevent avoidable suffering.",
