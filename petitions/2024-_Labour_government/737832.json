Misuse by those without children creates hazards, stress, and can prevent parents shopping safely. A verified badge and legal protection will ensure the bays are used correctly, keeping parents, heavily pregnant women, and elderly safe and able to shop with dignity.",
        "background": "Give Parent & Baby bays the same legal standing as disabled bays. Allow fines for misuse and introduce official badges issued by midwives or GPs to verify eligibility. Include parents, heavily pregnant women and elderly who may not yet qualify as disabled.",
