        "action": "Rejoin the EU fully - not just 'reset' the relationship",
        "additional_details": "As the UK faces economic challenges and global uncertainties, it is more important than ever to work closely with European partners. Rejoining the EU would increase and strengthen the economy, enhance international cooperation, improve security, and help protect the UK against external pressures.\r\n\r\nPartial measures fall short of what is needed. Only full EU membership ensures stability, influence and security.\r\n\r\nIt is also what many polls show the majority of the country wants!",
        "background": "For maximum economic benefit and to restore influence, the UK needs to rejoin the EU fully rather than merely 'reset' relations.\r\n\r\nA 'reset', Customs Union or Single Market membership may offer some advantages, but full EU membership alone provides the growth, security and global standing we need.",
