        "additional_details": "We are concerned that the neon sign making industry has been severely affected by some businesses that sell LED signs advertising/marketing them as neon signs, or LED neon, and other derivatives. We think this has led to confusion amongst buyers. Neon signs and LED signs are made from completely different materials and processes, and therefore we think they should be described as such.",
        "background": "Introduce a 'Neon Signs Protection Act' or similar, to protect the neon sign making industry. This would mean that only products that are made from glass tubes and filled with an inert gas (mainly neon and argon) can be labelled, promoted and sold as a neon sign.",
