This would restore a sense of trust in politics and give the public the power to call an election if the overwhelming majority were in disagreement and wanted a fresh choice.",
        "background": "To ensure the Government remains accountable to the electorate, a threshold should be introduced to call a General Election by the public. An example could be a 2/3rd majority of the number of voters that voted at the last General Election.",
