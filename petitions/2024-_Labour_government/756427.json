        "additional_details": "Recently, on 7 March 2025, the BBC reported on the Food Standards Agency\u2019s investigation of an incident at the T&S Abattoir in Arley, Warwickshire. The local MP had raised the issue in the House of Commons the previous day, saying people were horrified by a video, posted online by an animal rights activist, that apparently showed hours of abusive behaviour at the facility in her constituency. More cases have been recorded by the Animal Justice Project, Animal Equality UK & others.",
        "background": "Since 2018, it's been mandatory for CCTV to be installed on all areas of abattoirs where animals remain alive. The recordings made being available to \"official vets\" only. This has not ended reports of animals being abused prior to slaughter, most of these reports coming from unofficial sources",
