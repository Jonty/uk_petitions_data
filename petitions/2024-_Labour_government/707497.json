There\u2019s not much the government haven\u2019t taxed the working people on. If the normal people get taxed for what you get as a perk. You have not had a deduction from your wages. The normal person doesn\u2019t have much left from the money they work for. How can you understand the people you serve if you don\u2019t struggle like us. If you did maybe you would think how do we serve our nation instead of making the taxpayers being the person who picks up the bill all the time. Because if you had understanding maybe you would\u2019ve waste so much money",
