        "action": "Limit fireworks to specific time window and designated locations",
        "additional_details": "Health & Safety: Fireworks release toxic chemicals into the air and cause frequent noise-related stress, especially for people with PTSD, young children, and those with sensory sensitivities.\r\nDistress to Animals: Loud fireworks terrify pets, disrupt wildlife, and stress livestock. Restricting them to set times and places will minimize anxiety and accidental harm to animals.\r\nEnvironmental Impact: Fireworks produce chemical pollution, air contaminants, and litter, which harm natural habitats.",
        "background": "We propose restricting fireworks to major holidays like New Year\u2019s Eve and Guy Fawkes Night, with displays only at approved locations and limited to a 1-2 hour window (10:00 PM to midnight). This would allow for festive celebrations while protecting the community, environment, and animal welfare.",
