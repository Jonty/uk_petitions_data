        "additional_details": "The current child maintenance system is outdated and in need of urgent reform to reflect the financial realities of modern life. Calculations based solely on gross income fail to consider essential living expenses, placing an unfair burden on paying parents. A system based on net income and necessary outgoings would promote fairness, support children's needs more effectively, and help maintain financial stability and healthier relationships for both parents and children.",
        "background": "Child maintenance reform is essential to ensure fairness for paying parents who actively support their children while managing their own living expenses. Current calculations based on gross pay disregard essential bills, placing an undue financial burden on responsible parents.",
