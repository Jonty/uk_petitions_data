        "additional_details": "I know Wales isn't a country under UK law and it is a principality of England, but a symbolic representation would make us feel more included when people around the world speak of British people and leave us out. It hurts my soul as a Welshman when people speak of the UK and they don't even know Wales is a country with it's own language, culture and heritage.",
        "background": "England, Scotland and Northern Ireland are represented on the Union Jack except Wales. Wales is excluded from being represented as a country and after 1600 years it's time to get even just a symbolic representation.",
