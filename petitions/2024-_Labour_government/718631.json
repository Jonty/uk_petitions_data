We have all seen the movies where they turn on us due to mistreatment. We all know the risks of when AI will start thinking for itself. However, if we give them equal rights and the same protection we give humans then when AI or robots develop the independant thinking, they will have no reason to wish us ill. AI will be able to report abuse to the police. Protect all.",

We all know how AI and tech is advancing and mamy people fear the age of AI, especially if they start to think for themselves. If we protect them, we protect all.",
