        "additional_details": "Scottish Fontan patients are forced to leave Scotland for life saving transplants separating us from family and support at the most terrifying time of our lives. This is not choice it is a failure of the system. NHS Scotland must allow Fontan patients to be assessed and transplanted in Scotland.\r\nLet us fight for our lives at home. \r\nWe are not numbers or referrals. We are people terrified of dying far from home, asking for the chance to live \u2014 with dignity, love and support \u2014 in Scotland at Home.",
        "background": "I was born with Tricuspid atresia unventriculated heart disease. I survived because of the Fontan heart bypass and Extra Cardiac Fontan heart surgery. Fontan circulation is not a cure it fails. When it does a heart, lungs and/or liver transplant is the only way to live.",
