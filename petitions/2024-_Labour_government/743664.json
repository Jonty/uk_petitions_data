License sales so approved items are available only through accredited suppliers with safety information.\r\n4. Provide guidance and training on safe, lawful use.\r\n5. Impose strong penalties for misuse or criminal use.\r\n\r\nA regulated system would protect the public while allowing adults safe, legal options for personal defence.",

We ask Parliament to review weapons laws and allow adults to buy, possess and use regulated non-lethal self-defence items. The framework should cover product approval, licensed retailers, safe-use guidance and heavy penalties for misuse.",
