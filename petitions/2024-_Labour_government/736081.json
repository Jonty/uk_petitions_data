        "additional_details": "This campaign urges the government to extend the driving theory test validity to four years. This is a direct response to the massive backlog of practical driving tests, which forces many learners to retake and repay for their theory test simply because they cannot secure a practical test appointment within the current two-year window. The campaign seeks to ease the financial and time burden on learners while addressing the ongoing driving test crisis. Increase the practical test slots",
        "background": "The \"Give Us a Brake\" campaign wants the UK government to extend the driving theory test's validity from two to four years. This would help address the massive practical test backlog, saving learners time and money by preventing them from having to retake a theory test due to delays.",
