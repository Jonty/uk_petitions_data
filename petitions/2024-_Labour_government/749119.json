        "action": "End the Ban: Legalise Non-Lethal Self-Defence for Safer UK Streets Now.",
        "additional_details": "The law criminalises carrying self-defence items, leaving citizens vulnerable to rising violent crime and random attacks. While 'reasonable force' is permitted, the law prohibits the non-lethal tools necessary for viable defence, particularly against knife crime.\r\n\u200bWe are not calling for concealed weaponry, but for legal, regulated non-lethal options, such as defence sprays. This change will empower the public to protect themselves and restore confidence in their right to their personal safety.",
        "background": "We call upon the Government to amend existing legislation to create a new category for regulated non-lethal personal defence items. This framework must allow law-abiding citizens to legally carry effective mechanisms solely for self-defence, without fear of criminal prosecution.",
