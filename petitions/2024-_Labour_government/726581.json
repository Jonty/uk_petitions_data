        "additional_details": "We want the government to give more money to Leeds so the council can build more homes and help people who are homeless. This could mean more shelters, support for mental health, and help for young people and families who are struggling. Everyone deserves a safe place to live. As well as provide a land for homeless people or people struggling for home to be able to set up camps as a temporary shelter.",
        "background": "Homelessness is getting worse in Leeds. More people are sleeping on the streets or staying in places that aren\u2019t safe. It\u2019s really upsetting to see people with no home, especially in the winter. We think the government should do more to help.",
