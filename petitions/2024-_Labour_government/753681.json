        "additional_details": "We are concerned that complaints about noise and antisocial behaviour linked to short-term holiday lets have increased, but that the police and local authorities do not always have the resources to enforce rules and impose fines when needed. We believe this type of noise is disrupting residential communities at night, which could lead to sleep deprivation, poor mental and physical health and in the end increased pressure on NHS services. When neither booking platforms or police act on noise complaints, residents can feel like they are left without protection. More funding to ensure effective enforcement is needed.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to provide dedicated funding to local authorities and police to tackle complaints that are made against short-term holiday lets. We also call on the Government to require booking platforms to intervene immediately when they receive complaints.",
