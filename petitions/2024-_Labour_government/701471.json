        "additional_details": "We are concerned that in locations such as the Fylde, building windfarm onshore assets could hamper tourism, destroy quality farmland, close businesses, and ruin habitats for protected species.\r\n\r\nWe believe that methods used in the construction of windfarm onshore assets could increase flooding and substations built close to homes could be audible 24/7. Rural land might be industrialised when there are alternative quicker, cheaper and more suitable routes, which could have less impact.",
        "background": "We want the Government to ban wind farm onshore asset development on green belt land. We don't think local authorities are enforcing the National Planning Policy Framework to protect the greenbelt from inappropriate development when brown belt land is available and offers regeneration opportunities.",
