        "additional_details": "The restoration of Queen Victoria\u2019s nose on the colossal statue is essential for the preservation of national heritage and historical integrity. As a public monument of significant cultural and artistic value, the statue represents not only Queen Victoria herself but also an important era in the nation\u2019s history. The current damage to the statue undermines its aesthetic completeness and distorts the artist\u2019s original intent, thereby diminishing its historical and educational value.",
        "background": "I respectfully request that the government undertake the full restoration of the colossal statue of Queen Victoria with particular attention to the repair and reconstruction of the damaged nose.",
