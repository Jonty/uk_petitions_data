We do not believe there is any data proving the SIA has reduced any crime.\r\n\r\nWe believe that it doesn't serve any practical purpose. We are concerned about the impact of licensing fees and feel the SIA unjustly grant and deny people's right to work without due process.\r\n \r\nWe think that if there are any fields where the government feels security workers need extra training and background checks, for example licensed drinking venues, airports, arenas etc, then government, local councils or police could instruct them on what type of background checks and training they'd like their staff to do.",
