        "action": "Control domestic cat roaming to protect British wildlife",
        "additional_details": "Regular surveys of British wildlife have shown a significant decline in small mammal, songbird and amphibian populations, including water voles, starlings and frogs. Domestic cats contribute to this decline by preying on these animals, and reducing prey for wild predators such as owls. They also endanger our native wildcats in Scotland by interbreeding with this species. Similar policies for restricting the free roaming of domestic cats have been successfully introduced in Finland.",
        "background": "This petition asks the UK government to introduce limitations on the free, outdoor roaming of domestic cats. It requests that domestic cats are put on a lead when outdoors, and are not allowed to roam unsupervised. This is to stop cats from hunting wild animals whose populations are in decline.",
