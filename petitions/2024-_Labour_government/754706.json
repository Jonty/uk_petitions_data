        "additional_details": "Current UK law limits self-defence to safety alarms, leaving law-abiding citizens,feeling defenseless against violent attackers.Carrying any other non-lethal self-defence item, like CS spray or a Kubotan, can result in a felony charge.A licensed system would empower citizens with a proportionate means of escape and physical deterrent, reducing attack severity and enabling fundamental self-preservation,focusing the law on enabling victims rather than punishing preparation.",
        "background": "We petition the UK Government to review the Firearms Act 1968 and Offensive Weapons Act 2019 to create a new category for approved, licensed, non-lethal self-defence tools (e.g., regulated sprays/tasers) for women and vulnerable individuals, following background checks and safety training.",
