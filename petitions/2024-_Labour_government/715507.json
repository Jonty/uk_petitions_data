Taking our children in low season proves to be more manageable and less stressful for a child that struggles with sensory and social issues. Avoiding the busy holiday period makes a holiday more manageable for families and children living with a disability. Families are being fined and taken to court for putting their child with a disability first and this is wrong.",
