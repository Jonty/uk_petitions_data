        "action": "Change voting to a rank based system to allow complete freedom when voting.",
        "additional_details": "First-Past-the-Post forces tactical voting and creates millions of \"wasted\" votes, leading to unrepresentative governments. A ranked system makes more votes count and allows people to vote for their true preference without fear of \"spoiling\" the result. This petition presents a clear and focused request for this reform, as previous similar petitions have often been ambiguously worded, which may have hindered public support for this vital issue.",
        "background": "Replace the First-Past-the-Post system for general elections with a preferential voting system. This would allow voters to rank candidates by order of preference, ensuring their vote is used to elect a candidate they support, even if their first choice is eliminated.",
