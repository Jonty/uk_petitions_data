If they have imposed tariffs (or similar) that impede our trade into their country, on reciprocal grounds or otherwise\r\n\r\n2. If they have ever been convicted of a crime, regardless of sentence, in their country of origin.\r\n\r\nThen they should be barred from entry to our country indefinitely.",

We\u2019re not sure exactly what you mean by \u201cpunitive tariffs\u201d and tariffs which \u201cimpede trade\u201d. We are unclear if you would like your request to apply to leaders of countries that impose any tariffs on UK goods, or just particular types of tariffs.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nRahul"
