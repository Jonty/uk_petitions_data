This error was not only deeply upsetting for me and my family, but also remained visible on the certificate. The only adjustment was an amendment at the bottom of the certificate, which I feel undermined the dignity of my wife's memory. We propose new legislation to require the issuance of a new certificate with the amendment in the correct place in order to preserve the dignity of loved ones who have passed away.",
