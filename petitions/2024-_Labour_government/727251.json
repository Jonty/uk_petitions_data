        "additional_details": "EU citizens can still use eGates when entering the UK, making travel fast and easy. But UK travellers often face long queues at European borders, using \u201cAll Passports\u201d lanes. This isn\u2019t fair or reciprocal. We want the UK Government to secure similar treatment for UK citizens by negotiating access to EU/EEA lanes or eGates. This would improve travel, reduce delays, and show mutual respect in UK\u2013EU relations.",
        "background": "We want the Government to negotiate with the EU so UK passport holders can use EU/EEA lanes or eGates when entering Europe, just as EU citizens can use eGates when arriving in the UK. This would ensure fairness and improve travel for UK citizens.",
