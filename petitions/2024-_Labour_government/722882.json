        "additional_details": "Bullying is a widespread issue and can affect students' well-being and academic success. By introducing mandatory anti-bullying education programmes, we can create a supportive environment where young people feel safe, understood, and empowered to seek help. Early intervention and awareness may reduce stigma, promote emotional resilience, and prevent long-term consequences, ultimately fostering a healthier, more inclusive society for future generations.",
