        "additional_details": "When someone avoids paying for a service, such as a beauty treatment or building work it is usually classed only as a civil matter. This leaves service providers unprotected when clients take a service, materials, and labour without paying. Service providers lose the cost of materials, their time, skill, and income, while repeat offenders face no consequences. This change would deter serial offenders, protect businesses, and show that the law values professional services equally with goods.",
