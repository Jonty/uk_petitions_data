        "additional_details": "The new EU GPSR rules requiring an EU-based AP present a significant challenge for UK small businesses, particularly micro-enterprises and artisans. These requirements may impose prohibitive costs and administrative burdens, which could threaten access to NI and EU markets. By negotiating with the EU to allow UK businesses to act as the AP for their own products, we think the Government could support small businesses, reduce unnecessary trade barriers, and protect key economic contributions to the UK and the EU.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to negotiate with the EU to let UK businesses act as the Authorised Person (AP) for products sold to NI and the EU under General Product Safety Regulations (GPSR). We think current rules unfairly stop business owners from being the AP, adding costs and trade barriers.",
