        "action": "Introduce a fair 2% wealth tax on the richest 1% to end pensioner poverty",
        "additional_details": "We urge the UK Government to introduce a modest 2% wealth tax on the richest 1% with assets over \u00a310 million to help eradicate pensioner poverty. Many older people struggle to afford essentials like heating and food. A 2% annual tax could raise around \u00a324 billion, providing vital funds for fair pensions and targeted support. This ensures the wealthiest pay their fair share without affecting those comfortably off, promoting dignity, reducing inequality, and fostering prosperity for all.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to introduce a modest 2% wealth tax on the richest 1% with assets over \u00a310 million to combat rising pensioner poverty. This tax would fund fair pensions and support, helping older people avoid choosing between heating and food, without harming those who are comfortable.",
