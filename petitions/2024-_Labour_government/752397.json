        "action": "Reverse the freeze on income tax thresholds to stop stealth tax rises",
        "additional_details": "Frozen tax thresholds mean workers pay more tax each year for doing the same job. Many of us are already struggling with rising living costs, and fiscal drag quietly reduces our take-home pay even when our wages don\u2019t rise in real terms. This is a stealth tax that hits low- and middle-income families hardest. Thresholds should rise with inflation so people aren\u2019t punished for small or necessary pay increases.",
        "background": "Reverse the freeze on income tax thresholds and increase them with inflation. The freeze is a stealth tax that drags workers into paying more each year despite stagnant real wages. Uprating thresholds would protect working families from real-terms income cuts.",
