        "additional_details": "When MPs change parties or become independents, they are no longer representing the manifesto or values they were elected on. This undermines trust in our democratic system. Constituents should have the right to re-evaluate their support through a by-election, ensuring proper accountability and representation. MPs work for the public \u2014 not party leaders or themselves. This goes for every party in Britain, no exceptions. The people must have a voice.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to introduce legislation requiring any MP who defects to another party, or leaves their party to sit as an independent, to automatically trigger a by-election. Voters should have the right to approve or reject their continued mandate.",
