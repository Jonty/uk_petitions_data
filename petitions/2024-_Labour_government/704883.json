        "additional_details": "The reason why we want Westminster to allow another Scottish independence referendum is because the circumstances in UK have changed so much from 2014. We were told that if Scotland remained then Scotland would remain in the EU. One of many promises that were broken. Currently over the past few years the UK has seen lots of political unsability with countless prime ministers over the past few years and it doesn't look like changing the Scottish people have right to decide there own fate. Scotland doesn't need weak and unstable governments that are incapable.",
