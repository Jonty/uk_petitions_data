        "additional_details": "\u200bA referendum is appropriate because mandatory Digital ID is a profound constitutional change, not routine policy. It violates the UK's historic tradition of rejecting national identity schemes, fundamentally altering the citizen-state relationship and civil liberties.\r\n\u200bThe sheer scale of public opposition (millions of signatures) proves the policy lacks democratic consent. A referendum is essential to resolve this controversy, secure legitimacy, and ensure the people directly approve or reject this historic shift in state control.",
        "background": "\u200bThe UK Government must commit to holding a national referendum before implementing any mandatory Digital ID system. Given the immense public opposition (demonstrated by millions of signatures), this constitutional policy must be approved by the people, not imposed by Parliament.",
