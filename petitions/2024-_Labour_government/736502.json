These extra hours represent personal sacrifice\u2014time away from family, rest, and personal wellbeing. Yet, the current tax system does not distinguish between regular and overtime income.\r\n\r\nRecognise and reward hard work by making overtime income tax-free.\r\nSupport working families who rely on overtime to bridge the gap between wages and the cost of living.",
