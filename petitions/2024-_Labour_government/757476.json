        "action": "Make lobbying for private gain entirely illegal in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Lobbying government should be illegal because it allows concentrated wealth and special interests to exert disproportionate influence over public policy, undermining democratic equality. When corporations or well-funded groups can shape laws behind closed doors, elected officials may prioritize the interests of private organisations and individuals over the public good, eroding trust in democratic institutions.",
        "background": "Make lobbying for private gain illegal removing direct influence of private individuals, corporations, and interest groups over lawmakers. Under this approach, elected officials would be prohibited from meeting with or accepting input from any entity seeking to influence legislation for private gain",
