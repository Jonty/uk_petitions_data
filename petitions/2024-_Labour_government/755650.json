        "additional_details": "Just under 300,000 businesses closed in 2025, the number of payrolled employees fell by 171,000, and the unemployment rate increased to 5.1%. A substantial amount came from retail and hospitality.\r\n \r\nAn increase on business rates could put substantial pressure on an already struggling business market and result in significant business closures, and possible job losses in 2026 if support and relief is not put into place. We believe these increases are not sustainable and that these sectors need support.",
        "background": "Business rate increases and business rate relief reductions come into effect in April 2026. We urge the Government to increase business rates relief back to 75% for retail, hospitality & leisure. We are concerned increases could lead to business closures, substantial job losses & empty properties.",
