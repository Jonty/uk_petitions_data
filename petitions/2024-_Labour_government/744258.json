        "additional_details": "Currently, 16-18 year olds receive free or heavily discounted travel, but once students turn 18, they lose this support. The only student discount available for those over 18 is on expensive weekly, monthly, or yearly \r\npasses, which assume daily commuting. \r\n\r\nMany university students do not travel every day but are still forced to pay peak-time adult fares when they do - making travel disproportionately expensive. Expensive travel should not be a barrier for students seeking an education.",
        "background": "Introduce discounted university student fares for single journeys on public transport (bus, train, and tube), not just for weekly, monthly, or yearly travelcards with an 18+ oyster card. The 16-25 railcard is not enough as it only discounts off peak travel.",
