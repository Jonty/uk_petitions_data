        "additional_details": "Having the correct tyres on a motorcar for the UK climate conditions such as All season winter categorised tyres (which can be used all year safely) or summer tyres only during warmer months and Winter tyres during colder months could result in a huge reduction in delays on roads during snowfall saving lost time and money from the U.K. economy. It could make roads safer and possibly save lives. Some new cars are fitted with Summer tyres and these are not designed to work in winter conditions. We call on the Government to take action on this matter.",
        "background": "Winter tyres or all season winter categorised tyres greatly outperform Summer tyres in snow and ice. Most new cars are fitted with Summer tyres which give very little traction/grip in snow or ice. Summer tyres actually lose a great amount of traction/grip in temperatures around 0 Degrees C.",
