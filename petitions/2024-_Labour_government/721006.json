The average age people first see pornography is 13, very often by accident.\r\n \r\nHome pages of many mainstream pornography sites display content that is sexually violent or promotes incest. There is an increasing body of evidence showing this is harmful for the sexual development of our youth. We want the government to act now to safeguard our children from this industry.",
