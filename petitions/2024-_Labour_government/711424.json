The petition was presented to the House of Commons by Bambos Charalambous MP on behalf of residents of the United Kingdom.\nRead the petition and the Government's response (https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2025-03-17/debates/25031742000018/RespiratorySyncytialVirusVaccineEligibilityCriteria)\nThe petition asks the House of Commons to urge the Government to take immediate action to reallocate funds to provide free Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Shingles vaccine doses to individuals aged 80 or older.\nIn response to the petition's request, the Government states that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advises the UK Government on immunisation programmes. In November 2024, the JCVI recommended that the Government consider expanding the shingles vaccination programme to include individuals ages 80 and over. The Government will review this advice when setting vaccination policies in due course. \nJCVI advice informed the introduction of an RSV vaccination programme for adults aged 75 to 79 years. However, due to limited clinical trial data for those aged 80 and over, the JCVI expressed uncertainty about the vaccines effectiveness in this age group. In October, \n the JCVI agreed to formally review evidence for potentially extending the RSV vaccination programme to the very elderly and those in risk groups.\nWhat are public (paper) petitions?\nA public (paper) petition is a petition to the House of Commons presented by an MP.\nFind out more about public (paper) petitions (https://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/sign-a-petition/paper-petitions/) \nGet involved in the work of the UK Parliament\nYou can also sign up (https://parliament.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=098af33234df9814f59fb205f&id=6e29cb1262) to the UK Parliament newsletter for the latest information on how to get involved and make a difference. \n",
