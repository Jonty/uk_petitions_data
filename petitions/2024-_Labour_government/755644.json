        "action": "Make NHS-funded IUI available to same-sex couples without private barriers",
        "additional_details": "Same-sex couples are currently required to pay for and fail up to six rounds of private IUI before qualifying for NHS treatment. One round can cost over \u00a33,600, meaning costs exceed \u00a322,000. This is unaffordable for many working-class couples and creates unfair discrimination based on sexuality and income. Wanting to start a family should not depend on wealth. Equal access to fertility treatment is essential for fairness and inclusion.",
        "background": "Ensure same-sex couples can access NHS-funded IUI on the same basis as heterosexual couples, without being required to self-fund and fail multiple private treatment cycles before becoming eligible for NHS fertility support.",
