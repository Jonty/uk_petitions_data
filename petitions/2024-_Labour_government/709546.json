Learn from  the success in Finland and commit fully to helping all that want help. There was a  ''Housing First feasibility study conducted in Liverpool in 2017.\u201d with Crisis UK.

Canada provided $1B in their 2024 budget for the homless, Finland have been reducing their homeless since 2007. Follow their lead and commit similarly",
