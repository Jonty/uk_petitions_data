        "additional_details": "There is a blind corner at Brookfield house and cars driving 60 mph are caught out when the speed limit changes to 30 mph abruptly. There is no pavement and pedestrians and residents of the houses are often in danger as cars come speeding round the bend. There is going to be a fatal accident as the road is very poorly lit in this area and 60 mph is far too fast in a residential area.",
