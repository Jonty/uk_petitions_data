        "additional_details": "The govt has a green mandate, cut emissions, make our country self sufficient with renewable power and move away from fossil fuel, we have so many man made structures upon which solar panels could be erected, out of sight, not on our green belt & adjacent to existing infrastructure, why are we not implementing this, I do not understand?, please support this petition, thank you.",
        "background": "The Govt should be promoting building solar farms on buildings such as govt/council buildings, hospitals, car parks, shopping centres, in fact any existing buildings suitable for this purpose, which are plentiful & adjacent to infrastructure, it makes no sense to build on Green Belt land, full stop.",
