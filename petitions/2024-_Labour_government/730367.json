        "additional_details": "They can also damage rooftops, causing councils/homeowners big repair costs. We think the government need to consider culling the population of gulls whilst also implementing a long term plan to prevent gulls from nesting in large numbers. They could require the introduction of rooftop spikes on council properties and buildings and chimney stops. This could reduce droppings which are health concerns, and attacks of pedestrians, and control the number of birds being born.",
        "background": "We want the Government to amend legislation protecting seagulls so that they can be culled to significantly to reduce numbers. We think they have become a pest, and can have salmonella and cryptococcosis in their droppings. They can also be aggressive, nesting on rooftops and dive bombing people. ",
