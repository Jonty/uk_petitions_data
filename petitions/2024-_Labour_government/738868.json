        "additional_details": "If someone lies about a material fact on a CV, their employer is entitled to dismiss that person from their job.\r\nThe government works for the people. If a party lies about their election promises in order to get the electorate vote, there is nothing their employers, the voters can do about it.\r\nThis undermines democracy. In a democracy the public should have the right to remove a government that is not working in the best interests of the country.",
        "background": "A system needs to be put in place to allow the electorate a vote of no confidence in the government.\r\nAt present a vote of no confidence can only be called by parliament. An unpopular government with a large majority is safe because no MP will vote to lose their seat. This is undemocratic.",
