        "action": "Abolish Inheritance Tax to attract investment and strengthen the UK economy",
        "additional_details": "IHT raises only about 1% of UK revenue yet discourages saving, investment and family business growth.\r\n\r\nRemoving it would attract overseas capital, encourage long-term investment and help retain wealth and talent in Britain.\r\n\r\nSeveral successful economies such as Hong Kong and Australia have no IHT, showing that low-tax environments can draw international funds and strengthen fiscal stability.\r\n\r\nAbolishing IHT would make the UK more open, competitive and globally attractive.",
        "background": "The Government should abolish IHT and replace it with a fairer, growth-focused system that encourages saving, entrepreneurship and investment. Removing IHT would strengthen the UK economy, attract global capital and support families and small businesses.",
