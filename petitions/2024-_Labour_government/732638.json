        "additional_details": "Many of us came to the UK legally on visas like Skilled Worker, Student, or PSW, investing years of our lives, money, and effort. Changing the rules now\u2014especially income thresholds and dependent rights\u2014is unfair and disruptive. The Government must honour its commitments, apply old rules to current residents, and prevent hardship for those who trusted the system. This is about fairness, stability, and protecting the UK\u2019s global reputation.",
        "background": "The new UK immigration rules unfairly affect those already here on Skilled Worker, Investor, Student, and PSW visas. We call on the Government to apply existing rules to current residents and reserve new rules only for future arrivals. Protect those who came in good faith.",
