The posture is strictly defensive and non\u2011combat, operating only with Ukraine\u2019s consent.",
        "background": "We ask UK Gov, subject to Ukr\u2019s invitation, deploy non\u2011combat UK teams to W. and N. Ukr to secure rear areas, protect civilians, deter & doc cross\u2011border incursions, & sustain humanitarian corridors. This would be lawful, aligned with NATO sp mechs & IHL & free Ukr forces for front\u2011line defence.",
