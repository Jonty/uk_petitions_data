        "additional_details": "The current CMS model allows absent parents to hide income, evade monitoring, escape financial responsibility, and refuse to pay with minimal and/ or unacceptably late penalty. This not only forces the financial burden onto the resident parent and allows a dynamic of financial abuse, it disadvantages children and fails to protect them. The current system is flawed, outdated and is not fit for purpose, and is failing thousands of the parents and children it is meant to assist",
