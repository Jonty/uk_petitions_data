We think any changes in entitlement should be pro-rata.\r\n \r\nFor example if a child stops being a child 3 days before assessment period ends, the claimant is told they owe money for the whole month due to this change - not just the 3 days the child had stopped being a child. \r\nWe feel the Government may push people in debt with this policy.\r\nWe think it would be better if the Government calculated entitlement to the day.",
