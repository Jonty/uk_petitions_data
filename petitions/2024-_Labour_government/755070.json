        "additional_details": "Leeds is the largest city in Europe without a mass transit system, holding back productivity, jobs, and growth across West Yorkshire. Reliable rapid transit would cut congestion, reduce emissions, improve access to work and education, and support housing delivery. Investment would level up the North and give Leeds the connectivity expected of a major UK city.",
        "background": "Parliament should commit funding and legislative backing for a fully integrated mass transit system for Leeds, enabling light rail or rapid transit, coordinated buses, and long-term operating support through West Yorkshire Combined Authority.",
