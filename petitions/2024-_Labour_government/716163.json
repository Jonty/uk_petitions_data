        "additional_details": "Tax hikes kill growth. The UK economy needs businesses to invest and create jobs\u2014not be squeezed dry to fund government inefficiency. Every extra pound in tax is a pound that could have driven innovation and higher wages.\r\n\r\nYet, despite record-high taxes, the Government keeps wasting money on consultants, PR campaigns, and vanity projects. Rachel Reeves promised stability, but that won\u2019t come from tax hikes\u2014it comes from smart spending.",
        "background": "Rachel Reeves and the Government must get serious about cutting wasteful public spending before coming for taxpayers\u2019 wallets again. The UK is already one of the most highly taxed nations, yet we\u2019ve heard nothing about what spending has been reduced\u2014only more tax hikes.",
