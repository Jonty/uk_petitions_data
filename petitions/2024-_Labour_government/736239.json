Like many others, I never considered cancer a possibility. Even when I discovered a small lump, I thought I might be overreacting. What if I had dismissed it and waited until the age of 50 for a routine mammogram? So many young individuals are being diagnosed with breast cancer today, and it's not uncommon for them to feel dismissed or misdiagnose their symptoms as something less serious. Breast cancer doesn't wait for you to turn 50.\r\n",
