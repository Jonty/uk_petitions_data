        "additional_details": "South London (and beyond) is home to millions of residents, key town centres and growing communities, yet remains largely excluded from the Underground network. Despite years of TfL plans, no proper new Tube stations have been delivered south of the Thames. We deserve fair investment, better connections and Underground-standard services to support jobs, housing and sustainable travel.\r\n\r\nOverground lines would be incredibly helpful considering there\u2019s already National Rail lines in place.",
        "background": "South of the Thames is still under-served by the Underground despite long-standing TfL plans. This has led to overcrowding, longer commutes and unequal investment. We call for funded Tube extensions or rail conversions and a clear timetable for delivery.",
