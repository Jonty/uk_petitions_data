        "additional_details": "This petition seeks to return some power to public voters, giving the public what we see as a more meaningful say in how the country is run. Democracy means accepting the will of the majority, even if it differs from the government\u2019s wishes. We propose a Commons vote at 250k signatures (which is the equivalent of several constituencies), with additional thresholds for a binding referendum or any call for a general election. The irony of using this forum isn\u2019t lost on us, but we feel this is the only way to ensure review and response.",
        "background": "We call for petitions on petition.parliament.uk to enable action beyond a debate. We feel recent petitions with huge public support have been dismissed by government, and that this undermines faith in the process. More milestones are needed which force governmental action.",
