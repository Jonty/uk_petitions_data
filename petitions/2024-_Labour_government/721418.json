Removing access to encrypted messaging, backup and storage services puts citizens at risk of fraud and abuse from criminals, large corporations and governments worldwide, not just in the UK. Your drive to ban end to end encryption makes people all over the world unsafe. You will also make national security weaker, not stronger as your adversaries will be able to access citizens and government data more easily.",
