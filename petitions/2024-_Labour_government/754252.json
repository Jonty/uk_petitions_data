        "additional_details": "Grievances with government run deep; it's not just one thing, it's many: Our government is archaic inefficient & slow, and cannot address crises facing our nation. Governments currently & previously have abused power and been corrupt. The electoral systems and representative bodies of our country do not reflect the will of the people to our satisfaction; they are too subject to populism; not enough, to meritocracy. Our politicians are undeserving, incapable, cold, cruel, out of touch, overpaid.",
        "background": "Hold independent convention for complete UK constitutional reform process after the next GE, with parliament, meritocrats, civil servants, & political experts voicing opinion. With the  aim of centralisation of a new constitution, and addressing the continuity of the HoL, FPTP, and executive powers.",
