        "additional_details": "We want the TV license in the UK abolished, it's outdated not fit for purpose and it's totally unfair to force the British public into paying for something they do not want! The BBC can be funded in other ways such as advertisements or a monthly subscription like others are or a combination of both, sending people to people's homes to ask about TV license is intimidating and shameful and sending people to prison even more so if they do not have a license! People should have a choice.",
