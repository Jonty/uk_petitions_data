        "additional_details": "The government must act to remove Tyne Tunnel tolls, which unfairly burden commuters and essential workers. While other UK crossings are toll-free, North East drivers are still charged for using vital infrastructure. With rising living costs, this extra expense adds unnecessary financial strain. The tunnels are essential, not a luxury\u2014ordinary people shouldn\u2019t be penalized for daily travel. It's time for fair, toll-free access to this key route.",

Other UK crossings have scrapped tolls\u2014why not here? It's time to make travel fair. Sign now to demand toll-free access for non-commercial drivers!",
