That says that \u201cMembers shall never undertake any action which would cause significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons as a whole, or of its Members generally.\u201d This is because, except for Rule 11, the Code of Conduct does not regulate MP\u2019s views or how they express their opinions, and therefore the Commissioner cannot investigate complaints about their views or opinions. \r\n\r\nYou could submit a petition setting out any changes you would like to see to Rule 11 or calling for new rules for MP\u2019s social media posts in the Code of Conduct."
