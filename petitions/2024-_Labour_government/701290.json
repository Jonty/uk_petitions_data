        "action": "Ban wind farms on protected peat land in England",
        "additional_details": "We think the unintended consequence of building wind farms on protected peat land would be to worsen the nature and climate crisis - peatland's stored carbon would be released as a result of infrastructure construction. Reliable analysis shows there's plenty of available land in England for all the onshore wind farms needed for the green transition, without building on protected peatland. The Government should apply the precautionary principle - there is nothing to lose by doing so.",
        "background": "In its recent consultation on new onshore wind planning regulations, the government asked if some habitats, such as those containing peat soils, need extra protection from renewable energy development. We say YES! As did 90% of respondents to this question.",
