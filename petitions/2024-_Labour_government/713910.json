        "additional_details": "We think many people are unaware that there is no legal register for electricians. Electrical faults lead to approximately 70 deaths and 350,000 injuries annually in UK homes, along with over 20,000 house fires causing extensive property damage. We think having the HSE legally enforce electrical work and imposing real penalties is the only way to improve standards and safety. We think this would make anyone conducting electrical work competent and accountable by HSE legal registration.",
        "background": "We want a register owned by the Health and Safety Executive, like the Gas Safe scheme. We think such a register would enforce standards and ensure only registered electricians can purchase and install electrical equipment. We think voluntary schemes like NICEIC and NAPIT lack any legal authority.",
