There is no evidence to support the existence of \"inherently dangerous\" dog breeds.\r\nWould you feel safer living in a community that protected you from dogs that posed a real danger based on their actions or dogs or an invalidated stereotype? Actions of owners need to be held accountable. We should look at responsible ownership, education and strict penalties for owners of dogs that abuse them and purposely train aggression.",

It defies logic to believe a dog\u2019s appearance, shape of head, breath of chest has any influence on behaviour, temperament and propensity for aggression.",
