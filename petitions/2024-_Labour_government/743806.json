        "additional_details": "Decisions made in London affect the whole country, partially due to the disproportionate amount of GDP generated. This impacts how money is spent in the rest of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. London should represent everything that England and the rest of UK stands for, front facing. The citizens of the UK should have the opportunity to echo their view on this in a democratic vote.\r\n\r\nWhoever becomes mayor, is a national figure. Therefore, they should represent the say of the nation.",
        "background": "Discuss, with the interests of the British public in mind, the notion of giving citizens a say in who becomes the London mayor. The public would like a consultation on this, as being the London mayor is different to any other Mayoralty in the UK because of the sheer influence and representation.",
