        "additional_details": "As a sovereign British Citizen I urge the government to stop this bill in its tracks. It has no business even reaching the house of commons! This is a democracy, not a technoracy or a totalitarian country. It's designed to steal everybody's personal data, past and present. It could be used for nefarious reasons and be the end of freedom as we know it!",
        "background": "The Data & Access Bill is one of the most terrifying pieces of legislation in recent history, quietly slipping through Parliament while giving the government unprecedented access to YOUR data. This is a MASSIVE power grab! Your privacy is at stake. Is this the UK\u2019s version of a social credit system?",
