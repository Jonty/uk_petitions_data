        "additional_details": "We are concerned about the impact the ban will have on the entire breed. We believe it is not fair on exempted dogs who have to walk with a muzzle, even when they are calm dogs. I have an XL Bully, and I can\u2019t even get her to bite me if I tried, I put my hand in her mouth, and she just walks away! I believe it is unfair for them & the responsible owners. I think we should make sure all owners are responsible and have trained their dogs correctly.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to reverse the ban on XL Bully dogs, as we believe the problem is with owners not the dogs themselves. We believe a ban on a dog breed due to some undertrained dogs is wrong and discriminatory.",
