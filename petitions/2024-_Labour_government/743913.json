        "additional_details": "We\u2019re calling for a compassionate review of school absence fines for family holidays. Travel enriches children\u2019s education, yet inflated costs make term-time trips the only option for many. Current policies ignore valid reasons for absence and push families toward homeschooling. Let\u2019s replace punishment with understanding and support. Sign to demand fairer, family-focused attendance policies.",
        "background": "The government should end blanket fines for term-time holidays, assess absences case-by-case, and support learning during time away. It should address travel cost inequality and work with families to create fair, flexible policies that prioritize children\u2019s well-being and educational outcomes.",
