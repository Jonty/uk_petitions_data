        "additional_details": "There are people surviving off less than \u00a31000 a month in earnings. I believe that when you earn a very high wage, you should be able to cover your own expenses, instead of taking from a pot that already has too much coming out of it. The Government should cut MP expenses instead of welfare payments.",
        "background": "I believe that by cutting the expenses MP's are allowed to claim, when earning such a high wage, it will add more money to the pot for use on things such as fixing the NHS and building more affordable housing. This would replace the cut to welfare payments for the disabled and people unable to work.",
