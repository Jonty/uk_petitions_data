        "additional_details": "Currently, Londoners cannot remove the Mayor before the next scheduled election, leaving the office unaccountable for four years at a time. A recall law would give voters the same democratic rights they already have with MPs, strengthen trust in local democracy, and ensure that the Mayor remains answerable to the people throughout their term.",
        "background": "Introduce legislation allowing Londoners to trigger a recall petition for the Mayor, similar to the existing process for MPs. If enough voters sign, this should require a by-election so the Mayor can be held to account mid-term.",
