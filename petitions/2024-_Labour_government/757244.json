Many women live with painful periods, fibroids, or ongoing pain with no clear diagnosis. These experiences are too often dismissed due to such little research, which desperately needs to be increased.\r\n \r\nAddressing misogyny within the healthcare system is essential. When women\u2019s pain is not taken seriously, the consequences can be severe and life-threatening.",
