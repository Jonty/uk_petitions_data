        "additional_details": "Individuals born in Hong Kong who were minors in 1997 could not apply for BNO status alone, as policy at the time required BNO applications for minors to be made by parents on their behalf. At that time, minors had no way to independently decide to retain their ties to the UK by taking up BN(O) status. Those whose parents did not apply on their children's behalf cannot therefore benefit from the BNO Visa. In contrast, those born after 1997 to parents with BNO status can apply for the BNO Visa.",
        "background": "Reopen BNO applications and expand the BNO scheme to benefit those born before the 1997 handover of Hong Kong who were minors at the time. I think that those born before 1 July 1997 in Hong Kong whose parents held BNO status and who were minors at that time should receive fair treatment.",
