        "additional_details": "Ski masks and balaclavas are increasingly linked to gangs, intimidation, robberies, and knife crime. These coverings help offenders hide their identity and evade CCTV. Banning them would deter criminal behaviour, support policing, reduce fear in communities, and stop gangs using face coverings to conceal themselves, while still allowing limited legitimate uses such as sports or specific work roles.",
        "background": "Introduce a UK-wide ban on wearing, carrying, or selling ski masks and balaclavas. Classify them as prohibited identity-concealing gear and give police powers to stop, search, seize, and fine up to \u00a31,000 anyone found with them without a legitimate reason.",
