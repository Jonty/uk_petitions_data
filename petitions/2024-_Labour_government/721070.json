        "additional_details": "Locals&visitors to Hendon Golf Club&StoneX have been severely impacted by the closure.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve noticed a rise in antisocial behaviour, fly tipping, stolen motorbikes being discarded there, unsavoury characters loitering&almost weekly vandalism to the railings. \r\n\r\nThe closure also creates challenges for those with disabilities, walking difficulties&families with young children&caregivers. The detours mean longer, more arduous routes that can be particularly taxing on those with mobility issues.",
        "background": "The lane closed in Spring 23 following a structural survey determining that the bridge was unsafe. In Oct 24, Barnet Council said there is no timeline for reopening it.\r\n\r\nPrioritise its reopening to ensure everyone, regardless of their mobility, can navigate Mill Hill with safety, ease and dignity.",
