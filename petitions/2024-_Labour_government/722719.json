        "additional_details": "We do not aim to restrict the use of AI but to establish a framework that allows AI and human creativity to co-exist.\r\nConsumers deserve choice in content. Clear AI content labelling ensures transparency, supports human creators, avoid AI misusage, creation of fake news, and builds trust online. We call on Parliament to lead an ethical AI legislation, that balance innovation with accountability, protecting consumer rights and positioning the UK as a global leader in responsible AI integration.",
        "background": "We urge Parliament to mandate transparency in AI-generated content on digital platforms. Key proposals: 1) Tagging/watermarking AI content for user clarity; 2) AI content filters in apps/OS for user choice. Goal: Balance AI innovation with human creativity, ensuring informed consumption and trust.",
