In '23 we contributed almost \u00a370b to the economy. \r\n\r\n20% VAT is fundamentally flawed as unlike many other sectors of our core costs are not subject to VAT.\r\n\r\nOther countries recognise the unique pressures and social importance of hospitality and implement reduced VAT rates.This lower tax burden stimulates growth, encourages tourism, and supports local businesses.\r\n\r\nThis is not a subsidy, but a necessary correction.",
        "background": "\u200bWe call for an immediate and thorough review of VAT currently imposed on the UK\u2019s hospitality sector. The current standard rate of 20% is unsustainable, uncompetitive, and fails to recognise the unique economic and social contribution of our industry. We propose a permanent reduction to 5%. \r\n\u200b",
