We believe that defence funds should be prioritised for our own Armed Forces, and for the defence of the UK\u2019s borders and its territories, and to safeguard the UK against the threat of fundamentalist terrorism. We want a referendum on a defence/security pact with any European country.",

We believe such a pact is not in the national interest and must be subject to a referendum.",
