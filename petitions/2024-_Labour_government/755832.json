        "action": "Make sanitary products freely available in all public toilets in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Sanitary products are essential hygiene items, not luxury goods. Periods are unavoidable, and lack of access to sanitary products in public toilets can cause distress, missed education or work, and health risks.\r\n\r\nToilet paper is provided free in public toilets because it is necessary for basic bodily functions. Sanitary products serve the same purpose and should be treated equally.\r\n\r\nScotland has already made period products free by law, demonstrating that this policy is practical and effective. However, access across the rest of the UK remains inconsistent.\r\n\r\nMaking sanitary products freely available in all public toilets would reduce period poverty, improve public health, and promote dignity and equality.",
        "background": "Require all publicly accessible toilets in the UK to provide free sanitary products, in the same way that toilet paper is provided, to ensure basic hygiene and dignity for all who need them.",
