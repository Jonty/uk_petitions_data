Parent and child spaces aren\u2019t taken seriously, with many people either throwing in a blue badge or no badge at all. Just using the spaces to be closer to the shops or to stop their car getting damaged. \r\nMany parents have been caught in difficult positions of not being able to get their children in/out of cars because of a lack of respect for parent & child spaces.",
