        "action": "Let all children be allowed to use the toilet when they need at school",
        "additional_details": "Too many children are being told they can\u2019t go to the toilet during lessons, which can cause pain, stress, and health issues such as bladder problems or infections. It can also make school a place of fear or discomfort instead of safety and learning. Every child deserves dignity and respect. Allowing pupils to use the toilet when needed supports their physical health, emotional wellbeing, and basic human rights.",
        "background": "We want the Government to make it a rule that all schools in the UK must let children use the toilet whenever they need to, without needing a pass. Going to the toilet is a basic human need, and no child should be made to wait, feel embarrassed, or be punished for needing to go.",
