        "additional_details": "We call on the government to urgently simplify and clarify EU import procedures. Border staff often lack proper training, leading to unjustified shipment returns, wasted time and rising costs for small UK businesses. These delays don't benefit the country, they drain productivity and pile extra labour costs onto taxpayers. It\u2019s a broken system that punishes the businesses keeping the economy alive.We need efficiency, accountability, and real support for UK trade.Uk doesn't have enough resources",
        "background": "We urge the government to simplify and clarify import procedures from the EU. It's unacceptable that border staff still lack clear guidance, causing delays, returned shipments, and extra costs for small UK businesses that already contribute through taxes and local employment.",
