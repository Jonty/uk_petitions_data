        "additional_details": "Apart from the disruption to over-stretched schools it unfairly penalises pupils with almost 1,000 pupils at 29 schools due to take Latin at GCSE, as well as several thousands more pupils studying Latin at key stage 3. It removes yet another avenue of social mobility and levels the playing field between the state and private sector. If there is a belief in a well rounded ecucated population, the future critical thinkers, analysts and teachers the cancellation is short sighted and franly unfair.",
