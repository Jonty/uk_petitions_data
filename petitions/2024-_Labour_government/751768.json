The government should maintain the 5-year ILR for existing refugees, current Skilled Workers, and those who applied for asylum before new laws. No benefit restrictions should apply to recognised refugees and those who get ILR following current rules. Increasing ILR to 20 years would disrupt lives, create uncertainty, affect housing, employment, family stability, and children\u2019s future opportunities.",
