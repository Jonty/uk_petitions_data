        "action": "Stop proposals to scrap jury trials and protect our right to trial by peers",
        "additional_details": "Jury trials, protected since Magna Carta in 1215, are a cornerstone of British justice and democracy. They allow ordinary citizens to have a say, ensure transparency, prevent abuse of power, and maintain public trust. Weakening or removing them risks unfair trials, concentrated power, and the erosion of civil liberties that generations have fought to protect. The Government must urgently safeguard this fundamental right for everyone, now and for the future.",
        "background": "The Government must drop proposals that threaten our long-established right to be judged by a jury of our peers. Jury trials underpin open justice, public trust and fair outcomes. Reducing them would concentrate power, limit scrutiny and weaken vital civil liberties.",
