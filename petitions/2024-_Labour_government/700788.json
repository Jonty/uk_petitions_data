        "additional_details": "Basic first aid, cpr and recovery position saves lives, yet barely anyone gets taught it except for first aid courses. Some people were taught the recovery position in yr6. No one knows when someone may need CPR, and it is crucial in saving/preserving someones life until paramedics can arrive. With how badly the NHS is struggling, and with ambulance services being a long wait, having someone perform CPR will save someones life until paramedics can eventually arrive. It cant be taught online.",
