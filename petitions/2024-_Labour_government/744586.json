The homes still will not be affordable for the people who actually live in and around the area. The infrastructure is not good enough and there will be an inevitable rise in crime with so many new dwellings. We do not want these places that we have loved for years being destroyed. You do not know the area or have lived here, the residents should have the say.",

The homes will still not be affordable and we will have forever lost a beautiful part of outer London. WE DO NOT WANT THIS",
