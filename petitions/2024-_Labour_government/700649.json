The noise can impact those who have disabilities or PTSD aggravated by loud noises.\r\n\r\nAnimals are also greatly affected by fireworks, causing distress, panic and even death. Animals have no escape from or understanding of these noises, no matter the day or time. I've heard countless horror stories of animals and people being hurt or killed due to fireworks being used unsafely.",
        "background": "Ban the sale and possession of fireworks to the general public unless they're silent. The public are able to buy and use fireworks from October through to new year. This is unfair to those who suffer from the loud noise.",
