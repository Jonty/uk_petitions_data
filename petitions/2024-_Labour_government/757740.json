        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to reform student loan interest rates so borrowers have a realistic chance of repaying what they owe. Current student loan interest rates exceed inflation for many graduates, meaning that despite making regular repayments, balances continue to grow rather than fall. For many borrowers, this can make the loan effectively impossible to repay in full. Student loans were intended to be a fair, income-contingent contribution to education \u2014 not a debt that increases indefinitely.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to:\r\nCap student loan interest at inflation (CPI), and\r\nEnsure future changes are not applied retrospectively to existing borrowers.\r\nWe think this would restore fairness, transparency, and confidence in the student finance system.",
