        "additional_details": "As people get older, staying connected with family and friends becomes even more important. Yet I find that high train fares make long-distance travel impossible for many. Free national rail travel could give seniors the freedom to see loved ones, explore, and stay active while also boosting tourism and local businesses.",
        "background": "National train fares are expensive, and even with a 1/3 discount, I think many seniors can\u2019t afford to travel. They must pay \u00a335 annually for a railcard just to save on tickets. This could mean missed family moments and lost independence. I feel that free travel could give them true freedom.",
