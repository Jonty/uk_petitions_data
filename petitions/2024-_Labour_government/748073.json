        "additional_details": "T\u00fcrkiye & the UK enjoy strong diplomatic, economic & cultural ties. But we feel current visa requirements place a significant burden on Turkish citizens wishing to visit the UK for legitimate stays. Many comparable countries have introduced visa-free or simplified arrangements for Turkish citizens & the UK should too. We think introducing visa-free access for Turkish citizens would help strengthen all ties between the UK and T\u00fcrkiye, boost economies/ease family reunions.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to introduce visa-free entry for citizens of T\u00fcrkiye for visits including tourism, business, family visits and long term stays. Turkish citizens are humans too and we think they deserve the same access rights as citizens of countries with visa-free entry to the UK.",
