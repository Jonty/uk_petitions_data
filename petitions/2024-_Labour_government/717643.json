        "additional_details": "We urge the UK Government to take immediate action to stop puppy farming, unethical breeding and puppy sales. Current laws do not go far enough to protect dogs from exploitation, overbreeding, and inhumane conditions. We demand stronger breeding regulations regardless of the amount of litters with mandatory welfare checks for any breeding dog before a license is granted and better enforcement, to ensure any dog is bred responsibly and ethically and not as a form of income",
        "background": "\u2705 Make all dog breeders legally required to be licensed, regardless of litter numbers, with mandatory welfare inspections before approval.\r\n\u2705 Create a national breeder and puppy database, linking all dogs to their breeder via microchip registration, ensuring full traceability and accountability",
