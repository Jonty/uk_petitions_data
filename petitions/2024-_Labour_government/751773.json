        "additional_details": "I am concerned that across rural areas such as the Highlands, communities are losing access to essential banking services. I believe shared banking hubs have proven effective where local banks have closed, but that the current eligibility criteria is too narrow.\r\n\r\nIn my view, the current assessment process prioritises large retail centres, excluding many smaller towns and villages, despite these places acting as vital service hubs for surrounding rural communities.\r\n\r\nTo ensure fair and equitable access to banking services for all, I would like access to cash in rural areas, the criteria and FCA rules affecting it to be reviewed and reformed.",
        "background": "Review access to cash in rural areas and require the FCA to reform its rules, and LINK\u2019s criteria, so more rural communities like the Highlands can have banking hubs. It must better reflect rural issues: ageing populations; limited internet access; and geography to help stop financial exclusion.",
