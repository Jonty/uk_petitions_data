We believe this increases pressure on services and contributes to rising crime and violence. We believe Foreign Aid must be conditional on cooperation to stop subsidising obstruction, safeguard communities, and reinforce the UK\u2019s immigration system, ensuring national security and fairness in the use of public funds.",
