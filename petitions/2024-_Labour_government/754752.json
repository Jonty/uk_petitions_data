        "additional_details": "Residents in Manchester and Cheshire are against the significant strain on already degraded infrastructure and NHS services which a new town of up to 20,000 houses (mainly on farmland) would bring.\r\nLocal councils, Cheshire East Council, and our MP are against Adlington new town. Instead, progressing other national sites that are mainly brownfield and have strong local support would ensure that the development of new towns does not degrade national food security or quality of life in communities.",
        "background": "The Secretary of State must: 1. Halt the 2026 designation process for Adlington. 2. Confirm that no Designation Order for Adlington under the New Towns Act 1981 will be signed. 3. Guarantee that 'New Town' powers will not be used to override unanimous local democratic opposition in Adlington.",
