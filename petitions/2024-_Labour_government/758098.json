        "action": "Fund urgent replacement / refurbishment of Central Line trains.",
        "additional_details": "The Central Line is one of the most unrealiable parts of the London Underground, with near-daily severe delays, repeated service suspensions, train defects and unsafe overcrowding. This is largely due to the ageing 1992 rolling stock which is no longer reliable enough to support a stable timetable. \r\n\r\nPassengers routinely experience long gaps between trains, repeated suspension of entire branches, dangerously overcrowded platforms, affecting work, childcare, education and healthcare.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to work with TFL to urgently fund the replacement or major refurbishment of the Central Line\u2019s 1992 ageing rolling stock, improve service reliability, and implement a short-term stabilisation plan to reduce severe delays, train failures, and dangerous overcrowding.",
