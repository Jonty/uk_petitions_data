        "background": "Funding: Allocate funds for the construction of the causeway.\r\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment: Conduct a thorough assessment of the environmental impact of the causeway.\r\nCommunity Consultation: To see what local communities have to say/how they feel about the causeway and how it could help them.",
