By reducing this burden, applying a credit for stamp duty paid to use against a future home purchase, we think this would meet the needs of our diverse, increasingly transient population and encourage movement of the workforce.",

We think this would effectively give families a \u2018credit note\u2019 of the stamp duty paid and help reduce this financial barrier.",
