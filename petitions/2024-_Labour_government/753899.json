        "additional_details": "AI-generated music is increasingly difficult to distinguish from human-made recordings. Without clear labelling, listeners cannot make informed choices about what they are hearing, supporting, or sharing.\r\n\r\nTransparent tagging will protect consumers, improve trust in streaming services, and help ensure fair recognition of human artists and songwriters.\r\n\r\nWe also want an optional toggle that enables users to exclude AI-generated tracks from autoplay, radio, and algorithmic recommendations.",
        "background": "Require music streaming platforms operating in the UK, including Spotify and Apple Music, to clearly label when a track is AI-generated or substantially AI-assisted. We also want platforms to provide a user setting that allows listeners to block AI-generated music from being played or recommended.",
