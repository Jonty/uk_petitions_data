Government are asking again to stop next elections in May 2026. This is stopping tax and council tax electorates fro making their choices at the polling stations. The public need the right to vote, not be blocked from a vote",
        "background": "Government does not seem to be listening to the public, the people who voted them in. Even those who voted, are regretting their votes. If Labour isn\u2019t listening to the public, making their own rules to stop other parties from a chance, then it\u2019s time for the King to step in and dissolve Government",
