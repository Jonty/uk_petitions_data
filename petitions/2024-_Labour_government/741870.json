        "additional_details": "There are no rules put into place to protect women in the work place while on their period.\r\nI find it disgusting that a male colleague can have a day off for migraines and for conman aches and pains, yet women have to go into work and be forced to do their job, or be fired or suspended for not being able to work.\r\nSome women have endometriosis and pcos and find it extremely painful to even get out of bed in a morning, let alone the having to get into work and not be given any leeway.",
        "background": "Bring in a law to put steps into place to make every woman able to be supported and protected while on their period at work.\r\nThere should be protocols put into place that give women the right to have paid sick days and access to chairs and other equipment to help them during their period.",
