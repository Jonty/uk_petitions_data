        "additional_details": "1- Prevent breach of trust in UK immigration rules.\r\n2- Avoid unfair disruption to skilled migrants\u2019 lives.\r\n3- Protect families, employers and key sectors from instability.\r\n4- Recognise contributions to economy, taxes, and public services.\r\n5- Uphold legal certainty and UK\u2019s reputation for fairness.",
        "background": "We urge the Govt to protect current Skilled Worker visa holders on the 5-year ILR path. The proposed 10-year rule must not apply retrospectively, as it unfairly disrupts lives of migrants who made commitments based on existing rules, causing uncertainty for workers and employers across the UK.",
