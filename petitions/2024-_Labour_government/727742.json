        "additional_details": "Thousands of Skilled Worker and other work visa holders and their dependants moved to the UK based on the three to five-year ILR pathway. Migrants contribute to the UK through essential work and over \u00a32 billion in taxes each year. Applying new rules retrospectively would not only be unfair to those who have built their life in the UK but also undermine trust in the system and damage thousands of families who contribute fully but live with limited rights.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to guarantee that any increase to the ILR qualifying period will apply only to future visa applicants. Migrants already in the UK on 5-year settlement routes must remain protected under the rules they entered on. Changing them mid-way would be unjust.",
