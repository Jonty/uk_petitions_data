        "additional_details": "We think that the current GCSE and A-level exam boards are incompetent, expensive and sometimes exams set are factually incorrect. We are concerned that there may be a lot of money spent on expensive textbooks, sitting exam papers, and that the content set by exam boards may be outdated, badly worded and contain incorrect information. We believe that nationalisation will allow for greater levels of control on what we teach the people in our country, and ensure exam materials are relevant and correct. It will also unify all exam boards.",
        "background": "Nationalise all GCSE and A-Level exam boards to ensure exams are accurate and relevant to what students have studied. Pay examiners fairly as we believe that some examiners are also teachers working extra to earn more income.",
