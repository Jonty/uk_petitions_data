Stricter rules should prevent illegal content, with severe penalties for non-compliance. Regular audits and oversight are essential to ensure protection and accountability",
        "background": "1 in 5 children aged 11-13 and 1 in 3 15-year-olds in the UK view porn, often with no age verification in place. Early exposure can disrupt brain development, impair emotional regulation, and skew perceptions of relationships. This can have lasting effects on their social and emotional growth.",
