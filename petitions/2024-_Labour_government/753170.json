        "additional_details": "Reverse the recent study results which implies that it would be \u2018more harm than good\u2019 statement. If another study was to be done by prostate cancer patients, who never had any symptoms, or families of those who have passed away with this disease with no symptoms, I am sure opinion would change. Firstly think about the impact on individuals and their families. When you hear the word CANCER from the doctor, your world changes.  Early detection will save lives, and the NHS \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 \r\nScreening is a must",
        "background": "A recent decision by heath experts concluded that a screening programme would do more harm than good, but, if prostate cancer is detected early there is a better chance of living longer, and less long term pressure on NHS if it\u2019s detected early",
