        "additional_details": "It is important that the government supports the need to educate young girls through the curriculum at an early age with regard to their own physical development and breast health.  This would raise awareness of how to check for potential lumps or other abnormalities and understand their own breast development and the need for a professionally fitted bra. This can not only protect them from the need for cosmetic surgery later in life but can also save lives and reduce costs on the NHS.",
        "background": "To introduce the subject of breast health onto the school curriculum.  To break the barrier of \"taboo\" and educate young girls on how to check their breasts for abnormalities and to understand the reasons of the importance of a professionally well fitted bra for both everyday and sport.",
