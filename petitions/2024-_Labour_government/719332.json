        "additional_details": "Prong collars are designed to cause pain or discomfort to the animal to reduce or stop them from pulling on their lead. Causing unnecessary suffering to the animal. \r\n\r\nThey're based on the principle of applying something painful or frightening to stop unwanted behaviour. When a dog pulls on the lead, the metal prongs of the collar close and prong the sensitive skin around the neck. The prongs cause pain as well as potential injury and infection from puncture wounds and nerve damage.\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that aversive training techniques, like prong collars, can cause pain and distress and can compromise dog welfare. We also know that painful and distressing training techniques have long term effects on the mental wellbeing and overall happiness of dogs.",
