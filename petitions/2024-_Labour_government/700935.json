        "additional_details": "I would the government to ban the use of fireworks in back gardens. Fireworks in public displays could still be in place however the ban of back garden fireworks could not only help with the loss of pets but also reduce anxiety in those with mental illnesses such as PTSD. The environment as a whole would be positively impacted, litter would be reduced and less smoke in the air. We want our communities to feel safe and that includes protecting our animals and environment.",

Many dogs flee their owners on walks to escape it.",
