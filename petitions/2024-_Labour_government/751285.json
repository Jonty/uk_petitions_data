        "additional_details": "MPs rely on a 300-year-old precedent to act as \"Trustees,\" owing judgment but not answers. This effectively legalises the attitude that \"I am not accountable because I know better than you.\" Consequently, MPs can legally ignore constituents for years between elections.\r\n\r\nWe must amend the Recall Act to sanction \"Systemic Non-Representation\" (excluding abusive mail). We need a statutory \"Duty to Account\" to replace this aristocratic paternalism with a binding obligation to engage.",
        "background": "The Recall of MPs Act 2015 captures criminals but ignores negligence. Constituents have no recourse when MPs systematically refuse to engage or explain decisions. We must amend the Act to recognise 'Systemic Non-Representation' as a breach of duty, ensuring MPs cannot silence those they represent.",
