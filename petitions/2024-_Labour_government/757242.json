        "additional_details": "In our view, the law as it stands creates a discriminatory double standard where babies diagnosed with Down syndrome can be terminated much later than those without. We believe this late-term allowance is not only unjust but perpetuates a societal view that individuals with Down syndrome are less worthy of life. There\u2019s countless stories of individuals with DS who thrive and contribute significantly to society. We think changing the law will foster greater acceptance and support for these individuals and their families.",
        "background": "Amend laws relating to abortion to equalise the 24 week limit for abortions in cases where the baby has been diagnosed with Down\u2019s syndrome. We believe that the law should affirm the equal value and dignity of all lives, ensuring that every child has a fair chance to make their mark in the world.",
