        "additional_details": "Many centres have a very large roof, which can be ideal for a large number of solar panels. We believe solar panels would be a one-off cost rather than a monthly handout. We believe this initiative can help leisure centres stay open, which can ensure continued investment in our mental and physical health whilst also helping the government move towards its net zero goal.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to fund solar panels for non-for-profit leisure centres. We are concerned that leisure centres struggle with the cost of electricity bills, heating swimming pools and the running studio, and gym air conditioning, as it can mean less money to spend on staff and equipment.",
