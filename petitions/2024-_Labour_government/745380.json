        "action": "Conduct a leadership review of Labour due to retrospective ILR rule.",
        "additional_details": "The retrospective 10-year ILR policy has caused widespread loss of trust in the Labour Party, especially among refugees, migrants, and their communities. This policy undermines the promise of a fair and timely route to settlement and damages Labour\u2019s credibility. A leadership review is necessary to hold the party accountable, restore public confidence, and ensure immigration policies reflect compassion and justice.",
        "background": "We urge the government to pressure the Labour Party to conduct a formal leadership review and reconsider the retrospective 10-year ILR policy. This is essential to restore trust among refugees, migrants, and the public, and to ensure fair and humane immigration policies.",
