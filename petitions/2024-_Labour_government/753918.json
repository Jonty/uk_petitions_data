        "additional_details": "I am 19 years old. My parents are unfortunately dead, I am fairly estranged from my family. And so I have to pay rent. Some of my apprentice colleagues are on the same wage living with parents and do not have to pay a penny toward their living expenses, whilst I am left with almost no money every month.  I believe that it would be beneficial to apprentices with limited family support and higher living expenses many people living in circumstances such as this, and worse, to have a slightly higher hourly wage.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to ensure that individuals seeking further education as an apprentice (e.g getting a level 3 qualification in childcare) can have a wage that is more appropriate for an their circumstances, as opposed to a single flat minimum wage for all apprentices.",
