        "additional_details": "Vaping has become an epidemic amongst young people. \r\n\r\nYoung people still in school, who's minds and bodies are still developing.\r\n\r\nLittle is known about the long term affects. We do know, now, that the potency of some vapes can be many times stronger than a single cigarette. \r\n\r\nCurrently, vaping is sold with bright colours, advertising sweet smells; targeted directly at young people.\r\n\r\nVaping was introduced as a means of NRT, to quit smoking. \r\n\r\nUltimately, more (children) are becoming addicted.",
        "background": "Standardise packing for all vaping products, (including vapes, liquids, filters, coils etc.) to reduce their appeal. Packing should be plain, not coloured, advertising sweet smells. Similar to legislation passed in 2015 for tobacco products.",
