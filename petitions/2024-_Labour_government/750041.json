Additional scans, such as those done in private can also save the lives of women who have asymptomatic ectopic pregnancies only discovered via the additional scan.",
        "background": "We believe private pregnancy ultrasound clinics are taking advantage of low NHS availability by charging extortionate amounts for ultrasounds. We have heard that some women are paying upwards to \u00a3100 to confirm their pregnancy is viable. There should be a cap on what private clinics can charge.",
