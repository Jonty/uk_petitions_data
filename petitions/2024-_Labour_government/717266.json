We think labels should provide details about how produce is transported, enabling consumers to make informed purchasing decisions. We believe by knowing the carbon footprint associated with produce, some shoppers could make environmentally conscious decisions, potentially reducing their overall carbon footprint. Air-freight is one of the most carbon-intensive transport methods and we think it is is potentially incompatible with Britain\u2019s net zero commitments.",
