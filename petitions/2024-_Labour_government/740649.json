        "additional_details": "Many people now discover and enjoy music through streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube, rather than traditional radio. Yet, the law still treats streaming differently, which we argue results in a less fair deal for artists, songwriters and musicians. Radio pays per play, acknowledging each broadcast as a distinct use of music, and we believe streaming should reflect the same principle. Reform is needed to ensure fair pay for artists in the digital age.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to reform copyright law so that music streaming is treated in the same way as radio play for royalty purposes. We believe artists and performers should be paid fairly for every stream, just as they are for every broadcast on radio.",
