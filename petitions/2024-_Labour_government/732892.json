        "additional_details": "For example, if a baby is born in January, they become eligible for 30 hours free childcare in September, when they turn 9 months old. However, if the mother takes 52 weeks maternity leave plus 2 weeks neonatal care and returns to work in February, the family will miss the January 31 funding deadline. As a result, they will not receive funding until April, losing three months of childcare support. This issue may affect many families using neonatal leave and we think it must be addressed by the government.",
        "background": "Currently, the 30 hours childcare scheme bases eligibility on the baby\u2019s birth date and parent\u2019s return to work. Neonatal leave delays some parents, which may cause them to miss deadlines and lose months of free childcare. We think the government must change this to stop families being penalised.",
