        "additional_details": "We feel the current ban on recruiting individuals with diabetes is outdated and inconsistent, particularly when service members with the condition can remain in the Armed Forces if well-managed. We think excluding capable recruits from critical roles, like cyber security, due to a medical condition is discriminatory and limits the pool of skilled personnel. With widespread skill shortages, particularly in high-demand areas, we think it's crucial to create a more inclusive Armed Forces, following the example of progressive nations like Finland.",
        "background": "We want the government to end the blanket ban on recruiting individuals with diabetes into the Armed Forces. We think the policy should be updated to allow those who can manage their condition effectively to serve, especially in non-physically demanding roles like cyber security and intelligence.",
