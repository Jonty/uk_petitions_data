        "additional_details": "This significant reform should involve proper democratic engagement including a full public consultation and citizens assemblies because this controversial proposal to introduce digital ID - which has been rejected before by the citizens of the UK - was not included in the Labour Party's 2024 manifesto. \r\n\r\nIt is also a matter which, if proceeded with, will require parliamentary scrutiny & oversight & careful draughtsmanship. Therefore, any public consultation should cover the need for primary legalisation if this is not agreed. \r\n",
        "background": "We feel that the Government lacks a mandate to introduce Digital ID\r\n\r\nWe feel introducing Digital ID would be an unnecessary & unjustified intrusion into people\u2019s privacy for which the Government has no mandate. ",
