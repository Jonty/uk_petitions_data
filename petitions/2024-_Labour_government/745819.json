It would break the trust between the Government and those who came here legally, increase financial and emotional hardship, and delay their ability to fully participate in society.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to honour the existing 5-year ILR commitment for those already legally in the UK and ensure that any new 10-year settlement rules apply only to future applicants.",
