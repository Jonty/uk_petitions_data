        "action": "Change the legal processes to make prosecuting rapists more attainable.",
        "additional_details": "Many victims of rape would rather not go to police or try to convict for rape, because they know that it is unlikely to end successfully for them, and reliving the trauma of the rape alongside the long and costly process, isn't worth it if their rapist isn't going to be convicted. On the other hand, many rapists also know that they can rape and most likely not be criminally charged. This needs to change to bring justice to victims and act as a preventative measure for future rape cases.",
        "background": "With the legal standard for criminal prosecutions being beyond reasonable doubt, the evidence needed to successfully convict rapists and bring justice to victims is incredibly high. I want this changed so it is more attainable to convict those guilty of rape.",
