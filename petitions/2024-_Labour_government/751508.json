Retrospective law changes undermine legal certainty, stability, and trust in the immigration system.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to ensure that new immigration and ILR rules are not applied retrospectively to refugees who already arrived in the UK. People who entered the UK under previous rules should continue under the system they were initially assessed with.",
