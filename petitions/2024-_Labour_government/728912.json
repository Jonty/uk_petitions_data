        "additional_details": "We want the ban to be extended to cover activities with smaller volumes of liquid.\r\n\r\nExtracting oil and gas will intensify the impact of climate change. There are companies who have submitted planning applications to use what we see as \"small-scale fracking\" to extract oil and gas. Little is known of the potential risks of this activity. We ask the government to close what we feel is a loophole to help protect communities from harm. We believe not doing so could slow the essential transition towards clean, renewable energy.",
        "background": "Fracking forces fluid into rocks to open cracks so oil or gas can flow out. It was banned in 2019 after being blamed for causing earthquakes in shale gas drilling. But the ban only covers fracking with large volumes of fluid. ",
