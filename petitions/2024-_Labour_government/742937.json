        "additional_details": "This advisory ruling from the International Court of Justice is not legally binding and will cost taxpayers \u00a335 billion paid Mauritius, a close Chinese ally and despite Mauritius never having a claim to the island historically. The remote yet very strategic base of Diego Garcia is now unnecessarily leased for the next 99 years and faces falling into the hands of China. The people of Chagos had no consultation in this decision and this has the potential to set a precedent unless a U-Turn is made.",
        "background": "The United Kingdom should reverse the decision to surrender sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. This decision imposes a huge unnecessary cost to the British Taxpayer over 100 years and includes a strategic military base that we now have to lease.",
