        "additional_details": "The government must take action, as many people in the UK are seeking answers. The victims deserve to understand why their voices were ignored, and why the majority of perpetrators were never brought to justice. The peaceful Muslim community in the UK also needs clarity, as the lack of convictions unfairly damages their reputation and fosters mistrust toward decent Muslim men. Most importantly, those in positions of authority who were complicit must be held accountable to ensure such failures are never repeated.",
        "background": "I think the Government should commission a full independent inquiry into the way successive governments, local councils, social services and the CPS have mis-handled and suppressed the news coverage of the Pakistani grooming gangs rape of many thousands of children over the last 40 years.",
