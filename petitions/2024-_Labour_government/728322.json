        "action": "No Retrospective Rule Change for existing Skilled Workers, Keep 5-Year ILR Route",
        "additional_details": "Existing skilled worker visa holders made life-changing decisions based on the expectation that they are eligible for ILR after 5 years. Some have started a family or even bought a new home in the UK. Unforeseen increase in the qualifying period for ILR would put them at risk of losing their jobs as employers may be unable to continue sponsorship for extended period due to rising visa costs,and consequently losing their homes, mortgages, and their rights to stay in the UK. Quoting HSMP precedent",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government not to apply the proposed change to extend the Skilled Worker visa settlement route from 5 years to 10 years retrospectively. Honor the original 5-year ILR route to existing visa holders.\r\n\r\nApply any new settlement duration rules only to new visa applicants going forward.",
