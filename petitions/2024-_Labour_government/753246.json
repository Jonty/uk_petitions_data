        "additional_details": "Cancelling the May 2026 elections would deny residents in Chorley, Preston and Blackburn their democratic right to choose who represents them. Proposals to create new larger \"unitary\" authorities in Lancashire are still uncertain and not due to take effect until 2028. Major decisions will still be made before any new \"unitary\" authority exists. Too much can change before 2028, and people deserve accountability and a say in their local elections and not be denied their chance to vote locally.",
        "background": "Ensure that local elections in Chorley, Preston and Blackburn go ahead in May 2026. Do not cancel or postpone them as this would deny residents their democratic right to choose their local representatives. Democracy should never be paused. The government must protect the rights of its residents.",
