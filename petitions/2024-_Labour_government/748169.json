Yet they are outside FOI, and much information is secret by law. We think bringing them within FOI \u2013 while protecting personal data and security \u2013 would improve value-for-money scrutiny, prevent conflicts of interest, increase trust and transparency in an institution many of us support. We believe that if public money is used, there must be public accountability.",
