        "additional_details": "At present, MPs may change their party affiliation after being elected without consulting voters. Many constituents vote for a party and its manifesto, not just an individual candidate.\r\nRequiring a by-election when an MP changes party would uphold democratic accountability and allow voters to decide whether the MP should continue to represent them.\r\nThis petition calls on Parliament to amend the Recall of MPs Act or introduce new legislation so that a party change triggers a by-election.",
        "background": "At present, MPs can change their party after being elected without asking voters if they still wish them to represent them. This can weaken democratic accountability. Requiring MPs who switch party to trigger a by-election would allow constituents to decide if they still support their representation",
