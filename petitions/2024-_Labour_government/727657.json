        "additional_details": "There is no specific policy mandated by the Government in existence today. We think that creating a policy for use by schools in England for whenever feedback is being given to a pupil, would align with Government plans to support young people's mental health and reduce the risk of future suicide. We think notification to parents should be mandatory, even if a pupil appears to regain their composure after having been distressed. Unfortunately, over 200 teenagers are lost to suicide every year.",
        "background": "We want the Government to create specific statutory guidance that must be used by educational establishments. This is to prevent the risk of pupils taking their own life after having been distressed whilst receiving feedback on their academic results and/or future subject options.",
