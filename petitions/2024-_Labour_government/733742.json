        "additional_details": "The age limit has been reduced before, to accommodate people with specific disabilities. We think it should be reduced to encompass all 16 year olds. We believe it would promote early road training, and could reduce pressure on public transport. There should be restrictions however, such as a maximum passenger limits for the first year & restricted night driving, but in the long run, we think it could make the next generation into responsible, young adults, as well as making life more practical.",
        "background": "I believe the current legal driving limit should be reduced to 16 years old for cars. We already allow 16 year olds to drive cars if they meet specific criteria for disability or health conditions. We believe this means age is less of a concern. Several other countries allow 16 year olds to drive.",
