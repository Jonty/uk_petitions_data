It can affect many people, including younger people and older people. People shouldn\u2019t have to wait years to have results. People shouldn\u2019t have to deteriorate due to waiting so long or not being heard. Doctors need to acknowledge the symptoms and send referrals, this doesn\u2019t seem to always happen and it can be dismissed. We\u2019d truly like this to be more recognised and for there to be more training. We believe England doesn\u2019t know much about TMDs.",
