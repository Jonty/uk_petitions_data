While some UK stonemasons may be confident that they have the strongest health and safety measures in place to protect their team, we believe the risk of this material is not necessary when there are alternatives on the market.\r\nEngineered stone is a large market in the UK and we urge the UK government to ban the sale of this product.\r\n",
