        "action": "Halt the changes made to PIP which will remove financial aid to disabled people",
        "additional_details": "We want the government to understand that taking away this vital financial aid from vulnerable people, will have disastrous consequences. People do not use this aid as sole income as it isn\u2019t enough to live off, but instead use it to enable daily living expenses for disabilities. Being a disabled person is costly and many do not get paid enough to cover accessibility requirements. Taking this away means that disabled people will not be able to function. This contravenes human rights principles.",
        "background": "We want the Labour Government to stop the discriminatory changes they have made to PIP that mean it will be even harder for disabled people to gain financial aid. These changes also mean that many will also lose this essential benefit. Pressure from MP\u2019s needs to be increased to stop this action.",
