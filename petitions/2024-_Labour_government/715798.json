Children are stealing vapes off shelves and the shop staff do not challenge them as it\u2019s above their pay scale or they are too scared. Drastic action needs to be taken NOW!! The future side effects of vaping is uncertain. What is certain is the strain already on our NHS!! It will only get worse in the future! Would a self-employed Vape shop owner turn away under-age customers? Highly unlikely!",
        "background": "Same laws as selling cigarettes. Vapes shouldn\u2019t be on shelves in shops they should be behind shop counters. They are too accessible for children and packaged like sweets. Fruity sweetie flavours are not necessary!!",
