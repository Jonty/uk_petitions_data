        "action": "Reverse the decision of officially recognising a Palestinian State",
        "additional_details": "The recognition of a Palestinian state rewards a terrorist organisation after the horrors of October 7th 2023. It is also fundamentally against international law with no formal border and no official governance. The state is currently under a Terrorist regime that is still holding many innocent hostages. This costly recognition for the taxpayer goes against the will of the British public and will have no impact on a ceasefire or peace solution.",
        "background": "The United Kingdom should not recognise a Palestinian State. We should not be communicating with Terrorist organisations and the embassy needs to be closed immediately. Cooperation with Palestine is traitorous to our Jewish population in the United Kingdom.",
