        "additional_details": "Leading charities estimate it takes almost 9 years on average in the UK to be diagnosed with endometriosis, which can cause avoidable pain and mental health struggles, and is linked to fertility problems. We believe that systems to track diagnosis, treatment, or outcomes are inadequate, and that there are limited ways to see where care may be failing or to measure improvement. We think other countries have proven that registries and audits can improve care, shorten delays, and drive research.",
