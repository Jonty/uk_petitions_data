        "additional_details": "Palestine lacks unified, legitimate governance, with the Palestinian Authority and Hamas divided\u2014Hamas being a recognized terrorist group. It fails to meet statehood criteria, lacking defined borders, effective control, and independent capacity. Armed factions perpetuate violence, undermining peace. Recognition without negotiations removes incentives for compromise. Withdrawing recognition affirms that sovereignty must be earned through responsible governance and peaceful coexistence.",
        "background": "The government should withdraw recognition of Palestine, as it lacks unified governance, fails to meet statehood criteria, and allows armed groups to undermine peace. Recognition without negotiations hinders compromise; withdrawal reinforces that sovereignty must be earned responsibly.",
