        "additional_details": "We believe it is in the public interest to review the accuracy of the claims, the sources of funding for campaigns, and the role of misinformation in shaping voter choice. A transparent inquiry could provide accountability and help restore trust in democratic processes. Many believe the referendum was a turning point for the UK, and we believe the public deserves clarity on how it was conducted and the validity of the information that led to such a significant national decision.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to establish an independent, public inquiry into the claims and information presented during the EU Exit referendum. Many reports and studies suggest that misleading or exaggerated claims were made by both sides, which may have influenced public opinion and the result.",
