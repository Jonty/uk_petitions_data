        "additional_details": "Current law gives pregnant people full control over whether a pregnancy continues, which is ethically correct, but men have no equivalent legal choice. A man can become a father without his consent and be forced to pay child support for 18 years, even if he never wanted a child or had no say in the outcome. This imbalance is unfair and outdated. The law should allow men a clear, pre-birth opt-out so responsibility matches choice, while abortion decisions remain solely with the pregnant person.",
        "background": "Pass a law letting men sign a binding pre-birth opt-out that ends all parental rights and child maintenance. A woman can become pregnant and choose to keep or abort without the man's consent, yet men can still be forced to pay for 18 years. Make it fair.",
