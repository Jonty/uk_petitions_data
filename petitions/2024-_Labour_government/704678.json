        "additional_details": "Standing charges have risen, which we think leaves consumers with limited control over their energy bills. We think this unfair system exacerbates the cost of living crisis and reduces incentives to cut energy consumption / CO2 footprint. By making costs fully variable, we think users would have more control over their bills and be encouraged to reduce energy use, helping both their finances and the environment.",
        "background": "Standing charges are applied regardless of usage and disproportionately affect low-energy users. Instead, we think the Government should require energy companies to include the cost in the unit price. We think this would ensure large users pay more and small users pay less.",
