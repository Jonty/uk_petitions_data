        "additional_details": "The UK has repeatedly criticised Israel\u2019s military methods. If the UK believes there's a better way, it should lead by example. British forces, known for their professionalism, should demonstrate how to neutralise terrorists without harming civilians or causing collateral damage. This would test the feasibility of disarming terrorists embedded in civilian areas, and would show that UK criticism is backed by practical solutions, not rhetoric.",
        "background": "We believe the UK should not endlessly criticise Israel\u2019s actions unless it is prepared to offer a viable, operational alternative. The UK must demonstrate international leadership by taking upon itself to dismantle terrorist infrastructure entrenched in Gaza.",
