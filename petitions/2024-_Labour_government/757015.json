        "additional_details": "The people of Iran are facing extreme violence and repression. At least 12,000 people have lost their lives according to official figures, with credible reports indicating the true number is far higher. Despite the scale of these atrocities, the response from the UK Government\u2014and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer\u2014has been disturbingly quiet. Silence in the face of mass suffering is unacceptable. The UK has both a moral and international responsibility to respond to this genocide.",
        "background": "Publicly and unequivocally condemn the actions of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Acknowledge the severity of the human rights crisis in Iran. Take practical action to support the Iranian people, including diplomatic pressure, targeted sanctions, and support for independent investigations.",
