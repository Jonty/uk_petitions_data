The Government have discriminated against the women hiding them as a matter of national security so they could not qualify for the \u201ccatch 22\u201d rule of \u201cAppeal\u201d against their civilian status. Also placing the SOE as \u201cForeign Office\u201d despite being a military unit fighting against the Germans. No matter the ethical dilemma the UK Government did place women to fight in the middle of a war.",
