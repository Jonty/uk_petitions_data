        "action": "Make licensing mandatory for all rescues and rehoming centres.",
        "additional_details": "Many issues arise from unlicensed operations, from inadequate facilities to insufficient veterinary care. Animals may be kept in poor conditions, leading to health issues or behavioural problems that make them harder to rehome. A mandatory licensing scheme would mandate regular inspections, ensuring facilities are safe, clean, and meet specific care standards.\r\n\r\nTogether, we can protect animals from harm and ensure they find the loving homes they deserve.",
        "background": "The absence of mandatory licensing for animal rescue and rehoming centres poses an unacceptable risk to the health and well-being of animals. \r\n\r\nUnlicensed facilities can operate without oversight, leading to unregulated and potentially harmful environments for vulnerable animals.",
