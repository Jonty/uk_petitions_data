We would loose our cherished rural identity, residents feel that we would become boundary towns that do not have anything in common with the urban areas of Gr Manchester. If we have these changes forced on us, it will create a resentment and will reinforce the lack of democracy if this proposal is pushed through by the government.",
        "background": "We want the Government to accept the that the residents of the High Peak are far better off not being part of Greater Manchester. Feelings are very strong on this subject and if the Government want to prove to themselves, give the people of High Peak a referendum on the proposal.",
