        "additional_details": "We call for the Government to ban all supermarkets from throwing away all edible food, and require them to donate any surplus food that is edible and is approaching the best-before-date or with minor imperfections to be donated to food banks and local charities. Ending food waste could reduce hunger, cut environmental damage, and show real social responsibility.\r\n \r\nNo one should go hungry while good food is thrown away.",
        "background": "Everyday, UK supermarkets throw away tonnes of edible food while millions of people rely on food banks to survive. We believe this is wrong, and that food that is safe to eat should not end up in bins when many families, pensioners, and workers are going hungry. ",
