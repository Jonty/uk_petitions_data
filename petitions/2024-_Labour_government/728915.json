        "additional_details": "The UK curriculum is outdated and does not prepare students for a world shaped by AI, automation, digital technologies, and global challenges. Countries like Singapore, Estonia, and Finland are already modernising their education systems. Without urgent reform, reducing outdated subjects, and proper investment in UDL, teacher training, and infrastructure, the UK risks falling behind, damaging our economy, workforce, and children\u2019s futures. Failure to act now will cause long-term harm to society.",

Invest in inclusive education, teacher training, and Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to support all learners.",
