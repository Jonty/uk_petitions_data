        "additional_details": "We believe the only parties that will benefit from the exemption being removed are UK retailers, by shifting the burden of customs on UK citizens, and forcing them to consume UK retailer goods. This could cause catastrophic harm for small businesses and many citizens cannot be outspoken by the opinions of corporations. It could cause major delays in shipping times and delivery. People could be expected to pay \u00a314 (customs + courier handling fees) on an import that only cost them \u00a310, which we feel is distasteful.",
        "background": "In the Chancellor\u2019s budget, plans were announced to remove the \u00a3135 exemption by 2029, but many UK retailers are actively demanding this to be implemented sooner. The burden of this change could most affect UK citizens. Keep the \u00a3135 exemption and not put duties on goods under \u00a3135.",
