        "additional_details": "We think students are poorer than ever: many have little disposable income each week after rent, can live in terrible housing conditions, and face cuts to essential services on which they may depend. After university, they have debt which has increased due to rising tuition fees and what we see as an unfair payback system. We think the sector is falling apart, leading to worse education and support. Education is a public good and we think students and young people deserve better.",
        "background": "We urge parliament & government to increase investment in Higher Education, with the aim to eventually make it free. To have maintenance loans adjusted for inflation, and reintroduce maintenance grants. Income based graduate tax & rent control on purpose-built student housing.",
