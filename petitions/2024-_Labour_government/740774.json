        "additional_details": "The EHCP system is failing. Children\u2019s medical needs are being erased, deadlines ignored, and unsafe school placements forced. Families are left traumatised, with parents in constant fight-or-flight and children losing vital education. The law must change to protect children\u2019s health, safety, and futures, and to restore trust for families navigating SEND. The impact is long-lasting, just like Covid reshaped a generation, the SEND crisis is reshaping ours, only without acknowledgement or urgency.",
