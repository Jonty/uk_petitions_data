        "additional_details": "I think that if you block a phone number, they shouldn't be able to contact you again. It's an invasion of privacy and blocking a phone number means you don't want to talk to that person any more. The fact that they can still contact you through No caller ID mode on their mobile phone defeats the whole point of being able to block somebody. No caller ID should be made illegal for people's privacy and could also help to stop bullying within teenagers/ adolescent people.",
