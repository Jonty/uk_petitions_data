        "additional_details": "My cat Nala, well known locally as the station cat, was hit by a vehicle and tragically died. I don\u2019t know how long she lay there before being found, though a local business tried their best to help her. It makes little sense that cats - often similar in size to dogs and other animals that must be reported are excluded. The Road Traffic Act 1988 is outdated for modern pet ownership. With 230,000+ cats hit each year, requiring drivers to stop and report could save lives and prevent heartbreak.",
        "background": "Require an amendment to the Road Traffic Act 1988 so cats are treated like other reportable animals. Motorists involved in a collision with a cat must stop, provide assistance, take the cat to a vet if possible, and report the incident to the police.",
