        "additional_details": "I\u2019m on maternity leave, they\u2019ve been so many times this year where I haven\u2019t felt like myself and I honestly don\u2019t know what I would have done without the creche. It gives me the opportunity to look after and prioritise my mental and physical health whilst my daughter is getting top year care. \r\nNot everybody has a village or a community around them, but by taking the service away you\u2019ll be taking that village from me and so many other parents like me.\r\nPlease, please do not close it.",
        "background": "The Creche is currently listed as a potential closure to save money for Warrington Council, the saving would be \u00a333K per year. Parents/carers have already advised they're happy for costs to increase, without it these parents wouldn't have access to the gym and the mental and physical heath benefits!",
