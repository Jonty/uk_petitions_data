        "action": "Grant UK Healthcare Workers Freedom to Choose Their Employers",
        "additional_details": "Our job in healthcare is already demanding, with long work hours and low pay. Being bound to one visa-sponsoring employer worsens the situation. The right to work is enshrined in Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which includes the right to free choice of employment. No one should be tied to an employer, particularly when their rights are jeopardised and their well-being is at risk.\u00a0We urgently need a change in policy to protect care workers rights and dignity at work.",
        "background": "The current system that ties care workers to a single employer is exposing many to potential abuses and exploitation, including low wages, insufficient break times, and poor working conditions. On top of that, there is the stress of long commutes due to the scarcity of visa-sponsoring employers.",
