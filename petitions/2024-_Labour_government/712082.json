        "additional_details": "Tewksbury council use a blue bin that all the recycling going into, much more room and less likely to blow away in the wind.\r\nI have watched Gloucester council recycling go into the same compartment of the lorry so why do we separate the different recycling? \r\nIf you buy a tv or a fridge there is no chance of folding the cardboard into the blue bag. \r\nIf recycling is easy everyone will do it, so make it easy and just have one bin for it all to go into.",
        "background": "Recycling boxes and bags are useless, the lids provided are flimsy and if you have lots of recycling you can\u2019t put them on. The boxes are left on the side of the road and when windy rubbish gets blown everywhere. The bags for cardboard are tiny and won\u2019t hold much. Let\u2019s just have a bin.",
