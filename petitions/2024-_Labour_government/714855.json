Further to this, around 300 of these greyhounds die each year from injuries caused by racing. \r\nThis is a greedy industry, used to exploit these innocent animals and only furthers the addiction of gambling.  There is an abundance of greyhounds that need rehoming after their racing \"career\" across all well known adoption centres, as well as their own independent centres, specifically for greyhounds.",
        "background": "I want greyhound racing to be banned within UK.\r\nCurrently there are still 19 Greyhound centres within the UK and approximately 7000-8000 greyhounds registered annually to race.",
