        "additional_details": "Currently, only British, Irish, or Commonwealth citizens can vote in national elections, excluding millions of permanent residents who contribute to society, pay taxes, and participate in community life. Granting them the right to vote would strengthen democratic representation, promote integration, and ensure decisions affecting them are made with their input, not by third parties.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to amend national electoral law to grant all migrants with permanent residency in England the right to vote in national elections, ensuring they have a voice in decisions that affect them and highlighting equality before the law.",
