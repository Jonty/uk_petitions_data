        "additional_details": "Why This is Critical:\r\n\r\n1. Mental Health Crisis: Social media use in kids is linked to anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. Setting a minimum age gives children time to develop healthy self-perception before facing online pressures.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Cognitive Development: Social media disrupts focus, social skills, and offline engagement. Restricting access helps kids grow in healthier environments.\r\n\r\nThis policy shields children from stress and harmful influences, fostering a generation better prepared for life\u2019s challenges. Sign to protect our youth.",
        "background": "We call on the government to follow Australia\u2019s lead and ban children under 16 from accessing social media. Platforms expose kids to risks like cyberbullying, harmful content, and addiction, fueling anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem.",
