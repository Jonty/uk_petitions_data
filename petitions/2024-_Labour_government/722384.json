        "additional_details": "Recent trends suggest reinterpretations that impose modern ideological lenses, risking the erosion of their historical and artistic integrity. Stratford, as the heart of Shakespeare\u2019s heritage, should remain a place where his works are celebrated as written, not altered to fit contemporary political narratives. This preserves their value for future generations and respects their global significance.  \r\n\r\nWe request that the government support institutions like the Royal Shakespeare Company and Stratford\u2019s cultural bodies to maintain authentic presentations of his works, rejecting funding or policies that prioritise decolonisation over fidelity to the original texts. Shakespeare belongs to all humanity\u2014let\u2019s keep him untainted by division.",
        "background": "We urge the British government to ensure that William Shakespeare\u2019s works and legacy in Stratford-upon-Avon remain free from efforts to \"decolonise\" them. Shakespeare\u2019s plays are a cornerstone of British culture and a universal exploration of human nature, not a colonial artifact to be reframed.",
