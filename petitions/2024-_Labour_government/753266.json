        "background": "The Bread and Flour (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2024 will require flour millers to fortify non-wholemeal wheat flour with folic acid. \r\nThe people who have signed this petition demand that this act is repealed, or at the very least a referendum is held so the public may choose for themselves.",
