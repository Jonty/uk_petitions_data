        "additional_details": "The UK is often described as a voluntary union of 4 nations. Of these, we think Northern Ireland has the most clearly codified route to leave. We see this as a democratic imbalance, and a political inequality. Without legal clarity we believe the Union risks becoming permanent by law not by consent, and that the outcome would contradict the Good Friday Agreement.  Even the EU has Article 50 to uphold consent.",

We believe that without a more clearly codified exit route, the Union could risk becoming involuntary. We think this could undermine democracy and breach the UK\u2019s international obligations.",
