        "additional_details": "Private users and businesses using electric vehicles often use the public network to go to clients, patients, family members, public or private visits, etc. I believe a reduction in the VAT rate would make it fairer in terms of taxation as the electricity consumed on public posts is taxed at a higher rate than charging the vehicle at home. That reduction could help thousands of drivers and companies with a expense that is quite significant and also promote the transition to EVs",
