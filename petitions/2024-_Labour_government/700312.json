        "additional_details": "Currently non-binary people are not recognised in UK law. This means that we have no choice but to choose either male or female gender markers on government IDs and in many other institutional settings. This can lead to constant misgendering. Therefore, we think the government should legally recognise non-binary people to allow us to be seen as our true gender by society and to help us feel more respected in everyday life. We think that this would be in line with fundamental British values.",
        "background": "Many non-binary people in the UK currently feel invisible and ignored. Therefore, we think this government should seek to reform the Gender Recognition Act 2004 so that it extends legal recognition to a third, non-binary gender.",
