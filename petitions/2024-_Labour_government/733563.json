        "additional_details": "The county in which I live, Surrey, has been overwhelmed by green belt planning applications since green belt was de-proritised by government, leaving a wide range of brown and grey belt opportunities untouched. This is not surprising: of course developers would prefer a virgin site in a beautiful area over something less attractive and perhaps requiring more work. As the tower blocks of the 1960s blighted lives, so too would the wholesale development of green belt land",
        "background": "To enact in law that green belt development applications will be refused if there is no quantifiable & demonstrable local housing need or where brown/grey site alternatives are available within reasonable commuting distance; with the mandatory prioritisation of grey/brown field land over green belt",
