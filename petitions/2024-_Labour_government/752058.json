        "additional_details": "The Government should maintain the current 5-year route to ILR as promised for people already on the skilled worker visa. We have structured our lives around this commitment, and contribute significantly to the UK economy. Changing the terms mid-way is unfair and also impact our mental health. The skilled worker visa promises that after five years of hard work, dedication, and integration, one would qualify for ILR. To alter this promise disrupts lives and can have long-term negative impacts.",
        "background": "Government should keep to their promises. Hence, they must keep the current 5-year route to Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) for people who are already on skilled worker visa as earlier promised and restrict access to government benefits for ILR holders until they transition to British citizenship.",
