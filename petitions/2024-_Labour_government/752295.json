        "additional_details": "Cheapest EV biased home electric tariff (Octopus Go) is 6.5p per unit assuming you have access to a charger at home. \r\n\r\nAverage EV achieves 4 miles per unit which is 1.6p per mile. Compared to ICE vehicles wavering at 10p+ per mile, it's a small incentive to switch. Adding 3p per mile increases this to 4.6p. Suddenly the incentive is diminished. \r\n\r\nOn 12000 miles per year this adds \u00a3360 to your tax bill with no limit. \r\nTaxi drivers average 46500 miles per year, that is \u00a31395.",
        "background": "The UK Government is planning on introducing a scheme whereby owners of Electric and Hybrid vehicles are going to be charged per mile travelled. Myself and many other EV and Hybrid vehicle owners including businesses feel this is is a disproportionate tax on environmentally friendly means of travel.",
