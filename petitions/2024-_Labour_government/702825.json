The BBC needs to be scrapped, sold off or moved on to subscription if they want to continue. This unfair tax, needs to be blocked now. If the BBC want to continue to remain a fta service then they need to up there game, start making programmes that are not all about crime,  cancer, and the awful things of life that we turn to tv to forget.",
        "background": "This outdated tax was set up in the 1920s to pay for the national and international network after the first world war as there were very little funds available from the government. Here we are 100 years later, when we have commercial tv, subscription channels, and Satellite tv available,",
