        "additional_details": "This could include stricter enforcement against illegal breeders and stronger legislation to ensure all dogs are bred in environments that prioritise their health and welfare.\r\n\r\nPuppy farming subjects dogs to extreme cruelty, with breeding dogs confined in horrific conditions. Puppies can suffer from genetic disorders, disease, and psychological trauma. We think puppy farming contributes to behavioural problems, including aggression and the rise in dog bites. We think now is the time for a full ban to end this inhumane practice and safeguard both animal welfare and public safety.",
        "background": "We urge the government to introduce legislation to stop and ban all forms of puppy farming, ending the mass breeding of dogs in cruel, profit-driven conditions.",
