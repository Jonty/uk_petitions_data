        "additional_details": "We think missed GP appointments are wasting valuable resources and increasing wait times for others in need. Each missed slot represents lost time and potential care for patients facing long waits. By introducing a small fine, we think the Government can encourage people to attend or cancel responsibly, freeing up appointments and helping to reduce strain on the healthcare system. We think this would improve access, ensure fair use of NHS resources, and promote a more efficient healthcare system.",

Missed slots waste time, increase wait times, and limit access for others. We think a small fine would encourage responsible use, free up appointments, and improve access to essential care.",
