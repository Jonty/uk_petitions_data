        "additional_details": "We think funding free 'I Voted' stickers at polling stations can inspire more people to participate in elections. We believe these stickers serve as a visible reminder of civic duty and could increase voter turnout, and can also foster conversations about voting and create a sense of community pride. With declining voter engagement in the UK, we think this small but meaningful step could positively impact democracy and make voting more engaging and memorable for citizens.",

We think these stickers have proven successful elsewhere and can encourage turnout and foster a sense of community. We think it's a simple, effective way to make voting a more positive experience.",
