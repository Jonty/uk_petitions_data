        "additional_details": "The Blackwall Tunnel has always been free, so introducing a charge now is unfair to those who rely on it daily. Many commuters and businesses have no alternative, meaning this toll is effectively a tax on travel. If the Silvertown Tunnel needs funding, a temporary charge could be an option, but once it\u2019s paid off, both tunnels should be free. Adding a permanent charge will only increase costs for hardworking people and could push more traffic onto already congested routes, making the problem worse.",
        "background": "The government to stop the Blackwall and Silvertown tunnel charge. Blackwall has never had a toll\u2014why introduce it now? If Silvertown needs funding, charge only until it\u2019s paid off, then make it free. This avoids burdening commuters, businesses, and residents while ensuring costs are covered fairly.",
