        "action": "Ask King Charles to dissolve parliament and force a general election.",
        "additional_details": "The current government lacks public confidence and is failing to address major challenges such as the cost of living crisis, healthcare pressures, and illegal immigration, including unsecure borders. By calling a general election, King Charles can empower citizens to select a government better aligned with the nation\u2019s priorities. This decisive action will uphold democratic principles and ensure the UK moves forward with leadership that reflects the will of its people.",
        "background": "We want King Charles to exercise his constitutional power to dissolve Parliament and call for a general election. This will allow the public to decide who leads the country during this critical time, ensuring renewed trust, accountability, and a mandate to address urgent national issues.",
