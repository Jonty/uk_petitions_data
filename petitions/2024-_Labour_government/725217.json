        "additional_details": "There have been multiple debates and advice given on how to stop an off-leash dog from attacking your own, but these do not go far enough. \r\n\r\nIf a dog-walker is confident with the dog they are accompanying, why should it be on them to go out of their way to make excuses and be put in discomfort for other poorly-behaved dogs?\r\n\r\nCurrent legislation is lacking, and more must be done to achieve justice and better support for victims and their loved ones.",
        "background": "Harsher legal consequences should be met for those who own aggressive and out-of-control dogs that attack, for example, reviewing dog ownership and breeding bans. \r\n\r\nVictim support like compensation for emotional distress should also be available.",
