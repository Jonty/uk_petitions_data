We think large-scale CCS is being advanced at speed despite major gaps in transparency, regulation, and public consultation.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to pause all UK offshore CO\u2082 storage projects until a full independent safety, environmental and legal assessment is completed. Some research suggests that injecting impure CO\u2082 can risk acid formation, toxic metal release, and long-term damage to marine ecosystems and aquifers.",
