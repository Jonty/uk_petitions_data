        "additional_details": "A wealth tax could raise large amounts of money while taxing only the wealthiest few percent, matching the government's desire that those with the broadest shoulders should bear the heaviest burdens. We believe this could allow greater government investment and we think this would be widely supported by the public and would not be breaking manifesto pledges. Various respected bodies have advocated for this and the government has the ability to analyse and implement their work which we believe could improve all our lives.",
        "background": "We believe the government should study the practicalities of a tax on wealth. This should include studying wealth taxes internationally and the work of think tanks, to consider appropriate thresholds and percentages. This could also consider an exit tax designed to reduce tax avoidance.",
