This forces caregivers to choose between income and presence. We urge government to support term-time contracts, flexible hours, remote work, and childcare stipends\u2014especially for face-to-face roles\u2014to protect family bonds, mental health, and equity for working parents.",

This would ease childcare pressure, protect family wellbeing, promote fair access to work for parents. No more of Income or presence?",
