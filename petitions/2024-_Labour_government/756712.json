        "additional_details": "Many migrants struggle with high living expenses, including rent, transport, childcare etc. We feel IHS fees place them under extreme pressure, forcing some into debt, delaying renewals, or even falling into irregular status through no fault of their own.\r\n \r\nParents may be forced to choose between paying IHS fees and meeting basic household needs such as food. Changing this could strengthen social cohesion, reduce poverty, and uphold the UK\u2019s values of fairness and opportunity for all.",
        "background": "We believe the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) is causing severe financial harm to migrants and their families. At present, the standard IHS fee is \u00a31,035 per year. For a 10-year visa, this amounts to \u00a310,350. We believe migrants working and paying taxes should be exempt from paying the IHS.",
