        "additional_details": "1. We believe visa holders contribute significantly to the UK economy and pay taxes and NI.\r\n2. Many wish to take additional part-time work to support their families.\r\n3. We believe allowing secondary work could reduce illegal working and give them the same flexibility available to UK citizens and permanent residents.\r\n4. We believe it could benefit the economy with higher tax revenues.\r\n5. We believe delivery accounts may not be misused, and visa holders may agree on paying extra tax if they earn extra wages.\r\n",
        "background": "We call on the Government to allow Skilled Worker visa holders to undertake unrestricted secondary work, including self-employment and gig economy roles such as food delivery and private hire driving, that would only be allowed outside their primary sponsored working hours.",
