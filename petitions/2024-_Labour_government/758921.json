        "additional_details": "The government should do it as many young people are eager to get on the road, reduce their burden on their parents and have a small amount of ownership and responsibility. Another reason is that it has already been proven by 7 eu countries that the 14 year old age requirement is working and makes more sense having then had 3 years of road experience before then moving onto a bigger motorbike or car",
