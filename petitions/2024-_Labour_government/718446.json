        "additional_details": "In addition there needs to be a full public audit of how the billions of taxpayers\u2019 money already committed to Ukraine has been used.\r\n\r\nAlso those promoting wars, and those who seek taxpayers' money for wars without a vote of the people, must provide the people with regular substantive evidence that the money is being properly used and is not being used to enrich those who promote wars or those who seek taxpayers\u2019 money for war.",
        "background": "Instead of sending billions of UK taxpayers\u2019 money to Ukraine, we should commit those billions over a 100-year deal to the NHS and build state of the art hospitals, rather than exacerbate alleged \u2018black holes\u2019 in our public finances from our funding of foreign wars.",
