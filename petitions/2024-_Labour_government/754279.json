        "additional_details": "Exporting our recycling frequently shifts pollution to communities with fewer safeguards. Investigations show our waste ending up in rivers, open dumps, and informal burning sites in developing countries. This damages ecosystems, harms public health, and undermines trust in our recycling. We should process, recycle, or reuse our waste domestically or through environmentally robust OECD partners with strong enforcement guards.",
        "background": "The Government should ban the export of all recyclable waste (including plastics, paper metals, and mixed recyclables) to non-OECD countries, where weak regulation and limited waste-management infrastructure often result in dumping, open burning, or environmental harm.",
