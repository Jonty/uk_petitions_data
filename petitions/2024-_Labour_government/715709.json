        "additional_details": "We think extending VAT exemption would promote equity, health, and fairness in sports.\r\n\r\nVAT on period swimwear and sportswear limits access for women and girls, with 71% avoiding sports during their periods and 43% dropping out after primary school. Marginalised communities are especially affected, with 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children not swimming. Removing VAT could make these products affordable, enabling participation, reducing stigma, and promoting fairness. Tampons and pads are already VAT-free; it\u2019s time to extend this exemption to period swimwear and sportswear.",
        "background": "We want the Government to remove the 20% VAT on period swimwear and sportswear. We think these essential products are unfairly taxed as luxury items, creating barriers for women and girls to stay active during their periods. ",
