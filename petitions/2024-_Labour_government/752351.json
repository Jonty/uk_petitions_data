        "additional_details": "Despite being human rights zealots, David Lammy and Keir Starmer are politicising the courts with plans to remove the right to trial by a jury of our peers. This is the most important human right we have.\r\n\r\nWithout jury trials, defendants will be subject to a form of two tier justice that is akin to George Orwells 1984. It cannot be allowed.\r\n\r\nThis is the greatest attack on British democracy in history. It is anti-British and will also cost the taxpayer in legal challenges.",
        "background": "David Lammy and the Labour Government should desist from their plans to remove the rights of British citizens that have existed for over 800 years.",
