        "additional_details": "I believe the Government should maintain the 5-year ILR route for people who already came to the UK legally and were granted refugee status because these individuals have built their lives around the current rules. They followed every legal step, passed all checks, and have been working hard to integrate, study, and contribute to the UK. Changing the settlement pathway midway would create uncertainty, disrupt families, and reduce trust in the system.",
        "background": "The government should keep the 5-year ILR route for people who already came to the UK through legal channels and have been granted refugee status. These individuals have planned their lives based on the existing system, followed all rules, and are already integrating and contributing.",
