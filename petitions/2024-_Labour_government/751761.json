        "additional_details": "Altering their pathway after approval or after submission would undermine the principles of legal certainty, legitimate expectation, and non-retroactivity, which are fundamental to UK administrative and immigration.\r\nThis approach is consistent with the UK\u2019s Human Rights Act, including protections for private and family life under Article 8 ECHR, and with the long-standing UK commitment that policy changes should not destabilise those who have already acted in good faith under previous rules.",
        "background": "We request that the UK Government ensure the newly announced asylum and immigration rules are not applied retrospectively to individuals who already hold refugee status. Refugees are relied on the UK\u2019s previously published rules, including the 5-year route to Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR).",
