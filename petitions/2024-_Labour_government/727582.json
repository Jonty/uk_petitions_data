        "additional_details": "These individuals form the backbone of many essential services and have made long-term life decisions\u2014financial, familial, and professional\u2014based on the current 5-year settlement framework.\r\nThey make vital contributions to the country\u2014especially in the care sector, where chronic staffing shortages make their work essential to the wellbeing of vulnerable people.\r\nMany have committed to the UK in good faith, planning their futures on the 5-year path to ILR that is now under threat.",
        "background": "We therefore urge the UK Government to:\r\nWithdraw the proposal to increase the ILR qualifying period from 5 to 10 years. \r\nGuarantee that all legal migrants currently in the UK\u2014including those on Health and Care Worker visas\u2014remain eligible for visa extensions and settlement under the existing rules",
