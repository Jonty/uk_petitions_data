        "additional_details": "Women across the UK face an unacceptable level of risk in everyday life. Despite repeated assurances, violent crime particularly against women remains a serious and ongoing concern. \r\n\r\nMany women feel unsafe walking alone, travelling at night, or simply going about their daily lives. \r\n\r\nCurrently, UK law prohibits women from carrying pepper spray, leaving them legally defenceless while expecting them to rely solely on after-the fact policing and prosecution. \r\n\r\nThis needs to change!!!",
        "background": "Review current legislation on self-defence weapons\r\nLegalise the carrying of pepper spray for women for personal self-defence.\r\n\r\nIntroduce sensible regulations, and guidance!\r\n\r\nPut women\u2019s safety first by giving them lawful, practical means to protect themselves.",
