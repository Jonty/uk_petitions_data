Cars don\u2019t have a fixed decibel limit in the regulations, but it\u2019s illegal to modify their exhaust systems to increase noise beyond the original type approval, and police can act if the silencer is defective or the vehicle is excessively loud.\r\n\r\nIf you want changes to this, you could start a petition about that. \r\n\r\nYou may wish to sign the following petition:\r\n\r\nFund system to test if motorbike noise is over the legal limit in urban areas\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/734189"
