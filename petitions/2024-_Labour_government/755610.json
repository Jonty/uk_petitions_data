        "additional_details": "The Government is expanding prevention work in schools under its VAWG strategy, including content on consent and misogyny. We welcome this, but we feel the approach must be fair and complete. ONS data estimates that 1.5 million men experienced domestic abuse in 2025, and 2 million men were victims of domestic abuse, sexual assault/stalking. If we're teaching young people how to treat each other, we should teach one consistent standard: respect, consent, and zero tolerance for abuse, regardless of gender.",
        "background": "Amend the Government\u2019s statutory guidance for schools on misogyny and violence against women and girls to also focus on tackling misandry and helping male victims. Guidance should state that: abuse is wrong, consent matters, online hate / harassment are unacceptable, and any pupil can be a victim.",
