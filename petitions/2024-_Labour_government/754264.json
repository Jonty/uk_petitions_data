        "additional_details": "When we make a purchase, it's not just about the price or the product, it's about trusting that what we've paid for will arrive safely and on time. Yet, the reality is that some courier companies consistently fail to meet these expectations. We deserve the right to make informed decisions about whom we trust with our purchases. We want the government to legally mandate that online sellers and service providers should clearly disclose the courier service responsible for delivering our items before payment is made.",
        "background": "Every day, countless consumers across the country are frustrated by failed delivery attempts, undelivered packages, or damaged/lost goods. We believe this frustration arises from a lack of transparency during online transactions, specifically about the couriers tasked with delivering our purchases.",
