        "additional_details": "Greater flexibility for families to spend quality time together.\r\n\r\nReduced financial strain, as families could avoid inflated travel costs during peak seasons.\r\n\r\nLess pressure on travel, tourism, & childcare sectors caused by peek holidays.\r\n\r\nImproved work-life balance & mental well-being for parents & children alike.\r\n\r\nI believe this proposal would better reflect modern family needs, enhance equality for working parents, & support a more balanced approach to education & family life.",
        "background": "Replace fixed terms with a flexible model, similar to a workplace. Schools would retain a traditional 2wks at Christmas & 1wk at Easter. Each child would be allocated an additional 10 days flexible leave a year, to be taken at any time. This flexibility would not apply during GCSE years 10 and 11.",
