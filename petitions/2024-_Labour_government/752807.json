This figure highlights the enormous contribution carers make to society, yet many receive no meaningful financial recognition for their work. Thousands of carers, including those who have provided long-term care report that this rule is unfair, harmful, and forces families into hardship.\r\nEnding the deduction would seriously improve their lives",
