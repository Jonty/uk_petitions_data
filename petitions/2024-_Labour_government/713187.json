        "additional_details": "Without doubt as you will understand that Working for the education comes with its own challenges and stress.   Especially people Working with children with additional needs.  You know the pay is not that great &  job very challenging.  If they cannot afford to unwind (which they truly need & deserve) due to term time extortionate prices.  The government will lose staff in this sector,  which I'm sure there already is a huge vacum.  This will help staff to relax and an incentive to stay",
        "background": "I would like the government to introduce subsidised holiday package for all the staff members working in the education system. Working for the education system doesn't give us the luxury to enjoy the non-term deals that all travel companies introduce once the busy holidays are finished.",
