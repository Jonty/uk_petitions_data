        "additional_details": "We think that wearing jogging bottoms, leggings, t-shirts, sweatshirts and trainers would be cheaper, more comfortable, more practical and more easily washable than current school uniforms. Children would be better able to walk to school and go out and play at breaktimes, thus potentially getting more exercise and helping get cars off the roads.\r\n \r\nMany workplaces do not expect a shirt and tie so why do we ask children to follow a fashion that we think is out of date. Please can the Government update the non-statutory guidance for schools to ensure uniform expectations are modernised.",
        "background": "Why are we expecting children to wear school uniforms that are often impractical for school? Many school uniforms require a tie, blazer and formal shoes - all of which could be impractical for getting to and for doing many activities at school. ",
