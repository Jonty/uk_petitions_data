        "additional_details": "Large-scale NHS redundancies risk worsening patient care as waiting lists already breach targets, with over 7.8 million waiting and many over a year. Admin staff coordinate surgeries, clinics, and follow-up care \u2014 without them, delays, cancellations, and errors will rise. Cutting loyal, long-serving teams deepens burnout, damages morale, and amid high unemployment, forces many into poverty, housing loss, or reliance on benefits \u2014 hurting both patients and communities the NHS is meant to serve.",
        "background": "NHS runs on more than doctors and nurses ,admin and support staff are its backbone. They coordinate care, manage operations, and support patients every step. Redundancies devalues decades of dedication and harms patient care. Protect them to protect our NHS. Stop the redundancies, find a better way.",
