        "action": "Raise the minimum wage across the UK and keep pace with inflation",
        "additional_details": "We think the UK government must raise the minimum wage to address widespread financial struggles. We feel that the current NLW fails to cover basic expenses, trapping low-wage workers in poverty and forcing reliance on public assistance. We believe that a higher minimum wage could stimulate economic growth by boosting consumer spending and benefiting young and precarious workers. We think it's a matter of social justice, ensuring fair compensation for hard work and promoting economic stability for all.",
        "background": "We think the government should commit to raising the National Living Wage (NLW) to better reflect the actual cost of living. This could involve not just a nominal increase, but a substantial rise that keeps pace with inflation and ensures that low-wage workers can afford basic necessities.",
