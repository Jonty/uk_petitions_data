        "additional_details": "We are concerned that many dogs may be mislabelled and misidentified due to the vague requirements. Many breeds stand over 19 inches and we believe they shouldn't be victimised. Some owners of large dogs fear their dog may be misidentified due to the guidelines\u2019 vagueness. We believe a maximum height would stop this for many large breed owners. We believe the vagueness of the criteria may lead to innocent dogs such as Labrador mixed breeds being victims as well as other large breeds.",
