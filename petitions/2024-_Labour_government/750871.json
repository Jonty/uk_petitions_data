        "action": "Make police check CCTV if witnesses report a convicted abuser near a victim",
        "additional_details": "I want this change because victims with protective orders are placed at risk when police choose not to review CCTV, even when witnesses report seeing a convicted abuser nearby. This can mean breaches go unchecked and victims are pushed into costly court action. Making CCTV review mandatory would improve safeguarding, help ensure breaches are properly investigated, and give victims and children greater protection.",
        "background": "I want the Government to make it mandatory for police to review CCTV whenever witnesses report a convicted domestic abuser near a victim protected by an order. Police should check footage that could confirm or rule out a breach, improving safety and enforcement.",
