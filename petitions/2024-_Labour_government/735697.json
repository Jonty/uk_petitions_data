        "additional_details": "I want this because unfair contact denial harms fathers\u2019 and children\u2019s mental health. When dads are cut off without cause, it causes lasting pain. Changing the law will protect families, reduce suffering, and ensure children grow up with both parents\u2019 love and support.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to introduce a legal presumption of shared parenting after separation, giving both parents equal rights to remain in their child\u2019s life \u2014 unless clear safeguarding risks exist. Children deserve both parents. No loving father should be shut out without cause.",
