        "additional_details": "A People\u2019s Vote of No Confidence in the Labour government is essential. Promised reforms in health, housing, and education have stalled or vanished. Economic policy lacks substance, focusing on tax hikes over growth. Immigration remains unmanaged, with failing legal routes and rising irregular entries. Public services are still in crisis, and strikes persist. Labour\u2019s centralisation of power and weak delivery demand accountability. The public must demand urgent change through a vote.",
        "background": "A People\u2019s Vote of No Confidence in the Labour government is vital. With crises mounting and public trust eroding, we cannot wait four more years. This vote lets UK people demand Labour change course and listen. It\u2019s time to hold them accountable.",
