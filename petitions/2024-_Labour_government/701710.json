        "additional_details": "Impact of Smoking Breaks on Staff and Patient Care:\r\nIn high-pressure environments like Accident & Emergency (A&E), smoking breaks, though essential for staff welfare, can disrupt patient care by causing delays and increasing wait times. These brief absences from duty may affect the timely response to urgent patient needs, reducing care efficiency. Additionally, non-smoking staff may feel disadvantaged, as they are expected to remain at their posts while colleagues take unscheduled breaks. This creates an imbalance in work-life equity, with non-smokers shouldering more continuous responsibility. Addressing this issue requires balancing staff wellbeing with maintaining a consistent, fair work environment for all team members.",
        "background": "Current smoking policies for both staff members and patients within hospital specifically related to smoking during working hours and the allowances for patients to smoke while admitted. I believe these practices may be having a negative impact on both patient care and the overall work environment.",
