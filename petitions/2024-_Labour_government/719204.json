        "additional_details": "The Tower of London moat was emptied in 1843 as it was stagnant and a vector for disease. The tower is no longer a military garrison but is now a tourist attraction and symbol of the nation that attracts nearly 3 million visitors a year. \r\n\r\nRefilling the moat would be a viral moment for Britain, attract tourists to the capital and make the Tower look even more epic. \r\n\r\nThe moat was filled with water for hundreds of years and should be restored to its original purpose.",
        "background": "Have the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport instruct the Historic Royal Palaces to conduct a feasibility and cost study on refilling the Tower of London moat with water and study how many extra tourists and revenue this would bring to the UK.",
