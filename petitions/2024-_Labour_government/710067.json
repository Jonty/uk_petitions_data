        "additional_details": "In March 2022, many Ukrainians were offered 3-year visas, due to expire in March 2025.\r\n\r\nWe're concerned that applications for extension can only be made when a visa has 28 days or less until expiry. Early applications risk rejection.\r\n\r\nIt's been reported that processing the extension can take 8 weeks. We think it creates uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThere is no clarity on options after the 18 months. The years many Ukrainians have spent here should count towards Indefinite Leave to Remain after 5 years, as it does for any other humanitarian route.",
        "background": "Since Feb 2025, Ukrainians and their eligible family members in the UK have been able to apply for further permission to remain for up to 18 months. We would like the extensions to be automatic and for the Government to set out a path to Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) for Ukrainians.",
