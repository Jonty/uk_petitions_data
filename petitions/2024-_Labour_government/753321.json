        "action": "Reject & remove plans to abolish jury trials for offences under 3year terms",
        "additional_details": "We ask Parliament to halt this reform, hold a full debate, and require any change to jury trial rights to be approved either by primary legislation with constitutional safeguards or by a national referendum. Jury trials protect a core liberty rooted in Magna Carta, and no government should alter this without direct public consent.",
        "background": "The Government plans to end jury trials for offences under three years, stripping citizens of their right to be judged by peers. This petition seeks the full rejection and removal of this proposal, which undermines open justice, concentrates state power, and weakens vital legal safeguards.",
