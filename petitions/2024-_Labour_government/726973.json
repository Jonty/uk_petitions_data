        "additional_details": "Neurodivergent children\u2014especially those with uh ADHD and autism\u2014are frequently misdiagnosed or completely missed. Failure to identify neurodivergence early can lead to self-medication, addiction, school exclusions, and prison. The NHS Long Term Plan commits to early intervention, yet implementation is failing. Routine screening would reduce A&E admissions, pressure on CAMHS, and future NHS costs. Prevention must start with early identification .Mandatory screening would lead to earlier support, prevent serious mental health decline, and save lives. No child in the system should be forced to survive. They should be thriving.",
        "background": "Many children are missed. My son Jader was only diagnosed with ADHD at 19. He died 8 months later. Early screening could save lives and prevent crisis.",
