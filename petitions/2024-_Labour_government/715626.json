We think that a 20 week timescale should be met in above 90% of cases. We believe that the Government should review why some local councils are not hitting the deadlines, what needs to change, do further resources need to be allocated, and if the 20 week timescale is realistic considering that this is already a long time for a child with extra needs or a disability to wait. We believe it shouldn\u2019t have to be a fight for parents. Please help our children!",
