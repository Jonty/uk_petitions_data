        "additional_details": "SKI MASKS are used by individuals who simply want to either hide their identity because they've committed or are going to commit a crime, or just make the public feel uncomfortable. Protests are rife with SKI MASKS & other face coverings that could be deemed offence to the general public. \r\n\r\nIt's time to stop wanna-be 'gangsters' & thugs from protecting their identity from wrong-doings & stop them making the public feel threatened & in danger.",
        "background": "The public feel threatened by people who wear ski masks and other face coverings to purposely 'protect their identity' but in reality these people are usually just avoiding getting caught for committing a crime. If not committing a crime they're simply making the public feel unsafe on the street",
