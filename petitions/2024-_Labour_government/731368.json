Patents of weaponry to not be public domain. Support for TIs of gangstalking. Regulations to protect people from extensive existing threats which are being ignored. Stop all neurotech that manipulates nervous system and mind from being commercialised. Follow Chile\u2019s example.",

We want public consultations so wider public views can be heard and reviewed. Stop forcing it on us when we have no human rights in place.",
