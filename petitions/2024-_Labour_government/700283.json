        "action": "Limit the Decibel Rating of Fireworks in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Loud fireworks cause severe distress to pets, wildlife, young children, the elderly and those with sensory sensitivities, including veterans with PTSD. \r\nBy capping the decibel rating of fireworks sold to the public, we can minimize harm while preserving the joy of celebrations. Louder fireworks should be restricted to licensed public displays, ensuring safe enjoyment for all while maintaining protection for our communities and environment.",
        "background": "This petition urges the UK government to limit the maximum decibel level of consumer fireworks to reduce noise pollution and its impact on vulnerable groups. A decibel limit for public use fireworks will ensure that celebrations can continue, while supporting the wellbeing of all members of society.",
