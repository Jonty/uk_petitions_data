We are constantly having to watch matches that are full of conservatory with VAR taking centre stage when it should be a relative bystander. The fans deserve better. We collectively pay huge sums to watch our teams, be that in stadiums or TV subscriptions. I think the government needs to seriously consider intervening. Thank you",
        "background": "Like many of us who live in the UK, the introduction of VAR was met with significant optimism. Correcting obvious refereeing mistakes, ruling out goals were clearly offside to name a couple. This appeared to be for the good of the game.",
