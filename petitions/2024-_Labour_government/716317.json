        "additional_details": "While regular school attendance is an important part of a child\u2019s education, penalising parents for taking children out of school during term time overlooks broader educational and family considerations. A more flexible approach, which takes into account individual circumstances, would provide a more balanced solution, supporting both the educational needs of the child and the well-being of the family.",
        "background": "There are several arguments that can be made in favour of not imposing penalties on parents who take their children out of school during term time. These points are based on educational theory, practical considerations, and the unique needs of individual families.",
