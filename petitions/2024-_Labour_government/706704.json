        "additional_details": "I ask the government to explain how financial and other resources will be allocated to palliative care, to not only help ensure a better system for the people receiving care but also for staff, who face ever more challenges. I think this would reduce the pressure on hospitals and give patients the dignity they deserve. I believe quality of life is paramount. I think this will ensure a detailed plan is given and with a timescale given. I think palliative care needs urgent attention.",
        "background": "After the historic vote on assisted dying in Parliament, I think the government urgently must set out a plan to improve palliative care. The assisted dying bill, even if signed into law, may not take effect for some time. I think this is too long for those with illness now.",
