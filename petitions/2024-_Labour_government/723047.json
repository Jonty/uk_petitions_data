        "additional_details": "One of the key factors driving this surge in rental prices is the persistent imbalance between supply and demand. A shortage of available rental properties, particularly in high-demand urban areas, has caused landlords to increase rent to capitalize on the limited housing stock. Moreover, government policies and economic factors, such as rising property taxes and the impact of the cost-of-living crisis, have further exacerbated the issue, pushing rental prices even higher.",
        "background": "The rising rent prices in the United Kingdom have reached an alarming and unsustainable level, presenting significant challenges for many households. Over the past few years, rental costs have surged at an unprecedented rate, far outpacing wage growth and inflation.",
