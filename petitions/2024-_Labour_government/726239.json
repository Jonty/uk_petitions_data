        "action": "Lower grade boundaries for GCSEs from 2026 exams",
        "additional_details": "Lowering the grade boundaries is crucial to address the significant challenges students have faced due to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which have resulted in gaps in knowledge and inconsistent learning experiences. Many students have struggled with remote learning and the lack of in-person support, leading to anxiety and diminished confidence in their academic abilities. By adjusting the grade boundaries, we can alleviate the pressure during exams and create a more equitable environment that allows students to demonstrate their true potential. This change would promote fairness and inclusivity in education, ensuring that all learners, regardless of their circumstances, have a genuine opportunity to succeed and thrive in their academic pursuits.",
        "background": "I urge the government to lower GCSE grade boundaries for all subjects starting in 2026 to establish a fairer assessment system that accurately reflects students' abilities and learning experiences.",
