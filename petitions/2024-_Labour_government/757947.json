        "additional_details": "Prong collars & Electric Shock collars are sometimes used on Dogs & Cats to control behaviour, as a punishment or used as part of training. Both collars inflict pain, fear & anxiety, leading, we believe, to potential physical injury (e.g. to the thyroid) & psychological damage, and they also can increase aggression leading to more bites & risk to the public. The Royal Kennel Club, British Veterinary Association, Dogs Trust, RSPCA, PDSA, Blue Cross, Battersea Dogs & Cats Home all support a ban.",

We believe they are inhumane, inflict pain, fear and anxiety leading to potential physical and psychological damage, while punishment tools can increase aggression leading to more bites and risk to the public.",
