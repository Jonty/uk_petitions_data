        "action": "Hold a National Referendum for the United Kingdom to rejoin the European Union.",
        "additional_details": "Since leaving the EU, the UK has faced higher trade barriers, labour shortages, rising costs for businesses, and reduced international influence. Many voters believe these consequences were not fully understood in 2016 and that circumstances have significantly changed. Holding a new referendum would allow the public to make an informed decision based on lived experience, strengthening democratic legitimacy and public trust in the country\u2019s future direction.",
        "background": "Brexit has reshaped the UK\u2019s economy, trade and global standing. Many feel the outcomes differ from expectations in 2016. A fresh, democratic choice would let voters assess real-world impacts and decide whether seeking EU membership best serves the country\u2019s future.",
