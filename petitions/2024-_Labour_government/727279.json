        "additional_details": "GCSEs are placing an immense strain on young people across the UK. The intense pressure to perform is causing rising levels of anxiety, depression, and even physical illness among students. I urge the Government to reform the current system to prioritise student health and well-being. No child should have to sacrifice their mental or physical health for academic achievement. It\u2019s time for a system that supports, not harms, the next generation",
        "background": "The current GCSE system places immense pressure on students, leading to severe mental and physical health issues. The government must reform the exams to prioritize student well-being and create a healthier, more supportive approach to education.",
