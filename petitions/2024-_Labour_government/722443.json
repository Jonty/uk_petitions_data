        "additional_details": "We would like to ensure transparent implementation and reporting, so funds directly support UK culture. UK museums attract millions of international visitors yearly, yet UK taxpayers help fund them. We believe a \u00a35 tourist entry fee could raise millions of pounds annually, reducing reliance on public funds. This could free up taxpayer money for the NHS, schools, and services while securing arts funding. Many countries charge tourists more \u2014 we believe it\u2019s time the UK did too, fairly and sustainably.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to require state-funded UK museums and galleries to charge all international tourists a \u00a35 entry fee, whilst keeping free access for UK residents. We would like this fee to go towards funding arts, museum upkeep, and cultural programs.",
