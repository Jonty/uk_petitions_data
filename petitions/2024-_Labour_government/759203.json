No more jeering and abuse. Answer the questions and no more insulting each other. It is, quite frankly, immature, embarrassing to the people of the country, and pathetic.",
        "background": "Parliament has become an embarrassment - name calling and insults instead of properly debating matters. People in power acting like children and refusing to answer actual questions. I would like MP\u2019s to be made to grow up and actually act like adults (especially in PM\u2019s question time)",
