That is not taking into account other healthcare workers.\r\n\r\nIt is a tragedy that we are losing healthcare staff in this way. This loss needs to be understood in depth, along with moral injury, safe staffing and psychological safety. Effective strategies and funding must be put in place to support staff and create accessible systems that are safe for staff and patients.",

To make recommendations to governing bodies and workplaces on how to reduce suicides and improve staff mental wellbeing, and ensure adequate funding is in place to carry out the recommendations adequately.",
