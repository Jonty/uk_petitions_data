        "additional_details": "I want Parliament/Government to protect fairness for current care workers by keeping the original 5-year ILR route. Many of us came under agreed terms, made long-term plans, and dedicated ourselves to supporting the UK\u2019s most vulnerable people. Changing the settlement pathway now is unfair and destabilising. The government must honour existing commitments and recognise our essential contributions.",
        "background": "Government must ensure fairness by keeping the original 5-year ILR route for current care workers. We have built our lives here, filled critical staffing gaps, and supported vulnerable people. Rules should not change retroactively for those already contributing.",
