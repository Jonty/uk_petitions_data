These accidents not only cause suffering to animals, but can also create dangerous situations for drivers. Children\u2019s mental well-being can also be affected when they witness such events. We think installing barriers would make roads safer for everyone and show that animal welfare is valued in our society.",

We think these barriers would prevent animals from entering the road, and could help reduce accidents, protect drivers, and save animals\u2019 lives.",
