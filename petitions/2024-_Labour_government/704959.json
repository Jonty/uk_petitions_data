        "additional_details": "When the \u00a32 bus fare cap was introduced in January 2020, it was vital for people across the country who rely on buses to get to work, attend medical appointments and visit family/friends.\r\n\r\nA \u00a31 increase may not seem like that much, but for daily commuters, it could mean up to an additional \u00a310 per week or \u00a3520 per year. This 50% fare increase will leave many people worse off and isolated from their friends/family and essential services.",
        "background": "We demand the \u00a32 fare cap remain permanent, not increased to \u00a33.\r\nAs a student, my weekly bus costs will rise from \u00a312 to \u00a318 after January 1st. I've already spent \u00a3100 on essential travel this academic year. A \u00a33 fare would severely impact low-income families and students, making the \u00a32 cap vital.",
