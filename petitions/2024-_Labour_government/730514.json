        "additional_details": "Currently, Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) goes into general government revenues and is not specifically allocated to road upkeep.\r\n \r\nMeanwhile, many British roads suffer from poor maintenance, potholes, and declining infrastructure. Many road users rightly expect that the taxes they pay for vehicle use should directly contribute to the condition and safety of the roads they travel on, without the cost of additional expenditure due to repairs on their cars from damage caused by pot holes which are unavoidable.",
        "background": "We call upon the Government to ringfence revenue from Vehicle Excise Duty (Vehicle Tax), with all monies raised to be solely used for the maintenance, repair, and improvement of Britain's roads.",
