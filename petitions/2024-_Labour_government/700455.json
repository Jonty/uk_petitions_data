        "additional_details": "I have an autistic child and from the end of October for 2 weeks my child will not sleep and and is terrified of the large booms that come from the many fireworks being let off. Having spoke online and also within my community, there are lots of families who support this request as they are in similar situations. It is cruel and it is traumatic to children who are autistic, have other similar disabilities and also to pets. They do not need to be that loud, they can still be enjoyed without the sudden loud triggering bangs. ",
