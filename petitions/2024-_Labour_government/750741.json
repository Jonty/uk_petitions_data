        "additional_details": "Losing a pet can cause the same pain as losing a family member, but the law still treats them as property. My dog, Bronson, died in a tragic incident, and I don\u2019t want any other family to experience this. I believe clear rules on catch pole use and strong legal recognition and protections for pets could help prevent avoidable harm and ensure proper accountability in the future. These reforms could be named Bronson's Law.",
        "background": "I ask the Government to review and reform the status of pets to recognise them in all cases as sentient family members and relatives, not chattel. Set out specific strict rules on using animal-control equipment like catch poles and strong penalties if negligence or force cause harm or death to pets.",
