        "action": "Keep refugees on the 5-year ILR route and stop plans to extend it to 10 years",
        "additional_details": "This change would have a serious impact on refugees who are building safe lives in the UK. Applying it to those already on the 5-year route would create uncertainty, disrupt work, healthcare, and family planning, undermine fairness, and diminish their hope and motivation. Any change should apply only to new arrivals, and the Government must consult legal and humanitarian experts to ensure a fair and humane policy.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to halt plans to raise refugees\u2019 ILR from 5 to 10 years. Any change must not affect those already on the 5-year route, to avoid disrupting lives, employment, healthcare, or family plans, and to uphold fairness and legal certainty.",
