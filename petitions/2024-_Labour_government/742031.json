        "additional_details": "Despite compulsory microchipping, many dogs are untraceable because chips link to outdated or incomplete records across multiple private databases. This fuels abandonment, illegal breeding, and cruelty, while making it harder to reunite strays with owners. A single DEFRA register, with keeper updates required by law, would close loopholes, improve welfare, and give authorities fast, reliable traceability in cases of neglect,and dangerous dog incidents.",
        "background": "Make all dog microchips linked to a single DEFRA-run database. Every change of keeper, rescue intake, or pound release must be logged by both parties. Keepers, rescues, and councils must maintain up-to-date records so every dog can be traced quickly.",
