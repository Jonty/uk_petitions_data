Many temporary traffic arrangements are poorly organised, interacting badly with other temporary lights, with permanent traffic management arrangements or sequenced poorly. A licence scheme for companies who wish to run temporary traffic lights could mitigate their negative impact on local traffic requirements and reduce the associated disruption.",
        "background": "Permanent traffic management is evaluated carefully prior to its introduction. Organisations who need to implement temporary measures for safety reasons should be able to show, on threat of loss of licence, that they will minimise traffic disruption and that the timetable for the work is feasible.",
