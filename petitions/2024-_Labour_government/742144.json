        "additional_details": "The HSE should produce rules, policies, enforcement, procedures, including all scheme costings and membership fees.\r\n\r\nA tragic gas explosion at a block of flats in 1968 led to the establishment of CORGI which later led to the Gas Safety Register, appointed by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Despite electrical tragedies caused by an electrical fault, yearly, it has been reported that electrical faults cause around 20,000 domestic fires, 70 deaths, and 350,000 injuries. We feel the government has failed to act to improve electrical safety and protect the public; we believe every electrical scheme must come under legal HSE legislation and control.",
