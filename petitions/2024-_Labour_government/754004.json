Whilst many charities exist to help with problems of nutrition and food poverty there is nothing which serves the needs of those who love food, cooking, and creativity but no longer have the opportunity to share and express that love. If there were a society such as I envisage it might alleviate problems of health, (both mental and physical), as well as mitigate social isolation and loneliness.",
