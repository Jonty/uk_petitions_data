        "additional_details": "Applying new immigration rules retrospectively to adversely affect Health and Care workers is unfair, especially where no crime or wrongdoing exists. Such action disrupts lives and undermines the principles of justice and equal treatment.\r\n\r\nThe Home Office\u2019s decision to place Health and Care workers on a 15-year route to settlement is discriminatory and destabilising. This segregation contradicts the Public Sector Equality Duty and disproportionately affects a workforce that sustains essential services. These workers only responded to the UK government call to help fill 217,000 healthcare vacancies (BBC report & ONS) after Covid and Brexit. They committed no offence.",
