        "additional_details": "I have experienced the dazzling effect of dipped LED headlights. These lights are far too bright on many British roads and motorways, particularly when there is no lighting gantries or similar, and cause a dazzling effect to oncoming drivers. This could cause serious accidents and injuries as these incredibly bright lights are becoming much more common. I hear many complaints from drivers across the country and I feel something must be done before something awful happens as a result.",
        "background": "Parliament should consider banning the use of or reducing the luminosity of modern LED headlights on motor vehicles, or introduce legislation to limit the brightness of such headlights.",
