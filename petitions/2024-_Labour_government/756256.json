        "additional_details": "We believe the current system of going to a website and then being redirected to another website to share your ID, or a likeness, puts users at greater risk of fraud or impersonation online because often, these third party companies are sending users data outside of the UK and EU. There's already been examples of data leaks as a result of this. We call on the Government to instead set up a central database and allow people to verify their age in exchange for a voucher which could be used online without their ID being stored.",
