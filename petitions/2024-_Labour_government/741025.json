        "additional_details": "Every UK citizen should have the right the free dental treatment. Dental treatment can be very expensive and ultimately without such treatment it can have long term adverse implications that actually could cost the NHS and government more to resolve and care for. Just because someone is working full time it does not mean that they can afford to pay, and actually quite often working individuals are worse off due to the lack of support.",
        "background": "During times such as the currently financial crisis many people including those who work full time are struggling to excess dentist treatment due to the cost. Make it free for all UK citizens to access.",
