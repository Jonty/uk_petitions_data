Dental treatment can be very expensive and ultimately without such treatment it can have long term adverse implications that actually could cost the NHS and government more to resolve and care for. Just because someone is working full time it does not mean that they can afford to pay, and actually quite often working individuals are worse off due to the lack of support.",
