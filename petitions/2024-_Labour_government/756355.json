        "additional_details": "Many airlines charge cancellation fees even minutes after booking, weeks before departure\u2014often exceeding the ticket price. With near-zero digital processing costs, we think these fees are disproportionate and unjustifiable. This practice harms consumers and demands government protection; introducing fairer consumer regulations is paramount.",
        "background": "Introduce a regulation framework in respect of flight cancellation fees charged by airlines for flights to and/or from the UK, which is currently very unfair to the consumers. A cooling off period where no cancellation fee is incurred should be introduced for all UK flights and ticket types.",
