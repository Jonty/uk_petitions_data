        "additional_details": "Police officers are leaving the profession at an alarming rat, and a growing number are struggling with severe stress, trauma, burnout and mental health crisis. Tragically, some officers have taken their own lives. Officers regularly deal with traumatic incidents, violence, sudden deaths and distressing situations, yet often feel they have little or no meaningful support. \r\n\r\nSupporting police mental health is essential for officer safety, public safety, and the long term health of policing.",
        "background": "I want the Government to ensure all police forces in the UK provide:\r\n- Guaranteed access to free, confidential mental health support.\r\n- Mandatory annual and post-incident wellbeing checks. \r\n- Policies that protect officers from stigma or negative career impact when they seek help.",
