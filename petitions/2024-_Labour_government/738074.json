        "additional_details": "Nut allergies are one of the few airborne allergies that can be fatal. The micro particles that are in the air in confined areas such as aeroplanes and airport areas can cause anaphylaxis, often on board with limited medical help. This can be easily avoided by banning all nuts being served, eaten or brought into airports and planes. There have been many situations recently that were entirely avoidable and will increase the safety of passengers who are effected by this allergy.",
