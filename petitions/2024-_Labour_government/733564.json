        "action": "Add Asthma to NHS Prescription Charge Exemption List",
        "additional_details": "Currently, a single prescription can cost around \u00a380, placing a financial burden on people who rely on it daily to manage their health. The NHS is moving away from prescribing salbutamol due to environmental concerns, but the new recommended alternatives such as Fostair are significantly more expensive for patients paying out of pocket and often come with a short shelf life, making them even less accessible. No one should be forced to ration their medication or risk their health because of cost.",
        "background": "The British government should make asthma medications like Fostair available for free, as they are essential and often lifesaving for those living with chronic respiratory conditions.",
