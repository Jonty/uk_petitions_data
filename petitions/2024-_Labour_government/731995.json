        "background": "As UK heatwaves worsen, staff must often work in unsafe high temperatures. Unlike the legal minimum, there\u2019s no set maximum. We call for a legal max (e.g. 30\u00b0C, or 27\u00b0C for strenuous work) and mandatory measures like air con, ventilation and cooling breaks to protect workers\u2019 health.",
