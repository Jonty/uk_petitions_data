Many of these women likely would not have been sent for a colposcopy had there not been changes detected in their smear testing. Its previously been estimated that cervical screening only prevents around 70% of cervical cancer deaths in England. Women deserve the right to have the confidence that cancer that can show no signs in initial stages be tested for on a regular basis.",
