        "action": "Encourage MPs to donate 1% of pay monthly to help Ukraine's fight against Russia",
        "additional_details": "There are uncertainties on whether Ukraine will continue to get aid from the US to sustain its efforts in repelling Russian aggression and providing resources to affected Ukrainian citizens, stretching Ukraine's ability to deploy sufficient resources for both its defence and humanitarian needs.\r\nIf we all can chip in on a regular basis, we would be able to collectively create a continuous stream of resources to help alleviating the suffering of Ukrainians and contribute to peace in Europe.",
        "background": "As Ukraine is losing US' support in its fight against Russian aggression, MPs can donate 1% of their salaries to Ukraine monthly until the end of the war to show how one can help Ukraine in an affordable and sustainable manner. Citizens who followed the lead should be provided with tax relief.",
