        "additional_details": "The history of liberty is the heartbeat of civilisation. From the ancient Greeks, who birthed democracy in Athens\u2019 agora, to the British Parliament, where Magna Carta forged the shield of law against tyranny, and the birth of America, where free men declared inalienable rights, liberty is our lifeblood. Without it, we are naught but surfs, bereft of dignity. Let every UK school teach this sacred story, that our children may guard the flame of freedom with unyielding resolve.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to mandate that every UK school teach the history of liberty as a distinct subject to all 13-year-olds. One class weekly for a year shall trace the cost of its hard-won past, the impetus it gave to our enlightened modernity, and the cost and liability of maintaining it.",
