        "additional_details": "The system of categorizing Irish women as 'pregnant from Ireland' and the discriminatory treatment of these women and their children in terms of access to healthcare and the welfare system in the UK was an abuse of their human rights. Their deportation often resulted in them being incarcerated in a cruel system of mother and baby homes in Ireland and the separation of women from their children.",
        "background": "I would like the government to apologize for the historic categorization by British authorities of pregnant Irish women as PFI, and the involvement of UK authorities in the deportation of these women to Ireland.",
