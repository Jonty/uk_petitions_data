        "additional_details": "Banning 3D, 4D and styled plates would wipe out a major legal product for 35 thousand plate makers and confuse millions of drivers who bought BSAU 145e plates in good faith.\r\n\r\n\"Stealth\" plates are created by IR-blocking films and sprays, not raised characters. Police ANPR trials have already shown these plates can be detected!\r\n\r\nGovernment action should target overlay films, uncompliant sellers and weak DVLA enforcement, while keeping tested 3D, 4D and styled plates legal when they meet BSAU 145e.",
        "background": "Do not support BS AU 145e changes that would ban 3D, 4D or negative plates. Keep these styles legal when they meet BS AU 145e. \r\n\r\nInstead tackle ghost plates by stronger NIR tests and enforcement on IR-blocking films and sprays; Birmingham's \"Operation Phantom\" caught 4,300 ghost plates in 2 weeks.",
