        "additional_details": "Women across the UK experience distinct mental health challenges linked to hormonal changes, life stages, caregiving roles, workplace pressures, and social expectations. Yet women\u2019s psychological wellbeing remains under-recognised and under-researched, with many unable to access tailored support.\r\n\r\nRecognising Women\u2019s Mind Health Day would create an annual platform for education, open conversation, and positive action. The day would encourage employers, schools, healthcare providers, and communities to engage with women\u2019s mind health",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to formally recognise 1 May each year as Women\u2019s Mind Health Day \u2014 a national day dedicated to promoting awareness, education, and support around women\u2019s mind health and wellbeing.",
