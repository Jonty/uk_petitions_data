        "additional_details": "Previous localised reports have exposed horrifying crimes but also cover ups and strong official resistance to facing up to some of the lessons. Few public officials have been held to account for failures to tackle abuse. Only a handful of the places where crimes were committed have been the subject of local reports. There is no definitive set of lessons or actions to reshape the official culture which led to the mishandling of this scandal.",
        "background": "Hold a public enquiry into the grooming gangs scandal, looking in detail at each of the over 40 places in which these crimes took place. This would seek to understand the mistakes that were made and the reasons why; question those involved in a wide range of public bodies; and make recommendations",
