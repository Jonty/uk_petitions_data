        "additional_details": "Judges can make mistakes, hold unconscious biases, or overlook evidence. In complex family cases, it\u2019s wrong to rely on one person. A jury ensures fairness, prevents bias, and guarantees all evidence is properly heard. In emotionally and legally complex family cases, it\u2019s unacceptable to leave decisions to one person. Judges can be wrong or biased, and placing all that power on one person risks serious mistakes and undue pressure.",
        "background": "Reform the family court system to include a jury of impartial civilians who can deliberate on evidence, hear from children, and help ensure just outcomes in cases that impact families.",
