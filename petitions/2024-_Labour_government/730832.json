        "additional_details": "We think the June 2025 vote to decriminalise abortion up to birth was rushed, it only had around 2hrs debate in the Commons chamber, and we don't think there was enough public input. Many will oppose it, fearing it undermines unborn life, lacks safeguards.\r\n \r\nIf a mother kills her child an hour after being born they would be charged with murder but an hour earlier they\u2019re not.\r\n \r\nWe believe that a referendum, like Ireland\u2019s 2018 vote, ensures democracy.\r\n \r\nPause law, review impacts, let the public decide.",
