        "additional_details": "This petition is needed because the government is set on a course of action that could by default censor the British public's ability to openly examine or criticise a religion. This governement is creating a council that would draw up an official definition of \u2018Islamophobia\u2019 of which the next step would be the potential to impose a blasphemy law.  A secular society cannot allow critique of a religion to be branded as hate speech or racism. The government must protect free speech, not censor it.",
        "background": "In a secular society all religions must accept that their worldview will be examined and criticised in open dialogue and debate. This government must make a commitment to protect free speech as regards a citizen's right within a secular society to examine and criticise any religion or ideology.",
