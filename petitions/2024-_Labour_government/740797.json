        "action": "Rule out military bases in Lincolnshire for asylum seeker accommodation",
        "additional_details": "Lincolnshire has many former RAF bases in rural areas, such as Scampton, Woodhall Spa, and Grantham, often far from hospitals, schools, and public transport. Using these sites for asylum accommodation risks isolating people, fuelling local tensions, and undermining regeneration, such as the \u00a3300m investment planned for RAF Scampton. Asylum provision should be in well-supported locations.\r\nLincolnshire people deserve better than more speculation, so we ask the government to be unequivocal.",
        "background": "The Government should rule out using disused or active military sites in Greater Lincolnshire for asylum accommodation - especially where clear alternative plans are in place, like at RAF Scampton and Prince William of Gloucester Barracks.",
