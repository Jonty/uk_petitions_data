In 2022, the National Audit Office found that in the previous 6 years at least 69 suicides could have been linked to problems with benefit claims. The system is often reported as being dehumanising and cruel.\r\nWe think that more people and a broader spectrum of people should be awarded PIP.  We stand against changes to reduce PIP claimants.",
