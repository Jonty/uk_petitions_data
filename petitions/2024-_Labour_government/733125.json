        "additional_details": "We ask the Government to make it a legal requirement for police forces to provide preventative and ongoing PTSD support. We think officers face repeated trauma and are at far higher risk of PTSD than civilians or military personnel. Current schemes are not mandatory or consistently effective. We think legislation should enforce early intervention, mental health assessments, trauma training, wellbeing debriefs, and national tracking of suicide data. We think legislation is the only way to hold forces accountable.",
        "background": "Research shows almost 1 in 5 officers are estimated to have PTSD. The condition increases suicide risk and, if untreated, can cause impaired judgment, posing a safety risk to officers and the public. We want mandatory support & trauma training.",
