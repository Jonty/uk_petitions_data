Yet we think that often, no one is held personally responsible. Victims deserve justice. We think there must be improved ways through which those in power can be held accountable if their failures destroy lives.",

We believe this would provide an improved means through which to hold public officials \u2014 including ministers, social workers, and civil servants \u2014 legally accountable if their actions or failures cause serious harm, trauma, or death.",
