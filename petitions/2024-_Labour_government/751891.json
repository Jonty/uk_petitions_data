        "additional_details": "Childcare is costly & legal immigrant parents who are taxpayers do not have any support for their children even those who are born in the UK. In addition to the rising cost of living, it is just right to help them with childcare costs as it is important to keep the families together. This also encourages the dependant parent to work & contribute to the community when they move to the country.",
        "background": "In the upcoming changes, it has been stated that those with ILR status will have no recourse to public funds. This is completely understandable. However, working parents who legally migrated should still have the right to be given assistance when it comes to childcare.",
