        "additional_details": "We also want them to raise awareness of the environmental and safety impacts of littering to encourage public cooperation in keeping roads clean and safe. Roadside litter harms wildlife, pollutes ecosystems, and creates safety hazards for drivers. We think it diminishes community pride, deters tourism, and reflects poorly on the UK\u2019s global image. Inconsistent clean-up efforts can leave areas neglected and worsen the problem. We think that litter-free roads could improve environmental health, attract investment, and support sustainability goals. Clear accountability and decisive action are vital for lasting change.",
        "background": "We want the government to define responsibilities for councils and National Highways, establish KPIs for litter removal, introduce more fines for littering and ensure compliance through inspections.",
