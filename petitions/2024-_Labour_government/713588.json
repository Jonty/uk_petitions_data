        "additional_details": "I think that the 25p we receive from the government is negligible on its own, however en masse it is profitable. I think it is loose change that could make a change.\r\n \r\nI think the elderly are probably the most in need of the NHS, and sadly may not be able to access expensive operations, because of their age. If the Government were to create a fund from the 25ps of all 80+ in the country, we could raise a large sum, with interest, for the NHS. This could then benefit the elderly when they are most vulnerable. The Government should provide updates on how much money is in this fund.",

Whilst I am grateful for this money I believe the 25p from all 80 year olds amalgamated could be a significant sum and could be best used to create a fund for operations for the elderly in the NHS",
