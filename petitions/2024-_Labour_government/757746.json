        "additional_details": "When an MP switches party mid-Parliament, voters may end up represented by a party they did not choose. Many people vote based on party, manifesto and leadership, not just the individual. Defections can therefore erode trust and alter the political balance without consent. Requiring by-elections for party defection would give constituents a democratic say and help maintain legitimacy and accountability in our parliamentary system.",
        "background": "Require legislation so that when an MP defects to another political party during a Parliament they must seek a fresh mandate through a by-election. This would protect voter trust, prevent unapproved shifts in representation, and ensure democratic legitimacy.",
