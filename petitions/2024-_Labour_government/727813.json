        "action": "Reverse ILR from 10 to 5 years; if not, exclude those already on the route.",
        "additional_details": "Extending ILR to 10 years causes undue hardship for skilled workers, spouses, and families who face prolonged uncertainty and instability. It delays their ability to fully settle, work freely, and access public services. This change disrupts lives, harms mental health, and damages the UK\u2019s reputation as a welcoming country. Many have already planned their futures around the 5-year rule, so this extension is unfair and punitive.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to reverse the ILR qualifying period from 10 years back to 5 years for all applicants, including skilled workers, spouses, and families. If this is not possible, we urge them to exclude those already waiting or who have applied under the previous 5-year rule.",
