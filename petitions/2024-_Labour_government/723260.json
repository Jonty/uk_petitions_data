        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom has always taken great pride in being ahead of the curve in humanitarian issues, scientific knowledge, and providing opportunities for its citizens. Which is why the proposed changes to Personal Independence Payment are so shocking as for many, this payment covers the huge cost of living with a chronic physical or mental illness. Disabled people lose vast amounts of income each month for items such as prescription charges and lose wages to time off to manage their conditions.",
        "background": "The Government need to step back and rethink the proposed changes to PIP for disabled people! If the suggested changes are passed, it will lead to a vast decline in the quality of life of many of the country\u2019s most vulnerable people and their families.",
