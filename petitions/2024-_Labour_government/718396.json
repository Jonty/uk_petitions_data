        "action": "Create a Government Efficiency Department to cut wasted non beneficial spending",
        "additional_details": "The UK government wastes billions on inefficiency, bloated bureaucracy, and projects that fail to benefit the British public. A Government Efficiency Department would identify and eliminate wasteful spending, ensuring taxpayer money is used for vital services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Every pound should directly improve lives, not be lost in red tape or mismanagement. This initiative would boost public trust and make government spending more effective and accountable.",
        "background": "I urge the UK government to establish a Government Efficiency Department to cut wasteful, non-beneficial spending. Every pound should serve the British public, not be lost in bureaucracy. This department must prioritize taxpayers interests, ensuring funds go to essential services that improve lives.",
