        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister decreed, in a pamphlet distributed to every household, that the referendum would be the decision, and reiterated that in his speech from Chatham House where he almost literally commanded the people to do the job that we keep parliament for, but there are no reasonable grounds to imagine that anyone believed the decree nor obeyed his orders. \r\nThere appears to be no democratic basis for the referendum becoming a decision. \r\nThe government must explain how it happened.\" ",
        "background": "The 2016 referendum was advisory, that point was put beyond question by the Supreme Court judgment. \r\nWe consider that an advisory referendum is an expression of opinion, it is not a declaration of will. \r\nWe cannot see any democratic pathway that enables that opinion to become a decision.",
