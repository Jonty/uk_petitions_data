        "additional_details": "Migrants from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are among the UK\u2019s largest communities, and pay large sums in taxes and NI. Yet, when they return home, many may lose these contributions, with no increase to their pension, nor a tax / NI refund. We think this is unfair. We want the Government to either secure these agreements or refund NI. We feel it is unjust to take from immigrants and give nothing back.",

If agreements can't be reached, we think the UK should refund NI contributions when those affected return home.",
