We believe that since the country is apparently so badly off, all MPs should have to prove their eligibility for payments via a PIP-style questionnaire, overwhelmingly positive feedback and expert assessments. We suggest that if an MP has too many complaints, they should be ineligible for their pay, and non-attendance in parliament will also make them ineligible.",
        "background": "We call on the government to make changes to the legislation covering how MPs are paid. We want a PIP-style assessment for MPs to fill out and require them to get positive feedback from constituents before they can be paid, and assessments that decide whether they're eligible for the payment.",
