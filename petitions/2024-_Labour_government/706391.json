        "additional_details": "Small domiciliary care businesses provide vital services but face high costs and rigid requirements for sponsorship licences.\r\nWith staff shortages affecting care, reducing fees and allowing flexible employment terms could ensure care providers can recruit overseas workers and maintain essential services.\r\nWe think relaxing the requirements would help providers tackle worker shortages, improve care quality and meet growing social care needs in ageing communities.",
        "background": "We want the Government to lower sponsorship fees for small care businesses and allow more flexible contracts for overseas care workers.\r\nWe believe this will help address the care worker shortage and support small providers who cannot meet the current financial and contractual requirements.",
