        "action": "Change the 20-hours restriction ban on international students to 30-hours",
        "additional_details": "This limitation forces many students to seek alternative, often informal, employment to meet their financial needs. To alleviate these difficulties, the government should consider lifting the 20-hour work restriction or adjusting it to reflect current economic conditions. Such a measure would provide international students with greater flexibility to support themselves and contribute to the UK economy.",
        "background": "In recent years, international students have encountered hurdles, including a competitive job market and stringent visa regulations. Despite the rising cost of living and inflationary pressures, the 20-hour work restriction during term-time remains unchanged.",
