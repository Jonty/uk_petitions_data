        "action": "Reclassify melatonin to Green so GPs can prescribe it routinely.",
        "additional_details": "Melatonin is safe, effective and widely needed for children with autism, ADHD and other neurodevelopmental conditions, yet its amber status blocks GP prescribing. Families face long waits, severe sleep deprivation, school difficulties and rising pressure on CAMHS. Reclassifying melatonin as green would ensure fair, timely access, ease strain on specialists, support children\u2019s wellbeing and help parents stay in work.",
        "background": "Work with NHS England and the BNF/BNFC to make melatonin a Green medicine so GPs can prescribe it routinely for appropriate, evidence-based use. This will remove the current Amber restrictions that cause delays and unequal access nationwide.",
