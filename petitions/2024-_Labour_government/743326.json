        "additional_details": "We believe individualised monitoring can help reduce poor practice and prevent abuse. It could also enable gaps in training and low care standards to be revealed and promptly addressed. It could provide indisputable evidence for those who cannot communicate effectively, and empower other carers to report concerns. We believe that currently abuse is widespread and that alarmingly there is no accountability for those who commit it, highlighting a national failing in protecting the vulnerable.",
