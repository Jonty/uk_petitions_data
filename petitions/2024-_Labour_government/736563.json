Labour has broken key pledges on green investment, scrapping the two-child benefit cap, free school meals, House of Lords reform, and nationalisation. Keir Starmer is not up to the job, nor are Angela Rayner or Rachel Reeves. Ministers are unqualified, public funds are being wasted, and trust has collapsed. The public has lost confidence in this government. We need a fresh mandate and leadership that keeps its promises and puts the country first.",

Money is being wasted and unqualified ministers hold key roles. The public deserves honesty and competence in government.",
