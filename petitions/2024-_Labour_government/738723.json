        "additional_details": "Because no where in the history of earth has taxing the wealthy and middle class ever helped the less fortunate in the long run.  It de-incentivises those who would have made a better life for themselves and It makes those who would be huge assets to our country flee to better lands with more opportunities.  Raising taxes to fund public ventures will only fix the short term, if any!",

We must stop the endless taxing of the wealthy  or middle class and open up the country again for investment and the ability to grow in order to give those we need to support opportunities.  Bring back our job creators!",
