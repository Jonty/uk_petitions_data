However travel companies hoick the prices by thousands during half term.\r\n\r\nSo much education can and is incorporated into travel. Language, culture, history.\r\n\r\nFor many families, the increase in pricing during half term is simply unaffordable and this law means they will not go on holiday at all.\r\n\r\nIt should be our right to give OUR children these experiences.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s fight for this!",
