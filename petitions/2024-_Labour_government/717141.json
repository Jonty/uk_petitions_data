We believe the Child Maintenance Service is a failing department, failing children and may inadvertently be allowing some self-employed parents to use the system as a weapon against other parents. In our view, the process currently places too much responsibility at the foot of the other parent to prove or disprove the financial position and children and parents can be damaged as a result.",
