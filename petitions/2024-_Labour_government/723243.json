It\u2019s something everyone in Glasgow talks about, there\u2019s no reason for dogs to not be allowed on. I\u2019d use the subway so much more if I could take my dog. She\u2019s too lazy to walk to the west end but all of her favourite places are there, so I have to spend like \u00a350 on uber pet to get her there and back. I can\u2019t be the only one.",
