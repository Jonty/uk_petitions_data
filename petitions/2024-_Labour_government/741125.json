        "action": "Provide parking permits from pregnancy until the child is 12 years old or 135 cm",
        "additional_details": "The amount of people parking in child spaces with teenagers or no children  causes serious problems for those legally obliged to use baby and child car seats. Baby and toddler seats especially require a fully open door to operate. People often use these spaces to be closer to the shops not caring that those with babies and toddlers really do need to be closer to the shops and have the extra space to safely operate legally required car seats.",
        "background": "These permits will prevent others who are not entitled from using the small amount of spaces for baby and child parking. Care sets are a legal requirement so space should be provided in order to safely operate these.",
