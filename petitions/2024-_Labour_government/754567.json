        "additional_details": "Preterm birth and pregnancy loss cause lifelong trauma for families. I lost my baby at 18 weeks due to undetected cervical insufficiency; nothing could be done in time. Evidence shows early cervical length screening can identify risk and allow simple treatments such as progesterone or cerclage. Including this in routine NHS 12-week scans could spare families unimaginable grief and save babies\u2019 lives. Nobody should have to experience loss first to then be classified as \u2018at risk\u2019.",
