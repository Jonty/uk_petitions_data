        "additional_details": "The proposed changes will require pensioners to pay privately for medical reports from GPs and opticians. Money that the majority can ill afford. \r\nFor many the car is their only means of travel .\r\nThe only way to  visit family and friends or to attend appointments. \r\nIt would take me hours on various buses to get to hospital should the need arise. A journey I could take in the car in 45 minutes. Without breaking any rules of the road",
        "background": "Stop the unfair proposed changes to the renewal of the over 70s drivers license.\r\nThe dangerous drivers on the UK roads are not the elderly but, the younger irresponsible people. \r\nThey are the ones more likely to disregard the speed limit and othe highway code rules.",
