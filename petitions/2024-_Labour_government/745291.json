We don't know what you would like a right to bear arms to include, so we're not sure what specific action you want taken.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, permission to possess or to purchase or acquire a firearm will be granted to an individual who is assessed by the licensing authority, the police, as not posing a threat to public safety and having good reason to own the firearm.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition clearly explaining what you'd like to happen. For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Government and Parliament to make a specific change to firearm regulations, if that's what you'd like to happen."
