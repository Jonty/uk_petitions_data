        "additional_details": "The announcement made by Shabana Mahmood MP on 20th Nov. which says that Healthcare Workers will have to wait 15 years to obtain ILR, firstly it is discriminatory that Healthcare Workers have to wait longer than the other categories, secondly it will allow modern slavery and exploitation by the visa sponsors, because it bounds a person to stay in one job for 15 long years. We do not wish to get public funds rather we want government to fulfil its promise to grant ILR after completing 5 years.",
        "background": "We healthcare workers request the honourable parliament of the UK to reconsider the new changes announced on 20th November regarding Earned Settlement, especially about 15 years route towards settlement for Healthcare workers.",
