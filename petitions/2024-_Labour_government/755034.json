        "additional_details": "I want the UK Government and Parliament to protect the Old Devonian/ Celtic Devonian language as we believe it represents an important but overlooked part of England\u2019s Celtic heritage. Devon once had its own Brythonic language, closely related to Cornish and Welsh, but it disappeared without any formal recognition or preservation.\r\n \r\nBy granting it protected status, the Government could safeguard the remaining evidence of this language, support research into Devon\u2019s Celtic past, and allow future generations to reconnect with a unique part of their identity. Recognising and protecting the language could ensure that Devon\u2019s early history is not forgotten and is given the same respect as other Celtic regions in the UK.",
