        "action": "Commission a national enquiry on Child Sexual Exploitation in England and Wales",
        "additional_details": "Child sexual exploitation remains a national epidemic, with victims continuing to suffer under a system that fails to protect them or prosecute their abusers.\r\n\r\nFor years, CSE has been treated a localised issue. Governments insist it is the responsibility of local authorities to commission independent inquiries, but local investigations can only go so far. They cannot address national failures or conduct broader analyses of offending and the structures nationally that failed to protect victims.",
        "background": "We need a government-led inquiry that examines the scope of CSE across England and Wales.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry must investigate the systemic failures within national and local government, children\u2019s services, law enforcement, and the judicial system that allowed grooming gangs to flourish for decades.",
