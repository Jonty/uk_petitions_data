        "additional_details": "The simultaneous M4 and M48 closures exposed a major weakness in cross-Severn travel. These bridges are vital, and full shutdowns disrupt commuters, businesses and emergency services. We need an independent review to improve maintenance, weather-closure protocols, contingency planning, and to invest in reliable alternative routes. Stronger infrastructure and clearer communication are essential to prevent future total closures and protect the region\u2019s connectivity.",
        "background": "Conduct a full review of the 9 December 2025 disruption, upgrade safety-critical infrastructure on both Severn bridges, strengthen wind-resilience, improve public communication, and publish a long-term strategy ensuring at least one crossing remains reliably open.",
