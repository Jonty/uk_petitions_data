        "additional_details": "We are concerned that adoption permanently severs their legal and emotional ties to their birth family, siblings, culture, and identity, which can compound trauma rather than resolve it.\r\n\r\nWe believe that in many NAI cases, risk can be safely managed through alternative measures such as kinship care, special guardianship orders, or long-term fostering with continued family contact. These options could allow children to remain connected to their family while ensuring their safety.",
