        "additional_details": "Allowing children aged 14 and older to drive, under strict supervision and training, can help them gain responsibility and independence. It would ease parents\u2019 burden by enabling teens to assist with errands and school travel. With proper safety measures and a graduated licensing system, young drivers can become safer on the road. This change would especially benefit rural areas with limited transport. We urge the government to consider a regulated framework for 14+ drivers.",
