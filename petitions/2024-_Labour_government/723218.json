Officials spending public money to cancel Easter events in schools, or \u201cdecolonise Welsh Cake\u201d is petty cultural vandalism. Inclusion does not mean erasure! We want to thrive as distinct people. Our history shaped these isles, our stories built its soul. Act decisively and halt our cultural obliteration.",

Our heritage and culture grew from the people of these Isles over millennia. Protect our heritage!",
