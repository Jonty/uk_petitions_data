        "action": "End pick up and drop off fees at airports.",
        "additional_details": "I want the government to pass a law that prevents charges being made to access a travel facility to pick up or drop off. This is not about parking but simply about the ridiculous and ever increasing charges Airports are charging to pick up or drop off. I believe there should be a 10 minute free period and by all means charge for overstaying. But charging for what is a basic necessity when using air travel is absurd.",
        "background": "Legislate against the charges that airports are imposing on people dropping off and picking up from the airports. The airport operators are taking advantage by charging ridiculous rates to use the pick up and drop off zones. You wouldn\u2019t pay to enter a bus station or train station.",
