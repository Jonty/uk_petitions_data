        "action": "Hold a National Public Inquiry into Grooming Gangs in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Grooming gangs have abused vulnerable children across the UK for decades, with cases in towns like Rotherham, Rochdale, and Telford exposing systemic failures by police, councils, and social services. Local inquiries have been limited in scope and failed to address the national scale of the issue. An inquiry is essential to hold institutions accountable, restore public trust, and ensure safeguards are in place to protect children and prevent these crimes from happening again.",
        "background": "Hold a national public inquiry into how public institutions handled grooming gang cases. It must identify patterns of failure, ensure accountability, and recommend reforms to prevent future harm. Victims should have a platform to share their experiences and guide safeguarding changes.",
