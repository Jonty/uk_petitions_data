        "additional_details": "This means that same-sex partners who are using surrogacy to start a family aren\u2019t automatically recognised as the legal parents once the baby is born, unless they go through a lengthy and costly court process.\r\n \r\nWe feel the current law leaves a baby effectively parentless and needs to be changed. We believe UK surrogacy laws are outdated and don\u2019t reflect modern families.",
        "background": "Currently, UK law still recognises the surrogate as the legal mother (and their partner as the father if they have one), despite neither having any biological connection to the baby. This can lead to a lengthy court process costing thousands of pounds to be recognised as legal parents.",
