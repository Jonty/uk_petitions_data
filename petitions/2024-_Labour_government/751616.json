        "additional_details": "We call the new rules the \u20185 Years ILR Route Scam\u2019 because legal migrants came with the clear expectation of a 5-year path. The government is breaking that promise, damaging trust and pushing people into crisis. Many of us will leave, and others won\u2019t come. We\u2019ve contributed through work and taxes, and we do not accept these new rules for existing migrants.",
        "background": "The government has recently announced major changes to ILR route which has been increased   from 5 - 20 yrs effecting even those already here on skilled work visa. Many people's ILRs are due by the end of 2026 or early 2027 and it's totally unfair, unjust and this should be reversed.",
