        "action": "Increase statutory paternity leave from 2 weeks to 6 weeks on full pay.",
        "additional_details": "Longer, paid paternity leave supports gender equality,maternal recovery & child development. It helps fathers bond, reduces health risks & ensures parents can adjust without sacrificing maternity time & pay. Most can\u2019t afford leave. A modern policy must be paid, protected & separate from maternity leave. Becoming a parent is one of the BIGGEST life changes anyone can face. Fathers are at risk of depression & emotional stress\u2014especially when trying to balance work, family & wellbeing.",
        "background": "To increase statutory paternity leave to 6 weeks, full pay & separate from maternity leave. 2 weeks is not enough for fathers to bond with their baby, support the mother or adjust to parenthood. The change would improve mental health & support family life without compromising maternal recovery.",
