        "additional_details": "Because it\u2019s a vague, overused term that often serves as a weapon to silence or discredit dissenting voices without evidence or nuance. It\u2019s a lazy tactic that shuts down debate, polarizes society, and unfairly stereotypes people with diverse views. When those in power or high office use it, it amplifies division and risks abusing their influence to vilify opponents rather than engage with ideas.",
        "background": "I believe labeling individuals or groups as \u201cfar right\u201d should be banned.\r\n\r\nA ban would force more precise, constructive dialogue, focusing on specific actions or policies rather than inflammatory labels that sow mistrust and obscure truth.",
