        "action": "Reverse the Government's recent changes to inheritance tax on British farmers.",
        "additional_details": "In the recent Budget, Rachel Reeves announced that from 6 April 2026, the full 100% relief from inheritance tax will be restricted to the first \u00a31 million of combined agricultural and business property. Contrary to Rachel Reeves claim that this decision will only impact \"one in four family farms\", this Budget decision will needlessly decimate the economic prosperity of the overwhelming majority of British farmers, whilst preventing farming families to succeed their land to future generations.",
        "background": "We are calling on the Government to reverse their proposed reforms to agricultural property relief (APR) and business property relief (BPR) for British farmers. Despite British farming already being in decline, this tax hike will devastate our rural community and lead to closures of British farms.",
