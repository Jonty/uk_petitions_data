        "action": "Make a legally required referendum on UK petitions with over 500,000 Signatures.",
        "additional_details": "UK petitions do not have any guaranteed way to become law, as they do in other European Democracies like Switzerland, and thus have no relative effect in the governing process, which allows for unpopular policies to be passed without democratic consent. By doing this, the government will be able to increase democratic participation in our system, allow for more power in the decision-making process given to the people and to prevent unpopular and undemocratic polices from passing.",
        "background": "We would like the government to have all petitions on the UK Government website which reach 500,000 signatures to have a referendum across the nation to allow people to express their views. We would also like to legally bind the government to the decision in the petition based on the people's views.",
