        "action": "Call an early General Election in 2026 so voters can renew or withdraw consent.",
        "additional_details": "Early elections have been called before to renew legitimacy when trust breaks down. The Government says it needs time to fix an \u201cinherited mess\u201d, yet has introduced major tax rises, policy reversals and measures not clearly set out in its manifesto. Repeated U-turns and mandate drift have damaged public confidence. An early General Election would let voters decide whether this Government should continue.",
        "background": "Millions have already signed petitions calling for a General Election, yet debates avoided the core issue: whether the Government still has a democratic mandate. The Prime Minister should request dissolution so the public can judge policies introduced or changed since the last election.",
