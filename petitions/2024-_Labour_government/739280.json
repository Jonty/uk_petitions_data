We think a six month probationary period, reviewed by an independent panel, would help ensure MPs prove their competence and keep pledges. MPs deemed unsuitable by the panel could be removed. We think this would align politics with other jobs\u2019 accountability standards. It could help rebuild trust, and help ensure MPs serve the public, not themselves.",
