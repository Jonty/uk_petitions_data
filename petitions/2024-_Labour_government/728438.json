        "action": "Stop removal of SEND provision in Mainstream schools.",
        "additional_details": "The government must not pursue the removal of SEND from mainstream schools this would be catastrophic for children. They need to seek further advice from those at grass roots level ie non statutory organisations run by parent professionals. Homeschooling has risen because of the lack of SEND provision. Child centred SEND provision must continue in mainstream schools not be prevented. It is necessary and without it children will be unable to secure an education they are capable of with support.",
        "background": "Ministers are planning to remove the legal right to SEND provision in mainstream schools. This would further oppress children who require support in mainstream schools preventing them from fulfilling their potential, impact mental well being and life chances. We cannot allow this.",
