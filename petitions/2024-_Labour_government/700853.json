        "action": "Ban the sale of ALL fireworks to the public and keep to organised displays only.",
        "additional_details": "At one time people knew when fireworks would go off and could plan for the event. Now its from midOctober to a week after Guy Fawkes. Not only do pets suffer but wildlife, horses, cattle, children or those with anxiety and ptsd.   We have 1.3g Rockets of gunpowder standing 5ft tall in the hands of irresponsible people. The Police and Firebrigade often have fireworks thrown at them.  The Government needs to put a stop to random fireworks causing alot of pain and misery to so many.",
        "background": "Every year thousands of animals in the UK get stressed and often die due to fireworks being let off often by young people who aren't even old enough to buy them.  We would like to see a total ban of fireworks being sold to the public and to keep to organised events only.",
