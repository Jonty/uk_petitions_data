        "additional_details": "Busking dancers add life, culture, and energy to our city. They offer free entertainment, support local talent, and bring people together. From hip-hop to traditional dance, they showcase diverse art that tourists and locals love. Banning them takes away joy, expression, and income for hardworking performers. Instead of shutting them down, cities should regulate and celebrate them. Let\u2019s keep dance alive in public spaces.",
        "background": "I\u2019m starting this petition to bring back the dancers to Leicester Square. These artists bring life, culture, and joy to the city \u2014 they deserve the right to perform and make a living. Let\u2019s support street art, not silence it",
