All of these and more changes or rulings have impacted sets of people but we think their consultations were not sufficient. Although ONS may contribute to the report, it may not take into account lived experiences, niche problematic areas that we think need further definition or areas that just haven't considered. We think this creates further work and doesn't allow groups of people a voice in changes impacting them.",
