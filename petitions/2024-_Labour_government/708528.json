        "additional_details": "We've seen Khan continuously deflect responsibility and accountability, blaming everybody but himself. \r\n\r\nLondon, once a vibrant, inclusive hub, now stands divided thanks to Khan's polarizing politics. London's crime rate has seen a marked increase during his tenure with knife crime reaching record heights in recent years (Metropolitan Police Data). Despite being in a position to enact change, he continuously places blame elsewhere rather than taking decisive action himself.",
        "background": "The Government should not be bestowed a Knighthood on Sadiq Khan, who has failed to uphold his duty to our city and its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nSadiq Khan's tenure as Mayor of London has devastated the city we love so much. Our once thriving capital is now divided and stagnant, and all under his watch.",
