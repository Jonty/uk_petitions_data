Low pay leads to burnout, high turnover, and service gaps that put vulnerable people at risk. Fair wages would improve retention, morale, and outcomes. Government action is essential to protect both workers and the communities they serve.",
        "background": "Support support workers are vital to protecting lives, yet many earn less than roles with far less responsibility. I\u2019ve seen colleagues leave due to stress and low pay, leaving vulnerable people without support. We need action to ensure fair wages and stable, skilled services across the UK.",
