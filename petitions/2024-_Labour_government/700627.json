        "additional_details": "There are around 38 million pets in the UK. Many of which suffer terrible stress caused by loud fireworks this time of year. The same for all of UK wildlife that has to endure this strange human tradition. For them it\u2019s not only frightening but also dangerous and as a nation of so called animal lovers we owe it to them to move away from this towards a more peaceful and considerate future for all. A once marvellous spectacle that is outdated by the many many things one can view on a screen, or with headphones. It\u2019s unnecessary, anti social and disrespectful.",
        "background": "Protect people, wildlife and pets from  unnecessary stress caused by loud fireworks. Ban sales of loud fireworks to the public and keep fireworks displays to a set date and time  (E.g. the evening of 5th of November)",
