        "additional_details": "BMI is considered by many to be an outdated, inaccurate measure that does not reflect individual health or account for differences in age, ethnicity, disability, or body composition. Its use increases stigma, and can cause harm to children and adults.\r\n \r\nIt continues to influence access to surgeries, fertility services, pain management, and other essential treatments.\r\n \r\nIn schools, children are assigned a BMI category yet childhood growth patterns are highly individual, making BMI inappropriate for use with children.\r\n",
        "background": "We ask the Government to undertake a review of the suitability of using BMI in NHS care and school health assessments, with a view to ensuring that NHS and educational health practices are fit for the 21st century and align with modern, evidence-based tools that truly support wellbeing.",
