        "additional_details": "Ticket resale at inflated prices makes concerts, sports matches, and theatre performances unaffordable for many fans. It allows ticket touts and scalpers to exploit people and undermines fair access to events.\r\n\r\nThe Government should introduce legislation that caps resale prices at face value (plus reasonable booking or handling fees) and ensure effective enforcement to protect genuine fans and event-goers.",
        "background": "I want the Government to make it illegal for individuals or companies to resell event tickets for more than their original face value in England, Scotland & Wales \r\n\r\nThis would bring England, Scotland & Wales line with Ireland, where similar laws already exist to protect consumers.",
