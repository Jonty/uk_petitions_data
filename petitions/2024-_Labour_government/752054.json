        "additional_details": "Trial by jury has been a cornerstone of English law since Magna Carta in 1215, guaranteeing that no one is judged solely by the state but by peers. Removing it risks concentrating power in judges alone, undermining centuries of tradition, transparency, and trust. Jury trials embody democratic values and protect against miscarriages of justice.",
        "background": "I urge Parliament to reject any proposal to remove the right to trial by jury. This cornerstone of justice must be preserved to protect fairness, accountability, and public confidence in the legal system.",
