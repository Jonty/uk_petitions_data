        "additional_details": "We believe that snares are very inhumane. It has been estimated that snares can kill 1.7 million animals per year. They can trap beloved pets, potentially causing them endless pain - in fact, a study also suggested that only a quarter of injured animals from snares are actually the intended target, normally foxes. We want the government to ban what we see as an inhumane mechanism that is still being used throughout England.",
        "background": "At the moment self-locking snares are illegal, since the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, but I think that free-running snares should also be illegal, as they are in Wales and Scotland.",
