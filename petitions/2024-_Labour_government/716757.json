        "additional_details": "Navigating the world as a disabled person is difficult enough without venues not showing vital information that could make things so much easier. Too many places either have no information about accessibility at all, or it\u2019s very difficult to find. Emails are often ignored, and answers not easy to get - in some cases because places might not want to admit they aren\u2019t accessible. We believe this kind of legal requirement would make planning easier and would stop companies avoiding the subject.",
