        "additional_details": "As voters, we don't get a choice about these organisations, which can often represent extreme ideologies, vested interests and corporate entities simply due to the funding available. Media briefing, paid influencers and use of social media and data can push the perceived dialogue, and bias coverage and awareness. We can't change this. But we think we should be able to see who is paying for it, and who is being paid to appear supportive rather than voicing authentic beliefs.",

However, think tanks go beyond merely brainstorming ideas and presenting data and arguments. They can push stories and PR to media outlets to influence the public before policy is made.",
