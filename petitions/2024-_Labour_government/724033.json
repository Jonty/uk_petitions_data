        "additional_details": "The government have the power to create a law of which period products can be made free or affordable to everyone including the homeless in a system of which women are entitled to be given period products free of charge or at a price not exceeding 40p. This law should state that 1-3 packets of pads/tampons can be given at a time, if companies cared about women's health, they simply would not and should not care bout their profits.",
        "background": "Make it a law for period products to be free or cheaper. On average, a woman has roughly 360 periods over their lifetime. If you average the price of one package of tampons/pads at \u00a32.50 then over her lifetime this will cost a woman approximately \u00a3900 which is not fair if a period is not a choice.",
