        "additional_details": "I want Parliament to act because people should be able to rely on the commitments made during elections. When parties promise major changes to gain support but later abandon them, it undermines trust in the entire system. A clear legal requirement would ensure governments remain tied to the promises that earned them power, strengthening accountability and protecting the integrity of our democracy.",
        "background": "We want Parliament to pass a law making party manifestos a legal requirement. If a governing party breaks its manifesto promises, it should automatically face a vote of confidence in the House of Commons to ensure accountability.",
