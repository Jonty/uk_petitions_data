        "action": "Make the spousal visa income requirement reflect regional living costs.",
        "additional_details": "The government should introduce a regionally adjusted income threshold or alternative assessment method that considers local economic conditions. Such reform would maintain the policy\u2019s aim of financial stability while ensuring that all citizens \u2014 regardless of region \u2014 are treated equitably in their right to live with their partners and families. Londons average income reaches the 29k threshold easily. Whereas other cities, such as Barnsley have a lower average and lower expenses.",
        "background": "We want the Government to review the spousal visa income rule and introduce regionally adjusted thresholds, so people outside London and the South East aren\u2019t unfairly disadvantaged by lower local wages and can reunite with their families fairly.",
