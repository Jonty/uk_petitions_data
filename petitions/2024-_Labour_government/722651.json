        "action": "For the abolition of ULEZ and Clear Air Zone charges.",
        "additional_details": "The UK Government must abolish ULEZ and CAZ charges as they impose unfair double taxation on drivers who already pay Vehicle Excise Duty. These fees disproportionately impact low-income citizens and small businesses, forcing them to bear extra costs without viable transport alternatives. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of these charges in improving air quality remains questionable. The government should focus on fairer, more effective environmental policies instead.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to abolish ULEZ and Clear Air Zone charges, which unfairly penalize drivers already paying Vehicle Excise Duty. These fees harm low-income citizens and businesses while failing to significantly improve air quality. End double taxation and invest in fairer solutions!",
