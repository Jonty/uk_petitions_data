        "additional_details": "Cutting PIP and disability benefits will push countless disabled people into poverty, hardship, and isolation. The government must protect vulnerable people, not abandon them. Disabled lives matter, and our rights and welfare should be prioritised, not stripped and taken away. We feel that if these cuts go ahead then disabled people will be pushed into further hardship, both physically and emotionally, and therefore we urge the government to reverse its position.",
        "background": "The government must immediately halt all planned cuts to PIP and disability benefits. Instead, they should focus on protecting and enhancing support for disabled people, instead of harming them, ensuring fair access to the resources they need to live with dignity and independence.",
