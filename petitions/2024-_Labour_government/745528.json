        "additional_details": "We want the Government to act because many schools are restricting girls\u2019 toilet access, forcing them to wait, carry passes, or explain private health issues. This is harmful, humiliating, and can cause pain, urinary problems, anxiety, and missed lessons. Schools must provide free sanitary products, clean, safe, and private toilets, and train staff to handle period needs with dignity. Every girl deserves safety, respect, and basic human rights.",
        "background": "We want the Government to ensure all schoolgirls can use toilets freely, access free sanitary products, and be treated with dignity. Schools must keep toilets clean, safe, and private, and train staff to handle period needs respectfully. No girl should suffer shame or pain for needing the bathroom.",
