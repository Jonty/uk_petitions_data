        "action": "Introduce stronger regulation of fireworks.",
        "additional_details": "Fireworks release harmful pollutants, including PM2.5, carbon monoxide, and toxic metals, worsening respiratory conditions and causing injuries. The NHS reports around 1,000 firework-related admissions annually. Both humans and animals suffer anxiety and trauma. Fireworks pollute soil, water, and the environment, straining local governments and emergency services. This highlights the need for stricter regulations and safer alternatives.",
        "background": "Fireworks harm public health, animals, the environment, and strain resources. The government can reduce this by enforcing stricter regulations, promoting safer alternatives, and limiting fireworks to controlled events, easing the burden on healthcare, emergency services, and animal welfare.",
