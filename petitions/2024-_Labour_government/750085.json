        "additional_details": "The traffic lights on the Swallow Roundabout (A90/A92, Dundee) disrupt natural flow, causing unnecessary stops and long queues even at quiet times. Poor signal timing worsens congestion, especially on the A90 and A92. Lights have increased rear-end collisions and risky lane changes. Idling raises fuel use and emissions, while congestion harms the local economy. Many feel the lights made the junction less safe and efficient than before.",
        "background": "Consider the removal (or moving to part-time lights during peek hours) of the traffic lights on the swallow roundabout.",
