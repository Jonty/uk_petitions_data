It often feels like we prioritise helping individuals from other countries while our own citizens, are left behind. It breaks my heart to see homeless veterans\u2014individuals that have fought for their country being treated in this manner. Meanwhile, we support immigrants by providing them with accommodation, using taxpayer funds to give them food, clothing, and a sense of welcome. It raises so many questions ??",
