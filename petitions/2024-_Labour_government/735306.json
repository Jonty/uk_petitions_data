Not to mention the amount of SEND parents and carers who have to give up work as there a no childcare options for those with SEND\r\n\r\nWe think providing childcare options and after school options and gives equal opportunities to those with and without Special Educational Needs and Disabilities. We cannot discriminate and offer services based on disabilities. We think this would help with SEND parents and carers who are currently out of work due to the lack of services for their child/children",
