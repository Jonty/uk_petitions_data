        "action": "Increase, implement and enforce sentences for animal cruelty",
        "additional_details": "Animal abuse still received negligible sentences for even the most distressing acts of cruelty. A recent case of shocking neglect resulted in the perpetrator receiving only a 12-month ban on keeping animals. In another case of a large dog fighting ring, the animals were kept in appalling conditions, many were cruelly killed or maimed yet not one sentence was the maximum. Implement and enforce harsher sentences. How will abuse of animals be taken seriously when the government and courts do not?",
        "background": "The government increase in the maximum sentence for animal abuse in 2021 to 5 years means nothing because it is not implemented or enforced. Sentences continue to be negligible even for the most heinous of animal abuse and neglect.",
