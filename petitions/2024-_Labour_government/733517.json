        "action": "Stop Public Bailouts of Water Companies and Nationalise the Water Industry",
        "additional_details": "We call on the UK Government to stop using public money to bail out failing private water companies, including Thames Water. Instead of rewarding mismanagement, the water industry should return to public ownership to ensure long-term investment, transparency, and clean water. The public should not pay for decades of failure or rising bills that benefit shareholders, while raw sewage continues to be pumped into our waterways, putting public health at risk.",
        "background": "The Government must not use taxpayer money to bail out failing water firms like Thames Water. Decades of private failure and raw sewage in our waters demand action: bring the industry back into public hands and make it accountable to the citizens of the UK.",
