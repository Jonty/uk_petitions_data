We believe this could discourage talented individuals from entering teaching, worsening teacher shortages. We believe a minimum trainee wage equivalent to a Teaching Assistant salary could make training more accessible, reduce financial stress, and help recruit and retain high-quality teachers. We believe the Government must act now to support future educators and protect education standards.",
