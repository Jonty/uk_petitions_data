        "additional_details": "We think serving personnel and Veterans are often put off from studying for a higher education qualification due to the fees involved and the repayment of those fees. We think this is particularly common in those who were medically discharged from service because of the prospect of having to repay a large sum of money once they graduate. We think making serving personnel and Veteran\u2019s exempt from having to repay the loans given would encourage more current personnel and Veteran\u2019s to gain higher education qualification which could have the effect of creating a more qualified workforce for the future of the country.",

Create a grant system (for fees and maintenance payments) for serving members & Veteran\u2019s.",
