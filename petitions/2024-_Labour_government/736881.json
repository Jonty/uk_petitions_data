        "additional_details": "By lowering the driving age, we give young people more freedom. The current labour government has lowered the voting age to 16, now it\u2019s time to lower the driving age. \r\n\u201cThey\u2019re old enough to go to work, they\u2019re old enough to pay taxes\u201d- Keir Starmer when asked why he is lowering the voting age to 16. Why is it that 16 year olds are allowed to work and not drive to themselves to work. Inconsistencies as such, can negatively impact quality of life for the youth of Britain hence, this petition.",
        "background": "Currently, in the UK, you can apply for a provisional licence at 15 years 9 months, take a CBT lesson at 16, and start driving lessons at 17.\r\n\r\nThis petition asks to allow those 15 years 9 months+ to take both driving and CBT lessons and to drive cars and motorcycles from age 16.",
