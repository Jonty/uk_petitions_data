        "additional_details": "Too many children with ADHD, autism and other SEN are being misunderstood in schools. Lack of staff training leads to exclusions, punishments and mental health issues. We want the Government to make basic SEN and ADHD training mandatory for all school staff, especially in secondary schools, to ensure inclusion is real and support is consistent. All children deserve to be understood, not punished for behaviours linked to unmet needs.",
        "background": "We want the Government to require all UK school staff to receive mandatory training in ADHD and special educational needs. Many children are being misunderstood or excluded due to lack of understanding and support. Training should be nationwide and standardised.",
