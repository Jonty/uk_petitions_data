        "additional_details": "Social workers make life-changing decisions that can remove children from their families and lead to court action. These decisions have permanent effects on children\u2019s wellbeing and family stability. Social workers are not required to use the body-worn cameras frequently seen on police officers or front-line staff. This can limit evidence, increase disputes, and reduce protection for children and families. Body-worn cameras could improve transparency, accountability, and public trust.",
