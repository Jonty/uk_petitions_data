        "action": "Reduce University tuition fees",
        "additional_details": "The UK is already falling apart and everyone hates the government and parliament due to its inability to run this country. The future generations won\u2019t be able to function without higher education which is currently made inaccessible to most due to its completely uncalled university fees of \u00a39500. If you care for this country like you tell us maybe it\u2019s about time you start taking care of our future generations because without us YOU DONT EXIST.",
        "background": "Again I urge you to reduce university tuition fees as a higher education should not leave students in a lifetime of debt just because this country isn\u2019t willing to provide affordable education for its future generations, especially when the quality of education has declined to its current state.",
