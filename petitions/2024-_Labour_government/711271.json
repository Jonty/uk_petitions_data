We believe they partner with venues and companies so that their card is the only proof that is accepted, which we feel leaves disabled people no choice but to pay for a card. As there are more than 10 different cards on offer partnering with different places, we may have to buy multiple cards to get into different venues. We believe a government issued card would solve this problem.\r\n",
