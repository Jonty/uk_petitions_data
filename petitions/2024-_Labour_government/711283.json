        "action": "Make UK Law to protect our vote by Governing parties to stick to their Manifesto",
        "additional_details": "We the undersigned, require Parliamentary Law/UK Legislation made, that protects our vote & that if a Governing party goes against their Manifesto, they must call a General Election within 4 weeks of their wrongful actions & the General Election must be held within 12 weeks of the calling of the new General Election. As an example, if a Governing party says in its Manifesto they will not increase taxes, then they must not do so during its term and must stick to it.",
        "background": "Both past & present Governments have gone against various aspects of their Manifesto. For a Governing party to go back on its Manifesto, is wrong & by doing so, those who have voted based on the Manifesto, have been tricked into voting for that party, this is also gaining votes by deceit.",
