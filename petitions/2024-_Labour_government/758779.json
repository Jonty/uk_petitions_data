        "action": "Reject a social media ban for under-16s and change the minimum age to 13 instead",
        "additional_details": "A ban for under-16s risks isolating teens who rely on social media for community and education. At 13, teens should begin developing digital literacy under parental guidance, not state prohibition. The Government is currently consulting on this, and we believe education and safety features are better solutions than a ban that restricts the rights of millions of young people.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to reject proposals to ban under-16s from social media. The Government should maintain the  digital age of consent at 13 and focus on enforcing the Online Safety Act instead of implementing a blanket ban that removes digital autonomy for 14 and 15-year-olds.",
