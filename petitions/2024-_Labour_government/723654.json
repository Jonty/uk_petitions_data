        "additional_details": "To prevent this, we urge the Government to:\r\n\u2022 Require payments to be held in an escrow account until the procedure takes place, ensuring funds are protected.\r\n\u2022 Enforce stricter financial oversight of cosmetic surgery providers to stop directors from prioritizing their own funds over patients. \r\n\u2022 Introduce tougher penalties for companies engaging in unethical financial practices.\r\n \r\nWe think these changes could protect consumers from financial loss and prevent businesses from exploiting vulnerable patients.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to introduce stronger regulations to protect consumers from cosmetic surgery scams. We believe many patients may have lost money to companies that take upfront payments, cancel procedures, and then go into liquidation\u2014while directors recover their funds first.",
