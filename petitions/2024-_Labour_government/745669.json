        "additional_details": "This is nothing short of blackmail. I have been an NHS dental patient and paying \u00a327.40 twice a year for my check ups. Now my dentist are saying I have to pay \u00a3215.40 a year for the same treatment. There are no practices around me offering NHS appointments and if I don't sign up to their scheme it will be \u00a360 per check up. This is not a one off situation, practices all over the country have already done this and more will follow once they realise they can fleece us for every penny we have.",
        "background": "Dentists that previously offered NHS services should not be allowed to become private when other NHS options are not available. There needs to be NHS dental slots available for everyone and the practices should not be able to refuse treatment on the count of you not paying their private fees.",
