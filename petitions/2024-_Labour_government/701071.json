        "action": "Permit Pets on Eurostar Trains to and from the UK",
        "additional_details": "Eurostar is not listed among the approved carriers for pet travel to and from the UK, restricting pets from using this convenient service. This forces pets to travel as manifest cargo on flights, subjecting them to stressful conditions and causing anxiety for owners. Alternative routes, such as ferries, are time-consuming and inefficient. Incorporating Eurostar into the approved routes align UK policies with neighboring countries, enhance animal welfare and provide a convenient travel for pets.",
        "background": "We urge the UK government to designate Eurostar trains as an approved carrier for pet travel on routes to and from the UK. This change would permit pets to accompany their owners on Eurostar trains, providing a humane and efficient travel option.",
