        "additional_details": "Amend the Firearms Act to give the Police the ability and the powers to prosecute someone to whom has been found guilty of knowingly making a false allegation or accusation about a Firearm and or Shotgun Certificate Holder. My proposal would only improve public safety because the Police would at the start of any investigation fully explain the consequences if the allegations or accusations after being fully investigated are deemed and decided to be false.",
        "background": "There are a lot of false allegations made about a Firearm and Shotgun Certificate holders in the UK. Under public safety grounds this would make sense that the Police had the powers in place to prosecute someone to whom has been found guilty of making a false allegation about a Certificate Holder.",
