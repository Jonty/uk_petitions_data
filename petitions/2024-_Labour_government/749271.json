        "additional_details": "Across the UK, many families experience ongoing harassment, vandalism, racial abuse, antisocial behaviour and racism from groups of young offenders aged 10\u201317.\r\n\r\nThese behaviours can include intimidation, property damage, throwing objects, shouting abuse and persistent nuisance towards residents. We think current responses like community warnings are ineffective and fail to protect victims. There should be better cooperation between police, councils and schools, & stronger protection for victims.",
        "background": "We ask the UK Government to review how young offenders aged 10 and above who commit hate crimes, harassment, vandalism or antisocial behaviour and spread racism are currently sentenced. We think they should face more serious legal consequences including increased use of custodial sentences.",
