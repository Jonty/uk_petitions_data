        "additional_details": "Birmingham residents continue to pay full council tax despite prolonged refuse collection failure caused by bin strikes ongoing since 6 January 2025. Homes and streets are overwhelmed with waste, creating serious public health and environmental risks. Residents are forced to manage waste themselves while paying for services not provided. Parliament must debate mandatory council tax refunds, accountability, and require Birmingham City Council to engage directly with affected residents.",
        "background": "Despite the residents paying full council tax, and the bin strikers getting full pay while on strike, the council should refund the council tax for the services they are failing to provide, they should force the birmingham council to engage in a constructive debate with the residents.",
