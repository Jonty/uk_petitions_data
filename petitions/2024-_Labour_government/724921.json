        "additional_details": "We think there is a lot of severe animal abuse and neglect. Currently if you take a neglected animal to a vets they may make a considerable effort to try and find the owner. They have no power to stop the owner reclaiming their pet so the torture continues. Animal charities can be informed of the neglect and abuse but they may be so overrun that they are often returned to the owner before they are able to step in. Let\u2019s be their voice when they can\u2019t cry for help, not all victims can report crimes against themselves.",
        "background": "If an animal is brought to a vet, we think they should be able to make the decision that due to the severity of neglect they will seize the animal. We think the owner should be fined, added to a register and unable to obtain animals in the future.",
