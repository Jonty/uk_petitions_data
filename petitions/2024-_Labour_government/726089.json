        "additional_details": "We think the climate emergency is an urgent threat to our communities, ecosystems, and future. Despite growing awareness, local councils do not have legally binding obligations to tackle climate change at the level we think is necessary to meet net-zero targets and safeguard public health. We demand action now to protect our future and empower councils to lead the way in creating a sustainable, resilient, and equitable society for all.",
        "background": "We want the UK government to introduce legislation that makes addressing the climate emergency a statutory duty for all local authorities. By legally requiring councils to prioritise climate action, we think this would ensure that vital environmental policies become integral to local governance.",
