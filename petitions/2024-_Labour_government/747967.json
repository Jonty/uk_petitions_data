        "action": "Make Letterbox Contact a Legal Requirement for safe Birth Parents",
        "additional_details": "Currently, birth parents may get to send and receive only one letter per year, and this is not legally enforceable. Letters may be left ignored and not responded to, which can leave families heartbroken and disconnected; precious bonds at risk, and children suffering in the long term. Some research shows that adopted children with steady birth family contact can grow up more secure and emotionally healthy. The court should be able to block contact if it wouldn't be safe for the child.",
        "background": "We call for the reform of adoption laws to make letterbox contact a legal right for safe birth parents. This can bring reassurance & healing; for children, it can preserve identity, belonging & wellbeing. Some birth parents are allowed one letter a year, which, at present, is not legally enforceable",
