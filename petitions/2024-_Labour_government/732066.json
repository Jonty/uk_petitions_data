        "additional_details": "Many people work full-time yet still live in poverty, which we believe is due to low wages. Many parents struggle with high childcare costs. We believe the benefit cap unfairly punishes unemployed people trying to find work. Many are doing everything they can but can\u2019t find suitable jobs as they may not exist. We believe removing the cap, raising wages, and making childcare affordable could give people real chances to support themselves and their families without fear or hardship.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to raise the minimum wage to \u00a318\u201320 per hour, remove the benefit cap, and increase funding for childcare to make it affordable for working parents. We want a system that supports people fairly and does not penalise low-paid workers or those who are trying to find work. ",
