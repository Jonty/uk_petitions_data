The same areas being blobbed with tarmac where there are potholes, one being blobbed in and one 3m away being left - then the tarmac coming out, \"repairs\" not being sealed, road markings do not exist and are dangerous! Gullies left to become so blocked they have grass growing out of them, Roads never swept.\r\nWe need more power locally & deserve more for our money. This is the way to do it",
        "background": "Remove Lancashire County Council from all aspects of highways management/maintenance, including repairs and decision making. Restore control of our roads, pavements and gullies to LOCAL borough councils who should take more pride in their own area & improve conditions",
