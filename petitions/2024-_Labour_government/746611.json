        "additional_details": "France, parts of Australia and other countries have long since banned these cruel training practices and the UK should be at the forefront of animal welfare. We cannot call ourselves a nation of animal lovers whilst allowing the sale and use of cruelty to \u201ctrain\u201d or punish animals. Whilst I appreciate there are many humanitarian issues to change we cannot ignore the voiceless that are our best friends.",
        "background": "As a veterinary student and experienced rescuer I can provide evidence that force related training techniques cause trauma, anxiety, physical and emotional pain and distress to animals. As an animal loving society I find it incredible that these tools of torture are not yet banned here.",
