        "action": "Apply any new immigration rules only to new arrivals, not to UK residents.",
        "additional_details": "Applying new immigration rules to everyone has caused difficulties and deepened social divisions. UK residents feel unfairly targeted by the Immigration White Paper because of their low income, which is beyond their control.\r\nThe real solution is to detain illegal migrants humanely until their refugee status is granted and to conclude their asylum applications within one month by recruiting additional interviewing officers. If they wish to appeal, they should remain in the detention centre.",
        "background": "As proven by the failed policies of \u201cremoving the right to citizenship from some refugees\u201d and \u201cdelaying asylum applications,\u201d pressuring those already in the UK will not lead to voluntary returns. It only makes the lives of vulnerable people much harder and causes significant distress and anxiety.",
