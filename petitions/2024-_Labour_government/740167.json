Under the new Online Safety Act, harmful content is restricted for under-18s\u2014gambling ads should be too. Adults already know gambling exists, so advertising only serves to draw in vulnerable people, especially as many ads use gamification, bright colours, and flashy incentives clearly aimed at younger audiences and new potential gamblers.",

We believe that these adverts fuel addiction, harming individuals, families, and future generations. Gambling addiction is a serious public health issue with devastating and lasting consequences.",
