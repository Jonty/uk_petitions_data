        "action": "Review the 'Firearms Act 1968' to remove pepper spay as a prohibited weapon.",
        "additional_details": "Violence against women has been declared as a national emergency in England and Wales. And yet women and girls do not have access to adequate self-defence tools in the UK. As pepper spray is illegal they live in fear if they are attacked (as 1in3 women are) and defend themselves it is either not enough; or they may be prosecuted for using something as effective as pepper spray. Many European countries allow for the use of pepper spray (many need permits or have age restrictions) for self-defence",
        "background": "Currently pepper spray is classified as a prohibited weapon in the UK under the Firearms Act 1968. Which makes it illegal to possess, buy, or carry pepper spray. It should be declassified as a prohibited weapon in order for it to be used for self-defence only.",
