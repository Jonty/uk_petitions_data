We believe it could help counter misinformation, increase public understanding of tax and spending, and build trust in government.\r\n \r\nTo ensure full neutrality, the service would need to operate independently of ministers or civil servants, with oversight from a board of non-partisan experts in economics, journalism, and civic education.",
