        "additional_details": "We want Direct Democracy because the current system fails to represent the public\u2019s true will. Politicians often ignore voters after elections, passing laws that serve party interests, not the people. Direct Democracy would give citizens real control, restore trust in government, and ensure decisions reflect the majority. It's time for the public to have the final say on the issues that affect their lives\u2014regularly, not just once every few years.",
        "background": "We want the UK to transition from Representative to Direct Democracy. Let citizens propose, debate, and vote on laws via secure referendums or digital platforms. MPs should serve as facilitators, not decision-makers, ensuring the people have real power over national decisions.",
