        "action": "Ban balaclavas and ski masks",
        "additional_details": "Balaclavas and ski masks obstruct the identification of individuals in public spaces, posing a threat to public safety and security. It\u2019s crucial for law enforcement to identify people in situations involving crime or anti-social behavior. A ban would ensure that public spaces remain safe, holding individuals accountable and making it easier for authorities to act quickly and effectively when needed. This legislation would help maintain order and protect communities.",
        "background": "I am petitioning the government to ban the wearing of balaclavas & ski masks in public spaces. Balaclavas obstruct identification and pose a risk to public safety. They should not be allowed where clear identification is needed, such as on streets, in shops, or at events, for security reasons.",
