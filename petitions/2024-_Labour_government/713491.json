        "action": "An immediate cap on political donations to parties of \u00a350,000 per year.",
        "additional_details": "We believe that only those who invest in our democracy through paying tax (without using tax avoidance schemes) should invest in political parties. We also believe that a cap on donations will lead to more equity and less influence by individuals/organisations who are hostile to our democracy and the welfare of the British people.\r\nWe seek to enable more political engagement by ordinary British citizens and see this being debated as a step forward in this aim.",
        "background": "We, British citizens, beneficiaries of the actions of those who came before us who fought for the democracy we now live in, ask our government to take swift & decisive action to secure our democracy against new and hostile global influence in the form of inflated political donations.",
