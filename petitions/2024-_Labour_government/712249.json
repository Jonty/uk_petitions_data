        "additional_details": "Child Sexual Exploitation is a grave and pervasive issue that has devastated countless lives. Previous inquiries have been insufficient in addressing the depth of the problem or holding those responsible to account. A Royal Commission is necessary to uncover systemic failures, ensure justice for survivors, and implement reforms to protect future generations. It is imperative to restore public trust in institutions and uphold the fundamental right of every child to safety and dignity.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to establish a Royal Commission into Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE). This Commission should comprehensively investigate systemic failures across institutions, ensure accountability, and recommend actionable measures to prevent such atrocities in the future.",
