        "additional_details": "1. Financial Burden\r\nUniforms cost families unnecessarily. Most students already own suitable clothing.\r\n2. Discomfort and Impracticality\r\nUniforms are often uncomfortable and unsuitable for changing weather. Students focus better in clothes they can move in.\r\n3. No Proven Benefit\r\nResearch shows uniforms do not improve behaviour or academic performance.\r\n4. Limited Self-Expression\r\nStrict uniforms reduce students\u2019 ability to express themselves, affecting confidence and wellbeing.\r\n5. Fit Issues\r\nSizes often do not accommodate all body types, causing discomfort.\r\n6. Environmental Concerns\r\nUniforms are replaced frequently, creating waste. Normal clothes are more sustainable.\r\nWe ask the school to adopt a flexible dress code that supports comfort, affordability, and student welfare.",
        "background": "The government can reduce uniform pressures by setting clear rules that limit expensive branded items and allow affordable generic alternatives. By giving flexible, low-cost dress codes, the government can help ensure families aren\u2019t pushed into unnecessary spending and that all students are happy .",
