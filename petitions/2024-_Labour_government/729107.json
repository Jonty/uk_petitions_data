It's unfair that only private jet users currently have this option. Many countries (EU, US, Canada) allow it safely. Travel restrictions contribute to pet abandonment. Boarding/cargo is costly & stressful for owners. Solutions exist for allergies (limited pets/flight, HEPA filters, carrier rules, etc. This maintains all UK health/biosecurity standards.",
