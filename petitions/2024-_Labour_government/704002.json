        "additional_details": "The government and MPs should show solidarity with those struggling during the cost-of-living and energy crises by freezing or reducing their own salaries. Since 2020, MPs' pay has risen by over \u00a39,400, totalling around \u00a36.1 million. Meanwhile, vital services like healthcare, education, and local programs have faced severe cuts due to insufficient funding, with local government spending power down by 26% since 2010. Reducing MPs' pay could help ease these pressures.",
