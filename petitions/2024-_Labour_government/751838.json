        "additional_details": "I want the parliament to see how the situation is becoming even more pressing as the population of the UK continues to grow, and the spread of illnesses is increasing. As more people require hospital care, the current staff numbers are simply not enough. Patients are experiencing delays in accessing vital medical services, which can lead to worsened health and add pressure on healthcare workers.",
        "background": "I want the government to take action on how hospitals in the UK are currently lacking staff with around 1,148 hospitals in the UK and only 1.7 million staff members to accommodate over 22 million patients per year. This is putting tremendous pressure on staff in giving healthcare everyone deserves.",
