        "additional_details": "Being a Prime Minister is a hugely important role for representing the people against the Monarchy. To see a Prime Minister representing his Country while holding a title that makes her/him a serf to the King is laughable and makes a mockery of the Magna Carta.\r\nAny person taking on this huge role representing his/her people on the World stage should immediately hand back the title in respect of the fact they are serving the people.\r\nWe the undersigned wish to see this implemented.",
        "background": "We the undersigned believe that a serving Prime Minister should not be able to hold a peerage. \r\nIt causes conflict in our unwritten constitution with the House of Lords, and also it is a responsibility of the Prime Minister to represent his Country.",
