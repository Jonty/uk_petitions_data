        "additional_details": "Families with school-age children are often forced to travel during school breaks and holiday companies raise prices, in our opinion by huge amounts. We think this makes holidays unaffordable for many, leaving only wealthier families able to go away. We think a 20% cap would stop such large price hikes, making sure all families have a fairer chance to enjoy a break together. We feel holidays are important for family time, rest, and creating memories, and they shouldn\u2019t just be for those who can afford massive extra costs.",
        "background": "We want the Government to make it law that holiday companies can only raise prices by a maximum of 20% during school holidays. We feel families are currently unfairly charged because they are limited to travelling in school holidays. We feel it would make access to holidays fairer.",
