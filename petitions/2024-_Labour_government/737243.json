        "additional_details": "Before 2003, Jamaicans could visit the UK without a visa. Today UK citizens can still travel to Jamaica freely. We think the current rules are unfair and inconsistent, harming family ties despite Jamaica\u2019s deep historic contribution through Windrush. We think Restoring visa-free travel would honour our shared past and strengthen our future relationship.",
        "background": "For over 20 years, UK visa rules have kept many Jamaicans from visiting loved ones here. My family, like many others, has missed weddings, births, and final goodbyes. Jamaica\u2019s Windrush generation helped build the UK\u2014now we ask for the same trust and welcome in return.",
