        "additional_details": "I believe any MPs convicted of serious crimes undermine public trust. Current law only vacates a current MP\u2019s seat if given a custodial sentence longer than 12 months, and recall petition rules are limited. We believe the change suggested in this petition closes that gap, protects vulnerable people, and requires parties to vet candidates. It targets serious custodial offences only, balancing public safety with rehabilitation. ",
