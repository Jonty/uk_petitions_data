        "action": "Introduce a mechanism for the immediate removal of MPs involved in scandals.",
        "additional_details": "The public holds a strong expectation that their representatives act with integrity and accountability. The current system, which allows MPs involved in scandals to remain in Parliament as backbenchers while continuing to receive a salary, creates a perceived two-tier system of justice. This erodes public trust and suggests that MPs are not subject to the same standards as the rest of the working population, who would face immediate dismissal for similar conduct. A new system would uphold public confidence and ensure that elected officials are held to the highest standards of conduct.",
        "background": "The Government should create a formal process to remove MPs found to have been involved in a scandal, rather than allowing them to resign or be deselected at the next election. Such a process should include a mechanism for immediate suspension of pay and benefits, and full dismissal.",
