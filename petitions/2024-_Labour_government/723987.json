        "additional_details": "We believe smoking disposable e-cigarettes is a cheaper and healthier alternative than smoking and that reusable vapes do not have the same properties as disposables. We feel there are individuals who rely on disposable vapes to aid in their smoking cessation journey and who use them as a coping mechanism rather than alternatives. Some individuals may also not be able to have reusable vapes due to the high price bracket or for other reasons. We think the flavour is different too.",
        "background": "Cancel the ban on disposable vapes, and continue to allow 18+ to purchase. Stop the ban so people 18+ can continue to purchase, and to reduce the appeal to younger individuals have plain packaging like cigarettes. We feel they should not be banned for those who want to use them and are 18 plus.",
