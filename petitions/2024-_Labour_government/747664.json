        "additional_details": "High meat consumption can increase the risk of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes in children. It is estimated that animal agriculture generates 14.5% of global greenhouse emissions and can drive deforestation. It can cause immense animal suffering\u2014billions of chickens, pigs, and cattle confined in factory farms before slaughter. This regulation requires schools to support an industry which we feel is harmful to health, environment, and animal welfare. Schools should have freedom to serve sustainable, compassionate meals.",
        "background": "Remove the mandatory requirement in the Requirements for School Food Regulations 2014 requiring maintained schools and academies to serve meat or poultry three days per week. We believe this rule conflicts with environmental goals and health guidance on reducing meat consumption.",
