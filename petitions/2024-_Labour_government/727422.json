        "additional_details": "1. Grandfather existing Skilled Worker visa holders under the rules that were in place when they received their visas.\r\n2. Maintain the original 5-year ILR route.\r\n3. Provide clarity and protection for families and dependents already residing in the UK.\r\n4. Recognize the significant long-term financial and social planning that has already been made by these individuals.\r\n5. Thousands of skilled workers have made long-term financial commitments, including mortgages, family planning, and education.",
        "background": "We urge the government to exempt existing skilled workers from the newly introduced immigration rules, including the settlement period changes & job code restrictions. These individuals made life-changing decisions, such as relocating families, paying higher taxes, and contributing to the economy.",
