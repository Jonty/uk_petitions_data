Wes Streeting has praised physiotherapy and cited the profession in the ten-year health plan. We feel support for physiotherapy is needed to strengthen the NHS workforce, prevent longer waiting times and burn out. We believe new graduates are motivated, driven and passionate about delivering patient care but do not have the opportunities available to make a difference.",
