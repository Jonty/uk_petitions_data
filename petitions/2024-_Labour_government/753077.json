Children in care face insufficient standards of living, children from low income families are restricted in many aspects of life and so many other examples.Under article 48 children have the right to \"know their rights\" yet they are inadequately educated. Introducing children's rights into the curriculum will both help strengthen one right, while also protecting the most vulnerable in society through knowledge",

The government have a duty to protect children's rights under the UNCRC, but time and time again children are failed without the knowledge to confront it.",
