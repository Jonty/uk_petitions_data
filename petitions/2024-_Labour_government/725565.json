        "additional_details": "Birmingham's bin strike has resulted in over 21,000 tonnes of uncollected waste, posing health risks and highlighting systemic failures within the council. The dispute stems from pay cuts and role eliminations affecting refuse workers, following the council's financial mismanagement and equal pay liabilities. Residents, especially in deprived areas, suffer the consequences. Government intervention is necessary to ensure accountability and prevent future crises.\u200b",
        "background": "We urge the Government to investigate the causes behind Birmingham's prolonged bin strike, identify who is accountable, and explain how the council's decisions led to this crisis. The public deserves transparency and accountability for this failure in essential services.",
