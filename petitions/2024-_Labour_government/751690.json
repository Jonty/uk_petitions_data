        "additional_details": "We want Parliament and the government to protect Rushmere Jump Zone by recognising its value to young people, families, and the wider community. We ask them to step in, support funding, and work with local authorities to keep it open. This space helps people learn, stay active, make friends, and feel safe. Losing it would harm the community, so we urge the government to act now and secure its future.",
        "background": "Rushmere Jump Zone shouldn\u2019t close because it brings joy, helps people learn to ride safely, and creates a friendly community. It\u2019s a place where riders build confidence, improve skills, and make lasting friendships. Closing it would take away a valued, positive space for everyone.",
