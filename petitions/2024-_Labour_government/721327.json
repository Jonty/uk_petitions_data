        "additional_details": "The rhetoric blaming immigrants & benefit claimants must end. Benefits support survival-rent & food-money that goes to the wealthy who own land and corporations. We\u2019re heading into a pre-war financial strain: rising interest rates, increasing debt, and more wealth for the rich. Governments are bankrupt, & the public is indebted. The rich continue to buy more, driving up prices. We must implement wealth taxation on UK-held assets or face societal collapse. Taxing incomes over \u00a3100k won't fix this",
        "background": "Taxation should pivot to a more balanced approach. Income tax was designed when wealth shifted from landowners to the working class. Today, wealth is concentrated with asset owners, yet we still rely solely on an income tax system, which no longer reflects the current economic reality.",
