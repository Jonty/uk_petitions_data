        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to allow Carers to earn uncapped earnings and still receive the full amount of Carers Allowance, as long as they meet the condition of caring for at least 35 hours per week. I believe it will benefit those needing care, Carers and the Government as more people may be prepared to take up caring responsibilities. This could reduce the cost of paying for professional Carers and working Carers will pay income tax which can help the economy and more people could get care.",
        "background": "Those that receive Carer's Allowance & work part time are only allowed to earn a weekly set figure to be eligible, which may fall below minimum wage after taking into account additional caring costs. I believe those receiving carer's allowance should receive it whatever they are earning..",
