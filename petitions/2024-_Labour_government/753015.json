This could discriminate against the homeless, the elderly, the lesser educated and anybody who may not wish to own or carry a device. It could also accelerate the loss of human interaction. We believe it represents dangerous tech dependency too, with no analogue backup in the event of power/network failure or cyberattacks.",
