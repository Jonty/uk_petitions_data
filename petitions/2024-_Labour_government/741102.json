        "additional_details": "I have reached out to supermarkets, coffee shops and various other places and very few are willing to make these changes. I have now started a social media campaign and have found many other stoma users have the same difficulty, including in hospitals! With a high risk of infection when the stoma is exposed for an appliance to be changed. How is this acceptable.",
        "background": "There are often no facilities for stoma users in disabled toilets. Leaving us using the floor or the top of toilet seats for our appliances. This is not sanitary. I would like a legal requirement of a fold down shelf. This allows the shelf to be folded up so there is no impact on wheelchair users.",
