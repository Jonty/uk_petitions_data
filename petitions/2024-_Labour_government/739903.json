        "action": "Give chronically ill people more workplace protections",
        "additional_details": "Chronically ill employees require more time off work than their able-bodied coworkers, usually due to fluctuating symptoms, medical appointments and ongoing treatments. Despite this, chronically ill people are only allowed as much sick leave as someone who doesn't have to experience any of these things, putting them at an immediate disadvantage and leading to significantly higher rates of unemployment.\r\n\r\nWe need more protections to access and exceed in work, not to be forced out of it.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to impose mandatory workplace protections for chronically ill people, and to prevent businesses from subjecting them to strict absence policies that often result in punishment and dismissal. The Equality Act also needs to be more enforced.",
