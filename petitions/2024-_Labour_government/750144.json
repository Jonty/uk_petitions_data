        "additional_details": "There have been reports that some pharmacy businesses are changing the nominated pharmacy without patient consent or knowledge, potentially automatically renominating themselves in bulk using the technology available to them. This can result in confusion, inefficiency and delays to medication supplies. We believe it greatly impacts patient care and puts the EPS infrastructure at risk.",
        "background": "We want the government to explicitly ban NHS system suppliers, by law, from providing any technology that may enable pharmacies to switch patient EPS nominations without informed and current consent, or in bulk using automation, and make it illegal for pharmacies to engage in this practice.",
