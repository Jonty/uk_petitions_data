        "additional_details": "Trial by jury is a fundamental safeguard against state overreach and the potential for a single judge's bias to lead to a miscarriage of justice. It ensures the public retains a vital role in the justice system.\r\n\r\nRemoving this right for a vast number of cases erodes public trust and disproportionately endangers minorities and marginalized groups, who are more vulnerable to systemic bias. \r\n\r\nThis policy weakens justice, reduces liberty, and creates a less fair and less democratic society for all.",
        "background": "Reverse the recently announced policy to scrap jury trials for cases with sentences under three years.\r\n\r\nWe demand that Parliament instead codify and protect the right to a trial by a jury of one's peers for all criminal cases, reaffirming this centuries-old principle of British justice.",
