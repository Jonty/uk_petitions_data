        "action": "Extend the Recall of MPs Act to cover MPs who change or leave political party",
        "additional_details": "We believe that voters elect MPs based on both the individual candidate and the political party and manifesto they represent and that when an MP leaves, is expelled from, or switches party, the basis of that mandate changes. The Recall of MPs Act 2015 exists to protect democratic accountability. In our view, extending it to cover party defection would allow constituents to confirm or withdraw consent through an existing, voter-led process. This is the same democratic mechanism as in India.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to amend the Recall of MPs Act 2015 so that a recall petition is triggered when a Member of Parliament who stood for a political party leaves, is expelled from, or switches the political party from which they were elected.",
