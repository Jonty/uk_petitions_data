        "additional_details": "Despite Scotland successfully implementing a universal Baby Box programme since 2017, the rest of the UK has yet to follow suit. \r\nThe cost of living crisis continues to put pressure on families, and this would be a simple, cost-effective intervention.\r\nDesigned to offer a secure alternative to unsafe sleep environments, they can be packed with essential supplies.\r\nIn areas where Baby Box schemes are already in place in the UK, they have been hailed as a lifeline for families.",
        "background": "We would like the UK government to introduce a nationwide Baby Box scheme - like that which runs in Scotland - to provide parents with a baby's first bed and essential supplies.\r\nThis would help families give their children a safe and supported start in life.",
