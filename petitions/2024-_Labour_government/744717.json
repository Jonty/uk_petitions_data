        "additional_details": "We feel the current rules can cause daily frustration and confusion. Drivers turning into a road can often block those trying to exit, but we feel letting them out first wouldn't delay anyone. This can create unnecessary waiting, unpredictable behaviour, and potential safety issues when exiting drivers edge forward for visibility. We think the proposed change would improve traffic flow, simplify decision-making, and formalise courteous driving into law.",
        "background": "Amend the Highway Code so vehicles turning right into a road must give way to vehicles turning right out of that road (except at dedicated filter lanes). This would establish a new junction priority system which we think would reduce driver confusion & frustration, & improve traffic flow and safety.",
