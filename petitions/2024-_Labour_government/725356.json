        "action": "Reform the Compulsory Basic Training (CBT) motorcycle licencing process",
        "additional_details": "A 16 year old can obtain a CBT certificate and begin riding on public roads with minimal training, no requirement for a theory test, and without any advanced safety training. The fatality rate of youth drivers is alarmingly high many of these tragic incidents involve inexperienced riders who may not have received sufficient theoretical or practical instruction before riding solo. We need to focus on education and preparation.",
        "background": "Mandate the successful completion of a motorcycle theory test before a CBT certificate can be issued. Introduce council-supported or funded advanced rider safety and maneuverability training programs, particularly targeting young or new riders.",
