        "additional_details": "The inquiry needs to look at why and how these gangs were able to operate, the structure of the gangs and whether this is connected at a national level. It also needs to question the role of the police, NHS, Social Services, local government and national government as to why this was allowed to go on for decades without action being taken to stop it and why the political system seems to ignore the problem and dismissing at times the victims and their circumstances.",
        "background": "The scandal of Grooming Rape Gangs across the country has been going for some considerable time, and the public and victims need a full public inquiry.",
