        "additional_details": "As someone who had a clear smear test, then 3 years later discovered that I had severe pre-cancerous cells (resulting in colposcopies, biopsies & an operation under general anaesthetic to remove part of my cervix, leading to extremely bad mental health) I find this new rule of smear tests every 5 years totally wrong. I am proof that cell changes can dangerously escalate in 3 years, even when low risk. Had my smear test been 5 years later instead of 3, I'm honestly not sure I would be here today.",
        "background": "I believe the new NHS policy, which changes cervical smear tests to every 5 years for women aged 25\u201349 from 1st July 2025, should be abolished. Smear tests should continue to be offered every 3 years for women aged 25\u201364, and consideration should be given to starting them at an even younger age.",
