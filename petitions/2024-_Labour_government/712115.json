We think it is costly and counterproductive of our legal system to prosecute our young people (causing what can be devastating implications to them/their families) when we feel they are not provided with the legal knowledge and thinking/reasoning skills to enable them to make informed, law-abiding decisions. We think this could safeguard young people, reduce crime and reduce the burden on charities, criminal justice system and the tax payer.",
