        "additional_details": "There are efforts to remove abortion from criminal law, allowing abortion up to birth with few restrictions. This risks undermining the value of life, removing safeguards, and ignoring unborn rights. We urge the Government to uphold current laws and even criminalise abortion , support women in crisis, promote alternatives, and protect both mother and child.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to reject proposals to decriminalise abortion. Every unborn child has value and deserves protection. Keep legal safeguards in place and strengthen laws to defend the rights and dignity of the unborn. Life must be protected at all stages.",
