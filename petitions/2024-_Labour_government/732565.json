        "additional_details": "The frequent misuse of car horns, especially during early mornings or late at night, negatively affects families, children, shift workers and vulnerable individuals. We believe public awareness campaigns, signage, and potential enforcement would protect community wellbeing and restore quiet to our streets.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to introduce clearer guidance and potential penalties for unnecessary car horn use in residential areas. Horns should only be used to alert to immediate danger, yet they are often used out of frustration, disturbing communities and contributing to noise pollution.",
