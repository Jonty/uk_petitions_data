        "action": "Develop a long term plan to bring England\u2019s water companies into public control.",
        "additional_details": "Privatised water companies in England have accrued significant debt, failed to invest adequately in infrastructure, and contributed to widespread sewage pollution in rivers and seas. Despite rising bills, many companies prioritise shareholder returns over environmental and public outcomes.\r\n\r\nWater is a vital public good. Its management should serve the public interest, not private profit.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to develop a plan to return England\u2019s water to public control. A costed plan is needed which explores options like phased public shareholding, citizen investment schemes, and not-for-profit models. This plan must safeguard consumers, the environment, and long-term resilience.",
