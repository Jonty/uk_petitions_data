        "additional_details": "The UK government has set out a provisional \u00a323-46 million to spend on a statue of the late monarch. Considering that the Sovereign Grant already reaches nearly \u00a3100 million, and that the Windsors\u2019 private estate collects tens of millions more from the taxpayer in the form of rented out space to the NHS and schools, I do not believe it right for us to fund more of their projects.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to remove the current budget for a statue of Queen Elizabeth. The Windsor family can then pay for the statue themselves, and the \u00a323-46 million should be spent investing in the NHS.",
