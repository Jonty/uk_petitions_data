        "additional_details": "Remedial cladding work on many developments, following the Building Safety Act 2022, has left many leaseholders out of pocket due to increases to their insurance premiums (which may be passed to leaseholders in their service charges). We believe the Government should require all builders to pay for all costs associated with necessary remedial work. We believe it can be easily calculated by looking at the trend in past insurance increases each year and making builders pay the difference.",
