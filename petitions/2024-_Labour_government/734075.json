        "action": "Restrict illegal immigrants so they cannot wander freely around communities.",
        "additional_details": "We ask that you secure those arriving illegally into this country in facilities which do not allow unsupervised freedoms in our local communities and towns. Those who have entered this country illegally should not be allowed to wander freely within our local towns and cities. They should not be dispersed in private accommodation, posing even further risks to local people. British women and girls deserve to be protected and to be allowed to walk freely in our streets.",
        "background": "This year 23,000 people arrived into our country illegally. These people have no documentation, so we don't know who they are, and many come from countries which have different societal and ethical rules - especially around the treatment of women. This causes a security and safety risk.",
