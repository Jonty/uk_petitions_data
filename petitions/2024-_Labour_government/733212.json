We believe after the tragic loss of a child; two weeks is not enough time to bury or begin the grieving process. We believe there is no time limit on grief. We want this change to help parents feel like they matter.",

We believe this is not enough time to begin to grieve or plan and have the funeral before returning to work. We want to get the law changed so parents have more time to grieve after such a huge loss.",
