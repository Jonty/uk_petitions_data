Having this phrase on television encourages the use of it in every day use, which encourages the normalisation of it. To many people in the UK the name of Jesus Christ is our Lord and Saviour and to hear it as a swear word is deeply disturbing to all Christians. There is no justification for it to be used as a swear word",
