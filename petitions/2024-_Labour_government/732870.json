This can cause fatigue, dehydration, and reduced concentration, putting safety at risk. Some drivers may spend days living in these cabs. With more heatwaves due to climate change, we think legal protection is urgently needed.",

We want the Government to require air con in all new HGVs and vans and require existing air con systems in older vehicles to be maintained and operational to protect driver health and road safety.",
