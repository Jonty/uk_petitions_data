        "additional_details": "The RBA is currently carried out using a computer or tablet. Some parents and educators are concerned this introduces unnecessary screen time for 4-year-old children during a critical stage of development. There are concerns that digital delivery may interfere with teacher-child interaction, introduce bias based on digital familiarity, and fail to reflect best practice in early years education. We think schools should be given the flexibility to assess using age-appropriate, screen-free methods.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to remove the requirement for the Reception Baseline Assessment (RBA) to be delivered on a digital device. We think teachers should have more flexibility to administer the assessment without screens, using printed or hands-on materials where appropriate.",
