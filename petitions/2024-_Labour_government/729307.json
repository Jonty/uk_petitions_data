I believe my proposed change would allow for better and healthier relationships in schools and workplaces by giving many more the opportunity for a greater work life balance without potentially having to justify or be penalised for taking time off.\r\n \r\nI think it would also allow families to visit family abroad and give them enough time to celebrate with loved ones that they do not usually get an opportunity to visit.",

The dates for Eid can differ depending on the sighting of the moon, so I think providing up to 3 days would allow some flexibility.",
