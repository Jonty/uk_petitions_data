        "additional_details": "We think that for too long our politicians and elected officials make unilateral decisions not in line with their manifesto or the public interest or public good. We also don't think they take petitions into account when making decisions. Some petitions are heard in Parliament, but we feel there is not enough action. Therefore we think if a petition was to reach more than 650,000 votes we should hold a referendum on the subject to get a clear understanding of public\u2019s needs and interests. We think this could ensure fair balance, which we don't think we\u2019re seeing in today\u2019s government.",
