        "additional_details": "We believe MPs who are landlords have a direct financial interest in housing policy, which could create conflict when debating issues like rent control, eviction law, and housing standards. We feel public representatives should not personally profit from the housing market while shaping it. Banning MPs from being landlords could ensure decisions are made in the public interest, restore confidence in Parliament, and promote transparency and integrity in housing policymaking.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to introduce legislation preventing sitting MPs from being residential landlords. We believe MPs who profit from rental income are in a conflict of interest when voting on housing, rent, and tenant legislation, which may undermine public trust and fair representation.",
