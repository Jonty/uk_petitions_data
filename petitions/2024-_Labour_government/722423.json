        "additional_details": "Good health is a priceless gift we must protect and food plays a key role in that.\r\nLab-grown \"food\" is artificially made by applying chemical processes to harvested cells. The long term effects on humans are unknown. We do not want to be part of this experiment.\r\nSupermarkets waste a lot of food already. We do not need lab-grown food to add to the pile. Instead, we should protect our health, support local farmers, reduce future healthcare costs to the NHS and promote consumption of natural foods.",
        "background": "The UK government should make it illegal to make, sell, store (to prevent accidental distribution) and eat all lab-grown food. \r\n\r\nThey should protect our health by putting this ban in place and cancel all plans to introduce lab-grown food (meat, dairy, etc.) into the country for human consumption.",
