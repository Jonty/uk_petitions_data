        "action": "Get rid of the TV license requirement",
        "additional_details": "The TV licence no longer reflects how people consume media. Most households use multiple streaming platforms and on-demand services, making a mandatory fee for one broadcaster outdated. Parliament should replace the licence with a modern funding model that allows viewers to choose what they pay for, ensuring fairness, transparency, and alignment with today\u2019s digital media landscape.",
        "background": "I want Parliament to scrap the TV licence as it\u2019s outdated, unfair, and forces people to pay for the BBC even if they don\u2019t use it. In today\u2019s world of streaming and choice, funding should be voluntary, not a compulsory tax on households.",
