        "additional_details": "I believe the United Nations is a failure at global governance and serves no real purpose to the nation or the world. I fully believe in an idea of strong global governance however I think the UN is broken. By a security council nation leaving it could inspire reform of the UN or lead to a new system of global governance for the world. This is such an important time for this with Russia's actions and the tensions of the middle east which need to be solved and I think the UN cannot do that.",
        "background": "I believe that government should withdraw the UK from the United Nations, it doesn't work as a peacekeeping force and the only way to inspire it to change is for a key nation to leave and we should pioneer the change.",
