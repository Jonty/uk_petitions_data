        "additional_details": "This would bring the system closer to Scotlands where accepted offers are binding, reducing failed sales and giving buyers and sellers more certainty.\r\nIn England and Wales nearly a third of sales collapse after an offer is accepted causing wasted money, delays and stress. A binding commitment at the point of sale would:\r\nCut the number of failed transactions\r\nProtect both buyer and seller form wasted costs\r\nMake the process faster, fairer and more reliable\r\nIts time to modernise home buying",
        "background": "We call on the Government to reform home buying in England and Wales so that when a sale is agreed, the buyer must place a deposit. If either party withdraws for reasons other than genuine exceptional circumstances, they lose the deposit.",
