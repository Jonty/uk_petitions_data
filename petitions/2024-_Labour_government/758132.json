        "action": "Amend rule to permit small pets in cabin on EU/EEA-to-UK flights with safeguards",
        "additional_details": "Cargo-only air travel can be highly stressful for some pets and is not unsuitable for anxious, elderly or medically fragile animals and for some breeds with breathing difficulties. This pushes many owners into indirect travel (fly to near country, then enter GB by ferry or Eurotunnel), adding transfers and journey time. Indirect routes often rely on third-party transport services and can involve high fees. E.g. Ireland allows airlines to carry small pets in-cabin while import rules still apply.",
        "background": "Amend UK rules so small cats and dogs can travel in the cabin on EU/EEA-to-UK commercial flights (under-seat carrier). Keep biosecurity by requiring Pet Travel compliance and mandatory microchip/document checks on arrival.",
