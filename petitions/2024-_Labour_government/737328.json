        "additional_details": "We would like the Government to require car hire companies to provide safe child seats and impose steep fines against car hire companies that fail to provide safe or suitable car seats for children. \r\n \r\nAt the moment, we feel the market is not delivering for people with children who need to hire cars. Many customers cannot trust that when they arrive at the car hire centre, a safe and suitable seat will be available for their child. We believe this is especially challenging for people travelling alone with children, who may find themselves marooned at the airport. We believe there is a gap in accountability for car hire companies.",
        "background": "Many parents who hire cars have persistent problems with child car seats being unsafe, unsuitable, or provided without appropriate fitting instructions. ",
