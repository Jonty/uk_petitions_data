        "additional_details": "I believe that Right to Buy currently makes homeownership hard and depletes social housing, worsening the housing crisis, extending waiting lists, and pushing many people into expensive private rentals. I think more sustainable discounts and guaranteed one-for-one replacement would balance tenant homeownership dreams with preserving vital affordable homes. In my view, it would help ensure public assets serve public good, not private profit, securing housing for future generations across the UK.",
        "background": "Introduce more sustainable Right to Buy discount levels for tenants and reverse recent discount cuts. Legally require & fully fund one-for-one replacement of all social homes sold with new social rent properties in the same local area. Introduce stricter resale conditions.",
