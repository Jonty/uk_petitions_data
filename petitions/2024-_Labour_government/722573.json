        "additional_details": "Slough Borough Council is imposing Controlled Parking Zones (CPZs) despite strong public opposition. In Baylis and Stoke ward, 1,420 signed a petition and 550 objected, yet the council ignored them. These schemes seem financially motivated, not based on parking needs. We demand a government investigation into whether CPZs are being unfairly imposed to generate revenue rather than solve real parking issue",
        "background": "We demand the government step in and halt the permit parking scheme. Slough Council was allowed to run unchecked, leading to bankruptcy, yet residents bear the cost. We should not be penalized for the council\u2019s poor decisions. This parking scheme is just another way to generate income from us.",
