        "additional_details": "Children in Portsmouth are being left in unsafe homes due to underfunded social services. Overworked staff can't respond fast enough, and vital support is delayed or denied. Without urgent funding and reform, more children will suffer harm that could have been prevented. As someone who has experienced abuse firsthand, I know how it feels to be isolated and beyond rescue. But I want children across Portsmouth to know they are not alone \u2014 there is always someone ready to stand by their side and fight for their safety.",
        "background": "We are urgently calling on the UK Government and Parliament to increase funding for children\u2019s social services, review the impact of underfunding on child protection, invest in early intervention, and improve support for social workers to protect vulnerable children in Portsmouth.",
