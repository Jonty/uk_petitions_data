        "additional_details": "I\u2019ve been on a Skilled Worker visa for 3 years and have 2 years left to qualify for ILR. I\u2019ve followed every rule, paid taxes, and contributed fully to the UK. Changing ILR requirements mid-way creates unfairness and uncertainty. Parliament must allow those already on the ILR pathway to complete it under the original rules, ensuring fairness, stability, and recognition of the commitment skilled migrants have made to the UK.",
        "background": "Skilled migrants in the UK face uncertainty due to sudden changes in ILR route periods, despite years of contribution. Many have built their lives around original rules. We urge the government to honour the original ILR terms for current Skilled Worker visa holders, ensuring fairness and stability.",
