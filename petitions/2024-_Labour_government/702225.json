        "additional_details": "Making overtime pay tax-free would provide financial relief to workers struggling with rising living costs, incentivise part-time staff to work extra hours, and address critical labour shortages. This policy would boost disposable incomes, increase productivity, and strengthen the UK economy overall.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to make overtime pay tax-free. This would support workers facing rising costs, encourage part-time staff to take on extra hours, and help fill labour shortages. By allowing workers to keep their full overtime earnings, it would boost incomes and drive economic growth.",
