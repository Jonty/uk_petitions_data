        "additional_details": "Under the Act, the House of Lords cannot stop legislation, and we believe this leaves the government unchecked. We think the Government is losing public trust due to unpopular policies, and that this unchecked power undermines democracy. We believe that revoking the Act would restore a necessary balance, ensuring laws are scrutinised and not rushed through by a single-party majority. It's time Parliament prioritised the people's voices over political convenience and brought back real accountability to protect our future.",
        "background": "We believe that this Act left the House of Lords unable to effectively challenge poorly thought-out legislation, allowing governments to force through unpopular laws. We think there is widespread discontent with government decisions and restoring a proper check on power is vital.",
