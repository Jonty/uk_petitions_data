        "additional_details": "We also want the review to consider how immigration policy can better align with domestic labour needs.\r\n \r\nWe believe outsourcing has caused job losses, weakened UK industries, and harmed local economies. We think communities face stagnant wages, rising inequality, and reduced public services. We think outsourcing makes the UK reliant on overseas labour and supply chains, which could reduce resilience and competitiveness.\r\n \r\nWe think that limiting outsourcing could help rebuild the UK economy, support workers, and ensure a more secure and fair future.",
        "background": "We want the Government to review the impact of outsourcing of UK jobs and services abroad. We want the review to look into alternatives such as more support for key sectors like manufacturing, IT, and healthcare through local investment, job creation, and skills training.",
