        "action": "Ban Single-Use Plastic Packaging for Fruit and Vegetables in UK Supermarkets",
        "additional_details": "Plastic pollution is an environmental issue. Despite growing awareness, UK supermarkets package large quantities of fresh produce in single-use plastic. Contributing to plastic waste, which ends up in landfills, incinerators or our environment. There are sustainable alternatives, including compostable or reusable containers & loose produce options. The UK must follow in the footsteps of other countries, to reduce plastic waste, protect our environment, & lead the way to a sustainable future.",
        "background": "I am asking the UK Government to ban the use of single-use plastic packaging for fresh fruit and vegetables in all supermarkets and encourage the retail sector to adopt environmentally responsible alternatives.",
