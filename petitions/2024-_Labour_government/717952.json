        "additional_details": "This could include building into the algorithm specific features that will detect hedgehogs and avoid harming them.\r\n\r\nCurrently hedgehogs are killed in large numbers by cars. Hedgehogs are considered a near threatened species in Britain (IUCN red list). We think that if the Government commits at this early stage to insist that manufacturers put hedgehog protection measures into their driverless car algorithms, it could help save this much loved native species and would entail no cost to the government.",
