        "additional_details": "The UK public have not had a say on the adoption of digital ID, considering the impact this holds on every single individual in the UK, it\u2019s only right that the public have the opportunity to vote. It\u2019s already clear that a large amount of the population are not in favour considering the recent petition to scrap the idea completely, gaining support in the millions in a very short amount of time. The GOV must act accordingly and in the interest of the majority by allowing a vote to take place.",
        "background": "It\u2019s clear that despite a clear and huge divide amougnst the general public, the government are intent on bringing in mandatory digital ID. This is undemocratic as it wasn\u2019t featured in the GOV\u2019s manifesto and should be for the majority to decide, considering its impact on the whole UK.",
