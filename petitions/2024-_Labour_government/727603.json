        "additional_details": "UK had welcomed foreign nurses and care workers during COVID pandemic and they did a commendable job. We so much rely on foreign staff for delivering essential services in the NHS. \r\n\r\nThe proposed changes which were announced recently would mean that they have to remain double the time to gain settlement status and it would be unfair for such families. It seems they are being penalised. \r\n\r\nThe govt is urged to exempt the existing health and social care visa holders from this proposed change",
        "background": "As the immigration policy is reviewed, the government is urged to ensure that they are fair in setting up rules for the migrants who are already living in the U.K. on health and social care visa and for their dependents. It is unfair to increase the time required for citizenship midway.",
