If loud music is causing a nuisance, residents can submit a complaint to their local council who will investigate and potentially serve an abatement notice. Find more information about how councils deal with noise complaints here: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/noise-nuisances-how-councils-deal-with-complaints \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do, such as asking for the law to be changed around playing music at night in residential properties.
