We think people should be able to enjoy a visit to the beach without having to sit amongst litter and other detritus that has been washed ashore. We think funding litter picking facilities would encourage and enable visitors to clean up safely, and dispose of any rubbish easily. We think our beaches are beautiful! We think we need to keep them that way by encouraging the public to care for and take responsibility for our shores.",
