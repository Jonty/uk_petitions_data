        "additional_details": "We believe that it is unfair that former PMs, even those serving only weeks or leaving office in failure, can claim \u00a3115k per year for life. We do not think that taxpayers should fund what we see as lifelong perks for those who failed in their duty. We think reform will ensure only long-serving, responsible leaders get limited, justified support for genuine public duties.",
        "background": "Reform the Public Duty Costs Allowance for ex-Prime Ministers. Set a 2-year minimum term in office for eligibility, remove entitlement if they resign in disgrace or are judged to have caused harm, make the allowance time-limited to 10 years, and cut the \u00a3115k cap to reflect only essential costs.",
