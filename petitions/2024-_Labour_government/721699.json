        "additional_details": "Parliament is seeking to spend less on welfare and make PIP stricter, but in 2022, 69 individuals committed suicide with part of the cause being benefit assessments.\r\n\r\nDisabled people are living in poverty, when they could be using PIP to boost the economy.\r\n\r\nWe should live in a society that looks after the weak, but instead we have ostracised them. Being disabled isn\u2019t a choice, but the Government putting them into poverty and generating a public hatred campaign is a choice.\r\n\r\nIncrease PIP awards.",
        "background": "Increase the remit of who can receive PIP.\r\n\r\nCurrently the eligibility criteria is too strict and it prevents awards in cases where expenditure exists due to a disability.\r\n\r\nThe usage of the eligibility criteria is degrading, inhumane and cruel.\r\n\r\nDiagnoses prove a disability exists already.",
