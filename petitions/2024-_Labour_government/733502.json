        "additional_details": "Many long-term tenants have paid rent for years and looked after their homes, yet they are now priced out of buying them because the Right to Buy discount has been reduced or removed. This policy helped millions achieve homeownership and financial stability. Bringing it back would give hardworking renters a fair chance to own the homes they\u2019ve built their lives in, promote stronger communities, and make the housing market fairer and more accessible for everyone.",
        "background": "I want the government to reinstate full Right to Buy discounts for long-term council and housing association tenants, making homeownership more affordable and giving renters a fair chance to buy the homes they\u2019ve built their lives in.",
