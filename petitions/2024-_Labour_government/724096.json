        "additional_details": "We believe that defence lawyers can exploit loopholes to delay justice and that delays in convictions force victims to relive trauma. We feel that abusers can manipulate the system to avoid accountability thereby re-traumatising survivors. We want the Government to review and reform the justice system to make changes.\r\nSome ideas for reform include: \r\n- Faster convictions for domestic and sexual abuse cases \r\n- Stronger bail conditions",
        "background": "We feel that too many victims of domestic abuse, sexual violence, and coercive control are suffering because our justice system is slow, ineffective, and can fail to protect them. We believe that some perpetrators are walking free without consequences and that this needs to change.",
