        "additional_details": "The current legislation has been in place since 1983 and we feel it has become outdated and misleading in 2025. The maximum commission that the Park Owner can request was set in 1983 at 10% and remains the same today. \r\n\r\nThe Government commissioned an independent survey on the subject in 2021 and the findings of that survey were submitted to the Government in June 2022. Since then there has been no decisions made to make changes to the 40 year old legislation or not. We feel that promises made have not been kept.",
