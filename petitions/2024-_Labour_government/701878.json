Renaming them would reflect their true nature, improve geographical accuracy, and end unnecessary confusion for travelers and map users. This symbolic change would also highlight the importance of accurate representation in geography.",

This would correct the historical misnomer, as Greenland is icy, and Iceland is greener. The name swap would improve geographical accuracy and reduce confusion in education and travel.",
