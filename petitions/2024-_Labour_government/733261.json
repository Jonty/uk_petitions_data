        "additional_details": "We urge the Government to fund a national memorial to show these people had value and deserve to be remembered. We believe it'll honour those who've died and been lost, returning dignity to their memory, and may act as a focal point to inspire communities who want to honour these gravesites locally, conduct historic research, and use public records to build a clear picture of who lies within them. We also believe it could help tackle historic shame and stigma and right a historic wrong.",
        "background": "Thousands of people died in Victorian-era mental health hospitals and many of their bodies were not claimed by next of kin. Many were buried in unnamed pauper burial plots. Many burial sites are unmarked, neglected, or may even be sold, which we believe dooms patients to an eternity of anonymity.",
