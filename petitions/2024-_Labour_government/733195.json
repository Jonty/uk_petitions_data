Involving UK citizens in decisions that could lead to war ensures we do not enter conflict without public consent. This could prevent future wars, reduce the human cost, restore democracy, foster peace, and ensure actions reflect the will of the people. By requiring a referendum before any military action or foreign intervention, we prioritise public involvement in matters of war and peace.",

This would ensure real democratic control and help prevent unnecessary, harmful conflicts driven by political, corporate, and geopolitical interests. ",
