        "action": "For the UK Government to ban the Nazi or 'Roman salute', as Germany has done.",
        "additional_details": "The Nazi or 'Roman salute' is a symbol of hate, extremism, and fascism that has no place in a modern, inclusive society. Its use glorifies oppressive ideologies, promotes division, and causes distress to many, particularly those affected by historical atrocities. Banning this gesture, as Germany has, would send a clear message that hate and extremism will not be tolerated in the UK. It would also help protect public safety, maintain societal harmony, and uphold the dignity of all citizens.",
        "background": "Ban the Nazi or 'Roman salute' in the UK, as Germany has done, to combat hate and extremism. This offensive gesture promotes fascism and undermines societal harmony. Criminalising it would show a firm stance against hate and protect the dignity and safety of all citizens.",
