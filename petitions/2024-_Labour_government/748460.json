        "additional_details": "Many children with dyslexia are not identified early enough to get the support they need. Without early screening, children can struggle with reading and learning, lose confidence, and experience anxiety at school. Currently parents are expected to pay privately for testing which is not something that everyone can afford. Every child deserves the chance to thrive, and early dyslexia screening can make a real difference to their education and mental health.",
        "background": "We are calling on the Government to provide funding for early dyslexia screening in all primary schools. Early identification allows teachers and parents to give children the right support from the start, improving literacy, wellbeing, and long-term learning outcomes.",
