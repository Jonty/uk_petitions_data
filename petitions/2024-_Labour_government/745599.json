        "additional_details": "Former ECAA visa holders came to the UK legally under the Ankara Agreement, investing, paying taxes, creating jobs, and contributing to the economy. After Brexit, we were promised fair treatment under the same terms. Extending ILR eligibility from 5 to 10 years breaks that promise, creates uncertainty, and punishes qualified people who have built their homes, families, and businesses in the UK in good faith. We call on the Government to honour its commitment and maintain the 5-year route to ILR.",
        "background": "We ask the UK Government to keep the 5-year route to Indefinite Leave to Remain for former ECAA (Turkish Businessperson) visa holders. Extending it to 10 years breaks previous commitments and unfairly affects those who built lives and businesses in the UK.",
