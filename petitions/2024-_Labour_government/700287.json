        "action": "Bring in a bill now to properly phase out and ban trail hunting by October 2025",
        "additional_details": "For far too long now, far too many wild animals as well as domestic animals have been killed during trail hunts and too many hounds have been shot in the head by hunts when they are no longer wanted. It is time to end this! Bringing in a bill now to properly ban trail hunting and close all the loopholes in existing legislation by October 2025 will allow all the hunts to properly re-home all of their hounds and horses to good homes as well as save treasured wildlife and people's beloved pets.",
        "background": "Despite there being a pledge in Labour's election manifesto to ban trail hunting, no such bill has yet been created or introduced to do that despite high public opinion wanting it banned.",
