        "action": "Stop the proposed changes to PIP eligibility",
        "additional_details": "Many disabled people experience cumulative challenges across multiple areas of daily living, which can be as disabling as a single severe impairment. The proposed change ignores fluctuating and intersecting conditions, unfairly excluding people who need support. This will push more people into poverty, dependence, and ill health, increasing strain on families and public services. We urge Parliament to maintain a PIP assessment that at least partly reflects the real experiences of disabled people",
        "background": "We urge Parliament to reject the proposed change to PIP eligibility, which would require a score of at least 4 points in a single category. Instead, PIP should continue to recognise cumulative difficulties across multiple areas, ensuring fair access for those with complex and fluctuating conditions.",
