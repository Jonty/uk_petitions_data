        "additional_details": "The IBDP has over 200,000 global graduates each year. IBDP students take 6 subjects in different 'groups' as well as Theory of Knowledge, write a 4000-word essay (EE) and engage in extracurriculars (CAS) to pass.\r\n\r\nIBDP graduates are increasingly sought after by employers and universities because of the skills they develop, such as critical thinking and enquiry. The government's plan to cut funding for the IBDP in state schools limits choice for those who can't afford it.",
        "background": "We want the government to reverse its decision to cut funding for the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) in state schools. The IBDP is a rigorous and internationally recognised post-16 qualification that encourages students to think critically, holistically and globally.",
