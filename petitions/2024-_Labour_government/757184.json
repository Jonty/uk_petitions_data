        "additional_details": "In history, leaders who feared facing voters delayed, cancelled, or hollowed\u2011out elections to stay in power. Castro, Hitler, and Stalin all did this. Recent UK actions allow councils to delay votes for reorganisation, undermining people\u2019s right to vote. Elections must happen on schedule; reorganisation can wait for the next cycle. The right to vote must come first \u2014 never postponed for convenience.",
        "background": "We call on the government to make postponement of elections impossible except in a genuine national emergency, and that any such postponement must be approved by Parliament, ensuring no Prime Minister or minister can delay elections on their own.",
