        "additional_details": "There are many care workers in the UK who do not have many working hours, and there are many jobs that are not being filled as many companies don\u2019t offer sponsorships. There is also a lack of healthcare workers yet there are, what I believe, an adequate number of people to fill these jobs.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to scrap the need for sponsorship for overseas healthcare workers already in the UK who want to switch jobs, so companies can give contracts of employment to people already here. Many people can\u2019t switch to working for other companies as they are not offered sponsorship",
