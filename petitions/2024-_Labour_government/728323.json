        "additional_details": "UK law requires pets to arrive as manifest cargo via approved routes - costly and unsuitable for many animals. Yet, pets from Ireland can enter without these rules, and Ireland allows in-cabin travel for inbound flights. This inconsistency causes stress and unfair costs. Updating UK rules would promote animal welfare, fairness, and policy consistency.",
