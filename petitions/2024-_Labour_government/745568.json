This has led to the public being ignored \r\n\r\nThe public petition the government for change and to express their voice. But instead of doing their job by doing as the public is asking (which is their job), they shut down our concerns and tell us we're wrong. They then proceed against public wishes with their plan.",

When 1 million+ people express concerns via petition, then it should be taken to the public to judge. The final decision should not be made by politicians, but by the public.",
