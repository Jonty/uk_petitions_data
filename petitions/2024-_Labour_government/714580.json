        "additional_details": "The frequency and repetitive nature of on-board train announcements has now reached an intolerable level. Being told the same thing multiple times per journey is un-necessary and unwelcome noise pollution. It particularly affects older people who have less capacity to filter out unwanted noise. People should be left in peace during journeys.  At the very least, a quiet coach should be provided on every service where passengers can escape from the unwanted noise.",
