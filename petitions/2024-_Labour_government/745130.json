        "additional_details": "Recommended daily caffeine intakes are 400 mg for adults and 200 mg for pregnant women, but consumers cannot reliably use product labels to help track intake. Excess caffeine risks can include heart palpitations, anxiety, insomnia, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. We think mandatory labelling\u00a0 would help empower safe, informed choices and protects public health. We want clearer caffeine labelling (mg per 100 g and per serving) to help protect health.",
        "background": "Pre-packed coffee in the UK (instant, ground, filter) does not have to show caffeine content, unlike energy drinks or medicines with over 150mg of caffeine per litre. We feel consumers like pregnant women and heart patients therefore can't track intake safely.",
