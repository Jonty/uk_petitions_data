Only 58% of the electorate were aware that there is a voter authority certificate, which was mirrored by their low uptake. \r\nI think it is unforgivable and unacceptable that such a huge proportion of the electorate could be disenfranchised through what I think is a cruel and unnecessary attack on a fundamental right and pillar of democracy. Those with disabilities, the unemployed, people without qualifications, and non-voters were all less likely to hold any form of photo ID.",
