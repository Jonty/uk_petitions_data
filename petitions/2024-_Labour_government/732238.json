        "additional_details": "We think victims of number plate cloning are being unfairly fined by local councils through PCNs for offences they did not commit. The current appeal system is often automated, with no direct way to speak to a council officer, and can leave innocent motorists presumed guilty and threatened with bailiffs. We ask the government to make it a legal requirement for councils to provide direct, accessible contact for PCN disputes, and uphold the principle of innocent until proven guilty.",
        "background": "Require councils to offer direct Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) contacts, facilitate fairer appeals, and better protect victims of cloned number plates. We feel councils can issue PCNs with limited options for appeal or discussion. ",
