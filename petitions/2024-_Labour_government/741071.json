We believe a tax cut would increase take-home pay, reduce financial pressure, and boost the economy by encouraging spending.\r\nWe think millions of workers across the UK are struggling with inflation, high energy bills, and rising mortgage or rent costs, and that a reduction in income tax would directly benefit workers, increase consumer confidence, and stimulate growth.\r\nWe call for urgent and fair action to ease the tax burden on working people\r\n",
