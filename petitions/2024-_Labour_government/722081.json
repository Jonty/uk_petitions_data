        "additional_details": "Justice should be equal for all, not determined by identity. These guidelines undermine the principle that the law applies fairly and equally to everyone, regardless of background. Sentences should be determined solely on the crime committed and its impact on victims. You must ensure equal sentencing for all offenders, based on the severity of their crime rather than their identity and reject guidelines that create disparities in sentencing based on race, gender, or other personal factors.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government and Sentencing Council to reject the proposed sentencing guidelines that introduce different sentencing considerations based on ethnicity, gender, or other personal characteristics.",
