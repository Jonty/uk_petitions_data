Enhanced collaboration between British and international authorities is significant. We believe a formal framework would provide better advice for the repatriation procedure and other services to alleviate isolation for the victims' families.",

Consistent assistance from British embassies is necessary regarding which actions should be taken when a family encounters such tragedy abroad.",
