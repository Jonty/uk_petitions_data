        "additional_details": "A site between the River Cherwell and the A34, on an active floodplain has become the dumping ground for tens of thousands of tonnes of illegal waste. \r\nThe Environment Agency (EA) has been aware of this site since May 2025, yet the waste mound has been allowed to grow to catastrophic proportions. \r\nWe are calling on the UK Government, Parliament, and the Environment Agency to take immediate and coordinated action to prevent further environmental, ecological, and public health harm.",
        "background": "Direct the EA to secure the site, and enforce action. Provide ring-fenced funds, a clear clean-up timetable, and full transparency. Protect the Cherwell and Thames from toxic gases, poisonous leachate, and escalating plastic pollution.",
