        "additional_details": "The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse report in 2022, barely mentioned grooming gangs.\r\n\r\nWe demand a national inquiry to uncover the truth and to bring to justice all the perpetrators involved, from the groomers to the ones who covered up these heinous crimes.\r\n\r\nA recent YouGov poll showed 76% of Britons in favour of a national inquiry into grooming gangs.  Protecting children should be our top priority.  \r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition for a national inquiry on the grooming/rape gangs.",
        "background": "We need a government led national inquiry into the grooming/rape gangs that have preyed on children, primarily white British girls for many decades and are still likely to be continuing today, by the hands of mainly Pakistani heritage men.  The victims and their families need justice.",
