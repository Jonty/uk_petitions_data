        "additional_details": "Chalk streams are among the rarest freshwater habitats globally, with over 85% located in England, primarily in the south. These streams provide crystal-clear, mineral-rich water that maintains a stable temperature year-round, supporting a diverse range of flora and fauna (brown trout, water voles, kingfishers, and crowfoot).\r\n\r\nHowever, they face significant threats from pollution and over-abstraction of water. We believe they should be protected for future generations.",
        "background": "We think the chalk stream recovery pack would increase investment, regulation and transparency; improving the state of all rivers. We feel Chalk streams\u2019 rarity, cultural and ecological importance should make them a priority for conservation, sustainable water management and restoration initiatives.",
