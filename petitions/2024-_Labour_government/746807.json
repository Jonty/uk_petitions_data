        "additional_details": "Studies show that children regardless on when they are advised to sleep they sleep at around 11-12pm and wake up at 7:30am. Making the school timetable 1 hour ahead would allow students to fit in more sleep in their schedule and allow them to be more on time. Other studies show that in countries where school starts at 9:30am their students actually come in and focus whereas in the UK most students do not come in the mornings exactly for this reason, \"More Sleep\".",
        "background": "Most people nowadays bunk school mornings because it begins too early, to combat this the government should make it mandatory for all schools to start from 9:30am to 4:30pm. Not only would this encourage students to not bunk their morning lessons but it would also increase students focus in lesson.",
