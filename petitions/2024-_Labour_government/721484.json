        "additional_details": "People deserve a government that delivers on promises and truly represents their needs, not one that just makes hollow campaign pledges. By enforcing transparent, trackable commitments and enforcing consequences for failing, we ensure accountability and restore trust. Banning second jobs and exposing lobbying prevent corruption, while direct recall empowers voters to remove those who don't deliver. This ensures leaders keep working for us, strengthening democracy through direct accountability.",
        "background": "We want the government to make parties keep the promises they campaign on, not just use empty PR to win votes. They must post all progress online, remove those who fail, hold regular approval checks, ban second jobs, make lobbying transparent, removing bad MPs, and teach people how government works.",
