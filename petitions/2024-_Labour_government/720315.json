        "additional_details": "There are rumours that the government will reduce the ISA allowance to an insulting total of \u00a34,000. This will not benefit the working, lower middle and middle class, as it's the only tax efficient way to save and invest with the current \u00a320,000 allowance. The allowance include the lifetime ISA and if they were to change will create even more disparity between the old and rich and the young and poor who are only just trying to find their feet/build a life in this country.",
