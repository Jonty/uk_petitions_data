        "additional_details": "Families struggle to find alternative childcar Preschools are vital community assets that provide essential early childhood education and care, laying the foundation for future academic success and social development. When preschools face closure, the impact extends far beyond the immediate loss of a learning environment. Families struggle to find alternative childcare, often disrupting work schedules and placing additional financial strain on households. Children may experience setbacks in their development, missing out on crucial opportunities to build social skills, cognitive abilities, and emotional resilience. Moreover, the closure of a preschool can have a ripple effect on the local economy, affecting jobs and reducing the availability of early childhood services for the community.",
