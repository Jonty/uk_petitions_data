There have been regulations within the housing industry for years with regards to door widths, access routes, activity spaces etc so why not for the leisure industry?\r\n \r\nThere are electronic steps on many new caravans/motorhomes to assist non-disabled people to gain access, so why can't the same courtesy be extended to disabled people too?",
