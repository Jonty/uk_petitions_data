        "additional_details": "On 30th January, 2025, the Government's '2025 mandate to NHS England' was published. Healthcare for women, and those assigned female at birth, was completely sidelined. We make up 51% of the population, are the biggest users of health and social care, and make up the majority of the, paid and unpaid, workforce propping up the healthcare system. And yet no attention was given to addressing the historic, and worsening, gender health gap that currently exists.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to honour its manifesto pledge, prioritising healthcare for women and those assigned female at birth. Invest in clinical education, research and infrastructure to reduce the gender health gap in the upcoming Spending Review, NHS 10 year plan and  the Women's Health Strategy.",
