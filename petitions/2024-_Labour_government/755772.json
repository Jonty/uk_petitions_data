Without a battery installation, the full energy efficiency savings of \u00a31350/year (3 bed home) will not be realised to help people combat the cost-of-living crisis. Taxpayers/consumers will instead need to pay more to deliver the equivalent of two nuclear power stations in new electricity generating capacity. Please stand firm!",
