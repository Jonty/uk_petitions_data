        "action": "Give children unrestricted access to toilets while in secondary school education",
        "additional_details": "Medical research shows that it takes 30 minutes after eating and drinking for the effects of needing the toilet to present, this does not coincide with breaktimes. If a young person is holding their bladder or bowel they are not concentrating on the lesson which may impact on future exams. Young girls and transgender boys should not have to explain to teachers they need to use the toilet due to menstruation this can have detrimental impacts on their mental health and wellbeing.",
        "background": "Create nationwide guidance that prohibits schools from restricting access to toilets. Allowing inclusion for all, without young people having to show proof of medical conditions. The current school policies discriminate against all young people without a medical condition.",
