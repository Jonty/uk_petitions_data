        "additional_details": "This petition proposes that the Government should regulate the intensity of headlights in the interests of public safety.\r\n\r\nLED lights, with a cooler colour temperature, are becoming standard issue on newer vehicles. They often do not appear to be angled, filtered, or otherwise adjusted adequately for the safety of other road users.\r\n \r\nMany comments are on the blinding effect these lights have, both from oncoming traffic, but also when approached from the rear. The colour temperature, which has more blue light, is known to cause eye strain.\r\n \r\nIt is a particular irritant for drivers with single or double astigmatism.",
        "background": "Online discourse indicates that a growing number of drivers are adversely impacted by the proliferation of excessively bright LED headlights, which impair the vision other road users.",
