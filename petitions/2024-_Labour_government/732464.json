        "additional_details": "We think physiotherapy graduates deserve fair access to employment and experience. Some applying for assistant roles to get experience may be rejected for being overqualified. Even private jobs may ask for NHS experience. We think this leaves graduates stuck and unable to start their careers. We\u2019re calling for a review of Band 5 recruitment and better support to help newly qualified physiotherapists enter the workforce. We believe roles should be made more accessible to external applicants without NHS experience.",

Some apply for assistant roles or private jobs but may be rejected for being overqualified or lacking NHS experience. We want a review and better support into practice.",
