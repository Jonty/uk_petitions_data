        "action": "Create a statutory body to oversee university academic appeals",
        "additional_details": "We think students deserve fair, evidence-based grades and the right to challenge any serious procedural failures. We feel that at some universities marks may be lowered through peer review without enough evidence, which could impact a student\u2019s final degree classification. Yet in our view, there is currently not an adequate way to appeal this. The Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA), which handles university complaints can take months, has limited powers, and public trust is low, which we think reflects serious student dissatisfaction. We believe earlier, enforceable oversight is needed so students are not left powerless.",
        "background": "Introduce an external body with the power to oversee university appeals in real-time, not just after issues arise. This must include clear deadlines and enforceable consequences if universities make serious or repeated errors.",
