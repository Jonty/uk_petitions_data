        "additional_details": "Neurodivergent individuals often face lower lifetime earnings, higher debt rates, and increased financial penalties due to executive dysfunction.\r\n\r\nThese fines are not due to neglect or intent to avoid obligations\u2014they result from systemic barriers that exacerbate financial inequality.\r\n\r\nEnacting this reform would reduce discrimination, align with Equality Act principles, and offer practical support to those facing hidden, avoidable costs.",

This unfair burden, commonly referred to as the \u201cADHD Tax,\u201d compounds existing financial disadvantages + disproportionately penalises vulnerable UK residents",
