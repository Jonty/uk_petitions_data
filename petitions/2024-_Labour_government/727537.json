        "additional_details": "We want the Government to honor the commitment made to current Skilled Worker and Health Care visa holders. These individuals have been contributing to the UK economy, especially during the pandemic. Changing the rules mid-way would be unfair, causing uncertainty and hardship for those who have made long-term plans based on the 5-year ILR path. It is essential that these workers can continue their journey to ILR as originally promised, ensuring fairness and stability in the immigration system.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to ensure that current Skilled Worker and Health Care visa holders on the 5-year ILR route are not affected by the new 10-year rule. They should continue on the original 5-year path to ILR as promised when they first moved to the UK.",
