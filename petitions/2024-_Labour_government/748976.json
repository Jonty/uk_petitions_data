        "additional_details": "The current climate in the UK is one of extreme fear, stabbings are almost at a daily occurrence & yet the government has taken any ability for someone to defend themselves away. We cannot rely on the police to be at an emergency immediately, they are already unable to cope with the levels of crime in the UK. What chance does someone have against a knife with just their hands? Having the ability to escape a dangerous situation by temporarily incapacitating an attacker could help save lives",
