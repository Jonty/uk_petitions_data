        "additional_details": "Implement Political Studies from either Year 9 or Year 10 as a mandatory requirement, like PSHE; but it adopts a similar form to the A-Level standard that is currently present. It may have to focus more on UK politics since its engineered to GCSE students but frankly its unfair that you let 16 year olds vote without many of them having a shred of political understanding, it would also help the youth to actually get involved in politics instead of just being commentators.",
        "background": "Implement \"Politics\" as a subject that is mandatory, similar to Maths and English. With new voting laws, it is more important than ever that people truly understand the impact and meaning of politics and ideologies; only with an educated public can you benefit society.",
