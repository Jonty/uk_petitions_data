        "additional_details": "We urge the Government to use additional money from these reforms to fund scrapping tuition fees for students. Current state pension benefits cost nearly \u00a3150 billion a year \u2013 we believe this is unsustainable. We believe those with the broadest shoulders should support an approach which keeps the Chancellor within her borrowing limits and protects priority departments, like the NHS & Defence. We believe young people need more help. We believe \u00a350k in debt for students is too much.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to review existing state pension entitlements and introduce the following reforms: 1) end the triple lock 2) reduce entitlements for those on existing private defined benefit schemes with an income \u00a320,000 + 3) end state pensions for incomes over \u00a350k.
