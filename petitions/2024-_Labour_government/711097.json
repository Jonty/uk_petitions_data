        "action": "Introduce Life Imprisonment Without Parole.",
        "additional_details": "If a suspect is found guilty by a jury or they plead guilty, they get Life Imprisonment with a minimum term. But that shouldn't be the case. If a suspect murders someone, then they should NOT get a minimum term, they should automatically get Life Imprisonment without Parole. It's kinda the same as a Whole Life Order (WLO) but by rights... life should mean life with them not coming out 10/20/30/40/50 years later.",
        "background": "The Labour Government to introduce Life Imprisonment without Parole and the reason behind, is that the current structure of the Justice System, does not work. Life should mean life and when a suspect is found guilty of a crime (ie: murder) they should remain in prison for the rest of their life.",
