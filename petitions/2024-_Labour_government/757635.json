        "additional_details": "I believe NHS Mental Health services are not fit for purpose for Neurodivergent people. Treatment methods are inadequate for many Neurodivergent people due to some not recognising that Mental Health issues affect Neurodivergent people differently to non Neurodivergent people. Many Neurodivergent people find CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) doesn\u2019t work for them and have to go to private mental health support. There must always be reasonable adjustments to treatment.",

All NHS Mental Health services must be suitable for Neurodivergent people.",
