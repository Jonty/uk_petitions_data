        "additional_details": "The ROYGBIV model - Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet-was defined by Newton in the 17th century, yet indigo is arbitrary and outdated. The distinction between indigo and purple is woefully ambiguous.\r\nModern education and design recognise purple as the true bridge between blue and violet.\r\nRetaining indigo causes cases of chromatic confusion. We urge the Department for Education to replace indigo with purple, forming the clearer ROYGPV Spectrum.",
        "background": "The Government should officially recognise purple instead of indigo in the traditional\r\nROYGBIV colour sequence taught in schools and used in public educational materials.Indigo is outdated and extremely confusing, it no longer reflects how colour is perceived in modern education, design or science.",
