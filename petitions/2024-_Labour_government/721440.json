        "additional_details": "Sexual violence remains a pervasive issue that deeply impacts the safety, dignity, and well-being of women in Northern Ireland. Current laws and support systems are insufficient, leaving many survivors without justice or adequate care. Stronger legal protections, longer sentences for offenders, and better resources for survivors are essential to preventing further harm. The Government must take immediate action to ensure a coordinated response that holds offenders accountable and supports the victims of these crimes.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to take urgent action against sexual violence in Northern Ireland, including stronger legal protections, better support for survivors, improved police training, and longer sentences for violent sexual crimes. It\u2019s time for a coordinated response to ensure justice for women.",
