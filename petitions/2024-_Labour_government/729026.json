        "additional_details": "The pay gap between 18\u201320 and 21+ is a form of age-based discrimination. Many 18 to 20 year-olds are financially independent, paying rent, bills and supporting families. They deserve equal pay for equal work. A standard minimum wage for all 18+ is fair, just and reflects real-world responsibilities. Employers should not have the right to pay individuals less just because they are not yet 21.",
        "background": "We want the Government to introduce a standard minimum wage for all adults aged 18 and over. The current pay gap between 18 and 21+ is unfair and discriminatory, despite both age groups often doing the same work and facing similar living costs.",
