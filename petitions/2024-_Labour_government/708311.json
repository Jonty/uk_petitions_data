        "additional_details": "This issue is the number one concern of huge swathes of the country and failure to manage it underpins many of our economic and societal problems. Goals should be SMART- specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-phased. The government rhetoric on this key issue meets none of the criteria for a plan.",
        "background": "We want the government to have a proper plan to manage legal and illegal migration. This is missing from the government\u2019s milestones, and without a realistic, measurable target, it is not a serious plan. Without a goal, this is mere rhetoric and the British public deserves better.",
