        "additional_details": "Many citizens\u2014especially those on low incomes, students, and pensioners\u2014struggle with the financial burden of the licence fee. \r\n\r\nEnforcement practices, including threatening letters and home visits, can be distressing and disproportionate.\r\n\r\nEnding the TV licence fee would relieve financial pressure on millions of households and encourage innovation in how public media is funded and delivered.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to abolish the mandatory TV licence fee and explore alternative funding models for public broadcasting.\r\n\r\nThe TV licence fee is an outdated mechanism that no longer reflects the way people consume media. In an era dominated by streaming services and on-demand content.",
