        "additional_details": "We think that critical decisions should have to give credence to parents wishes including treatment overseas or hospice care.\r\n \r\nWe think the following is required:\r\n \r\n- Full consultation with parents at all stages of treatment.\r\n- Compulsory independent medical mediation for conflict resolution.\r\n- Difficult decisions should made outside of a court setting.\r\n- A statutory minimum period before legal proceedings are commenced. We think parents must have access to legal and financial assistance prior to court proceedings.\r\n- Expert medical advice sought to be required to be considered in decisions.\r\n \r\nWe think this would protect the rights of the child and their parents.",
        "background": "We want the government to give parents rights to be fully involved in all decisions taken for their child by the medical profession and give them the right to seek independent expert medical advice and include it in decision making.",
