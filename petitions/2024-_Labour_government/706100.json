        "additional_details": "Without the use of commercial vehicles these houses would not have been built as well as it posing a struggle on reactive maintenance on properties taking place. It is a struggle to find somewhere to live with these rules in place.\r\n\r\nAnother argument is that cars can also be deemed as commercial vehicles however that always seems to be overlooked and only van owners are penalised when all we want to do is go to work to be able to pay for the privilege of living somewhere.",
        "background": "As a tradesman I need to be able to park my sign written van at home, I see it as unfair that due to me not having an office based job and need a van to carry my tools and materials in that as tradesmen we are discriminated against. I risk getting fined just to park outside of my home or nearby.",
