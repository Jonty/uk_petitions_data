        "additional_details": "Across the country, many people are desperately seeking a home swap\u2014whether it's to gain an extra room for their growing family, downsize, move closer to support networks, or escape overcrowded conditions. However, the current home swapping system often gets hijacked by people who are not serious about making a real swap. These individuals can waste valuable time, resources and cause unnecessary delays for those who genuinely need to move.",
        "background": "We're calling on the government, to call on all councils and housing associations, to take control of the home swapping process. With their involvement, they can ensure that swaps are handled more efficiently, helping those in real need connect with suitable homes.",
