While UK law bans many mutilations, others remain not only legal but the standard practice, especially in farming, breeding, and imports.\r\nProtecting animals aligns with the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and the UK\u2019s duty to recognize animals as sentient and lead in compassionate, science-based welfare.\r\n",
