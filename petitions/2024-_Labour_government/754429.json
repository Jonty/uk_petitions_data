        "additional_details": "I feel that it has become increasingly difficult to tell fact from fiction. The potential for harm is considerable. We are often fed misinformation on any range of topics. Take recent examples like brexit where certain individuals twisted narratives to suit their own agendas. Also, fake footage showing police brutality/ineptitude which undermines public trust. Imagine the possible damage in the run up to an election or the potential damage caused to innocent people. This needs to be controlled.",
