        "additional_details": "Introducing extended settlement routes\u2014such as 10- or 15-year pathways\u2014for people who are already lawfully in the UK is both unfair and harmful. \r\n1. Keeping the ILR requirement at 5 years for all Skilled Worker and sponsorship visa holders already in the UK\r\n2. Ensuring that any future immigration changes apply only to new entrants.\r\nA 15-year settlement route risks creating a system that resembles long-term dependency rather than encouraging integration, stability, and contribution.",
        "background": "Thousands of individuals have built their lives here in good faith, having arrived under clear immigration rules that promised a 5-year pathway to settlement. These workers have followed every regulation, paid significant visa and NHS fees, contributed to the UK economy and  paid taxes.",
