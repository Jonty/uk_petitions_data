        "additional_details": "I don't want to see my country building bad debt on to the backs of our children. We have pensioners starving and freezing in their own homes, our farmers protesting because we're taxing them for feeding us, we're also making enemies with Russia for no reason but to allow Ukraine to join nato when a peaceful agreement could easily be done.\r\nWar only benefits the banks of those lending the money, no one else.",
        "background": "I would like the government to stop sending money to a war that has nothing to do with us, we are in a recession and should not be involving ourselves with other countries wars. We have more debt than we can afford and should not continue paying vast amounts of money to an endless pit.",
