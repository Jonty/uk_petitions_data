        "additional_details": "We urge Parliament to pass clear laws protecting free speech from censorship and government interference. Vague laws and biased enforcement must end to restore fairness, trust, transparency, and public confidence. Police powers to investigate opinions should be restricted and subject to oversight. Online platforms should respect free speech and follow transparent, fair procedures before removing content. This Act would strengthen democracy, protect rights, and ensure equal treatment for all.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to protect free speech with a \u201cFirst Amendment-style\u201d Act. Current vague laws and unequal enforcement create fear and a damaging perception of a two-tier justice system. Clear legal protections would ensure free, fair expression without political bias or censorship.",
