This will help out people who want to learn and drive by the age of 13 as they will know more by the time they actually get a provisional license and be able to drive themselves to places as taxi prices are going higher and some people don\u2019t have enough money - and it teaches kids how taxes and the legal requirements work, to be more ready for the future.",
