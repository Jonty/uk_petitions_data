        "additional_details": "Since the Labour party took office, it has failed to meet any of its mandates set out & is slowly implementing laws & acts set out to oppose freedom of speech. We are meant to be living in a free democratic society. The Labour Party does not represent this.\r\n\r\nWe want:\r\n\r\n-An early general election with an additional public vote regarding the implementation on digital ID's. \r\n\r\nIf the PM is so confident in his ability and decision making, call a general election, give the people what they want.",
        "background": "The public of the UK want a general election and public vote on digital ID's, much like the process we had taken during the Brexit Campaign. There is a clear divide within and outside or parliament which requires a vote, not a forced decision made by one person.",
