        "additional_details": "For many people, Zipcar is not a convenience, it is their only way to survive in a city where owning a car is virtually impossible.\r\nShared mobility provides:\r\n-Affordable access to medical appointments, caring responsibilities, and essential travel\r\n-Independence for people with disabilities who cannot rely on inconsistent public transport\r\n- A realistic alternative to private car ownership\r\n- Crucial flexibility for shift workers and parents\r\n- Lower congestion and reduced emissions across London.",
        "background": "We urgently call upon the MoL & TfL to reverse the imposed Congestion Charge rules on car-share vehicles, inc Zipcar & the few mobility services.\r\nThis policy threatens to cut off a lifeline for thousands of Londoners who rely on shared vehicles for essential travel, especially low income residents.",
