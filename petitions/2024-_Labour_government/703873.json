Whom at present only show the rondel which in many  cases isn\u2019t visible due to tinted windows and rondel placement . The drivers should be as accountable as other customer transport services in the capital . This would be clearer to customers using ride share apps whose vehicle they are getting into and hopefully increase the diligence of drivers .",
