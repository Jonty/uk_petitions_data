        "additional_details": "As a passionate advocate and pet professional, it is absolutely vital that we push the UK government to take a stand against the sale of fireworks that so tremendously distress our beloved pets.\r\n\r\nThe effect that fireworks have on animals cannot be downplayed - the deafening noise can reach levels as high as 120db, akin to the roar of a jumbo jet. This relentless cacophony can inflict lasting damage on the delicate ears of dogs, which are adversely affected at anything exceeding 85db.",
        "background": "It is imperative that we advocate for the banning of the sale of fireworks.\r\n\r\nBy transitioning to alternative options that produce lower levels of noise, we can prioritise the well-being and comfort of our dogs and cats (plus other animals)",
