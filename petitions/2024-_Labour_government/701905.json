        "additional_details": "Recently a 3 month old red panda died in Edinburgh Zoo due to stress caused by fireworks. \r\n\r\nVeterans with PTSD may be triggered by fireworks.\r\n\r\nPeoples pets stress and make themselves ill and sometimes run away due to fireworks.\r\n\r\nElderly people may be scared if they\u2019re alone and have limited mobility.\r\n\r\nWe need tighter laws on fireworks. I feel that fireworks should only be available to businesses with licences and for organised controlled displays.",
        "background": "Fireworks are commonly purchased for 5th November for bonfire night however they are so easily accessible for many people, people who misuse them and don\u2019t just use them on bonfire night. Fireworks can be extremely scary to some people and certainly to many many animals.",
