        "additional_details": "According to a study in the european journal of midwifery, 31.7% experienced post partum PTSD and 14.3% had a PTSD profile following an emergency C-section. Many may wish to avoid a hospital birth where intervention is more likely and would prefer to go to a birth centre as a middle ground between hospital and home birth. Many feel forced into a hospital which may bring back trauma or home birth which may be riskier than at a centre. Birth should be about choice, not forcing parents hands.",
        "background": "Birth choices often feel limited in a situation where the mother/birthing parent has little control. Currently, birth centres often turn away mothers for not meeting a strict set of criteria - such as BMI or a previous caesarian.",
