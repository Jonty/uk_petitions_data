        "action": "Scrap the proposal of installing \"tamper-proof\" software to monitor devices",
        "additional_details": "The amount of control that the government is trying to take is quite frightening for some. If the amendment does get approved, it will be similar to North Korea (DPRK) and no one wants to be watched by the government whenever they feel like it as it induces a lack of privacy. It would be much more beneficial to not introduce this act, and it would also set a dangerous precedent for government overreach and reduce trust in the public.",
        "background": "The Government should withdraw this amendment and reject any requirement for tamper-proof surveillance software on personal devices. Child protection must rely on targeted law enforcement, not blanket monitoring that undermines privacy, security, and encryption for everyone.",
