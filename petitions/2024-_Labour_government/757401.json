        "action": "Require permanent road repairs instead of pothole patching.",
        "additional_details": "Current patch and repair methods are clearly failing. Pouring material into damaged road surfaces does not last and quickly breaks apart, creating the same hazards again within weeks.\r\n\r\nThis situation is not just damaging vehicles but poses a serious risk to public safety, particularly to motorcyclists, cyclists and drivers who may lose control or be forced into oncoming traffic. Without proper resurfacing, it is only a matter of time before someone is seriously injured or killed.",
        "background": "Roads across Cheshire East, including Knutsford, Alderley Edge, Wilmslow, Holmes Chapel, Middlewich, Northwich and Mobberley, have become dangerously damaged. Potholes are deep, unavoidable and repeatedly damaging vehicles, with many residents forced to replace tyres and wheels.",
