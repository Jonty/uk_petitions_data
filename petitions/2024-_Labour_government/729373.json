        "additional_details": "Cornwall has a unique identity separate from English, culture, language, and history that deserve protection and self determination. Devolution would empower local leaders to handle economic inequality, the second home and holiday let epidemic, afford families to stay and live in Cornwall, stabilise and further diversify our local economy, and support the growth of Cornish language and culture. It\u2019s time for Cornwall to have the powers it needs to shape its own path to becoming a nation.",
        "background": "Grant Cornwall a devolved government with powers akin to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Further recognise Cornwall's distinct identity and give our people more control over decisions affecting our land, economy, language, and future.",
