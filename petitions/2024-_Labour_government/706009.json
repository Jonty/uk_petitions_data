        "action": "Leave the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)",
        "additional_details": "The ECHR has increasingly influenced UK laws in ways that undermine our sovereignty and the ability of our government to make decisions that reflect the will of the British people. It often obstructs swift action on critical issues like border control, national security, and law enforcement. By leaving the ECHR, the UK can take back control of its legal framework, ensuring that decisions impacting our country are made by those directly accountable to the British electorate.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to withdraw from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to restore full sovereignty over our legal system. Decisions impacting our nation's laws and policies should be made in the UK, by our Parliament and courts, without external interference.",
