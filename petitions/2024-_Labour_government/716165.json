        "action": "Reverse ban on puberty blockers for trans and gender-diverse youth",
        "additional_details": "The Cass Review lacks sufficient evidence to support the ban, overlooking the importance of puberty blockers in gender-affirming care. Puberty blockers are routinely used for cisgender children with early puberty, showing their safety and effectiveness. The ban disregards expert medical consensus and risks harming vulnerable youth by denying them essential care, which has been shown to reduce mental health issues and improve well-being. Reversing this decision would align with evidence-based practice and human rights.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government and Parliament to reverse the decision banning puberty blockers for trans and gender nonconforming youth. These blockers are a critical part of gender-affirming care, helping to prevent distress and allowing individuals to make informed decisions about their future.",
