        "additional_details": "The shipyards of Jarrow & Hebburn were central to the local community for over a century, providing livelihoods for generations\u2014including my family since the 1870s. With the shipyards now closed, there is no dedicated space to preserve & celebrate this industrial & cultural heritage, honour the lives and work of those who built our communities, educate generations, & inspire local pride. It would also attract visitors & support the local economy, helping maintain our identity & cultural legacy.",
        "background": "Recognise Jarrow & Hebburn\u2019s shipbuilding heritage and the need for its preservation. Work with local organisations to establish a Shipyard Museum. Support funding through heritage grants, local budgets. Ensure the museum includes educational resources so it celebrates the work of generations.",
