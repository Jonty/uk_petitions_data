        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the UK Government to legalise the recreational use of cannabis.\r\n\r\nEvidence from countries and states that have legalised cannabis \u2014 such as Canada, Colorado, and California \u2014 shows that a regulated legal market can:\r\n\r\nReduce crime by cutting the illegal drug trade\r\n\r\nProtect public health with regulated, tested products\r\n\r\nGenerate significant tax revenue (\u00a31\u20131.5 billion/year estimated in the UK) that can fund schools, the NHS, and social programs",
        "background": "Legalise cannabis for adults aged 18 and over so that adults can make safe choices without fear of criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\nIntroduce a regulated market with strict age limits\r\n\r\nTax cannabis sales and use the revenue to fund healthcare, mental health services, education, and community programs.",
