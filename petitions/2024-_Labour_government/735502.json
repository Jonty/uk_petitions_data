The park in kirriemuir being as pitted and unrideable as it is, is discouraging and dangerous for people that like skateboarding and rollerblading, A rotten smelly alley that is behind the premier in the square has been marked on Google maps as a skatepark, I feel it's a rather unsafe place for children to skate",
