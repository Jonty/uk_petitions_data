Although laws already exist specifying that charges must be accurate and reasonable, many people are expected to pay up then seek refunds. We feel this and other factors put people challenging charges at a huge disadvantage in the current judicial system. None of the proposed new housing laws address this enforcement gap.",
        "background": "Create a scheme where disputed service charges are payable to courts or similar body and only passed to landlords if they can prove the charge's legitimacy. Otherwise, the money returns to the tenant/leaseholder. The scheme would apply to all landlord types excluding self-management.",
