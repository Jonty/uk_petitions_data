        "additional_details": "The UK government should consider reinstating the death penalty as a means of delivering justice for the most serious crimes, such as murder and terrorism. Supporters argue that it would serve as a strong deterrent against violent offences, ensuring that those who commit the most severe acts face the most serious consequences. Reintroducing capital punishment could also restore public confidence in the justice system by showing that the government takes the protection of innocent lives seriously",
        "background": "the death penalty needs to be brought back into play because crimes that would usually be given that sentance are happening to often now and something has to change to stop these horrible horrible crimes",
