        "additional_details": "We think Cervical smear tests should continue after age 64.\r\nWe think far too many women above age 64 are dying from cervical cancer because smear tests are no longer available beyond that age. Are women over 64 somehow less important? In particular we think grandmothers are a vital link in the chain to enable parents, particularly mothers, to work and contribute to the economic wellbeing of our country.\r\nWe think ending smear tests at 64 makes no sense and in addition to being unkind & unfair it is expensive for the U.K. from a health economics viewpoint.",
        "background": "Cervical smear testing is a proven preventative method of avoiding cervical cancer yet after age 64 these tests stop. However mortality rates from this disease in older women are high, as shown on the Cancer Research U.K. website.",
