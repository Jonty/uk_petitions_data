Furthermore, we believe that preventing asylum seekers the right to work costs the UK economy in supporting them and denies them the dignity of supporting themselves. We believe that allowing them to work could give the UK a stream of valuable and skilled workers who could be helping to fill the over 700,000 vacancies in the UK from the NHS to the building trade.",
