        "additional_details": "Every year, thousands of dogs are abandoned or surrendered, and too many animals are left to suffer due to overcrowded rescue centres. Yet, breeders continue to profit by producing more puppies, often without considering the impact on the welfare of the animals or the strain on rescue organisations.\r\nMany dogs are bred excessively, often resulting in serious health and behavioural issues.\r\nSome breeders subject animals to poor living conditions, neglect, and abuse to maximize their profits.",
        "background": "Implement stricter regulations on animal breeding to ensure that only responsible, ethical breeders are allowed to breed animals, focused on the welfare of the animals, not profit.\r\nIncrease support for rescue shelters, helping them reduce the number of abandoned pets and improve rehoming efforts.",
