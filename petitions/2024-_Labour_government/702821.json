        "additional_details": "We think public trust is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy and that excessive expenses undermine this trust. Whilst we believe that  MPs deserve fair compensation for legitimate costs, many scandals have sparked widespread outrage and calls for reform. We believe that stricter guidelines and a real-time, publicly-accessible reporting system for expenses would establish a transparent framework and ensure MPs can only claim what is necessary and appropriate.",
        "background": "We call for an immediate and comprehensive review of the system of expenses and allowances afforded to MPs. We believe the current system lacks transparency, accountability, fairness, and contributes to public distrust in our elected representatives.",
