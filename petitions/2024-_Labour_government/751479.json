        "additional_details": "Time spent on student visa + PSW visa does not count towards ILR. Increasing time spent on skilled worker visa from 5 to 10 years to get ILR status will put extra strain on people who come to UK for their higher education. This will mean a person has to spend 1 to 4 years to get a degree in UK, then 18 months on PSW visa and then Tier 2 skilled worker visa i.e. 10 years to settlement starts meaning a person who come as student has to spend 2.5 to 5.5 years + 10 years to get ILR which we believe is unfair.",

These are the people who have invested 1-4 years in their education and then on PSW visa in UK which does not count towards ILR.",
