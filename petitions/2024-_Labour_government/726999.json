        "additional_details": "Every year, thousands under 50 are diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK - many at later stages. Lowering the screening age to 40 would align us with countries like the U.S. and Australia and could lead to earlier diagnoses, less aggressive treatment, and more lives saved. Many at higher risk or with dense breast tissue struggle to access the right diagnostic tools early enough. Everyone - regardless of age, race, gender, or background - deserves an equal chance at early detection and survival.",
        "background": "We want the Government to lower the NHS breast screening age to 40 and create an Early Detection Pathway for faster, fairer access - using tools like ultrasound and MRI for those at higher risk or with dense breast tissue. Screening must be inclusive, regardless of age, race, gender, or postcode.",
