Walking dogs in high temperatures, leaving them in cars, or outside without shade and water is dangerous. \r\nThere are no clear laws to stop this. I want enforceable heat protection for dogs, including safe temperature limits, powers for early intervention, and penalties for those who put dogs at risk. Let\u2019s act before more dogs suffer needlessly.",

We need clear laws, enforcement powers, and penalties to protect them. Let\u2019s make it law. Let\u2019s protect our dogs.",
