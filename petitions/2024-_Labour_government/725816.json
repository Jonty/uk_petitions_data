        "additional_details": "I own Wellington landscaping and garden building that operates in Foxmore Business Park in Wellington, and the proposed closure of Junction 26's slip road on the M5 has become a significant concern for me and other local businesses. The potential economic impact on local companies like mine could be devastating, as our customers and staff would face tremendous challenges in reaching us if access is cut off. Your support is crucial to keep the lifeline of commerce and daily commutes operational.",
        "background": "We strongly urge the local council and transport authorities to reconsider the proposal of keeping Junction 26 partially open (one lane) would alleviate pressure on surrounding roads and ensure that both businesses and the public are not unduly impacted by this decision.",
