        "additional_details": "I believe Parliament should act upon it as, like previously mentioned in my first point, it affects children in several different ways from the aforementioned helplessness to helpline services to even wondering if they might have an infection or not in a specific part of them. As seen by another petition that aims to completely abolish the Online Safety Act, there is a clear dislike towards the new law and leaving it alone would be a very negative decision, leading to more chaos and uncertainty",
        "background": "Parliament needs to view the modern-day issues that have been caused due to the Online Safety Act, and how it primarily affects children. For example, on social media it has been said multiple times that especially young girls aren\u2019t able to search up on issues they might have as a result of the act",
