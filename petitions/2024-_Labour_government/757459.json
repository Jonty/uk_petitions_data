        "additional_details": "According to a survey by ActionAid (2023) 1 in 5 women in the UK struggle to afford menstrual products, equating to 2.8 million people (the equivalent of Greater Manchester's population). As a result of this, many women miss out on opportunities due to period poverty, including missing education, work, and socialising. Therefore if the government wants to reduce social inequities and promote gender equality, then they should ensure that menstrual products are free for all across the UK.",
        "background": "Period poverty is a pressing issue which the government must tackle. Following the success from Scotland's Period Products Act 2021, the Act should be enrolled across the UK so that women and girls can have access to menstrual products with dignity whenever needed.",
