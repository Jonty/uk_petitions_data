        "additional_details": "We think that banning price increases in the holidays could improve school attendance for many children as parents might not feel the need to to take their children out of school during term time.\r\n \r\nHolidays could be beneficial for families mental health and wellbeing and making them the same price as during term time could make them more accessible for all families and people. This includes for teachers as well as due to their work load they deserve holidays but some can't afford it.",
        "background": "We think the government needs to ban holiday companies from charging higher prices for trips and flights during school holidays. We think it's shocking that nothing has already been done about this. Some families struggle to afford to take their children on holiday, especially abroad.",
