        "additional_details": "I feel that in many areas the availability of 24/7 accessible defibrillators and bleed kits is alarmingly low. I believe that removing VAT from defibrillators, bleed kits and storage cabinets will greatly assist the individuals or organisations that are trying to raise the funds to buy them. They generally have to pay VAT, for many it is a step to far and the planned purchase can fail.\r\n \r\nTime is critical and we need as much equipment available as possible.",
        "background": "I would ask the government to make the purchase of defibrillators, bleed kits and the cabinets they are housed in all VAT free. Certain organisations can purchase defibrillators with no VAT, I ask the government to make this the case for everyone and extend it further to include bleed kits.",
