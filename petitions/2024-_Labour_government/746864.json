        "action": "Including cats (as pets/property animals) in the Road Traffic Act (1988)",
        "additional_details": "Just because cats are more likely to walk on a road does not mean they do not deserve to be saved. This petition's aim is not to prosecute anybody who accidentally injures a cat while driving, it is just to make it a requirement that drivers must report these incidents. Including cats in this act would mean that more of them would have a chance at being saved if their injuries are reported and they are taken to be treated. Thank you for taking the time to read.",
        "background": "Many cats (property) are injured and killed on roads every day. Very little are ever reported or cared about. Cats should be included in this act just as well as dogs are, as they are still property. This means that it should be a legal requirement to report any incidents of hitting a cat on a road.",
