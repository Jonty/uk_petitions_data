The day the turn 18 they gain a hugely powerful right: to vote. 70% of young people under 18 don't know their MP. 2 in 5 young people don't understand at all what politicians do. Additionally, 76% of teachers believe students do not receive necessary financial education. What's the point of schooling if not to prepare children? Show students how to deal with the realities and responsibilities of the real world.",
