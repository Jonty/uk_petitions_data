        "additional_details": "The UK mandates that pets enter the country as manifest cargo, subjecting them to stressful conditions in cargo hold. In contrast, Ireland\u2019s regulation, Reg 576/2013, allow pets to travel in cabin. \r\nTransporting pets as cargo exposes them to extreme temperatures, loud noises, and isolation, leading to physical and emotional distress. \r\nBy permitting in cabin pet travel, the UK would commit to pet welfare, align with neighboring countries\u2019 humane practices, and provide peace of mind to pet owners.",
        "background": "We urge the UK government to amend current UK pet travel regulations to permit pets to travel in cabin on inbound flights, aligning with practices in countries like Ireland. This change would allow pet owners the option to keep their pets with them during flights, ensuring their safety and comfort.",
