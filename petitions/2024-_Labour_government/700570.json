        "additional_details": "Prescriptions are a big expense for students who rely on government loans to fund university. Full-time students who are 18 receive free prescriptions but this stops when they turn 19. This means many students have to work out if they can afford their prescriptions, many university students suffer from health conditions which require medication but are having to re buy it monthly; which is extremely costly. Prescriptions currently cost \u00a39.90 which adds up each month.",
        "background": "To introduce a bill to allow for all full-time students to receive free prescriptions, currently it stops at 18 years old but this excludes full-time university students who are older and mature students.",
