        "additional_details": "Preserving both the route itself and the five-year qualifying period for ILR is essential to provide certainty and fairness for applicants who make long-term personal, professional, and financial commitments based on this established policy. Any change to these arrangements would undermine confidence in the immigration system and risk disadvantaging individuals who have planned their futures in reliance on the current framework.",
        "background": "The existing UK Ancestry visa route should be retained in its current form. This includes the eligibility of individuals with British-citizen grandparents to live and work in the United Kingdom for a five-year period, followed by eligibility to apply for ILR after completing those five years.",
