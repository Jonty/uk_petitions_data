        "additional_details": "We agree that there should be no automatic place for any person in the legislature. Removing this principle in relation to the hereditary peers is a step in the right direction. It however leaves the anomaly where bishops would automatically have a right to a seat in the House of Lords and nobody else would. There are other religious (and no belief) people which have a major makeup in the UK. No religion should have any space reserved in Parliament. The bishops have become politicians.",
        "background": "There is currently a Bill progressing through Parliament which seeks to remove the remaining hereditary peers from the House of Lords, however, whilst we agree with this, we believe that the Bill should also remove the Bishops from the House of Lords.",
