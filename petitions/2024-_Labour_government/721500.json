        "additional_details": "Due to the rise of violence, there are more young victims losing and fighting for their lives at such young ages. If students are trained with the right self defence techniques not only can they protect themselves, they can also control their emotions and prepare for potential danger threats. Knowing how to defend yourself mentally allows you to act out of logic rather than fear. This is something I believe would truly make a difference to the number of altercations happening on our streets.",
