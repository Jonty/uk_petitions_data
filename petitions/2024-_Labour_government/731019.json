        "additional_details": "Shared pedestrian-cycle areas are intended to be safe and accessible particularly for vulnerable groups such as children, older people, and those with disabilities. EAPCs often travel at higher speeds and are generally heavier than conventional bicycles. We feel that current legislation does not go far enough in addressing this issue, leaving pedestrians exposed to unnecessary danger.",
        "background": "We want the government to ban electrically-assisted pedal cycles in shared pedestrian-cycle spaces. We think that the increasing use of electrically-assisted pedal cycles (EAPCs) in these spaces poses a growing safety risk. ",
