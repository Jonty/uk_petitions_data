        "additional_details": "We think that reptile shops and pet shops can sell bearded dragons to purchasers without adequate lighting or husbandry, and may also be selling the incorrect lighting and husbandry themselves. The government should require shops to prove a customer has an adequate set up before allowing a purchase of a bearded dragon, and should require shops to only stock equipment which ensures a suitable environment for the animal, in accordance with the principles set out in the Animal Welfare Act 2006.",
        "background": "We believe that without basic set ups - as recommended by animal welfare experts - in terms of lighting and vivaria size, it can be detrimental to a bearded dragon's health and cause metabolic bone disease among other serious health conditions. There needs to be a change. ",
