        "additional_details": "Nearly 3 million people have signed a petition AGAINST the introduction of Digital ID's, and much like other petitions (i.e, one to repeal the so-called 'Online Safety Act') the government have looked at it and shrugged it off with a generic \"We're doing it anyway\" response, ignoring those people completely.\r\n\r\nThe people have made it as clear as we possibly can that we are vehemently OPPOSED to this and it is an insult to be ignored once again.\r\n\r\nLet US, the people, decide if we want this or not.",
        "background": "The government should hold a public referendum as to whether Digital ID should be introduced or not. The people should have the final say on if we want this or not. It should not be forced on us by a government who have neither asked, nor consulted us. We live in a Democracy, not a Dictatorship.",
