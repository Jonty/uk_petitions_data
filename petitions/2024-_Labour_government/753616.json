        "additional_details": "Like the NHS, often experiences have shown that access to our elected Members of Parliament can be variable, occasionally fraught with barriers. Email queries to MPs may be met with a 'template' response, or sometimes a holding 'we will respond later' email with no further follow ups. Occasionally there is a wall of silence. The elected MPs have a duty to engage with their constituents, by addressing their concerns appropriately, in a timely fashion, to show that they take their job seriously.",
        "background": "We call on the Prime Minister to widen access to our elected Members of Parliament. All MP offices should have their email inboxes monitored from 0800-1830 Mon-Fri, and they are mandated to have all constituent queries considered and addressed effectively, in a meaningful way, the same day.",
