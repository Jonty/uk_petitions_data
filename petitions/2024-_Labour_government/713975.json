When adding a vehicle to a user list, the app should connect with DVLA and affirm that the registration entered is valid and matches the vehicle identity. \r\n\r\nMany car parks use Automatic Number Plate Recognition. If a driver inadvertently inserts an incorrect registration that ANPR has not detected at the entrance, the payment collection system should alert the driver to this immediately.",
        "background": "Currently there are multiple different mobile apps used to collect payment for parking. When parking, the motorist needs to find the correct app and may not have it on their phone. This may lead to delay and possible errors. ",
