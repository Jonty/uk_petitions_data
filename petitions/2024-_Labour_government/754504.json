Riders of speed pedelecs can achieve speeds of up to 28mph.  Sellers in the UK currently are not required to confirm if the buyer holds the required license and other legal documents. Sellers should be required to see these documents prior to the purchase and provide the buyer with a signed document of confirmation.",

In addition the seller should record the buyer name, address, insurance & tax details before the purchaser can complete the purchase",
