        "action": "Amend the Party Wall Act 1996 to give adjoining owners stronger legal protection",
        "additional_details": "We think the Party Wall etc. Act 1996 fails to protect adjoining owners when building owners ignore the rules. There is no enforcement procedure within the Act, and no automatic fines or right to stop potentially unlawful works. We believe this leaves innocent homeowners exposed to trespass, structural damage, and weather ingress, with no option but costly legal action to protect their property. In our view, the law unfairly favours those doing the work and urgently needs reform to ensure adjoining owners are properly safeguarded.",
        "background": "Amend the Party Wall Act 1996 by introducing penalties such as fines for any breaches, grant local authorities powers to enforce compliance, create an affordable dispute tribunal, and establish a compensation scheme to protect any adjoining owners affected by unlawful or damaging works.",
