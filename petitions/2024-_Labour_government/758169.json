We think this will allow pregnant women and families park safely near the places they need to visit. This should be introduced alongside a fines system where people without the badge get fined for using the space incorrectly.\r\n\r\nThe badge system should start during pregnancy and finish when child reaches about the age of 5 unless disability or other adjustments are needed to be put in place.\r\n",

Introduce fines for individuals who break the rules and park there without a child under 5 or being pregnant.",
