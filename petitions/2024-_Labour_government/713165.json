        "action": "Allow SEND children to be taken out of school once a year without penalty",
        "additional_details": "Current rules mean that where parents feel they have no choice but to take their SEND child out of school during term time, so they can go on a holiday without their child being overwhelmed, they can be fined, and their child's attendance record suffers. We believe this is unfair.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue that affects many families across the country. The latest Government figures state that over 1.5 million pupils in England have special educational needs (SEN).",
        "background": "We want the Government to make it so parents of SEND children can take their child out of school once a year without facing any penalty. This would enable parents to take SEND children on holiday outside of school holidays, when everyone being on holiday can be overwhelming.",
