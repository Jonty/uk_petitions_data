        "action": "Protect Legal Exemptions for Non-Stun Religious Slaughter in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The UK recognises non-stun slaughter under the WATOK regulations, balancing animal welfare with the right to religious freedom, as protected by the the Human Rights Act 1998 and the ECHR.\r\n\r\nWhen Religious slaughter is carried out properly, animals lose consciousness quickly. The FSA monitors these practices to ensure animal welfare.\r\n\r\nSingling out non-stun is scientifically and ethically unjust and requires an inclusive approach towards welfare standards in general.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to uphold existing legal exemptions that permit non-stun religious slaughter under the Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing (WATOK) Regulations, and to resist any proposals to remove or restrict these exemptions without compelling scientific or legal justification.",
