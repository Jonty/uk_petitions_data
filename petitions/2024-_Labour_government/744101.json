        "additional_details": "I think the people should have a legal say in how the country is run, Britain should be the king of democracy, but instead many laws are introduced when nobody asked for them, such as Digital ID. The referendum allows the public to be content and contribute ideas to better British society. Governments can also launch referendums if they feel it might not get enough support in the house, but the majority of the public support the ideas.",
        "background": "I think the government should put in a law that if a petition reaches 1 million signatures, it should be put to a legally binding public referendum allowing the people to have power. It\u2019s very rare a petition reaches over 1 million signatures which indicates many people are affected.",
