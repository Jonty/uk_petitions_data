        "additional_details": "It\u2019s unfair on those who barely afford and not fair on the elite either. It\u2019s a tool just like medicine that should be exempt. Moreover, not every school is the posh, elite institution rather, some help special needs better than the appealing school system. Lastly, the schools are already oversubscribed as they are and there are no teachers.",
        "background": "Remove the VAT on private schools as people who barely afford the school in the first place had to take their kids out. Many parents use every last penny to send their child there. Private school is not just for the elite.",
