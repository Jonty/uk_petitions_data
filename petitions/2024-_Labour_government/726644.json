        "additional_details": "We believe some students may experience depression and anxiety due to the GCSE system that we think is outdated. Some lack support at home, with parents who do not care or cannot provide guidance. We think the current curriculum doesn\u2019t reflect the challenges we face. We think we need a modern, inclusive education system that prioritizes mental health, life skills, and support for all students to help us build a better future.",
        "background": "We think the GCSE curriculum is outdated and ignores real-life skills. Many students also face tough home lives, like being young carers. We call on the government to review and modernise the system to be more relevant, inclusive, and supportive for all.",
