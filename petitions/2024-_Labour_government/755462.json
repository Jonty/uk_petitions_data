        "additional_details": "The Importance of Immediate Response:\r\n\r\nSudden cardiac arrest can occur at any time, often without warning. The survival rate decreases significantly with each passing minute without immediate intervention. Studies show that the chances of survival can increase up to 50-70% when an AED is used within the first 3-5 minutes of a cardiac arrest. By equipping every new vehicle with an AED, we can ensure that drivers and passengers have immediate access to life-saving equipment.",
        "background": "To mandate the inclusion of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in every brand new car sold in our nation. The rationale behind this proposal stems from the alarming statistics surrounding sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), which affects thousands of individuals each year especially after Covid-19.",
