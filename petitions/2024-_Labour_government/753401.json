        "additional_details": "There is a growing teacher shortage, yet many PGCE subjects like Business, Economics, RE, Design & Technology, and the Arts receive no grants. Many trainees face heavy workloads and financial strain while shaping the future of education. Supporting all subjects with grants could ease hardship, widen access, strengthen recruitment, and affirm the vital role teachers play in society.\r\n",
        "background": "I want the Government to fund a universal grant for all PGCE trainee teachers. This could ensure every subject is valued equally, remove financial barriers to entering the profession, and help address the national teacher shortage by supporting trainees throughout their training year.",
