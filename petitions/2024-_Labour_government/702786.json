        "additional_details": "We think this change would promote Public Health, as some research shows plant-based diets may reduce the risk of chronic illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes. This could help lower the healthcare burden. In addition, this could support sustainability, as plant-based meals can have a lower environmental impact, which could help the UK meet its climate goals and protect natural resources.\r\n \r\nBy making plant-based options the default, we believe the Government can lead in creating a healthier, more sustainable, and inclusive food system, setting a global example.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to mandate that plant-based food options be made the default in all public institutions, including schools, hospitals, and prisons. This policy would require plant-based meals to be the primary offering, with other dietary preferences available upon request.",
