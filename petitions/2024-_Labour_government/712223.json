        "action": "Carry out an independent inquiry into the grooming gang scandal in Great Britain",
        "additional_details": "When we fail to protect not only the most vulnerable in society but also the most precious, we really rob ourselves of a hopeful future. As a nation of people we should not be able to sleep at night knowing that we are allowing the most precious resource we have, our children, to be subject to the devilish whims of very sick individuals. This should transcend issues of race, religion and ethnicity. In fact there should never be a hesitating question to investigating matters such as these.",
        "background": "I would like parliament to commit to carrying out an investigation into the grooming gang scandal that has shamed Great Britain. I would like them to uncover the individuals involved, those responsible for the coverups and those who failed in their duty either aware or through no fault of their own.",
