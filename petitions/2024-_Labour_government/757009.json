        "additional_details": "Recent claims of a \u201cU-turn\u201d do not address the central concern: the digital identity programme is still being pursued. While some compulsory elements are paused, the infrastructure and long-term intent remain. Digital ID is introduced gradually, framed as \u201coptional\u201d, then expanded until refusal becomes impractical. Voluntary in name, mandatory in practice. A centralised digital ID carries inherent risks to liberty, autonomy, and privacy. It should be scrapped entirely.",
        "background": "Scrap the UK digital identity programme in full, including all voluntary, optional, or future digital ID systems. Pausing compulsory use is not enough. Parliament must commit in law to never introducing a national digital ID. Anything less than full abolition is disingenuous.",
