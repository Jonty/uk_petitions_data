        "additional_details": "We the British people want Government and Parliament to take a proactive approach to ensuring the well being of people and animals, both wild and domesticated, by lowering the legal limit of noise produced by fireworks to 80 decibels.\r\nThis will also improve social cohesion by reducing the potential for disruptive behaviour which can be caused by unnecessarily loud fireworks.\r\nFireworks are primarily a visual display and limiting them to 80 Decibels would not detract from the pleasure of their use",
        "background": "We the British people believe that fireworks used in the UK should be limited to 80 Decibels.\r\nThis would significantly reduce stress on wildlife, pets and vulnerable people and reduce social disruption caused by their increasingly frequent use.",
