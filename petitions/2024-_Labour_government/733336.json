        "additional_details": "We also want the Government to fund prevention including youth services, education, and local policing. Many people are dying, and we feel it\u2019s getting worse. We believe the current approach isn\u2019t working as many are still carrying knives, possibly thinking they\u2019ll get away with it or get a warning. We need the Government to step in and show that this won\u2019t be tolerated. We believe this policy is about saving lives, making the streets safer, and giving communities like mine hope for change.",
        "background": "We want the Government to treat knife crime like an emergency. We believe this means tougher sentencing, starting with the introduction of a mandatory 2-year prison sentence for anyone found guilty of carrying a knife. ",
