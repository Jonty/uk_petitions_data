        "action": "Mandatory Full Theory and Practical Testing for Foreign Drivers in the UK",
        "additional_details": "If this issue is not addressed, the safety of UK motorists will continue to be undermined, leading to greater accident rates, insurance claims, and public dissatisfaction.\r\nEnforcing these regulations now will not only prevent future road hazards but also provide an economic boost through testing fees, licensing charges, and additional driving lessons. In contrast, failure to act will allow the current discrepancies to persist, placing UK-trained drivers at continued risk.",
        "background": "Immediate intervention is necessary to prevent further road safety concerns and ensure that UK driving standards are upheld by all motorists, regardless of their country of origin. Implementing a strict, standardized testing requirement for foreign drivers can significantly enhance road safety.",
