        "additional_details": "Reversing equality laws on 'what a woman is' feels like a slippery slope back to discrimination and oppression of all women.\r\nIt opens the doors to asking the question where women deserve to be and puts into jeopardy any other minority's and their right to basic human rights, dignity and freedom of expression.\r\nNo woman is free until all women are free.\r\nNo man is going to put on an eleborate disguise to assult women, he does it anyway. Transgender women are not the problem.",
        "background": "Include Trans women in the definition of a woman\r\nAllow transgender women back into female spaces such as sports and bathrooms.\r\nStop male police officers strip searching women they see as transgender.\r\nThe legal definition changing doesnt just damage transgender women, all women's rights suffer.",
