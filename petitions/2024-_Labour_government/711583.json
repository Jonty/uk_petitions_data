        "action": "Abolish Motorcycle license A2 to A test requirement",
        "additional_details": "We propose reinstating automatic upgrades from A2 to A motorcycle licenses after two years, as was the case pre-2013. This change reduces test centre backlogs, supports green transport by promoting motorcycle use, and eliminates redundant retesting that doesn\u2019t improve safety. Riders gain sufficient experience in two years to handle larger bikes. It also highlights the benefits of post-EU regulatory flexibility, streamlining licensing while supporting environmental and public sector goals.",
        "background": "In the past (prior to 2013), an A2 license holder would be restricted to two years before achieving a full A category unrestricted motorcycle license without an additional test. We propose it returns to that scheme.",
