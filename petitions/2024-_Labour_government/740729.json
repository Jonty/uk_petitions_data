        "additional_details": "Animals suffer due to weak penalties. Temporary bans aren\u2019t enough\u2014 we believe anyone who has harmed an animal should never be allowed to own one. We urge Parliament to enforce harsher minimum sentences, mandatory background checks for buyers/adopters, and ban social media sales. Stronger laws will protect animals, promote responsible ownership, and ensure abusers face real consequences. Protect animals. Stop abusers. Make cruelty unforgivable.",
        "background": "Every year, countless animals suffer at the hands of people who intentionally harm, neglect, or kill them. While the Animal Welfare Act increased maximum penalties in England and Wales, we think too many offenders still face minimal consequences \u2014 sending the message that animal lives don\u2019t matter.",
