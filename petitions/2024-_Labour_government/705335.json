        "additional_details": "We call for a vote of no confidence in Sir Keir Starmer and the Labour Party for failing to address critical national issues. Under his leadership, Labour has neglected the plight of farmers, ignored austerity\u2019s impact on the elderly, failed to tackle illegal immigration, and overlooked corruption in the police and courts. Furthermore, Labour has supported authoritarian measures that undermine free speech. The public deserves a stronger, accountable opposition.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government and Parliament to address public dissatisfaction with Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership and the direction of the Labour Party. We urge Parliament to hold a formal debate or process to express a vote of no confidence in his leadership and current party policies.",
