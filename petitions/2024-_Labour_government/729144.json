        "additional_details": "The reason I have put this petition together is that once the casualty has been taken by Paramedics, the person who administered first aid can have no idea \r\nabout what happened to the casualty. This can start playing on the mind of the person who dealt with casualty, which can affect their mental health, and their personal life. We want the Government to fund mental health support for all people who administer first aid, to ensure they receive any support and advice they need.\r\n",
