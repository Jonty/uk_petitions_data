        "additional_details": "This will allow airports and airlines to make their own decisions in the same way as for train and ferry operators. This will give pet owners the ability to bring their pets into the U.K. by the most appropriate mode for them. Updating the law for pet travel by air would also reduce travel time for pets entering the U.K., allow for the safest means of travel to be selected for each pet and reducing costs substantially.",
        "background": "Pets are not currently allowed to fly into the U.K. in the cabin of a commercial aircraft. This does not align with the rules for travel by sea or rail. I would like the government to change the law on pet travel by air to align with other transport modes for pets entering the U.K.",
