        "additional_details": "Mental health conditions account for approximately 28% of the overall disease burden and are associated with poor physical health and reduction in life expectancy. However, current allocation only gives 13% of funding to mental health services. We believe that addressing this disparity is essential to achieving equitable recognition and support for mental health. We think the government must commit to increasing investment in mental health services to ensure funding levels have parity of esteem with physical health.",
        "background": "The principle of achieving parity of esteem between mental and physical health services was established through legislation by the Health and Social Care Act 2012. We think that realising this objective requires more funding for mental health services, a goal that we think is far from being realised",
