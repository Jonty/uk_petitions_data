        "additional_details": "Since 2016 the Personal Allowance has only risen from \u00a310,600 to \u00a312,570, far below inflation and rising living costs. Meanwhile the National Living Wage has increased, meaning low earners now lose more income to tax despite facing the highest costs in decades. \r\nA full-time minimum-wage worker (37.5 hours/week) now earns around \u00a323,795 a year.\r\nTaxing them at \u00a312,570 means the government takes money before they even reach a living-income baseline. It\u2019s not aligned with the reality of wages.",
        "background": "Government to raise the Personal Allowance from \u00a312,570 to \u00a320,000, so that people can earn a basic, income before being taxed. The current allowance has not kept pace with inflation, rising living costs, or increases to the minimum wage, leaving lower-income households disproportionately burdened.",
