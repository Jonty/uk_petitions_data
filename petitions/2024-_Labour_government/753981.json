        "additional_details": "This law would close existing gaps by ensuring partners are always informed safely of HIV diagnoses, and healthcare professionals guide treatment to prevent harm to the public. This could be called Toni\u2019s Law. No one should face a shock diagnosis or unknown risk of HIV alone; clear rules, trust and stronger prevention.",
        "background": "I want the government to create a law to ensure partners of those with HIV are safely informed regardless of patient consent. I believe this would prevent HIV being used as a weapon and stop the spreading of HIV ensuring healthcare professionals manage cases with accountability and care.",
