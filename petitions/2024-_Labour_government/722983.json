We urge the government to make it law to restrict under-16s from using standard smartphones and require child-safe phones with restricted features like limited apps and internet access. A legal framework ensures every child is equally protected, as individual parental control alone isn\u2019t enough. Let\u2019s safeguard young minds and promote responsible tech use for a better future.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to introduce legislation that limits smartphone use for children under 16 and ensures the development of safe, child-friendly phones.",
