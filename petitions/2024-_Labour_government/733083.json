Their closure risks increased travel, delays in treatment, and loss of trusted local services for elderly and vulnerable patients. These closures also force dedicated nurses and healthcare staff to be redeployed, creating uncertainty, breaking up local teams and worsening already critical workforce shortages. Please help us protect our hospital!",
