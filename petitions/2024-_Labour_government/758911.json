        "additional_details": "Enforcement actions and consequences for not paying child maintenance could potentially improve things by ensuring that parents meet their financial obligations to their children. Stronger enforcement might lead to more consistent payments, which can significantly improve the well-being of children and reduce the financial strain on custodial parents.",

The current system lacks effective enforcement, and the repercussions for those who fail to pay for their children are minimal. This places an undue burden on the parent who is rightfully entitled to receive these essential funds",
