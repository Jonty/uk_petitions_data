Other 16-year-olds should have the same opportunity. At 16 they can work, pay tax and take responsibility, so they should be able to begin supervised driving. Allow learning at 16 with rules like black box, curfew, passenger limits and minimum supervised hours to build safer drivers by 17 and increase fairness.",
