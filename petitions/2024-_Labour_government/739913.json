        "additional_details": "You guys should extend from 6 weeks which is only 1 month and 2 weeks it also isn\u2019t enough for teachers which is why they sometimes go on strike for because of their holidays . It will be helpful if they make it 2 months always for all schools across they UK",
        "background": "This will be really helpful since the UK children are upset about 6 weeks and instead insist for more because other countries like Germany,Italy and Spain have a longer summer holiday from June to September . I say if we all contribute to sign this kids won\u2019t be upset and will be really happy of it.",
