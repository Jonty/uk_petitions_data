I feel that as adults, we all need to take responsibility for the safety of our children and vulnerable adults. The government have the power to change the law to make it harder for children and young adults to purchase weapons. We think this could save lives.",
        "background": "I believe that if the sale of knives, crossbows and other weapons online was banned, it would be easier to control the purchase of these items. If they were only available to purchase in specialist shops and high street retailers, it could be ensured that ID is shown before purchase.",
