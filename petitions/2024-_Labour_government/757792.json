        "additional_details": "Our school staff and young people deserve better. We oppose trying to run state schools on the cheap. There is a cost of living crisis and many teachers and support staff have 2nd/3rd jobs, which they wont be able to commit to. Scrapping 1265 in favour of unregulated and unpaid hours will lead to more poverty and burnout of staff. This will not help our young people. We want to attract people into the profession, not expect them to be 'on call' at the whim of CEO's/ Leadership - unpaid.",
        "background": "We are concerned about reports that the 1265 directed time policy for teachers may be scrapped. We feel teachers have faced real terms pay cuts, and view 1265 as the only thing protecting staff from even more unpaid and excessive workload. Recruitment and retention is already critical. We say no.",
