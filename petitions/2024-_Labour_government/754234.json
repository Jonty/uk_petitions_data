        "additional_details": "After Brexit, trade with the EU fell sharply and impacted our economy negatively making people worse off by thousands. Some analysis estimates that 90 billion of our tax revenue is lost because of Brexit and businesses are feeling the toll of this trade failure too. This is why we believe removing trade barriers with the EU through the customs union will put money back into people\u2019s pockets and put an end to this badly negotiated Brexit deal.",
        "background": "We believe that re-joining the Customs Union would bring down the brexit trade barriers with the EU and would significantly help boost our economy and relations with EU partners. So we are urging the government to step up and pass a bill to apply to re-join.",
