        "additional_details": "By introducing \"Advocating for Disabled and Vulnerable people\" as a British Value, what too many already do through charities, lotteries, events (sponsored events), and campaigns will now be enshrined, communicated from early years, to citizens and residents, and naturalised citizens. A common, healthier understanding of being disabled and or vulnerable is achieved and being disabled or vulnerable is no longer an afterthought across all sectors.",
        "background": "The current British values are \"Democracy\", \"Rule of Law\", \"Individual Liberty\", \"Mutual Respect\", and \"Tolerance of different Faiths & Beliefs\". Being disabled or becoming vulnerable is not a lifestyle, a choice, or a value; that is why advocating for those who can't as a core value brings cohesion",
