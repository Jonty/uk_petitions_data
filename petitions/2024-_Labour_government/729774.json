        "additional_details": "This application has been rejected several times in the past and is in breech of the neighbourhood development plan. Due to changes in planning law the developers have resubmitted again. The previous issues that caused the rejections still stand and thus development should be prevented once more. Existing road infrastructure has been completely overwhelmed with the recent development of housing elsewhere in Cirencester and has highlighted first hand the impact this will have to local residents.",
        "background": "Block the potential approval of 280 homes in Cirencester as per application 24/02854/OUT. The advantages of this proposal do not outweigh the negatives that this development would give. There is great concern this may be approved despite very clear objections from the community.",
