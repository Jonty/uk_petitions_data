        "additional_details": "Yet today, we are deeply concerned by growing indications that the current government may be considering stealthy regulatory alignment, re-entry into EU schemes, or the slow reintroduction of EU law into British governance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of the United Kingdom made their choice. It must not be ignored, diluted, or overturned through political maneuvering. Any attempt to tie the UK back into the EU\u2019s legal orbit without consent from the British public is undemocratic and unacceptable.",
        "background": "We demand the following:\r\n\r\n\u2022No reintroduction of EU laws or regulations without a new national referendum.\r\n\r\nAnd\r\n\r\n\u2022Commitment to domestic lawmaking & the supremacy of UK courts in all matters affecting British citizens.",
