        "additional_details": "School holidays are expensive, making breaks unaffordable for many low-income families. Many children from wealthier families can travel, while poorer children miss out or parents face fines for taking them out of school in term-time. We think allowing limited term-time holidays for low-income families would reduce inequality, support children\u2019s wellbeing, strengthen family bonds, and still protect overall school attendance.",
