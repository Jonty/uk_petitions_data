        "additional_details": "I believe that if adolescents were taught this within high schools it would have a meaningful and structural affect. If a 14/15 year old come across a person in need of first aid and did not know what to do to help them, think of the impact on this young person. \r\nThere are many things in schools being taught that will never be used in the real world or towards their future.",
        "background": "I believe that first aid training including CPR should be taught in high schools across the country. Not only will it save lives, it is a much needed skill when it comes to getting a job. For example working in the care sector. It will also boost their confidence in real life emergencies.",
