        "additional_details": "I believe the Home Office has repeatedly failed to handle immigration cases with due care and urgency, causing delays that have destroyed lives and futures. Even after legal appeals and decisions, some immigrants face indefinite waits for paperwork needed to work and live legally in the UK. I believe this is a systemic failure which undermines trust in the government and could violate basic human rights.",
        "background": "Review the cause of delays in processing visa applications, including deadlines for processing, communication and updates to applicants, support for people affected by delays, and how the Home Office is held accountable. Review if current practices respect human rights and fairness.",
