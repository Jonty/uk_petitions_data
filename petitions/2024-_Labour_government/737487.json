        "additional_details": "Animals and buyers suffer when animals are sold through bad breeding practices. Some breeders don\u2019t take care of their animals and see them as a cash opportunity. Buyers may be given no info on caring for the animal or how difficult that animal may be to care for. Too many unwanted animals exist because anyone can do this to make money. I am concerned about increased animal disease as vaccines may not be given to animals prior to sale. Many breeders aren\u2019t vetting homes to ensure they are safe.",
        "background": "We want all animal breeders to pay for a licence to breed animals. This licence fee would go toward the cost of regulating the industry. I want officers to be able to do random checks on breeders, and available if someone is concerned about a breeders\u2019 practices with heavy fines for non-compliance.",
