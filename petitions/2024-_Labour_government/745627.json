        "additional_details": "This proposal to make refugees wait ten years for settlement is inhumane and unfair. It creates prolonged uncertainty for families, which is especially damaging for children, and prevents the integration we should be encouraging. For compassion and common sense, the government must withdraw this plan.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to scrap any plans that would extend the time for legal refugees to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) from 5 to 10 years, especially for those who are already part-way through the 5-year route and have established lives and children in the UK.",
