        "action": "Keep the 5 year ILR pathway for workers in roles below RQF 6 care-worker",
        "additional_details": "We want the Government to keep the 5-year ILR route because care workers are essential to the UK. They support vulnerable people, prevent hospital admissions, and ease NHS pressure by delivering vital daily care. A longer ILR route would drive workers away, worsen shortages, and threaten the stability of both social care and the NHS. Care workers deserve security so they can stay, contribute, and continue delivering the support our communities rely on.",
        "background": "Parliament must keep the 5-year ILR route for care workers. They fill vital shortages, support vulnerable people, and keep social care and the NHS running. A longer route will drive workers away and harm those who rely on essential care.",
