        "additional_details": "We think privatisation has been a resounding failure by nearly all measures, other than shareholder\u2019s growth. Every year, the end consumer pays higher fees for utilities with a rapidly declining service level. Nationalisation could improve oversight and accountability. It could also allow centralised and coordinated investment into future efficiency and system resilience.",

Bring under governmental control the infrastructure of providing and distributing water, power and connectivity services. Consider a rotational committee of residents, akin to jury service, to oversee national services outside of politics.",
