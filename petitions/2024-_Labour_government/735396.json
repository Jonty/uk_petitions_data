        "additional_details": "Young peoples mental health is incredibly poor in recent years, and it's a known fact that exercise relieves stress, but many students had negative experiences with the main 4 sports, and so completely shut themselves off from any sports at all. When these students begin to struggle with their mental health, they have no healthy outlet, and so I believe that if we can get ahead of this issue, students will have a variety of sports that they can turn to for help that they might've not had before.",
        "background": "Fund after-school trips to different sports facilities for students aged \r\n4 ->18 to give them the option to pursue different sports that aren't just netball, hockey, football, and rugby.",
