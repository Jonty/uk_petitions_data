It\u2019s like giving that person a gun\u2026 \r\nThe damage is life changing. \r\n\r\nWe should all be allowed to watch and love fireworks safely.. \r\n\r\nThe new firework fights is so fundamentally dangerous to all of society. Those in the fire line, who try to stop this are the police, our public sectors. They are not safe. Let alone our children being shot at or our houses that can be hit, also those who are firing them, they are in a car with petrol, oil. We have to make everyone safe",
