        "action": "Restrict newly qualified drivers to cars of =\\<1200cc & limited BHP, for 3 yrs.",
        "additional_details": "For road safety purposes and driver safety this should be introduced. If people are prepared to pay high prices for insurance\u2026or drive uninsured\u2026this could potentially lead to inexperience causing devastating accidents. I would also suggest that as part of the theory test modules should be completed showing the consequences of dangerous driving so newly qualified drivers are fully aware of the damage a vehicle can do when being driven by them.",
        "background": "I want the government to consider this as a legislative change to stop newly qualified drivers being able to drive high powered cars while they are inexperienced. I believe that there are restrictions on the engine CC of motorcycles. This is needed for road safety reasons in my opinion.",
