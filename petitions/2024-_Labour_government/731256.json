        "additional_details": "Use of E-scooters is increasingly common across the UK, yet current laws are inconsistent and enforcement is limited. This has led to public confusion and contributed to rising numbers of injuries and complaints. Introducing clear and consistent national regulations will help protect pedestrians, support sustainable transport goals, and give police and local authorities the clarity needed to enforce safe use.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to introduce consistent, national regulations for E-scooters, including speed limits, proper lighting, insurance requirements, age limits and rules on pavement and public road use to protect the public, prevent accidents, and support responsible use of this means of transport.",
