        "additional_details": "Many asylum seekers are reported to be housed in accommodation that is overcrowded, unsafe, and unsanitary. Unlike social housing, not all properties are required to meet the Decent Homes Standard. We believe this leads to poor living conditions, health risks, and lack of dignity, putting vulnerable people at risk and undermining public health. We call on the Government to extend the Decent Homes Standard to all asylum accommodation to help ensuring safety, accountability, and compliance with human rights obligations.",
        "background": "We demand the Government to require that all asylum accommodation meets the Decent Homes Standard, as we are concerned many asylum seekers are housed in substandard, unsafe and inhumane conditions. Unlike social housing, not all asylum accommodation is legally required to meet this standard.",
