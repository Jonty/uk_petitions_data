        "additional_details": "The Chagossians deserve the right to self determination. They should be able to choose what happens to their islands in a democratic referendum. They should be able to decide whether they want to be independent, become part of Mauritius, or remain a British Overseas Territory. So far they\u2019ve not been given a choice on their future. Instead they\u2019ve been forced to be a part of Mauritius without anyone asking the Chagossians if they\u2019d like this. Many Chagossians have stated they don\u2019t want this.",
        "background": "The Chagossians should be able to decide what happens to their islands. They\u2019ve not been given a chance to vote on becoming part of Mauritius. They have a right to self determination. The UK government should set up a referendum that asks islanders and descendants of islanders what they want.",
