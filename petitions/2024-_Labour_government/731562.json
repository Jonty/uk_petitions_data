        "additional_details": "Bottom trawling is banned in some Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) but is still allowed in others. In order to protect ocean wildlife and to ensure the ocean is healthy enough to absorb carbon dioxide, it should be banned in all areas of UK waters. In 2024, MPAs suffered 20,000 hours of bottom trawling. If we include non MPAs, the number of bottom trawling incidents is far higher. This is completely unacceptable. Nature in our ocean must be protected from bottom trawling.",
        "background": "Bottom trawling should be illegal in all areas of UK waters. Bottom trawling is a destructive form of fishing where a large net is used to scrape the seafloor, which destroys it, in order to catch fish.",
