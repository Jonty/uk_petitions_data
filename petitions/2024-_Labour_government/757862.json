        "action": "Require HMRC to issue a mandatory questionnaire on how taxes should be spent",
        "additional_details": "We propose that it includes questions on whether taxes spent on access to benefits, NHS care, council housing should be limited to UK-born citizens & long-term contributors only (e.g. 10+ years of paying UK tax). Supporters might argue that this could reduce health tourism, prioritise essential services, and ensure fairness to taxpayers.\r\n \r\nWe believe that due to some wider concerns about national identity this should also prompt questions about how they want their taxes spent on measures related to tighter borders & clearer entry rules.",
        "background": "We believe UK taxpayers are dissatisfied with how public money is spent and the state the country is in. Require HMRC to issue a mandatory questionnaire, with penalties for non-completion, to those born in the UK or who have paid UK tax for 10+ years, asking how they want their taxes spent.",
