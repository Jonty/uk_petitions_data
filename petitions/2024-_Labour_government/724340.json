        "action": "Petition Against the Reduction of PIP Benefit Payments",
        "additional_details": "Cutting PIP would worsen financial hardship, deepen isolation, and make daily life more difficult for disabled people, especially during the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. PIP is essential for independence, healthcare, and mobility. The government should focus on building a more inclusive society with stronger support for disabled people. Reducing PIP would further marginalise the most vulnerable in society. PIP is a lifeline - not a luxury.",
        "background": "We urge the government to maintain and strengthen Personal Independence Payments (PIP) for disabled individuals. Instead of cutting PIP, the government should focus on improving employment opportunities, supporting accessible workplaces, and addressing the rising cost of living for disabled people.",
