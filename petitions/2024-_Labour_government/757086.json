There is no difference to losing any other animal. The speed to inflict serious injuries on an animal should be legalised we have to deal with suffering the loss &seeing the injuries caused by a reckless driver. I fear this could be a child next but cats should have the same rights as if you would have hit any other animal or human",
        "background": "There has been a rise in cats being knocked down in our area & unfortunately one of the cats was ours. My cat was involved in a RTA & passed away at the scene. A passer by had kindly taken him to the vets. We were deeply saddened to get that call from the vets and viewing him with serious injuries",
