        "additional_details": "People are increasingly unable to access physical libraries due to schedules. Increasing availability of ebooks could increase reading.\r\n \r\nWe want the Government to investigate policies to increase the availability of ebooks in libraries by reducing financial burdens and encouraging publishers to increase the overall selection available.\r\n \r\nThe cost to libraries of buying ebooks is significantly higher than print, and the dominance of a \"one copy, one user\" licensing model often results in long waiting lists. Despite increasing demand, the overall selection of ebooks offered by publishers to libraries remains relatively small.",
