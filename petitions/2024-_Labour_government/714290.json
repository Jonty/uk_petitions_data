        "action": "Launch a national inquiry into rape gangs and improve safeguarding measures.",
        "additional_details": "Children deserve protection from grooming gangs, yet systemic failures and inaction have allowed these horrific crimes to persist. A national inquiry is essential to expose perpetrators, hold complicit authorities accountable, and implement effective safeguards. Without urgent action, children remain vulnerable to abuse, public trust in institutions is destroyed, and victims are left without justice or closure. This inquiry will ensure accountability and create a safer future for all children.",
        "background": "We want the Government to protect children by launching a national inquiry into grooming gangs, arresting perpetrators, and holding complicit authorities accountable. This includes stronger safeguarding measures, justice for victims, and ensuring institutions prioritise the safety of all children.",
