        "action": "Cease all military and financial aid to Ukraine.",
        "additional_details": "The financial burden of ongoing military and financial support is weighing heavily on taxpayers. With the UK facing rising domestic challenges, including a cost-of-living crisis, many believe the government should prioritise national welfare over foreign involvement. Furthermore, this continued support could deepen the UK's involvement in a conflict that risks spiralling into a larger international crisis, making diplomacy and peace efforts more difficult.",
        "background": "We call on the UK government to immediately cease all military and financial aid to Ukraine, and to re-evaluate its foreign policy to prioritise peaceful, diplomatic solutions to international conflicts.",
