Even with anonymous username, verification could mean a person can be traced and held responsible and deter people from writing hate and setting up fake accounts.\u2028These extra layers of identification could also enable simpler identification of users, allowing action to be taken by platforms and authorities to deal with online hate.\u2028We think this will create a safer online space for all.",

Nicknames could be used to maintain anonymity in the public eye, but accounts will be linked to real identities to help ensure social media users can be traced by authorities.",
