        "action": "Abolish the planned Vehicle tax for electric, zero or low emission vehicles.",
        "additional_details": "The planned tax is unfair to EV drivers, some polluting ICE vehicles are tax exempt due to their low emissions.\r\nPublic charging network prices are uncapped and subject to 20% VAT. EV drivers are already paying more per mile than ICE drivers.\r\nThe absence of any fiscal incentives for citizens to transition to zero emission vehicles means the sector is unlikely to meet it's targets, resulting in both environmental and economic impacts.",
        "background": "Establish a fair taxation approach which rewards citizens for adopting clean transport technologies in advance of the ban on the sale of new diesel and petrol cars from 2035.",
