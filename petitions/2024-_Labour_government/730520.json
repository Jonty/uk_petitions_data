History shows military interventions often make conflicts worse, causing more violence and suffering. The UK should focus on peace, diplomacy, aid to civilians, and invest taxpayer money in public services instead of costly wars abroad that divide us.",
        "background": "I urge the UK government to stay out of any military action in the Iran-Israel conflict. No troops, no weapons, no war support. Focus on peace, diplomacy, humanitarian aid for civilians, and transparency in all foreign policy decisions to protect lives and promote stability.",
