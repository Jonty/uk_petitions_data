        "additional_details": "Puppy mills and backyard breeders are a huge problem in the UK, pet websites are filled with mutts  sold for thousands and puppy mills pretending to be breeders. The government needs to monitor dog breeding more and implement bans to prevent these. For example, making a license to breed dogs and requiring inspection of where they are planning on breeding. There should be a complete ban on breeding dogs without health testing or titled parents. Unwanted puppies fill shelters, it needs to stop.",
