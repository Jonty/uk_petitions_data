In contrast, during COVID the government of the day felt that enabling so-called VIP\u2018s to bypass normal governance, in order to become overnight medical equipment suppliers acceptable, costing the British taxpayer billions in unusable PPE. No prior or subsequent good deed should offset this fact and those found guilty should be stripped of/barred from any honour or office.",
