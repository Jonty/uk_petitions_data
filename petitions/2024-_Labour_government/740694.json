        "additional_details": "Hyperacusis should be acknowledged formally as a disability, and although there isn\u2019t a validated outcome measure currently, subjective tools, in conjunction with an audiogram and patient history, should be sufficient to identify the condition accurately. \r\nWe urge health authorities to implement formal processes considering subjective experiences to improve diagnostic criteria.\r\n\r\nThe absence of recognition means we are cut off from support to help manage symptoms and improve our quality of life.",
        "background": "Hyperacusis is a rare disorder, making it extremely difficult to tolerate everyday sounds, leading to debilitating levels of discomfort. It significantly impacts personal and professional areas of our lives. Despite its profound implications, Hyperacusis isn't officially recognised as a disability.",
