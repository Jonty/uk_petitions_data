Halal slaughter, even with pre-stunning, is rooted in outdated ritual rather than compassion or science. The UK should uphold one humane standard for all, free from religious exemptions. This would show moral leadership, prioritise animal welfare, and affirm that our laws are based on reason and universal ethics, not tradition or superstition.",
