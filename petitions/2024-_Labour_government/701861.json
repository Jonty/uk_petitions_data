        "action": "Address the UK NHS Autism and ADHD diagnosis and medication titration crisis.",
        "additional_details": "NHS wait times for autism and ADHD diagnosis and treatment are at crisis levels, with some over 2 yrs. This impacts education, employment and quality of life. ADHD medication shortages have left many without treatment for months. Timely diagnosis and support are crucial for well-being. Without it, children are struggling in school, and adults are facing workplace and social barriers. Early identification can reduce the need for intensive interventions later, thus easing long-term NHS pressure.",
        "background": "Implement a plan prioritising timely autism and ADHD diagnosis and treatment, with increased funding, streamlined pathways, improved ADHD medication supply, and early identification through training for teachers, healthcare professionals, and GPs to prescribe medication.",
