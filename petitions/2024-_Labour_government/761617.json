        "action": "Make Pink Floyd release a brand new live album of their 1977 \"In the Flesh\" tour",
        "additional_details": "The \"In the Flesh\" live album should be released because the tour is often regarded as Pink Floyd's best tour, and as one of the greatest in music history, yet no official coverage exists, despite the many bootlegs. The live album should draw from the soundboard recordings of the best and most notable shows of the tour, namely Fort Worth (1st May), Oakland (9th May), Portland (12th May), Chicago (19th June), Cleveland (25th June), Boston (27th June), New York (2nd July), and Montr\u00e9al (7th July).",
        "background": "Pink Floyd should release an \"In the Flesh\" tour live album since one was supposed to be included in the 2018 remix of the \"Animals\" album, but was removed at the insistence of David Gilmour. The \"In the Flesh\" tour spanned from January to July of 1977 and is often cited as the best Pink Floyd tour.",
