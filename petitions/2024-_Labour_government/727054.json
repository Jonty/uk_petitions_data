        "additional_details": "We need to support and protect British farming, and while this trade deal grants UK farmers access to the US market, we need to prevent a deficit. The US is moving to buy American, which may prevent the US market access from offsetting the losses incurred by US beef entering our market. All in all this would be catastrophic for the UK farming industry, and we need to prevent that happening by limiting the losses. This is why we need to limit the amount of US beef entering the UK market.",
        "background": "The recent UK-US trade deal has granted US beef farmers/ranchers access to the UK market. The Government and Parliament needs to limit that access/import and prevent US beef flooding the UK market and pushing UK beef out.",
