This will allow for a significant deterrent for those planning knife attacks, or for women against potential sexual assault on our streets. If the government will not protect us, we deserve the means to meaningfully defend ourselves.",
        "background": "we are seeing stabbings and attacks on a near weekly basis. Currently British citizens have no means of self defence. This must be urgently changed to allow innocent people a chance against knives.",
