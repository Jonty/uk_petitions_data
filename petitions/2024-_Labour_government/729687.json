        "additional_details": "To be able to get the ivf funding through nhs there is a lot of strict requirements such as the couples have to be cohabiting, no existing children (even if the mother doesn\u2019t have children but the father does from a previous relationships), same sex couples won\u2019t be accepted for full funding. As you can imagine infertility can really take its toll mentally, so not getting the help and having the financial stress on top can really put people in a dark place so I really believe it needs changing!",
        "background": "Around 1 in 7 couples struggle with fertility in the uk! But unfortunately not everyone can financially afford to get private treatment to full fill their dream of becoming parents. Only 27% of couples were funded for their ivf treatment through the NHS in 2022 dropping from 40% in 2012.",
