With American and other foreign billionaires threatening to interfere in our election processes, the Electoral Commission has called on the government to reduce the likelihood of foreign interference in British politics. Current limitations fail to address the influence of companies who can spend significant sums and influence elections simply because they have an incorporated company in the UK.",
