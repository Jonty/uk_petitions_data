The lasting psychological, emotional, and physical damage caused by such crimes can severely impact a child\u2019s development, often leading to long-term struggles with mental health, relationships, and overall well-being. As such, I request that the Government and Parliament collaboratively ensure that they are doing their utmost best to protect vulnerable people.",
