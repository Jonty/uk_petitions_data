        "additional_details": "Many in the UK are still grappling with a high cost-of-living: inflation, rising rent and housing costs, energy bills, falling real incomes. Public opinion shows that the economy, tax, housing and cost of living feature as top concerns for many. Some reports show around 7 million low-income households are going without essentials like food and adequate heating. Meanwhile, there is a 2-child benefit cap, as well as increased living costs and tax for many.",
