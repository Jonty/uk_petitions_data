        "additional_details": "We feel that 1:1 devices and EdTech platforms have been rapidly adopted by schools despite virtually no evidence of net learning benefit. Reputable independent studies show device use can negatively impact academic attainment, particularly for disadvantaged children. Some 1:1 devices and platforms are linked to an increase in bullying, access to inappropriate content, safeguarding and data privacy issues and an array of negative physical, emotional and social health impacts.",
