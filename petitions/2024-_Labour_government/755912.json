        "additional_details": "Dementia is a progressive illness that affects people of all ages (not just the elderly) and can create unsafe, unmanageable conditions at home, putting families under extreme physical and mental strain. Residential care is largely means-tested and privatised, forcing families to nearly exhaust savings or sell homes. Higher-quality dementia care is shown to improve safety and wellbeing but is often unaffordable. Funding access to Good or Outstanding care, as rated by the Care Quality Commission, would protect patients, carers and dignity.",
        "background": "Dementia affects people of all ages and can create unsafe home conditions, breaking many families physically and mentally. Privatised residential care is very expensive. We urge the Government to reallocate welfare funding for Care Quality Commission-rated Good or Outstanding dementia care.",
