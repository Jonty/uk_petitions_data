        "additional_details": "Pet owners face inconsistent vet fees, unclear insurance terms and higher charges if uninsured. Many can\u2019t afford urgent care, especially those on low incomes, Universal Credit or disability benefits. We want clearer pricing, fair treatment and insurance that works like car cover, with custom excess, tailored add-ons and protected no-claims. A regulated no-claims reward system, 0% payment plans for uninsured owners and clearer vet communication would offer real support.",
        "background": "We want the Government to introduce fair pricing and transparency rules for vet practices and pet insurers. This should include standardised vet prices, equal charges for insured and uninsured customers, and regulated pet insurance options with clearer policies, no-claims rewards and protection.",
