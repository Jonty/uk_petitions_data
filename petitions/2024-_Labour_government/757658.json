        "additional_details": "The student loan system requires some graduates to repay 9% of earnings above a frozen threshold, with debts written off after 30-40 years. We feel this functions like a horrifically high graduate tax that can destroy living standards, especially amid low incomes, and is a drag on the economy. We believe it disproportionately disadvantages students whose parents cannot afford to pay fees upfront, trapping them in a loan system while wealthier families can opt out entirely.",
        "background": "Consider options for abolishing the current system and alternatives such as a progressive graduate tax, scrapping interest rates, or writing off existing debts to address its unfair and burdensome impact on graduates.",
