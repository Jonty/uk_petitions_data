        "additional_details": "The cost of living crisis may push some households into financial hardship, while some essential service providers are making profits. I think the government must act to ensure fair pricing by capping profits at 10% of total revenue. I think this would prevent excessive charges on necessities like energy, water, and food, ensuring affordability while allowing businesses to operate sustainably. I think a fair profit cap would promotes economic stability and protects consumers from exploitation.",
