We also want stronger minimum penalties for offences.\r\n\r\nWe are frustrated at the level of theft and violence used. Motorcyclists are being stopped and threatened with weapons, garages are being broken into. Motorcycles are being taken and destroyed. These bikes could be the person's only form of transport, and many find that the expense of maintaining and insuring these machines is rocketing.",
