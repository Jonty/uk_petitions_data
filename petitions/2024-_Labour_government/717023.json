The added financial burden of paying over the odds for a test slot is exploitative.By allowing instructors & companies to bulk book tests, learners are left with longer waiting times. causing frustration, added lesson costs and delays in opportunities for those who need a licence for work.",
        "background": "This would stop companies from hoarding slots and reselling them at inflated prices, making tests more accessible and affordable. Additionally, there should be stricter penalties for those who exploit the system and a fairer queuing process to reduce long waiting times.",
