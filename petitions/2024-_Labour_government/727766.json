        "additional_details": "Many people moved to the UK in good faith under existing rules, expecting they could settle in five years. They have built lives, contributed to society, and raised children here. Changing the ILR requirement now will delay or block citizenship for their families, including children on dependant visas. This is unfair and undermines trust in the system.",
        "background": "We ask the Government not to apply the new 10-year ILR rule to people already living in the UK under visa routes such as the Skilled Worker visa. People should be allowed to settle under the Immigration Rules that were in place when they arrived.",
