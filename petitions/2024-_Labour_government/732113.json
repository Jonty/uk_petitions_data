        "additional_details": "Millions of UK citizens have contributed to National Insurance throughout their working lives with the clear understanding that they were paying into a system that would support them in retirement\u2014and deliver a fair, secure income they could rely on.\r\n\r\nThe State Pension is not a handout. It is a contractual promise, based on years of contributions. Treating it as a \u201cbenefit\u201d implies that pensioners are receiving something for nothing, which is insulting and unjust. It undermines their dignity and decades of hard work.",
        "background": "We ask that the Government change its language to reflect that the State Pension is an entitlement earned through contributions\u2014not a welfare benefit. The UK must follow the example of its European neighbours and treat the State Pension as the earned right it truly is.",
