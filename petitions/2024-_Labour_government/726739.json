        "action": "Petition to End Excessive Drop-Off Charges at UK Airports",
        "additional_details": "Parliament should require the Department for Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority to regulate airport drop-off charges. This includes capping fees, mandating a minimum free drop-off period, and ensuring transparency. Airports must justify any charges and offer exemptions for disabled passengers and families. Legislation should prevent airports from using access fees as a hidden revenue source, ensuring fair treatment for all travelers already paying Air Passenger Duty.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to abolish excessive drop-off charges at all UK airports. Passengers already pay Air Passenger Duty in their ticket price\u2014charging extra to access terminals is unfair, exploitative and must be stopped.",
