        "additional_details": "Most cat cafes across the UK struggle to make ends meet, in part because they are financially responsible for all medical bills for all cats within their care. Even small bills for things like check ups add up over time when you have several cats, and cats that need surgery lead many cafes to turn to funding pages in order to try and help pay for it. The government needs to change the law so that cafe owners are able to buy insurance, which I believe is a basic right for every cafe cat.",
        "background": "Right now in the UK cat cafes are unable to buy any form of medical insurance for the cats within their care because they are not classed as pets. The government needs to change this so all cats legally owned by the business/business owners are also classed as pets and not just treated like stock.",
