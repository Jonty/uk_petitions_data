        "additional_details": "Trial by jury is a core safeguard rooted in Magna Carta 1215 and centuries of English constitutional practice, protecting the right of free citizens to be judged by their peers rather than the state alone. Curtailing jury trial in a wide range of criminal cases is difficult to reconcile with the fair\u2011hearing guarantees in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, as applied by the Human Rights Act 1998, and risks eroding public confidence in the justice system. No government should use a temporary majority to dismantle long\u2011standing common\u2011law constitutional rights without clear consent from the electorate. Parliament and the Government should therefore protect the availability of jury trial in serious and either\u2011way offences and drop plans for routine judge\u2011only trials",
        "background": "The Government should withdraw proposals to restrict jury trials for either\u2011way offences with likely sentences of three years or less, and should guarantee that such offences will remain eligible for trial by jury in the Crown Court.",
