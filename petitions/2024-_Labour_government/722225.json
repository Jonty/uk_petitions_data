        "action": "Abolish the Close Season on rivers",
        "additional_details": "The current close season for coarse fish in English rivers has been in force since 1878 - 149 years ago. The world has changed. Fish populations in rivers are now under huge pressure from predators that were not present then, including cormorants, which have been driven inland by overfishing. And from poachers, who can operate undisturbed from March 15th to June 15th inclusive. Tackle shops are closing at an alarming rate. The industry needs help and we believe there is a thirst for change.",
        "background": "We would like the Government or Parliament to acknowledge that the river close season is out-dated and that indeed fish populations would now carry MORE protection (from predation and poaching) if anglers were on the bank. We call for the Environment Agency to be pressurised to abolish it in 2026.",
