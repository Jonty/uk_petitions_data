        "additional_details": "The British public deserves the power to call a general election when confidence in the government has been lost. Too many promises have been broken, and people feel their concerns are being ignored. If the public has the authority to elect a government into power, it is reasonable that they should also have the ability to remove it when it fails to meet expectations. Strengthening this accountability would help ensure that those governing the country remain responsive to the people they serve.",

If we can elect them into power we should be allowed to elect them out of power. If this petition is refused then the publics voices dont matter.",
