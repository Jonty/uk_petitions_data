        "additional_details": "By operating the national rail network on Boxing Day we think it would help grow stronger economical resilience for the Country and encourage people to spend, as a result of having greater access to goods and services.\r\n \r\nWe think such a proposal would also reduce the social impact of being isolated in communities that suffer from poor amenities.\r\n \r\nWe think the proposal would also help the Government work towards the 'net zero target' carbon emission scheme set along with other environmental benefits.",
        "background": "We think the UK Government, in any new contract, should require rail companies to operate a regular passenger service on Boxing Day every year. The exception being when engineer work needs to be carried out to ensure the safe and smooth operations of the railway network.",
