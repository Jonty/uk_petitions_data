        "additional_details": "The petition aims to make women-only carriages a voluntary and protective option in the public transport network, offering a safer alternative to mixed carriages. There are successful examples in Japan, India, and Mexico. Women's safety is a concern, with harassment, followed, and groped incidents still prevalent on public transport, despite awareness campaigns and surveillance efforts.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to require optional women only carriages on trains and other forms of public transport nationwide. This measure could improve safety, comfort, and accessibility for women who experience harassment or unwanted attention while travelling.",
