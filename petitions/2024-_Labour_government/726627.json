        "action": "Allow years worked under an ICT visa to count towards eligibility for ILR.",
        "additional_details": "Research has shown that, due to the relatively high salary thresholds for ICT migrants most ICT workers are net contributors to public finances and provide significant value to the UK economy. There are minimal differences between the ICT and the Skilled Worker visa, which does provide a pathway to ILR. Furthermore, the ICT visa has now been phased out. Given these factors, it would be reasonable to allow the years spent under the ICT visa to count toward eligibility for ILR.",
        "background": "I urge the Government to review the current regulations and permit the years worked under an ICT visa to be counted towards eligibility for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR). At present, time spent on an ICT visa is not considered in ILR applications.",
