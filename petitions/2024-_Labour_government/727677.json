        "additional_details": "We ask the UK Government to keep the 5-year ILR route for migrants already lawfully living and contributing to the UK. Changing the rules mid-way is unjust and deeply disruptive to families, careers, and long-term plans. Migrants build lives here, pay taxes, fill critical roles, and deserve a fair, stable path to settlement. Retroactive policy changes damage trust and risk harming the UK\u2019s global reputation as a fair and welcoming country.",
