        "additional_details": "I propose a snap general election is called because I do not believe that this Government is fit to run our country. Over the last year our nation has been let down due to the way that Kier Starmer has mismanaged our borders, the grooming gangs and other issues besides. Additionally I believe that the introduction of Britcard will be an infringement on our rights and freedoms. I believe that the UK has the right to a vote to remove this government from office.",
        "background": "I believe that the current direction in which our country is heading is going to cause great harm to our freedom. I do not believe that we can trust Keir Starmer to work for the country, so I therefore propose that there should be a snap general election to change the direction of the UK.",
