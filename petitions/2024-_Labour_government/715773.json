        "additional_details": "There are many parental control apps that monitor activity, block websites, filter words & website searches, block apps, put time limits on apps etc. We thin these enable young people to be able to access the online world in a healthy way, whilst giving parents the tools to parent in both the online and real world. We believe that funding a nationwide app that provides parental controls for free would make all the difference to young people's wellbeing.",
        "background": "We believe there is a national mental health crisis with young people that is largely connected to increased time online, social media advances and algorithms. We believe this is having a devastating impact on young people\u2019s physical and emotional development, and their safety.",
