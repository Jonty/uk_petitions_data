        "additional_details": "We want the Government to prevent the sale of small animals by anyone other than the original breeder and make it illegal for commercial dealers to sell small animals unless they bred the animals themselves.\r\nWe want to encourage people to buy directly from breeders or adopt from rescue centres. We think this could help to improve the welfare of small animals, reduce health problems associated with animals reared in poor conditions and make it harder for unscrupulous dealers who have little regard for animal welfare.",
        "background": "Ban the sale of small animals from pet shops and third-party sellers in the UK including hamsters, gerbils, mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits.\r\nAfter two of our shop bought Guinea Pig's died within a week of each other, an outbreak of Strep across 433 UK stores was publicised.",
