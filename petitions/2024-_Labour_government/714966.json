Politicians provide a public service that we fund and it needs to benefit all of us equally with minimal bias. \r\n\r\nWe need real progress towards the long term goals of properly funding our NHS, ceasing poverty, solving the climate crisis and so much more. The government's submission to the ultra-wealthy and short-term profit generation has been left unchecked for far too long and has damaged our children's future.",

Only allow it to be from profits generated/headquartered within the UK and require the transactions to be publicly viewable.",
