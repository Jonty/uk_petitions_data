        "additional_details": "I believe current funding rates do not reflect the cost of delivering care for 2yrs+ under legally required ratios. Some childminders can earn below NMW delivering 15/30-hr funded places for over 2s. I believe some childminders are leaving the profession, and that it is unfair & discriminatory to a predominantly female sector. Equal pay for equal work should apply across all age groups. Every funded hour of EYFS care involves the same professional responsibilities, yet not all are paid the same",
        "background": "Increase the hourly funding rate for 15/30hr early education & childcare places for 2-4-yr olds to the same level currently paid for under 2s. I believe current rates are financially unsustainable, contribute to some childminders leaving the profession, & lack of quality/flexible childcare places",
