        "additional_details": "For several decades now, decisions that profoundly affect the British people have been made by elected governments without truly considering the desires and needs of the citizens. It is a reality that has led many, including myself, to lose all faith and confidence in these governments. The time is ripe for a change, and I propose that all significant future decisions made by any UK government should be replaced by an independent national voting system open to the British people to vote upon",
        "background": "It's time to give the British people a say in the decisions that effect them currently made by elected members of Parliament.\r\nBut the British people have lost all faith in this system and its time the British people was allowed to have there say instead of decisions been made for us we have a voice",
