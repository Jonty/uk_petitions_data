There might have been more. My fear is that the number will prove to be significantly higher, because we are currently getting so little information as a result of the internet blackout that the regime has instigated as it tries to hide what it has done and the consequences. That is why we are talking to other countries about what can be done swiftly to try to restore some sort of internet access or phone communication to people across Iran.\"\r\n\r\nYou can read more about this here: https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2026-01-13/debates/94D92574-B962-41F2-BD4C-B290EC113BC7/Iran"
