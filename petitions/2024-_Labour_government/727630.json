        "action": "Existing skilled workers in the UK should be exempted from the 10year settlement",
        "additional_details": "Consider a person who obtained a skilled worker visa 4 years back, with the rules stating that settlement is possible after 5 years, with only 1 more year left. If Government suddenly change the rules and increase the requirement by another 5 years, it would not be a fair move, as it would derail and disappoint them significantly and it would cause them mental trauma. Especially when the person is abiding by all laws and genuinely working to achieve their dreams.",
        "background": "This is because existing skilled workers in the UK have gone through many tough times and challenges to reach this stage and they have endured much to obtain skilled worker sponsorship to work and stay in the UK. Consider the COVID, during which they supported UK Orgs in whatever role they worked.",
