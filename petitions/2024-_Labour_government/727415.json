        "additional_details": "Thousands moved to the UK on Skilled Worker visas with the clear understanding they could apply for ILR after five years. The proposed change to a 10-year requirement, if applied retrospectively, would be unfair and disruptive. It would increase costs, delay settlement, and damage trust in the immigration system. We urge the government to apply this change only to new applicants and protect existing visa holders.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government not to apply the proposed 10-year ILR rule to current Skilled Worker visa holders. They made life decisions based on the 5-year policy and deserve transitional protection.",
