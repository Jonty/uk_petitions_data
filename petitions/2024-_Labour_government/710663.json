        "additional_details": "Campaigns encouraging dairy and meat consumption conflict with climate science and legally binding environmental targets. The NHS advises limiting consumption of red and processed meat due to associated health risks. The Climate Change Committee has called for a 20% reduction in dairy consumption in the UK by 2035 and a 35% reduction in meat consumption by 2050. We think public bodies have a duty to inform people of these facts and inspire the population to eat more plant-based foods.",
        "background": "To help protect planetary and human health, the Government must promote plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, wholegrains, and legumes, and end any support for campaigns promoting meat and dairy. We believe the UK needs to eat less, not more, of these foods.",
