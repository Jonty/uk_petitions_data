        "additional_details": "We believe the age cap is unworkable and excludes students on longer degrees, placement years, or those who paused studies due to illness, caregiving, or hardship\u2014disproportionately affecting disadvantaged and mature learners. With postgraduate funding and student finance rarely covering tuition let alone living costs, apprenticeships can represent the only accessible and inclusive route into careers where an MSc is essential.",
        "background": "Instead of capping funding for Level 7 apprenticeships for those over 21, we urge the government to distinguish between career entry and career progression and continue funding level 7 apprenticeships (regardless of age) in fields where an MSc is the minimum qualification for starting a career.",
