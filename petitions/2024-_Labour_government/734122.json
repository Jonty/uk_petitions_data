We think medical recruitment agencies need time to adapt, or NHS staffing and patient care could be severely affected. We think some agencies rely on umbrella models to place temporary healthcare workers quickly and efficiently. We think rushed implementation could risk disrupting services, reducing workforce availability, and harming compliant businesses. We call for a 12-month delay & clear guidance. ",

Without it, we think rushed changes could severely impact the NHS workforce. Help us protect jobs and ensure a fair, sustainable transition.",
