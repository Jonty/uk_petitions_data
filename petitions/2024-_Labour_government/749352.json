We call on the Government to commit to a general election if the November 2025 Budget introduces any form of personal tax increase\u2014including income tax, National Insurance, council tax, or housing-related levies. These measures would compound financial pressure on households already facing high living costs, mortgage stress, and inflation. Major fiscal changes affecting personal finances should not be implemented without a renewed democratic mandate. The public deserves the right to vote on the direction of economic policy and leadership, especially when the burden falls on working families, renters, and homeowners",
