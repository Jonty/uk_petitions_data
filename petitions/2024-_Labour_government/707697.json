        "action": "Petition Against Illegal and Undocumented Asylum Seekers in the UK",
        "additional_details": "This petition calls on the UK Government to implement stricter measures to address illegal and undocumented asylum seekers. It urges immediate returns to safe countries, stronger border enforcement, and mandatory identification for all applicants. Public resources like housing and healthcare must prioritize citizens, and policies should deter dangerous crossings by penalizing unlawful entry. Transparency in asylum costs and impacts is essential to rebuild public trust and protect national security.",
        "background": "UK Government has to address the exploitation of the asylum system by illegal and undocumented arrivals. Many bypass safe countries, burdening public services, straining resources, and risking public safety. Stricter measures are needed to deter dangerous crossings and prioritize genuine refugees.",
