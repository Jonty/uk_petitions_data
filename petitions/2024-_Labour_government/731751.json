        "additional_details": "We want the Government to reverse this policy for small businesses as we believe it hampers businesses from employing, growing and generating profit, which raises corporation tax revenue. We believe it may cause small business to lay off staff as profit diminishes and avoid employing new workers. We are concerned it could burden the benefits system too. We believe the current policy is counterproductive and goes against economic growth. We urge the Government to make changes.",
        "background": "Many small businesses are struggling under rising costs, inflation, rising wage costs and uncertainty. We believe many need relief from the increases in employer national insurance contributions for growth and job retention, and that the Government\u2019s actions were counter-productive to growth.",
