By introducing taxes on non-stun slaughter products, the revenue from this could be used for research into other animal welfare projects. We feel some eateries give you very little choice but to consume non-stun slaughter meat without advertising so. If the government can put a duty of tax on tobacco products, we think they can surely do the same in regards to non-stun slaughter produce.",
