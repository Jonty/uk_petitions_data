        "action": "Ban the use of free-running snares in England",
        "additional_details": "Free-running snares remain legal in England, despite evidence of their cruelty and the harm they cause to all kinds of animals. Designed to restrain, they often result in severe injuries or death, including for protected species like badgers and hedgehogs. Labour pledged to ban snares, but this requires a clear timeline. Action is urgently needed to prevent further unnecessary suffering, and implementing a ban would be simple and effective.",
        "background": "Wales banned all snares in 2023, and Scotland followed in 2024, recognising their cruelty and indiscriminate impact on wildlife. It\u2019s time for England to take action, banning the sale and use of free-running snares to protect animals, promote humane practices, and align with the rest of the UK.",
