        "additional_details": "We propose that when a specified level of signatures is reached, there should be a legally binding obligation on the government to act upon the petition. Any action would have to reside in the boundaries of law, and would not breach human rights or the constitution.\r\n\r\nHaving a legally binding petitioning process will improve the ability of government accountability, enable individuals to have a direct influence in policy making, and demonstrate that public petitions are actually taken seriously.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to introduce a legislation that makes petitions enforceable whenever they gain a high number of signatures. Currently Petitions may be debated in Parliament or receive a gov response but they aren't enforceable. The government must remember that they work for us",
