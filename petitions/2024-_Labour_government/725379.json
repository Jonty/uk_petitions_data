        "additional_details": "While the legal system rightly recognises that a person who acted involuntary due to a medical condition or external factor may not be morally at fault, this does not change the fact that real harm has been caused. The current system often leaves victims without justice, compensation, or closure. This creates a sense of injustice in the legal process while we protect the rights of defendants, we risk overlooking the suffering of innocent individuals. It\u2019s not about punishing the blameless accused it\u2019s about recognising the rights and needs of victims, and ensuring they are not forgotten in the pursuit of legal fairness",

How aware are the police, while they are investigating a case, about people invoking automatism?",
