        "additional_details": "Gateshead Council has previously applied for funding to replace the Gateshead flyover and has clearly been ignored. This impact on transport could impact the economy of the whole area and even individuals livelihoods who depend on the metro to commute to Newcastle for work. Increased use of automobile use will also impact the environment. Such state of disrepair would have been unthinkable in this country's capital, Tyne and Wear legitimately needs more funding.",
        "background": "Tyne and Wear area is greatly suffering from lack of funding that has put off essential maintenance to the point that several crossings over the Tyne has been reduced, including the metro, which cannot pass under the Gateshead flyover which is in imminent danger of collapse.",
