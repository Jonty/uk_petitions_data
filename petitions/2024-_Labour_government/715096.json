        "action": "Lower the apprenticeship age to 14",
        "additional_details": "One survey has suggested that almost 3 in 10 secondary school pupils are avoiding school because it makes them anxious. The upward trend of school exclusions in the year 2018-19 was higher in boys with an average age of 14.\r\n \r\nRecent data suggests that SEN pupils with identified needs accounted for around half (46.7%) of permanent exclusions and fixed period exclusions. Exclusions by pupil characteristics demonstrate that pupils entitled to free school meals have a four times higher exclusion rate than pupils who are not eligible. We think the social and disciplinary exclusion of young males, has embedded the label of failure, and has potential consequences such as exploitation by criminal gangs.",
        "background": "I believe lowering the apprenticeship age to 14 could reduce social exclusion, decrease exploitation risk and allow young people to gain valuable skills. Permanent school exclusion rates increased by 34% from autumn term 2022/23 to autumn term 2023/24. ",
