        "additional_details": "Instead of strengthening protections, the government proposes to gut one of the last legal safeguards for our precious ecosystems. The Planning bill would erase decades of environmental protections. The bill would make it easier to override expert advice, sideline scientific evidence, and green light destructive developments, putting irreplaceable habitats like ancient woodlands and chalk streams at risk. The bill may even harm economic growth and slow development with complex levy schemes.",
        "background": "Britain is in the midst of an ecological crisis. We are one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world, ranking in the bottom 10% globally for biodiversity. Please Scrap Part 3 and Schedule 4 of the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which undermine the Habitats Regulations.",
