        "action": "Cut rents by 50% keeping mortgage payments unchanged to make housing affordable",
        "additional_details": "The current housing system unfairly rewards those who already own multiple properties, while trapping millions in permanent rent dependency. Rents have risen alongside interest rates and inflation, yet wages have not kept pace \u2014 meaning renters are effectively paying landlord's mortgages and profits. A 50% rent cut, with mortgages unchanged, would make housing fairer and encourage sales of overleveraged (debt fuelled) properties, opening opportunities for new buyers and reducing inequality.",
        "background": "Reduce all residential rents in the UK by 50% while keeping mortgage agreements unchanged. This would rebalance the housing market, make homes affordable again, and allow fairer access for first-time buyers blocked by inflated rents and speculation.",
