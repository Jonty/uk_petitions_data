        "additional_details": "We think HS2 is an unnecessary project that will benefit only the wealthy. We also think the time it would save travelling from Birmingham to London is insignificant compared to the ecological damage it is inflicting as well as the social damage through compulsory purchase of family homes. We believe a linear park and cycle path could help thrust the UK to the forefront of the fight against climate change and help protect England's treasured countryside habitats.",
        "background": "We want the government to stop construction on the HS2 line from London to Birmingham and return it to nature by creating the world's longest linear park. In addition, we want them to create a suitable path along it for cyclists to travel from London to Birmingham by bike.",
