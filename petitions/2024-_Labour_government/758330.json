        "additional_details": "Introduce a smarter, slicker system that fits with modern life and works in a timely manner. It needs to deliver a system that protects both   buyers/ sellers from unscrupulous buyers/sellers who drag their heels and back out of a sale at the last minute, causing untold stress and financial losses. For example, a system with a deposit or early contract exchange or even an element done on line through the Land Registry. There are plenty of workable solutions as examples which could be followed.",
