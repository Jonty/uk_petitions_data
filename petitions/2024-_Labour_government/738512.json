        "additional_details": "We want to stop leaving victims in social housing from staying in an unsafe or traumatic environment. Many convicted offenders of sexual or domestic abuse may not receive a custodial sentence or be found guilty in court. This means victims may have to reside in the same area as their convicted abusers. They may be left to survive in fear and avoid walking the streets. This includes child victims. We believe victims are being failed. Help victims after abuse and help them move and heal.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to fund local councils to enable the immediate relocation of victims of sexual or domestic abuse and violence from where the incident occurred or away from where their abuser resides, if wanted, once a court conviction is secured.",
