        "action": "Immediately end the ban on puberty blockers",
        "additional_details": "The government has not banned puberty blockers for all youth, only transgender youth, even though there is no difference in health concerns. This decision was based on the Cass report, which has been widely discredited by various experts and organisations, including EPATH and BAGIS. Not providing transgender adolescent care including puberty blockers while waiting for research results is not a neutral act given that it has immediate as well as lifelong harmful effects for transgender youth.",
        "background": "Revert this decision immediately, and allow transgender youth life-saving and fully reversible treatment. So far, no evidence of harm has been found around the use of puberty blockers, while plenty of evidence exists of its benefits for transgender youth.",
