        "additional_details": "We feel these laws effectively declassify certain GMOs by exempting Precision Bred Organisms (PBOs) from existing GMO regulations. We are concerned this may weaken safeguards relating to health, environment, labelling, traceability & public transparency, and that deregulation could allow genetically altered organisms to be cultivated, released & marketed without adequate risk assessments or public oversight. We ask Parliament to revoke the legislation which we think will help ensure that all GMOs are subject to full regulation & scrutiny.",
        "background": "Revoke the Genetic Technology (Precision Breeding) Regulations 2025 & repeal the Genetic Technology (PB) Act 2023. They allow certain genetically modified organisms (GMOs), such as precision bred plants and animals, to bypass requirements related to the environmental release and marketing of GMOs.",
