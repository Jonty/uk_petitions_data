        "action": "Call on Denmark to invoke NATO's Article 4 due to USA's statements on Greenland",
        "additional_details": "This is about security. NATO exists for collective defence and trust under Article 5. This matters. We think the USA\u2019s statements on Greenland weaken that trust and put UK security at risk. Article 4 allows allies to consult when territory or independence is threatened. When a powerful ally makes threats, the alliance is undermined. If the UK is silent other members may doubt support. We think a new united message would strengthen NATO unity and protect UK defence interests.",
        "background": "The UK must call on Denmark to lead NATO consultations under Article 4 and subsequently issue a new joint statement rejecting the USA's statements. Push more strongly for clear NATO unity and greater respect for international law. Make the UK\u2019s position known more loudly.",
