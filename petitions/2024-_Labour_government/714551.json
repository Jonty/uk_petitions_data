I couldn\u2019t believe the limitations of what students are allowed to chose. Why is it that a student can partake at competition level for certain sports, such as weightlifting, but can't do the activity for GCSE? I feel it's unfair that expensive, \"for the masses\" sports are on the list, but other, more accessible sports aren't.",
