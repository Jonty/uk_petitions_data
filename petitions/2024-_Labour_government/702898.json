        "additional_details": "Too many families are struggling to put food on the tables and provide basic living standards for their household, allowing overtime to be tax free will put more cash in the pockets of hard working families which in turn will be spent in the local communities helping to support their local small business owners. We need a radical change to the system which is solely designed to stop families building wealth.",
        "background": "It\u2019s about time we start to adopt the Donald Trump culture, one of his new policies is to remove Government tax on all worked overtime for full time employees. This will give the public much needed income which in turn will help us to afford to live in todays society with ever growing cost of living",
