        "additional_details": "Animals and wildlife can be truly traumatised by the loud bangs from fireworks, my own pets included. It is heartbreaking to see first hand how terrified they are in their own home. \r\n\r\nSilent fireworks would also allow people to still enjoy them. I\u2019m sure no one feels like the noise from a firework is the reason they set them off?",
        "background": "Make loud fireworks either illegal or hard to find so silent ones are used as an alternative for the benefits of the people with PTSD, the elderly, animals and wildlife \r\n\r\nSilent fireworks would not take away from people\u2019s enjoyment but may massively impact the people that struggle",
