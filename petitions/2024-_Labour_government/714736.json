        "additional_details": "The proposed 30m mast in Headless Cross (24/01177/TEL) raises concerns about health risks from radiofrequency emissions, even if within guidelines, causing anxiety for residents. It will dominate the skyline, devalue homes, and disrupt wildlife habitats. We ask the Government or Parliament to protect communities from such developments by enforcing stricter regulations, rejecting this application, and ensuring alternative, less harmful sites are chosen.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to stop the 30m mast in Headless Cross (24/01177/TEL) by National Grid, which offers no public benefit. It will harm the area\u2019s character, lower property values, and disrupt wildlife. Planning rules must protect communities, avoid homes, and ensure proper consultation.",
