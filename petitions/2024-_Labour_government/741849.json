        "additional_details": "Because the oldest pensioners are increasingly disadvantaged by the widening gap between the two rates. They are the ones most likely to need more heating and care, both of which are expensive. Arguably,  the discrimination falls foul of equality legislation, because it is age related, and that sort of discrimination is illegal in other areas, such as employment.",
        "background": "Eliminate the inequality by which, currently, the oldest pensioners are on a lower rate of basic pension and are more and more disadvantaged by annual percentage increases in pensions as the differential between the old and new rates expands.",
