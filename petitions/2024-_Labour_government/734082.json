        "additional_details": "We think toilet provision in the U.K. is often inadequate. Toilets may be vandalised, closed, poorly maintained, or imperfectly designed for their user group. There is evidence that a lack of toilet facilities can lead to a fear of going out. Many toilets have been closed in the last ten years. We think only national legislation can reverse this trend, and national funding is essential so that the money is available to transform the situation.",
        "background": "Introduce a duty that every council should be compelled to provide a public toilet service which can meet the needs of the entire population. The government should allocate sufficient funds to local councils to carry out these obligations.",
