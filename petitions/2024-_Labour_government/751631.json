        "additional_details": "Many care workers in the UK speak English at C1 level and are highly educated, yet they are trapped by care-visa restrictions that tie them to one employer and limit their chances of growth. These workers are capable of contributing far more to the economy, but current rules prevent them from using their full skills or progressing professionally. Many are graduates, including UK master\u2019s holders. Lifting these restrictions would reduce shortages and allow them to reach their potentiall",
        "background": "Many care workers in the UK are highly qualified professionals, including university graduates, who are eager to integrate and contribute economically. We ask the Government to:\r\n\u2022 Allow care workers to take up roles across the health and social care sector.\r\n\u2022 Lift restrictions to one employer",
