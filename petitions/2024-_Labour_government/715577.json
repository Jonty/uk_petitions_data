        "additional_details": "As consumers in the United Kingdom, we feel we are regularly confronted with an insidious practice known as 'shrinkflation'. This tactic, employed by manufacturers, involves reducing the size of products while maintaining or increasing the price. Many companies state its purpose is to cut costs; however, we think many companies still earn a significant profit even when inflation is high. France is already a notable country which is introducing rules like this.",
        "background": "We call on the UK government to require food retailers to clearly warn customers about products that are subject to shrinkflation. We think this practice exacerbates financial insecurity for many UK citizens, especially those of a disadvantaged background.",
