        "action": "Stop energy/solar companies using NSIP legislation to bypass local planning",
        "additional_details": "The use of NSIP legislation to bypass local democratic planning processes undermines accountability, weakens community trust, and risks the imposition of industrial-scale developments on landscapes and farmland without proper scrutiny. While the transition to renewable energy is dedirable, it must be delivered in a way that respects local decision-making, balances environmental impacts, and ensures that communities, homes, businesses and agriculture are not destroyed in the process.",
        "background": "Energy companies should not be allowed to exploit the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP) process to override the authority of local councils in deciding the future of large-scale solar farms and other energy developments. Stop them scaling/linking projects to achieve NSIP status.",
