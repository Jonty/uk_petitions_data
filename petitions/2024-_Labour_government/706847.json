        "additional_details": "We argue that since their inception the Acts have been improperly applied by law enforcement agencies because they have been poorly understood at operational level, due in part to ambiguity in their terms, and the scope of their application.  We do not believe that the Acts are fit for purpose and think that people have been improperly detained, including journalists. We believe that by definition anti-terrorism legislation is about protecting civil liberties and free speech not suppressing it.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to repeal the Terrorism Acts of 2000 and 2006, and for it to commission a review into how other existing legislation could provide the necessary safeguards for society.",
