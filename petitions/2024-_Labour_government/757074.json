        "action": "End the blanket ban on diabetics serving in non-frontline UK Armed Forces.",
        "additional_details": "The Armed Forces apply a near-blanket ban on people with diabetes, a policy that no longer reflects modern medicine or military roles. Advances such as continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pumps allow safe, reliable management. Many non-frontline, technical and specialist roles do not pose the same risks as combat. A role-specific, evidence-based approach would be fairer, safer, and strengthen recruitment without compromising operational effectiveness.",
        "background": "Review and modernise Armed Forces medical policy to end the blanket ban on people with diabetes, allowing medically fit individuals to serve in non-frontline, specialist and support roles in line with modern diabetes care and technology.",
