        "additional_details": "A furry family member of mine has very, very sadly recently passed away but when we needed help from a vet, we asked for help from 5 different veterinary practices in the area, including our current own, and only 1 could come out and help us but we were told that, had we lived just a few miles away, even they wouldn't have been able to help us either. EVERY SINGLE veterinary practice we asked gave the same reason: they couldn't help us because of staff shortages. This is unacceptable.",
        "background": "In a 21st century Britain, NO ONE, animal or human, should be denied help and care simply because of staff shortages, brought on by the failed promises of a past government. This is a national issue that CANNOT go on any longer like this!",
