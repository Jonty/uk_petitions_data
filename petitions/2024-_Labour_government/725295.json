        "additional_details": "Legal gender change, among other things, allows transgender people to get married as our true selves, simplifies passport and ID updates, and allows us to be referred to correctly on our death certificates. Many countries have implemented self-ID policies. In the UK, opposition to self-ID has focussed on the possible impact on single sex spaces, but following the recent court ruling that a GRC does not affect access to these spaces, we believe that any arguments against self-ID are resolved.",
        "background": "A recent Supreme Court ruling decided that transgender people with a Gender Recognition Certificate are not treated as their acquired gender under equities law. We believe that this voids most or all of the arguments which have been made against gender change by self identification.",
