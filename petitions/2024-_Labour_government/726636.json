        "additional_details": "If an elected government, local council, elected mayor or assembly breaks the contract they've delivered to the electorate. The party in question should be taken to the British Courts, if found guilty the punishment should be a fine. The payment would be from the parties own funding and not from the tax payer to deter uk parties from purposefully deceiving the electorate. If political parties can\u2019t abide by their manifesto promises then this should automatically trigger another general election.",
        "background": "The Parties publicly declare their policies that they promise to deliver if elected into office this is the Election Manifesto. There is no legal mechanism in place besides general/local elections to hold parties to account. Election Manifestos should be made into legally binding contracts.",
