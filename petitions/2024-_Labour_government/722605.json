It might be possible for a doctor to treat the patient there. Coercing a patient  at end of life to go to hospital instead of offering medical treatment at home, adds to the patient\u2019s distress.  It is documented that in winter, patients taken to hospital have had to wait in the ambulance or the corridor without treatment and occasionally died, or discharged themselves.",
