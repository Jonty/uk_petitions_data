Alcohol, vaping and smoking etc. Why not TikTok, face book and other social media platforms? They are the most unsafe place for vulnerable and under age people to access. Poor restrictions are in place on these platforms, and no certified checks and can be overridden. When accounts are age restricted by users, though content is legal, it\u2019s not always appropriate and can be accessed by minors.",

TikTok have this tool in place, yet under age people are able to access restricted accounts by using fake accounts and making up DOB to access.",
