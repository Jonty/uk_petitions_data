We think there are better alternatives. We want the government to uphold high animal welfare standards and protect birds\u2019 natural rights.",
        "background": "We want the government to ban wing clipping for all birds, including those kept as pets, sold in shops, or used for display. We think the practice causes harm and prevents birds from expressing natural behaviour. We feel a ban could protect bird welfare and uphold ethical animal treatment standards.",
