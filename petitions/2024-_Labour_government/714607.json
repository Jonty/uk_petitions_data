It was estimated it saved the trust \u00a3100,000 a year to have volunteer blood bikers do this work, however we think it would be more beneficial to the economy if these workers were paid an hourly wage rather than be volunteer run. We think it would also benefit the NHS and it is unlikely to cost \u00a314m in wages!",
