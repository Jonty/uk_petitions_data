        "action": "Prevent blocking comments on social media posts from publicly elected accounts.",
        "additional_details": "The practice of blocking or limiting commentary on social media accounts reduces the opportunity for the public to provide feedback, context and air grievances to these elected officials so they can gain a wider understanding of the electorate, instead of existing in an echo chamber. This is increasingly important in such a divisive, digital age. \r\n\r\nCivic 'Town Square' discussion has been lost during the migration online. We must do something to ensure all voices can be heard.",
        "background": "I want to stop those in publicly elected positions, such as the Mayor of London, from preventing comments on posts they make from official accounts on X, Instagram and other social media apps and websites.",
