        "additional_details": "We think religion and belief are personal choices, not inherent, uncontrollable traits like race or sex. Protecting them in equality law grants ideas the same status as identity. The state should stay neutral, treating all views equally without protecting any ideology from discrimination under law. Removing religion and belief would ensure equality law focuses on people, not opinions.",
        "background": "Remove religion from the Equality Act. Religion consists of fundamental beliefs. Fundamental beliefs should not be protected under law from discrimination because we think this hinders the rights of others. We think many religious texts encourage illegal behaviours, such as inciting violence.",
