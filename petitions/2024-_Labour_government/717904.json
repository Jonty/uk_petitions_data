        "action": "Withdraw the UK from the ECHR to prevent its continued abuse and overreach",
        "additional_details": "The ECHR, though founded on good intentions, has become a tool for judicial overreach, preventing the UK from enforcing its own laws and policies. It allows unelected judges to override democratic decisions, often prioritising rights of criminals over public safety. The UK has a strong legal system and can uphold human rights independently. Exiting the ECHR would ensure laws are set by elected representatives, restoring accountability and control over national legal matters",
        "background": "The ECHR is misused to block lawful policies and undermine UK sovereignty. It lets foreign judges overrule democratic decisions, restricting our ability to enforce laws. Leaving would restore full legal control to Parliament and ensure UK courts make final rulings on national matters",
