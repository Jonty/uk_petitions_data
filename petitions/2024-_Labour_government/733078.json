        "additional_details": "Citizens deserve a Government that delivers on its promises. Delayed welfare reform, rising benefit fraud costing billions, and a costly deal with France that returns few illegal migrants each week have led to public frustration and financial strain. These failures harm essential services, undermine trust, and threaten national security. Parliament must hold a full debate to scrutinise these decisions and hold those in power accountable through proper democratic processes.",
        "background": "We ask Parliament to debate the Government\u2019s failure to reform welfare, tackle benefit fraud, and control illegal immigration through its deal with France, and to examine the wider consequences these failures have had on public confidence and political accountability.",
