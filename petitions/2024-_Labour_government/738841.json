        "additional_details": "Public dissatisfaction is clear, yet petitions have been dismissed. In a democracy, consent must be maintained, not assumed. A referendum would restore trust, provide clarity, and ensure legitimacy. Refusal would clearly show the government cares more about power than people, undermining democracy itself.",

If no, continue the term with a renewed mandate. This would prove the government values democracy over power and give us a say in our future.",
