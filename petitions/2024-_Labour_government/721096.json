        "additional_details": "We would like the government to increase funding because we want to have the maximum opportunities to learn. A plethora of schools across the nation, including us, have been forced to drop subjects, due to being unable to afford paying for this. Schools are not businesses, but rather, establishments for the education of children. To limit the subjects we can choose is to limit our freedom to learn, and to limit the freedom to learn is to leave us uneducated.",
        "background": "We want increased funding in state secondary schools across the UK. We implore the government to not limit our education and allow us to reach our full potential and become better members of society when adults.",
