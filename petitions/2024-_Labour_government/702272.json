        "additional_details": "There has been a rise in childhood obesity and related health issues such as type 2 diabetes and tooth decay. We believe schools play a vital role in shaping children's dietary habits and by eliminating sugary foods, we can help create an environment that promotes long-term health, reduces the strain on the NHS, and fosters a culture of wellness for future generations. \r\nWe therefore call on Parliament to discuss and implement stricter nutritional guidelines in school meal programmes in England.\r\n",
        "background": "We urge the Government to amend the School Food Standards to remove high-sugar items like puddings, jellies, and cakes from school menus and offer nutritious alternatives such as fresh fruit, yoghurt, or low-sugar options instead.",
