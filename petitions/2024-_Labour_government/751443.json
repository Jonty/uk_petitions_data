        "additional_details": "We believe that proposals to extend this period to 10 or even 20 years would create severe, long-term hardship for millions of people including children who call the UK their only home.\r\n\r\nMany refugees have already suffered war, violence, persecution, and trauma. We think keeping them in temporary status for 10\u201320 years, without a stable path to settlement, is inhumane, and it could prevent families from healing, integrating, and contributing fully to society.\r\n \r\nWe urge the Government to protect the existing 5-year ILR route and ensure that refugees can rebuild their lives in safety, stability, and dignity. Finally, for many of us, this is not just about rules, we walk under a sky that offers no safety and upon a ground that gives no stability.\r\n",
