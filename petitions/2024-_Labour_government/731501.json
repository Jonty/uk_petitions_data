Changing it now would undo years of progress in cervical cancer prevention \u2014 and risk more women being diagnosed late, when treatment is more invasive and outcomes are poorer.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government and NHS decision-makers to protect women\u2019s health and keep smear tests every 3 years for women aged 25 to 49. This is about prevention, early detection, and ultimately, saving lives.",
