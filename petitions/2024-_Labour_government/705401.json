        "additional_details": "The lack of transparency between taxes paid and the information provided by the government leaves taxpayers unable to make informed decisions or hold Parliament accountable for spending.\r\n\r\nWhile taxpayers do not need precise details of where every pound is allocated, a percentage breakdown applied to their specific tax contributions would help them better understand the costs of different government programmes.",
        "background": "Given the historically high tax burden on British taxpayers, it is reasonable for them to expect an itemised bill outlining how their money is allocated within the economy. This transparency would enable citizens to make more informed decisions when selecting a government and holding it to account.",
