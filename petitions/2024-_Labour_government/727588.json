        "additional_details": "Extending ILR to 10 years punishes skilled workers who already contribute significantly to the UK. As a veterinary surgeon, I serve a profession facing national shortages. This policy risks worsening recruitment, disrupting public services, and deterring global talent from choosing the UK.\r\nThis country is now my home \u2014 I care deeply about its animals, people, and future.",
