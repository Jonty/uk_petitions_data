        "additional_details": "We believe this could help prevent unnecessary euthanasia of dogs. I worry about the fate of stray or abandoned exempted dogs, as well as dogs seized under the Dangerous Dogs Act. Under current legislation they can face euthanasia due to banned breed status. By advocating for the rehoming of these dogs with responsible owners, my aim is to give these animals a loving home. I believe all dogs, regardless of breed, should be judged based on their individual behaviour and temperament, not unfairly discriminated against.",
        "background": "Establish a Rehoming Scheme specifically tailored for rehoming banned breed dogs that are of good temperament.  Collaborate with rescue charities and organisations, ensuring that potential adopters undergo thorough screening and education on responsible dog ownership.",
