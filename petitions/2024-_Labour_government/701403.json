        "additional_details": "Public bodies and other nonprofit organisations face significant financial challenges as they work to serve vulnerable communities.\r\n\r\nCurrently, some of them are paying high rents for properties managed by either the Duchy of Lancaster or the Duchy of Cornwall. These costs divert essential resources away from their core missions.\r\n\r\nBy reducing financial pressures on these services, the royal family can make a meaningful contribution to the wellbeing of the public they ostensibly serve.",
        "background": "We call on the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall to introduce a cap of \u00a310 per year in rent on properties leased to charities, public bodies, and community services.\r\n\r\nThe recent Channel 4 Dispatches revealed that, while the duchies do not pay taxes, they receive funds from taxpayer-funded sources.",
