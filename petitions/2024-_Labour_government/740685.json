        "additional_details": "Whilst not clearly labelled as an allergen, people diagnosed with MCADD (Medium-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency) run the risk of consuming high amounts of MCTs without realising it, which could place their lives in danger.\r\n \r\nDue to MCADD, individuals cannot metabolize MCTs and ingesting them can lead to a metabolic crisis, causing severe symptoms like seizures, comas, and even death. We believe that labelling MCTs clearly, just like allergens, is a crucial safety measure to prevent these life-threatening reactions and for those affected by this rare genetic disorder. It's a matter of necessity, especially where Coconut Oils and Palm Kernel Oils are concerned.\r\n",
