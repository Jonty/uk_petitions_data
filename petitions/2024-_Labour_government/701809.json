        "additional_details": "Although some work places do have a voluntary policy, the quality of these policies varies hugely and ultimately some employers do not have one.\r\n\r\nIntroducing a legal right to paid bereavement leave could give employees the right to much needed time off when a loved one passes away without the financial stress hanging over them at an already difficult time. Not having this time off when required can be hugely detrimental to people\u2019s mental health at the time and later down the line. It would also put us in line with other countries such as France and Australia where these laws already exist.",
        "background": "There is currently no legal right to paid bereavement leave (time off work when a loved one passes away) in the UK, except parental bereavement leave.  Working parents who suffer the loss of a child are currently entitled to two weeks of statutory paid leave.",
