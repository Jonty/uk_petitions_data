        "additional_details": "Violent and sexual crimes are rising at an alarming rate, leaving many, especially women and girls afraid to walk alone. The Government\u2019s duty is to protect its citizens, yet current laws deny people even basic, non-lethal tools of defence. It\u2019s time to act and decriminalise regulated self-defence sprays so the public can feel safe again.",
        "background": "The Government has failed to make the public feel safe from attack. With violent and sexual crimes rising, citizens,especially women and girls deserve lawful, non-lethal means to defend themselves. Decriminalising regulated self-defence sprays would help restore safety and confidence.",
