        "additional_details": "The means test should be abolished in favour of a universally paid, much higher State Pension, our politicians should be means tested for concessions and bar/restaurant subsidies should be abolished.\r\n\r\nIf ever there was a striking reflection of Britain's rich and poor divide, we merely have to note, how badly our elderly folk are treated compared to how well we look after our very rich MPs.",
        "background": "The Winter Fuel payment, is paid because the State Pension is not enough to live on.\r\n\r\nHow dare our extremely well paid MPs, with their non means tested concessions, including subsidised bars funded by tax payers, inflict what is an undignified means test system onto our elderly generation?",
