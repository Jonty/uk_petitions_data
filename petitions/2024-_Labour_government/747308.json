        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, demand that the Government scrap any plan to delay the 2026 local elections. These elections have already been pushed back once from 2025 \u2014 enough is enough. Every delay chips away at local democracy and denies people the basic right to choose who represents them.\r\n\r\nLocal councils answer to their residents, not to Westminster timetables. Extending political terms without consent is not reform \u2014 it\u2019s a retreat from accountability. Communities deserve a voice and a vote, not another excuse for postponement.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to commit publicly and immediately to holding the local elections in May 2026, as already promised. Democracy belongs to the people \u2014 let them vote.",
        "background": "The Government must not delay the 2026 local elections again. They\u2019ve already been postponed once from 2025. Voters deserve their say \u2014 democracy means regular elections, not moving the goalposts when it suits those in power. Let the people vote in 2026 as promised.",
