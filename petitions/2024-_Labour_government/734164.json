        "additional_details": "We are concerned about elderly people being mistreated, abused, and neglected in our care system, and we believe safeguarding bodies like CQC are failing. We believe inspections are infrequent, and inconsistent, and lack clinical expertise. We think the inspections must go beyond reporting problems and actively fix them through specialised improvement teams. We think failures in care can go on for years. Staff shortages can lead to rushed, unsafe care such as 15-minute visits. Many entering care are new or untrained, and we think DBS checks often miss risks.",
