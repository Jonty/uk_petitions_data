        "action": "Prohibit the wearing of all full-face coverings in public spaces",
        "additional_details": "The Government should prohibit full-face coverings in public spaces to strengthen public safety and security. Concealing one\u2019s face hinders identification, complicates law enforcement, and increases risks in crowded or sensitive areas. Ensuring facial visibility supports crime prevention, accountability, and public confidence. Reasonable exemptions for medical or safety equipment would maintain a balanced and proportionate approach.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to prohibit full-face coverings in public, including niqabs, burqas, balaclavas and ski masks, to strengthen social cohesion, preserve cultural values, enhance security and promote gender equality. We believe this will ensure fairness, safety and a more unified Britain.",
