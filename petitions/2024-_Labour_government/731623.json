        "action": "Opposing Regulation and Calling for a Ban on Pedicabs in London",
        "additional_details": "The 2025 TfL consultation showed that 75% of users feel unsafe in pedicabs, 85% said fares are overpriced, and nearly 2,000 respondents called for a complete ban. Only 7% had ever used one. Most Londoners view them as a danger, a nuisance, and harmful to the city\u2019s image. They should be removed, not regulated.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to ban pedicabs in London entirely, rather than regulate them. The overwhelming majority of consultation responses show they are unsafe, disruptive, and unwanted by residents, visitors, and stakeholders alike.",
