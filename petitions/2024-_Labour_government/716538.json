        "additional_details": "It is unfair as it does show the true impact that SEMH schools have made with the child. It does not take into account the child as a whole and consider their individual backgrounds eg children who have spent a lot of time out of education or suffered severe traumas throughout their life. They need to celebrate any form of progression rather than set boundaries to gain the gradings of mainstrram schools.",
        "background": "It needs to be more focused on the progress the child has made all round since joining the school. It needs to factor in children's individual backgrounds and circumstances to determine the amount of progression a child has or has not made taking all child's background into consideration.",
