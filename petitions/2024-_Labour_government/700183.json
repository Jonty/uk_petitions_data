        "action": "Commercial Pilot Training to be VAT exempt and introduce new funding options",
        "additional_details": "I believe the heavy financial burden of pilot training prevents many talented individuals from entering the field, with VAT adding 20% to an already substantial cost, and makes aviation careers inaccessible to many from non-wealthy backgrounds. Research shows the UK could face a major shortfall of pilots in the years to come. I believe removing VAT and introducing government-backed support would be a vital step toward ensuring a more diverse, skilled, and sustainable future workforce.",
        "background": "I am urging the Government to make all commercial pilot training fees VAT exempt and provide government-backed loans or grants for aspiring pilots. I believe that this would lower financial barriers which in turn would promote diversity and provide a sustainable future for the aviation industry.",
