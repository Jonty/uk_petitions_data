        "action": "Revive the National tradition of Ringing in the New Year instead of fireworks.",
        "additional_details": "Church bell ringing is quintessentially British. This tradition and important skill must be kept alive. Bell ringing is fantastic for mental health and agility, and great for physical health. It has many social and community benefits and can be enjoyed by ringers and listeners alike. The music of the bells brings communities together and is a reassuring sound for many people.\r\nThe bangs of fireworks terrify people and animals. They are uneconomical and unfriendly to our environment.",
        "background": "As ringers and/or lovers of the sound of church bells, we believe it is important to keep the British tradition of ringing in the New Year alive. We would like to see the use of fireworks on New Years Eve replaced by environmentally friendly, mental health enhancing church bell ringing.",
