        "additional_details": "Amend the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 to establish a behaviour-based rehoming scheme for dogs prohibited or seized under Section 1 where no dangerous behaviour has been demonstrated. This should apply to strays, disclaimed dogs, and dogs seized due to owner unfitness or unrelated criminal matters. Dogs would be rehomed via approved rescues, preventing unnecessary euthanasia while retaining powers for genuinely dangerous dogs.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to amend the DDA1991 to allow non-dangerous dogs deemed prohibited under Section 1 to be recognised as such, and for their rehoming through approved rescues under a behaviour-based licensing system to be funded.",
