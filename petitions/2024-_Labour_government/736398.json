        "additional_details": "Manifestos should be binding commitments, not empty promises. Governments often introduce taxes or major policies not mentioned before the election. This undermines trust in democracy. Making manifestos legally binding would hold parties accountable and ensure voters know exactly what they\u2019re voting for. It would bring greater honesty, transparency, and integrity to UK politics.",
        "background": "Introduce legislation that makes general election manifestos legally binding for the duration of Parliament. This means any new tax, tax increase, or policy change not outlined in the governing party's manifesto cannot be implemented without public approval via a referendum or a new general election",
