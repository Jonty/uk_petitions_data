The Treasury\u2019s claim that these changes will affect only one in four farmers, not true.\r\n\r\nForcing families to sell or divide their farms to meet inheritance costs threatens the legacy of British farming.\r\n\r\nWe urge the government to:\r\n\r\n\t1.\tRecognise the real financial challenges of family farming.\r\n\t2.\tWithdraw the APR & BPR changes to protect family farms for future generations.",
        "background": "Petition to Reverse Harmful IHT Tax Changes\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to reverse changes to APR and BPR, which threaten family farms. These tax changes show a lack of understanding of farming and will force families to break up their farms. Protect our farming heritage\u2014reverse these changes now.",
