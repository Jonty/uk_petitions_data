Customers risk losing large fees with no recourse when payouts are denied or accounts closed under vague terms. Regulation would improve transparency, prevent unfair practices, and protect UK consumers from financial harm",

Many charge high upfront fees, impose restrictive conditions, deny payouts, and ban customers after taking thousands of pounds, using vague terms that allow payouts to be refused for almost any reason",
