        "additional_details": "We think that children's weeks in school are much too long and that this affects their childhoods, concentration and family relationships. The 5 day school week should be limited to a maximum of 3 days to allow children to still have a childhood and to allow children to learn at home too. Children from age 5 should not be forced by government and school bodies to be away from their homes and families for 5 days - up to 32.5 hours a week which is the equivalent in some cases to a full time job..",
