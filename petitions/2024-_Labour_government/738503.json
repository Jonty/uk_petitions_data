An MP should be able to claim expenses related to their role, however up keep on their properties should not be paid but the public. I vote to initiate a law that states: Members of Parliament can not be compensated with pay or anything over the value of the National Average Salary that year. The British Public will not longer be responsible for the up keep of the residents of members of Parliament.",
