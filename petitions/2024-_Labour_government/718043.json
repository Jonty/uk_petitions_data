        "action": "Make school meals free for all children, hunger has no place in a classroom",
        "additional_details": "The argument that parents would have to provide lunch if kids weren\u2019t in school is ridiculous, school is mandatory, and always has been. Many families just about make ends meet, disqualified from free meals but still struggling. This takes away money from vital things like extracurricular activities that help children thrive. Meanwhile, paedophiles, murderers, and criminals get free meals without question. England must stop failing its children. Food in school should be a right, not a privilege.",
        "background": "We demand free school meals for all children in compulsory education. School is mandatory, yet meals aren\u2019t, while criminals get 3 free meals. We don\u2019t care that prisoners can\u2019t earn money, that\u2019s their fault. No child should sit in class starving when adults who chose to break the law eat for free",
