        "action": "Ban the viral meme 6-7 from schools across the country.",
        "additional_details": "This trend is widespread in schools and often interrupts lessons. Even brief mentions of 6 or 7 trigger loud reactions, disrupting teaching and making it difficult for many students to concentrate and fully engage. While some participate for fun, others simply want to learn in peace and are affected negatively. In some schools, staff acknowledgement has unintentionally encouraged disruption. Clearer guidance is needed to ensure learning remains the priority and classroom focus is protected",
        "background": "I want parliament to ban the viral meme 6-7 from schools across the country. Students in schools are showing loud and disruptive behaviour at any minor hand motion or mention of either number. We all expected it to be over by now but the acceptance of teachers has just made it even worse.",
