        "additional_details": "We think families should have the right to support their loved ones with mental health conditions, especially if they are unable to fully understand or manage their own situation. Current UK laws restrict parental involvement for adults over 18, which we think may make it difficult to provide the care they need. While these restrictions were put in place due to past misuse, we think they unfairly limit families who genuinely want to help. We think that Government should review creating a system that allows responsible family members to be involved in decisions, which could ensure better support and a brighter future for those struggling with mental health challenges.",
