        "additional_details": "The current medical exemption process creates unnecessary admin for patients and the NHS. Many with chronic conditions, like diabetes, are eligible but must still apply. By linking exemptions directly to diagnosis read codes already in GP systems, access can be automated, admin reduced, costs lowered, delays avoided, and patient care improved. This simple change uses existing data to make the system more efficient, fair and supportive for those who need ongoing care whilst crucially saving costs",
        "background": "We ask the Government to link medical exemption status directly to patient diagnosis using read codes in GP records. This would remove the need for separate applications, reduce admin burden for the NHS, and ensure patients access the care and medication they need without delay.",
