The review should consider matters such as the prohibition of police pursuit use in response to non-violent offences and minor traffic offences; and mandatory camera activation.

We think the police have a duty to prioritise the preservation of life. A review should investigate whether rules on police pursuits reflect this duty of care and commitment to public safety.",
