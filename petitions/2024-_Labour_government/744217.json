        "additional_details": "We think current regulations for a tree covered by a TPO place an unnecessary admin burden on the tree owner, the LPA and the Planning Inspectorate.\r\nWe believe this amendment would retain current levels of protection, while potentially delivering the following benefits:\r\n1 Reducing admin\r\n2 Generating time and cost savings for Local and Central Government budgets.\r\n3 Enabling better management of trees, due to easier process, which could lead to increased work for tree surgeons across the country.",
        "background": "Remove the need for permission from the local planning authority to work on a tree with a TPO as long as the work is done by a qualified tree surgeon in accordance with BS3998.\r\nTo avoid doubt, work in the context of this amendment excludes felling, which would still require LPA approval.",
