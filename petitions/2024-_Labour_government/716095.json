        "action": "Ban the residential use of artificial grass",
        "additional_details": "Artificial grass harms the environment by destroying habitats and contributing to plastic pollution, and may increase flood risk. It can displace plants that absorb carbon, and kill soil life, and offers no support for pollinators. It can prevent absorption of rainwater. It degrades into microplastics, polluting waterways and harming wildlife. It also retains heat, which may contribute to urban areas experiencing higher temperatures. We believe a ban would protect biodiversity, reduce pollution, and promote sustainable landscaping.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to introduce a ban on both the use and sale of artificial grass in residential settings. This should include prohibiting its installation in private gardens and outdoor spaces, as well as restricting retailers from selling it for domestic use.",
