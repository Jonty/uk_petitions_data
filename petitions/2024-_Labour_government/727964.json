Furthermore, I believe the world has significantly changed its political balance and that traditional protection alliances have been proven unreliable. I think the UK needs more than ever to re-establish strong trading, policing and military ties with our nearest neighbours. I believe that for the future safety of our nation we require a brave government who will offer a chance to reconsider.",
