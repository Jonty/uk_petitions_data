Only 16% of s47 inquiries are justified, yet its ambiguity risks baseless probes turning into family breakups, eroding 1996 Act rights. It brings stigma and fines, hitting vulnerable families hardest. With Lords debates ongoing today (Oct 19, 2025), urgent amendments are critical to stop this state overreach. Act now!",

Protect home ed rights under the 1996 Act, ensure SEND deregistration with appeals, enforce UNCRC compliance with child impact checks, and secure family unity in kinship care, before Lords vote this wk",

For example we cannot find the the references to \"suitability\" and \"welfare\" in the Bill that you wish to be defined, and we do not know how you would want them to be defined.\r\n \r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n"
