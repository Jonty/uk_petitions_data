        "additional_details": "Extending the ILR pathway to 10 years would disadvantage Skilled Worker migrants who entered the UK on the legitimate expectation of a 5-year route. Many have structured their careers, family plans, and financial commitments around this framework. Altering it now would create uncertainty and erode confidence in the immigration system. Retaining the 5-year route upholds fairness and supports long-term workforce stability.",
        "background": "Extending the ILR requirement to 10 years would disadvantage skilled worker migrants who relied on the established 5-year route. It risks disrupting families and long-term plans. The Government should retain the 5-year pathway and ensure new ILR applicants demonstrate financial independence.",
