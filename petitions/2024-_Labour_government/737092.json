An annual confidence vote would keep them accountable, ensure they deliver on their manifesto, and give the public a regular say. If most vote \u201cNo\u201d, a General Election would be triggered. This would strengthen democracy, rebuild trust in politics, and ensure the people\u2019s voice is heard throughout a Government\u2019s term.",
