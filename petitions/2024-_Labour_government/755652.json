        "additional_details": "There is no official, government-mandated ban on the sale of rope toys for animals in the UK. As the toy frays or is chewed, animals can swallow the individual threads or larger pieces of rope. These linear foreign objects can travel along the intestines, causing severe internal damage, blockages, or a potentially fatal \"drawstring\" effect where the intestines are damaged. It was too late for our little two year old boy dog \"Chip\" the rope had severed his intestines and bowel. Please ban them.",
