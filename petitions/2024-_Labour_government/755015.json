By not deporting those here illegally, we are putting too much pressure on the UK's infrastructure. I want the Government to prioritize the safety and needs of its own citizens by ensuring that the law is enforced strictly through daily deportation flights.",
        "background": "I want the Government to significantly increase the number of deportation flights for those entering the country illegally. I am calling for a minimum of five planes a day to be used to return people to their home countries or a safe third country.",
