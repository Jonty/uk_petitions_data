        "action": "Restore the Death Penalty by hanging  for Heinous Crimes in the UK,",
        "additional_details": "The UK faces a collapse in law and order, with rising violent crime and a justice system seen as lenient. The death penalty is a necessary deterrent for the gravest crimes, signaling that society will not tolerate acts of extreme violence. Life imprisonment no longer deters, and justice for victims is often inadequate. Reintroducing capital punishment would restore accountability, protect public safety, and rebuild trust in the justice system, ensuring severe consequences for the most heinous offenders.",
        "background": "Acknowledging that our society has significantly changed since the abolition of the death penalty. With violent crimes on the rise and a clear need for stronger deterrents,  we seek to hold the most egregious offenders accountable through swift and decisive justice. Let us restore order and safety",
