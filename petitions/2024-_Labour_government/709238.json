        "additional_details": "Since the number of complaints against accredited counsellors has risen 24% since 2020 according to the BACP you can only imagine the amount of unheard complaints of abuse against \u2018therapists\u2019, who are not accredited nor trained. According to women who have spoken up to the guardian about their experiences being abused by people pretending to be trained therapists they feel \u201cembarrassed, humiliated & under control of the therapists\u201d.",
        "background": "It would a huge relief to me as well as anyone who has suffered maltreatment from a person without any training calling themselves a therapist if the government could work with the BACP (British Association for Counsellors and Psychotherapists) to regulate psychotherapists and Counsellors.",
