        "additional_details": "Type 1 diabetes was a death sentence until 1923. Cancer was a death sentence 50 years ago, now many patients get active treatment, and it may no longer be life-limiting if caught early. HIV was a death sentence until 1996. Now, it isn't a life-limiting condition, if given proper treatment. We think that increased regular funding would help to prolong the lives of MND patients in a meaningful way. We think funds, research, and money is needed.",
        "background": "We want the Government to allocate annual regular funding for the purpose of research, clinical trials, all stages of trials, in order to prolong the lives of MND patients in a meaningful way. We want innovative research to be prioritised. MND is life limiting still.",
