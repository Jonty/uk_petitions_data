        "additional_details": "It is in the Childs best interest to obtain a meaningful relationship with both parents.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, there is an incentive for one parent to unfairly restrict access based on a higher award granted via the CMA.  \r\n\r\nIn unresolved cases, the outcome of child arrangements is dictated by the parent willing to cause the most distress to the child; thereafter the only option the opposing parent has is to either cause more distress or fund mediation and a legal battle most people cannot afford.",
        "background": "Legal reform is required in order to grant both parents shared and equal (50/50) custody.\r\n\r\nFamily law dictates a child has the right for a meaningful relationship with both parents.  However, the dynamic of this relationship is not automatically equitable.",
