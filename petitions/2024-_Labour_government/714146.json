        "additional_details": "We feel that the NHS is a cornerstone of our society, providing free, high-quality healthcare to all. However, we believe that rising demand, underfunding, and staff shortages have led to dangerous delays in care, putting lives at risk. Many NHS workers are overwhelmed and burnt out. We feel that other European countries manage healthcare more effectively with shorter wait times and better outcomes. We think the government must prioritise the NHS to ensure timely, accessible care and protect it for future generations.",

This could improve ambulance response and A&E times, support staff with fair wages and resources and ensure transparency and learning from successful European models. Secure the NHS\u2019s future for all generations.",
