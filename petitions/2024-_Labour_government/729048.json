        "additional_details": "We cannot allow fear and division to dominate our Parliament or our future.\r\nHistory will remember this. In times of global uncertainty, Britain must stand united with leadership that reflects compassion, sustainability, and justice. Germany's coalition model proves that progressive unity is not only possible. It works. We ask Labour to lead boldly by working with its progressive allies, not alone.",
        "background": "We, the public, call on the Labour government to enter into a coalition with the Green Party and/or Liberal Democrats. Our nation faces several challenges, one being the Cost of Living. This is leading to the far right gaining traction. A broader, morally consistent coalition would resolve this.",
