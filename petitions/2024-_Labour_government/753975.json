This is unacceptable and government have a moral duty to recover our monies lost through individual or corporate greed and fraud at a time of national crisis. These spivs are no better than those that undermined our nation during WWII and must be held to account by being fined, taxed, named and shamed whoever they might be.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call on the UK government to use every means necessary to recover taxpayers money lost through fraud and excessive profiteering during the Covid pandemic through the courts, wherever possible, but also by the introduction of a windfall tax on individuals and companies responsible.",
