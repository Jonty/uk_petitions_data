        "additional_details": "The PM's speech on proposed changes to immigration rules has caused significant anxiety among people on skilled worker visas, who are facing the possibility of years in legal limbo over their residency status. Skilled workers already have to pay very high visa fees and NHS surcharges, and doubling the ILR path to 10 years would be a slap in the face. Allowing this uncertainty to fester also runs counter to the Government's stated goal of improving economic growth.",
        "background": "Reassure people legally in the UK on Skilled Worker visas that they will be bound by existing rules regarding ILR (i.e. the current five-year timeline) and will not retroactively see this doubled to ten years.",
