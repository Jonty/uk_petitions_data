        "additional_details": "It would allow more single words to be created, potentially boosting Government revenue.\r\n\r\nFor example, in TA11 EST the space could be removed to read TA11EST. The DfT stated in 2012 that the number plates would still remain readable by numberplate recognition cameras. The DVLA currently sell number plates that if the characters were to be pushed together would constitute a word; but they also prosecute owners for pushing those words together.  Acting on this petition would eliminate this unfair situation.",
        "background": "In 2012 it was reported that the Government was planning to relax spacing requirements for personalised numberplates, to allow for letters and numbers to be moved closer together to more easily spell words. This planned change has not been implemented. ",
