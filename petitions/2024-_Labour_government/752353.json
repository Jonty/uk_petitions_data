        "additional_details": "Freezing the personal allowance during high inflation means workers pay more tax without being better off in real terms.\r\nMore people are pushed into tax or higher bands even though their pay only rises to cover basic costs.\r\nEnding the freeze would relieve pressure on working households and let people keep more of what they earn.",
        "background": "We want the Government to end the freeze on the personal allowance and restore annual inflation-linked increases.\r\nThe freeze has pushed more people into paying higher taxes despite no real rise in income.\r\nWe ask Parliament to up-rate the allowance fairly and transparently.",
