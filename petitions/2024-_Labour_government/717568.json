        "additional_details": "Due to the current lack of legislation with private secondhand car sales, we lost our 18 year old son to an underaged driver who was able to purchase a dangerous and unroadworthy car for \u00a3100 off a social media platform. No legal responsibility for this situation was ever placed on the seller for this tragic event. We have read about many other similar or almost identical situations. We think the government must act urgently to prevent more unnecessary tragedy",

Failure to follow this process should lead to a prosecution or a fixed penalty for the seller",
