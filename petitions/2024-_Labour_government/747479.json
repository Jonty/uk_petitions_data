With 70% uptake in 2023-24, this group values boosters. This policy risks lives to cut costs, effectively culling pensioners. Reinstate to save lives and reduce hospitalisations.",
        "background": "The UK Government must immediately reinstate COVID-19 booster vaccination\u2019s for all adults aged 65-74, reversing the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommendation to limit it to those aged 75. This change will protect this group from preventable COVID-19 deaths and hospitalisations.",
