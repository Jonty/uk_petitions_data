        "additional_details": "Self-employed fathers get no statutory paternity leave or pay, and employed fathers get only 1\u20132 weeks, which we believe is not enough to support recovery from childbirth, including C-sections that can take 6\u20138 weeks to heal. Early parenthood can affect mental health, and many families need both parents present. Self-employed fathers pay tax like employees yet receive no statutory paternity support. We ask for a self-employed Paternity Allowance and at least 4 weeks paternity leave for all fathers.",
        "background": "The Government should introduce statutory paternity allowance for self-employed fathers, similar to maternity allowance, and increase statutory paternity leave to at least 4 weeks. This could support families, promote early bonding, and improve parental equality.",
