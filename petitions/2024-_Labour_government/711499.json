We think the repercussions of this mean an innocent dog may be shot and killed for being a loving kind big softie, that has a family that will forever will have there heart broken because of a gun instead of a tranquiliser. We think this review would give time to look into what could save a innocent life so please please save our dogs.",

We believe that the police need to be better trained in dog behaviour and learn to take time to assess a situation before acting on it.",
