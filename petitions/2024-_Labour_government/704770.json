        "additional_details": "This Bill is a Pandora\u2019s Box of unstoppable tragedies - a legal and moral nightmare. Horrifying stories from countries where assisted dying is legal, warn us that safeguards are easily eroded. As boundaries disappear and financial pressures rise, the most vulnerable are at risk - the elderly, disabled, poor, depressed. They should be loved, valued and protected, not left feeling that it\u2019s better to die than to be a burden on others. And it could be you or me. \r\nWhere is love? \r\n\u201cCare, not Killing\u201d",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, are pleading that this Government reject the Leadbeater Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill.\r\nThis Bill is a tragedy.\r\nIt\u2019s a Slippery Slope into untold sadness. \r\nWe say, \u201cNO.\u201d",
