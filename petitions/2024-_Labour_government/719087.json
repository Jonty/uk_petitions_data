        "additional_details": "Energy is a basic necessity, and its pricing should be fair, transparent, and equitable. Daily line charges disproportionately harm those who can least afford it and discourage sustainable energy practices. By abolishing these charges, we can create a more just and environmentally responsible energy system.  \r\n\r\nWe call on our parliment to take immediate action to address this issue and prioritize the needs of consumers over corporate profits.",
        "background": "We want the Parliment to make Laws to bind Energy Companies to Abolish fixed daily line Charges on electricity and Gas meters.\r\n They should replace fixed daily charges with a fairer pricing model that reflects actual energy usage.",
