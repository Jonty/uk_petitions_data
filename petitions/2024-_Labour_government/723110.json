        "additional_details": "Every year, many tradespeople have their vehicles broken into with tools worth large amounts of money taken. This can hurt people\u2019s lives, mentally and financially, and one of the reasons that criminals may not ever be caught is because the tools are sold online or at boot fair sales with serial numbers defaced/scratched off. This can make tools untraceable and allow criminals to profit off of damaging other people\u2019s livelihoods.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to pass a law which bans the sale of power tools with a defaced or removed serial number, and which bans the sale of large power tools at car boot fairs.",
