This can lead to serious health conditions, therefore, opening the doors for further issues arising as to why they person wasnt changed",
        "background": "Look into the reduction of continence products.  The reduction in the prescription of these medical devices have been deemed inhuman and utterly ridiculous.  Many people (children and adults) use more than 4 pads in a 24 hr period",
