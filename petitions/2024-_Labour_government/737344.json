        "additional_details": "Physician associates, despite their extensive training and crucial role to alleviate the strain on the NHS, still face unfair treatment and job insecurity. PAs are highly skilled clinicians yet are underutilised compared to their medical counterparts. Despite evidence illustrating PAs are safe and effective their preceptorships and jobs have been frozen. The healthcare system's failure to fully integrate and recognise their capabilities is a significant injustice which must be addressed now.",
        "background": "Reinstate all funding, preceptorships and jobs for qualified Physician Associates immediately. Establish a transparent dialogue with representatives from the PA profession, to create a sustainable plan for the future. Offer PA to doctor fully funded apprenticeship retraining opportunities.",
