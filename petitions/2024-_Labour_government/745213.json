        "additional_details": "The justification for digital ID is tackling illegal migration. If this is true, we believe it should be trialled on new arrivals to the UK, who do not have citizenship, not imposed on the public. We think a trial until the end of this Parliament would prove whether the system actually works before asking citizens to surrender freedoms and privacy for an untested policy.\r\n",

Its effectiveness should be measured and published transparently before imposing it on law-abiding UK citizens.\r\n \r\n",
