        "additional_details": "Over 1 million CCJs are issued every year. 93% of these are default judgements meaning the defendant didn't have the opportunity to defend themselves. However, when these CCJs are challenged via a set aside application, in many cases because the defendant was unaware they even had a CCJ, the claimant doesn't even bother to turn up to court. This allows these companies (debt collectors, parking ticket companies) to hand out CCJs like confetti knowing they don't have to defend them when challenged",
        "background": "Anyone who receives a default County Court Judgement, if they challenge this via a set aside application, should receive a default set aside order if the Claimant doesn't bother to show up to the court.",
