        "action": "Stop councils advising tenants to stay after eviction notices, support landlords",
        "additional_details": "Current policies let tenants live rent-free for months while landlords suffer financial losses. Councils, Gov.uk, Shelter, and Citizens Advice all advising tenants to stay until bailiffs arrive encourages legal loopholes, leaving landlords powerless. If this continues, many landlords will exit the market, worsening the UK housing crisis. We need fair rules that protect responsible landlords and ensure tenants meet obligations. Urgent reform is needed to prevent further damage.",
        "background": "Ensure councils stop advising tenants to stay after eviction notices issued, forcing landlords into costly legal action. Reform the eviction process to balance tenant protection and landlord rights, allowing landlords to reclaim properties efficiently when tenants breach agreements.",
