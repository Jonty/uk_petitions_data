        "additional_details": "We think this would make exercise more accessible and affordable for everyone.\r\n\r\nThe pandemic has highlighted the importance of physical and mental health, yet the cost of accessing fitness services can be a barrier for many. We think abolishing VAT on fitness services would be an investment in the nation's health and a step towards a healthier, more resilient society.\r\n \r\nBy removing VAT, gyms and fitness providers could lower their prices, which may encourage more people to prioritise their health and well-being.",
        "background": "We believe the fitness industry plays a crucial role in promoting physical, mental, and emotional health across the UK. We call on the Government to abolish VAT on all fitness services, including gym memberships, classes, and personal training. ",
