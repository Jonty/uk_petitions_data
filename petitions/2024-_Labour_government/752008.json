        "additional_details": "I want the Government to do this because changing rules for people who already have refugee status is unfair and creates fear and instability. Many refugees, including those who came legally, have built their lives based on the rights promised to them. Retroactive changes cause stress, uncertainty and hardship. The Government should protect the commitments already made and give refugees the stability they were guaranteed.",
        "background": "I want the Government to confirm that refugees already granted status under the 5-year route, including those who came legally, will not face new rules. Existing rights, benefits and the original settlement pathway should stay the same, with no retrospective changes.",
