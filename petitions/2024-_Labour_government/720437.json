        "additional_details": "We feel that public complaints require more transparency. We believe that police forces should not be able to investigate themselves as this could promote bias. We believe that police do not hold themselves to the same criminal standard as they do with members of public. For example, we believe that officers that use excessive force don\u2019t get referred to the CPS when they should be. We think there are too many cases where complaints are not getting upheld when they should be.",
        "background": "We want the Government to review current practices for how police deal with complaints. For example, consider potentially allowing members of public with sufficient knowledge of the law to review police complaints instead. This could provide transparency and reduce the likelihood of corruption.",
