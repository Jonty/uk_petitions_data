        "action": "Replace Indefinite Leave to Remain with Stricter Immigration Controls",
        "additional_details": "Replacing ILR with stricter controls ensures immigration benefits the UK by prioritising documented skilled workers in sectors with shortages. It prevents chain migration by limiting settlement to the applicant\u2019s immediate family. Fast-tracking high-demand roles strengthens the economy, while immediate deportation for lawbreakers protects public safety and upholds UK laws. This system ensures controlled, fair, and beneficial immigration.",
        "background": "Abolish Indefinite Leave to Remain and replace it with stricter immigration controls similar to pre-1973 rules. Only skilled workers in high-demand roles should be fast-tracked. Residency should apply only to the applicant, 1 spouse, and direct children. Lawbreakers must face immediate deportation.",
