        "additional_details": "We think it makes sense for pay bands to be standardised across all government departments. We think it makes no sense that equivalent pay bands across different departments could be getting roughly \u00a36,000 difference, some may earn minimum wage and some may earn comfortable living wages for very similar jobs. Many civil servants enjoy their jobs and serving the government and general public and we believe that their wages should replicate the work that they put in.",
        "background": "At the lowest level, some civil service workers are paid close to minimum wage, whilst holding what we feel are major responsibilities over the lives of people, not only in those in their relevant ministries but also the general public. We are advocating for higher, equal wages across all ministries",
