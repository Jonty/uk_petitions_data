        "additional_details": "We want the Government to introduce a price cap on essential food items and for the Government\u2019s investigation to look into increasing transparency around supermarket pricing strategies and supporting fair access to everyday food for all UK residents. Food is not a luxury- it\u2019s a necessity. We believe families shouldn\u2019t have to compromise on quality or nutrition just to stay within budget. We urge Parliament to treat food affordability as a matter of national wellbeing and economic fairness.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to launch an investigation into rising food costs. Prices have increased in recent years, placing immense pressure on many UK households. Even basic items have become unaffordable for some, whilst many supermarkets report strong profits.",
