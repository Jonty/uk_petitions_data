While we fully support the fundamental principle that both parents should contribute to the upbringing and welfare of their children, we consider that the current system places an undue financial burden on the paying parent by not accounting for their actual take-home pay. This often results in a situation where child maintenance payments are calculated on an amount that the parent never actually receives.",
