        "additional_details": "The flags were raised without consent to send a warning that some of us don\u2019t belong. They make migrants, minorities and their children feel afraid in the places we share, twisting our flag into a threat. Britain\u2019s true patriotism is proud, fair, and welcoming. Leaving these displays up implies consent. The Government must remove them, support councils to act, and reaffirm that our flag unites everyone who calls Britain home. Public space belongs to all of us, not to any faction. Restore unity.",
        "background": "Remove the unauthorised flags raised to intimidate people; direct councils and police to take them down swiftly, issue clear guidance and funding, and affirm that our flag belongs to all of us; uniting communities rather than frightening them. Public spaces should be welcoming to all.",
