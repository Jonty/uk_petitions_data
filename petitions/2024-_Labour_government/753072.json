        "additional_details": "Only trial by jury is impartial. It is a key element of our legal system that we can request the right to be judged by our peers.  Trial by jury is also fairer as it sidesteps the political affiliations or leanings of particular members of the judiciary.  Removal of trial by jury is taking a backwards step in terms of impartiality.",
        "background": "I want parliament to reject the Minister of Justice's proposal to amend current trial by jury protocols.  The public should retain the right to trial by jury in it's current format of 1st January 2025.",
