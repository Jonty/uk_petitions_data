        "additional_details": "Lipedema is a chronic, painful fat disorder that mainly affects women and leads to progressive swelling, mobility issues, and significant emotional and physical suffering. It is often misdiagnosed or dismissed, delaying proper care. Liposuction is the only evidence-based intervention shown to halt disease progression and improve outcomes.\r\n\r\nCountries like Germany and the Netherlands fund liposuction for lipedema through public healthcare and we call for the UK to match this level of care.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to fund liposuction on the NHS for patients with lipedema. It is a progressive medical condition causing pain, immobility and disability. In the UK, patients face high private costs or worsening disability due to lack of NHS access.",
