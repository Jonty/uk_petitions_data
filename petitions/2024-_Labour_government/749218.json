        "additional_details": "Standing charges for homes with solar panels should be removed to incentivise clean energy adoption. These charges penalise low-grid users and discourage investment in renewables. Removing them would reward sustainable choices, empower consumers, and accelerate progress toward the UK\u2019s net zero targets by making solar energy more financially viable for households.",
        "background": "I call on the UK Government to set a strategic direction for Ofgem to ensure that energy companies remove standing charges from energy bills for households that have installed solar panels and thus significantly reduced their reliance on the national grid.",
