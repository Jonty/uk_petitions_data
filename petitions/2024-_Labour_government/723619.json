        "additional_details": "I urge the Government to help those who require an emotional support animal to live their life, by giving them the same rights as assistance dogs under the Equality Act 2010 (such as guide dogs), by creating a new law called Daisy Companion Law. I believe that anyone who is medically registered by a medical professional as requiring an Emotional Support Animal should be treated the same as those who need assistance dogs under the Equality Act 2010.",
        "background": "Emotional support animals do not have the same legal status or protections as assistance dogs (like guide dogs) under the Equality Act 2010. This means that there is no legal obligation for employers to allow them into the workplace or access to public places.",
