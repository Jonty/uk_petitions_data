        "additional_details": "Currently citizens from 56 Commonwealth countries including countries with large diasporas living in the UK such as India, Pakistan and Nigeria can automatically vote in the UK from the moment they arrive, even students who are only temporarily resident. British Citizens have no right to vote in most Commonwealth countries. This outdated law should be replaced with a reciprocal system, allowing only British citizens - or citizens of countries that let Brits vote - to cast ballots in the UK.",
        "background": "The UK Government must end automatic voting rights for Commonwealth citizens and replace them with fair, reciprocal agreements - if British citizens can\u2019t vote in their elections, their citizens shouldn\u2019t automatically vote in ours.",
