        "additional_details": "Governments can be formed with very limited support due to low turnout and the voting system. This, in our view, undermines democratic legitimacy and leaves many citizens unrepresented. We think setting a 25% UK electorate threshold ensures governments cannot remain in office without broad backing. We believe allowing the electorate to petition for removal strengthens accountability and gives people a direct way to act when dissatisfied.",
