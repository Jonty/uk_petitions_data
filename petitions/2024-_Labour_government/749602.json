I believe that only allowing the country in which the artefacts were taken from to 'borrow' their own culture and history is outdated and shameful. We should be working to put our own history in the British Museum rather than showing the history of others. Please, consider my plea and consider our moral obligation.",
        "background": "I would like for the government to reform the act, to allow the return of multiple contested items from the museum to the respective countries. For example, the Parthenon Sculptures, which were taken from Athens. The act is outdated and needs dire reform.",
