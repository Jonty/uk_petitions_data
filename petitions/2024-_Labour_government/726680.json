        "additional_details": "We urge Parliament to stop the proposed cuts to PIP, as it is a crucial lifeline for disabled people. PIP is not work-related, and many recipients are in employment. The 0% fraud rate, according to the DWP, shows there\u2019s no issue with misuse. Cutting PIP would force many disabled people out of work, making them more dependent on the state. These cuts would harm the independence of those who rely on this support for essential services, mobility, and everyday needs.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to halt proposed cuts to PIP and the introduction of a voucher system. These changes would harm disabled individuals, limiting independence and access to vital support. PIP is a lifeline that must be protected.",
