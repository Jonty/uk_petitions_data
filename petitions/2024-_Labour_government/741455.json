Let couples marry where their love has meaning\u2014homes, gardens, hospices, community spaces\u2014while keeping safeguards: notice, ID checks, two witnesses, and records. Licensing celebrants (trained, insured) cuts red tape, lowers costs, widens access, and drives spend across local venues, hospitality and creative suppliers, supporting the visitor economy year-round. It helps rural and urban areas alike, encouraging midweek weddings and sustainable growth.",
        "background": "England & Wales still limit legal weddings to licensed venues or registrars. Scotland licenses celebrants, so couples can marry at meaningful locations. We want the same: authorise trained independent celebrants and allow legal weddings anywhere safe, fair, and dignified. Boosting local economies.",
