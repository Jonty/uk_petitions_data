        "additional_details": "Church bell ringing has been a cornerstone of British life for over 1,500 years, with archaeological evidence of bells in churches dating back to the 7th century. \r\n\r\nHistorically, it has marked community events, called people to worship, and symbolised freedom.\r\nDespite its cultural significance, this tradition is declining due to lack of support and funding.\r\n\r\nThis would preserve a unique aspect of British identity and support rural communities and churches facing financial pressures.",
        "background": "Allocate funding through the National Lottery Heritage Fund or similar schemes to restore church bells and train new ringers.\r\n\r\nEncourage local councils and heritage bodies to support regular Sunday ringing as a cultural practice",
