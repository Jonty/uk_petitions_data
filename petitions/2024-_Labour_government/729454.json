        "action": "The British government must try harder to help the people of Gaza to stay alive.",
        "additional_details": "The British government must try all options to help the people of Gaza to get all the aid they need to live. The vote at the United nations in New York on June 4 2025 showed that everyone wanted a ceasefire in Gaza immediately but America voted against a ceasefire. The British government has a good relationship with America and the British government must now put all available pressure on USA to help stop the Gaza war and to help get much more food and water and other aid to the people of Gaza.",
        "background": "Great Britain issued the Balfour declaration in 1917, and defeated the Ottoman empire in the middle east in 1918 and so has a strong historical connection to events in the middle east. Britain must help the people of Gaza get food and water and all other aid supplies they need to live.",
