Specifically, we want to consider limits on how much can be deposited within 24 hours and a ban on deposits through high-risk payment methods such as instant transfers.",

The petition was presented to the House of Commons by Maureen Burke MP on behalf of residents of Glasgow North East.\nRead the petition and the Government's response (https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2025-09-15/debates/25091519000021/OnlineGamblingPlatforms)\nThe petition asks the House of Commons to urge the Government to review with gambling companies and banking institutions what safeguards are in place to protect vulnerable customers from overspending, and further assess what more can be done to protect vulnerable people who may be misusing alcohol or substances while gambling.\nIn response to the petition's request, the Government states they are committed to reducing gambling-related harm by working across departments and devolved Administrations, to strengthen protections for vulnerable people and reduce gambling-related harm. The Scottish Government is responsible for implementing measures as wider health policy is devolved, and in England working with the Department of Health and Social Care on its suicide prevention strategy. \nThe Government\u2019s new statutory levy will generate \u00a3100 million for research, prevention and treatment of gambling harms, with part allocated to Scottish services. All licensed online gambling operators must implement effective customer interaction processes to minimise harm, including financial harms, and take timely action when harm is identified. Financial vulnerability checks introduced last August apply to online customers depositing over \u00a3150 a month, and the Gambling Commission is piloting enhanced financial risk assessments for high-spending accounts. Online slots, the highest-risk product, now have stake limits of \u00a32 per spin for 18-24-year-olds and \u00a35 for adults aged 25 and over. Banks play an important role through gambling block tools, though limitations and inconsistencies remain, so we continue to encourage improvements, with work under way by the Gambling Harms Action Lab and several banks.\nWhat are public (paper) petitions?\nA public (paper) petition is a petition to the House of Commons presented by an MP.\nFind out more about public (paper) petitions (https://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/sign-a-petition/paper-petitions/) \nGet involved in the work of the UK Parliament\nYou can also sign up (https://parliament.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=098af33234df9814f59fb205f&id=6e29cb1262) to the UK Parliament newsletter for the latest information on how to get involved and make a difference. \n",
