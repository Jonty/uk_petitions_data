        "additional_details": "Some reports claim that each year between 250 and 650 lives across the UK are lost to gambling-related suicide, a tragic figure that may represent up to 11% of all suicides in the nation. Meanwhile, harmful gambling can contribute to many people losing their homes and jobs. \r\n \r\nWe think it is still too easy for people who have recognised they have a problem to carry on gambling.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to review protections for people gambling online and  rules around how deposits can be made. Specifically, we want to consider limits on how much can be deposited within 24 hours and a ban on deposits through high-risk payment methods such as instant transfers.",
