        "additional_details": "Greyhound racing causes immense suffering. Thousands of dogs endure poor kennelling, inadequate care, and injuries. Many live deprived lives, while others are unaccounted for as 'wastage.' Racing is inherently dangerous, forcing dogs to run unnaturally, risking collisions and fatalities. Public support for this outdated practice is minimal, with most not attending races. It's time to end this cruel industry and give the existing greyhounds the lives they deserve as loved companions.",
        "background": "Ban greyhound racing in the UK to end the suffering caused by this outdated practice. Protect dogs from injury, neglect, and poor welfare, and implement policies to ensure rehoming and proper care for retired greyhounds, allowing them to live as loved family companions, not commodities.",
