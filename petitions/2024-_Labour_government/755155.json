        "additional_details": "Funding to the Canal and River Trust has decreased massively over the previous few years yet the costs are increasing as a lot of the inland waterways are centuries old. If this was a physical building or highway, more would be done to maintain it so the same should be demanded of the government for the canals and navigable rivers of Britain.",
        "background": "Given that another breach of a canal has happened on the Llangollen canal today, the UK government should provide adequate funding to maintain and enhance the inland waterways to support canal liveaboarda, canal users, tow path users and support and increase mental, physical and emotional health.",
