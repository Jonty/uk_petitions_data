        "additional_details": "The HeadSmart campaign was formed to raise awareness of brain tumour symptoms. Research suggests it helped to halve the diagnosis time for UK children & we believe it showed us that awareness is very powerful & can accelerate diagnosis. We believe a government awareness campaign could help people spot childhood cancer, empower young people & parents to seek healthcare in a timely manner, and lead to earlier, more effective diagnoses and better outcomes.",
        "background": "According to the NHS, 3,755 people under 25 are diagnosed with cancer per year and it is the most common cause of death by disease for UK children. We urge the Government to fund a national awareness campaign for children and young people, as we believe this would help to promote earlier diagnosis.",
