        "additional_details": "Digital ID has received the largest pushback of anything in the UK since 1990. People are familiar with the story of 1984 and are rightly terrified of the possibility of Orwell's story becoming reality. There needs to be a dedicated team that works, with the government, to protect citizen privacy and fight censorship. Organizations like Big Brother Watch are an inspiring example that stand up for these causes. Imagine what a similar team could do with government inclusion and funding.",
        "background": "The UK government has been pushing its reach over legislation related to privacy and censorship without any sort of vote or two-sided conversation to discuss what UK residents would like. There needs to be a team dedicated to pushing back in favour of protecting the liberties these threaten.",
