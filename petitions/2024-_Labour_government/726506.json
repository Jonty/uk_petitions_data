        "additional_details": "I think this needs to be done as many people may feel trapped and unable to go out without spending money on an expensive taxi service. In my view, cities have lots of buses that are becoming more frequent than ever. Some major towns and cities have services run to other major places up to every 10 minutes. However, in rural places with bus services, they may only run every hour or 2 hours which I think makes them less accessible to those who want to use the services and is just not fair.",
        "background": "I would like increased funding to add more bus services, and at greater frequency, in rural areas so people in such areas don't have to rely on cars to get to places, e.g. the nearest town and city or the nearest village with a shop. I think this should be prioritised over increased buses in cities.",
