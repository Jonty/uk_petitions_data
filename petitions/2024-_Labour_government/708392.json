        "additional_details": "We urge the Government to let OFSTED-registered social providers sponsor skilled workers under SOC Codes 6135 and 6136 to address workforce shortages. These providers deliver vital care to vulnerable individuals, including children and young people in residential homes and supported accommodation. Exclusion from visa sponsorship limits access to skilled international talent, worsening recruitment challenges and service delivery.",
