        "additional_details": "Veterinary nurses in the UK undergo rigorous training, gain professional registration, and perform skilled clinical tasks that are essential to the operation of veterinary practices and the health of animals. Despite this, many are paid wages comparable to or even lower than those in roles such as retail or hospitality. We believe that low pay is a leading cause of burnout and staff shortages within the profession.",
        "background": "We think a minimum salary could ensure that qualified veterinary nurses are recognised as skilled professionals and paid a wage that reflects their training, responsibilities, and contribution to animal healthcare and public wellbeing.",
