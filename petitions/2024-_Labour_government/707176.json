        "additional_details": "The imposition of wide ranging Net Zero policies is of huge significance for the people in the UK. The pursuance and impact of Net Zero policies has not been debated and voted upon in isolation of party politics and propoganda. A clear mandate from the people based on a fair balanced debate between experienced, qualified and knowledgeable people is required to gain a common assent for or against the policies of Net Zero. The issue of Net Zero is muddied by party politics. A mandate is needed.",
