        "additional_details": "Jess Phillips has announced that the 5 National Enquiries due to take place have now been \u2018dropped\u2019 by the UK Government. \r\nGrooming Gangs have been identified across the UK, with many instances where vulnerable children have been targeted. These gangs operate under the radar and rely on the silence and fear surrounding the issue. It is time to examine failures in law enforcement, local authorities and government response. Provide recommendations to improve prevention, support and justice.",
        "background": "We call upon the UK Government to initiate a comprehensive and impartial national enquiry into Grooming Gangs operating across the UK.
