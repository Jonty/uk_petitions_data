We feel the situation isn\u2019t getting any better \u2013 many Gazans are recording it on social media. Blackouts occur which make it harder to report. We believe the Government and Parliament has a duty to help journalists capture the truth to the general public. We believe impartiality can\u2019t exist if the truth is unknown.",
