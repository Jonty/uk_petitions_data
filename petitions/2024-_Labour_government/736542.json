        "additional_details": "The Crown Estate benefits from Wales' natural resources, yet we think this comes at no benefit to Wales at all.\r\nIn 2017, powers over the Crown Estate were devolved to Scotland.\r\nAll of Wales' 22 Local Authorities recently voted in favour of having the Crown Estate being devolved to Wales and the Welsh Government support this too, yet these calls continue to be ignored.\r\nWe believe the Crown Estate should be devolved to Wales so profits generated from it can benefit Welsh Communities and local services in Wales, such as the NHS and Education.",
        "background": "Wales' natural resources are extremely valuable, yet despite the Crown Estate making over \u00a31bn in profits this year, this goes to the Treasury and the Crown, and we think this leaves no benefit to Wales whatsoever.\r\nWe are, therefore, asking that the Crown Estate be devolved to Wales.",
