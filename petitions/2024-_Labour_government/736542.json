        "background": "Wales' natural resources are extremely valuable, yet despite the Crown Estate making over \u00a31bn in profits this year, this goes to the Treasury and the Crown, and we think this leaves no benefit to Wales whatsoever.\r\nWe are, therefore, asking that the Crown Estate be devolved to Wales.",
