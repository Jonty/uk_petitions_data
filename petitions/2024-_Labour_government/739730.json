        "additional_details": "Using solely Level 3 qualifications for university applications employs students the ability to be placed in an environment where they thrive due to having complete control over their subjects. That being said their interest and competence should be prioritised over their Level 2 qualifications. This also reduces the level of demand for jobs that require certain degrees.",
        "background": "GCSEs should only be used to determine a student's next course in higher education, not further. This is not a call to undermine GCSEs, but a call to place emphasis on the capabilities of applicants at the time of their application, not two years prior.",
