        "additional_details": "Although this is an improvement from when shops were forced to close on Sunday, 6 hour trading laws are still unnecessary. The previous census revealed the majority of the country is actually atheist, and religion is why we have these laws in force. We believe it is time for change and to allow large shops to treat Sunday like a normal day with longer opening hours.",
        "background": "The Government should abolish 6 hour trading laws for large shops. We believe that this puts pressure on shop workers to work a lot harder due to more demand & customers to go to the store within the 6 hour timeframe.",
