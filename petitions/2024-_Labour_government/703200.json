We think streamlining claims procedures and extending time frames for filing would ensure veterans aren't unfairly penalized by strict deadlines. We think publicizing these rights would educate veterans on their entitlements, fostering trust and fairness in the system. We believe this respect for their sacrifices is crucial for their well-being and dignity.",
