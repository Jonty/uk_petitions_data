        "additional_details": "The White Paper published in May 2025 announced the UK Government\u2019s plan to extend the ILR residency requirement from five to ten years, with reports suggesting this may impact those already in the UK.\r\n\r\nApplying this policy retrospectively would disrupt and limit migrants\u2019 financial, professional, and personal plans as they qualify for ILR.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government must provide official clarification ensuring current visa holders are protected and that any enacted changes apply only prospectively.",
        "background": "This petition strongly urges the UK Government to preserve the existing five-year ILR route for UK Skilled Worker visa holders and other eligible migrants who were already living and working in the UK prior to any rule changes.",
