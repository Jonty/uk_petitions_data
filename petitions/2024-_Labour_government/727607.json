        "additional_details": "Many pets suffer stress, anxiety, or health issues when flying as cargo. For some, separation from owners worsens their condition. Cargo options can be costly, forcing owners to leave pets in kennels or care facilities. Other countries allow cabin travel under strict rules, offering safer, less stressful options. We urge the Government to change the law so that the UK adopts similar regulations, which we believe will support animal welfare and responsible ownership.",

We believe pet owners should have the freedom to choose cabin or cargo travel based on their pet\u2019s size, needs, and airline policies.",
