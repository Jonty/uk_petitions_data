        "additional_details": "POTS can be life-altering and extremely debilitating. It seems there is currently very little training for healthcare professionals on POTS and little research, meaning that many could be going undiagnosed or aren't getting the care they require. Some reports indicate there has been an increase in people with POTS after Covid-19 and it seems there are very few specialists to deal with them. I believe many people with POTS are not receiving any care and have very little quality of life. ",
