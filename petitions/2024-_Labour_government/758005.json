The World Bank warns up to 216 million people could be displaced by climate impacts by 2050. UK asylum law offers no protection for those displaced by climate change. As a historic high emitter and global leader, we feel the UK has a moral responsibility to respond through clear legal recognition and safe humanitarian pathways.",
