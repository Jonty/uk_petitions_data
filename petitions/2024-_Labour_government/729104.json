        "additional_details": "I have a latex allergy and latex proteins can migrate from gloves to food and potentially trigger allergic reactions in sensitised individuals. Sometimes I am afraid of eating or drinking out. I almost had a nasty experience when a member off staff was wearing latex gloves and I noticed when they were putting the lid on my coffee. Luckily I noticed it before I had a reaction. I think something needs to be done before someone gets hurt.",
        "background": "We want latex gloves banned in all in commercial kitchens, restaurants, fast food chains, coffee shops, hotels, pubs, cruise ships, planes etc. We want the government to make it compulsory that anybody touching and preparing food must wear latex-free gloves if they wish to wear them.",
