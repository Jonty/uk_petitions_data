        "action": "Amend laws to align gender with legal sex",
        "additional_details": "The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in For Women Scotland Ltd. v The Scottish Ministers created a legal certainty that endangers trans men and women by excluding them from rights and protections they should have under law. Amending the Equality Act and Interpretation Act to recognise that 'man' and 'woman' are determined by legal sex and gender would ensure clarity and promote fairness, safety, and equality for all.",
        "background": "Amend the Equality Act 2010 and Interpretation Act 1978 to clarify that where laws refer to sex, gender, 'man', or 'woman', they mean legal sex and gender. This ensures consistency and legal dignity for trans people across UK legislation.",
