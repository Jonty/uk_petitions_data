        "additional_details": "Many in the UK no longer feel the BBC reflects their values, citing bias and past scandals. A compulsory, means-tested model based on property value is unfair - especially to those who stream or use alternative media. Funding a public broadcaster should be a choice, not an obligation. Keep opt-outs in law.",
        "background": "Reject proposals to make the TV licence compulsory for all households. Keep the current opt-out for those who don\u2019t watch live TV or BBC content. People should not be forced to pay for a service they don\u2019t use or support.",
