        "additional_details": "Fireworks cause immense distress to animals, leading to anxiety, injuries, and even death. Research by the RSPCA shows 62% of dogs suffer during fireworks. Human health is also at risk, with numerous injuries reported annually. Fireworks severely affect individuals with autism and sensory sensitivities, causing undue stress and anxiety. They also contribute to environmental pollution, releasing harmful chemicals and debris. By banning fireworks, we can create a safer, more compassionate society for all.",
        "background": "We urge the government to ban fireworks. Including prohibiting public and private displays, except for licensed, silent alternatives. We propose the adoption of safer, eco-friendly celebrations (laser light shows). This will protect animals, reduce environmental pollution, and enhance public safety.",
