Unsolicited items are causing avoidable environmental damage by adding to the mountains of recycling. I feel they are an intrusive and a waste of paper.\r\n\r\nPeople should have to 'opt in' and register to receive unsolicited mail as opposed to having to 'opt out' as the process is now. I think removing unsolicited items in the mail will reduce waste and help protect vulnerable people from being scammed.\r\n",

If citizens want unsolicited mail items, they should have to 'opt in' to receive them. Currently they have to opt out if they don't want marketing / unsolicited mail and leaflets.",
