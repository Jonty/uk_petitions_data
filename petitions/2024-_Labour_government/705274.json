In my view, the potential stress of having to appeal school placement decisions, especially when it becomes nearly impossible to coordinate pick-ups from multiple locations, is a significant challenge.\r\nI think such a change could help greatly reduce the logistical challenges many parents face and help provide them with greater peace of mind.",

I believe it is crucial for parents to have the reassurance that their children, especially siblings, will be able to attend the same school.",
