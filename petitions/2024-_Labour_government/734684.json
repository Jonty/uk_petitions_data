        "additional_details": "Helps people commute easier to places such as work, university and essential places. Tfl and public transport doesnt always cover each area and is more expensive than before. This is ruining the experience on young people discouraging them from getting their license as insurance is simply unaffordable in most cases. Be like other countries for insurance. Insurance companies are the biggest thieves and are profiting from others who are struggling to pay for a necessity in life for many.",
        "background": "Help the new drivers and people by making commuting easier. The insurance prices for any vehicle has gone through the roof over the past few years. Many/most other countries insure per vehicle not per driver. The average insurance cost for new drivers in London is approximately 4000 PER YEAR!",
