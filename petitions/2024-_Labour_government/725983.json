        "additional_details": "The current costs place unsustainable pressure on local council budgets, diverting vital public funds including council tax contributions away from other essential support services. The current system risks prioritising financial gain over the quality, consistency, and compassion that vulnerable young people deserve. Local authorities are left with little alternative but to meet inflated placement costs in order to secure essential care and housing for vulnerable children.",
        "background": "I would like parliament to regulate the excessive fees charged by private companies to local authorities, which can be as high as \u00a320,000 per week per child. The care of vulnerable children should not be a vehicle for excessive private profit, especially when funded by taxpayers.",
