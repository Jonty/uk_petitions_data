In the initial summary the HFSS regulation was put into place for obesity prevention. I do understand how much of an issue this is for the government but I believe not promoting alcohol and not romanticising a serious addictive substance can also save lives and cut healthcare costs and justice expenses as well. It\u2019s not a fix, but it\u2019s a prevention measure, to reduce the drinking culture.",
