        "additional_details": "We feel a licensing scheme will be fairer and could give opportunity for people to change their negative perceptions and stop demonising all dogs because some people are bad owners. Many large dogs are well-trained and friendly, and could be kept by responsible owners who have passed a course and DBS check to gain a licence. To keep their license, the owner would have to prove they have paid for professional training for their dog. There could be regular checks on the dog's welfare too.",
        "background": "We feel the current ban on certain dog breeds punishes the animal not the owner, and is distressing to owners of well behaved dogs. We believe the problem is poor training. Instead of bans, there should be a license system to own certain dog breeds, just like the gun license system.",
