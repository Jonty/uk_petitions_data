        "action": "Amend Broadcast Standards to Prohibit AI generated content from advertising",
        "additional_details": "Ai generated content is extremely dangerous in the advertising industry. The usage of AI is deceptive to a degree that can easily confuse the public. It is visually disturbing, and funnels money, jobs, and opportunities from our already vulnerable UK Film industry into American Big Tech firms, automating away the labour talented Brits rely on for steady work. AI is a product the UK does not produce, and its proliferation will make us a nation of customers to the USA without immediate safeguards.",
        "background": "AI generated content should not be allowed on TV. I propose that the use of AI on broadcast should be governed as obscene under the Broadcasting Act 1990, and prohibited from broadcast as soon as possible. If this is not possible, it must be prohibited by OFCOM immediately.",
