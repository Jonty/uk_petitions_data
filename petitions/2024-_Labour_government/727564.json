        "action": "Do not change ILR qualification period, PSW duration for existing immigrants.",
        "additional_details": "Retroactively applying new immigration rules to existing immigrants violates the principle of legal certainty. These individuals made life-altering decisions based on current policies, investing in homes,careers, and communities under a legitimate expectation of stability. Changing requirements midway creates severe hardship, disrupting established lives and breaking implicit social contracts. It undermines trust in government, UK's international reputation and contradicts fundamental principles",
        "background": "The recent proposal to increase the qualifying period for settlement to 10 years should not be changed from the current 5 years and PSW duration should not be reduced from 24 to 18 months. Any changes in immigration rules should be for new immigrants and not the existing ones.",
