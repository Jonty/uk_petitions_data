        "additional_details": "Call for Electrical Industry Reform\r\n\r\nDespite the introduction of Part P to improve domestic electrical safety, accreditation bodies have failed to enforce compliance effectively. A major body was recently fined by ACAS for inadequate assessments, reflecting deeper industry issues.\r\n\r\nUnregistered electrical work continues to endanger lives and property. A stricter, centralized system\u2014like New Zealand\u2019s\u2014is urgently needed to raise safety standards and remove rogue operators.",
        "background": "Electrical Industry Regulatory Proposal\r\n\r\nLimit public sales of electrical materials to basic items (e.g., sockets, switches, accessories).\r\n\r\nOnly accredited/qualified electricians may carry out electrical installations.\r\n\r\nIntroduce nationally recognized installer ID cards as proof of competence",
