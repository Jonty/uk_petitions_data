        "additional_details": "Allowing such imports would not only undermine UK farmers, who adhere to stricter environmental and animal welfare standards, but also risk the health and safety of British consumers. Moreover, it would strain the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU, which does not accept such imports from the US due to their lower standards. Accepting these products would create tension with the EU, undermining vital trade agreements and cooperation.",

Specifically, the import of hormone-treated beef, chlorine-washed chicken, and other substandard agricultural products from the US.",
