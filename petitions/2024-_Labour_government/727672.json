        "additional_details": "Extending the ILR route from 5 to 10 years would unfairly affect migrants already living in the UK under the current rules. Many have built their lives here based on the 5-year pathway. Applying changes retrospectively would cause disruption and hardship. We ask the Government to apply any new rules only to future applicants, not to those already on the existing route.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to ensure that any changes extending the ILR route from 5 years to 10 years are not applied retrospectively. Migrants already residing in the UK based on the existing 5-year ILR route must be allowed to complete their settlement under the original rules they started with.",
