        "additional_details": "For generations, small farms have fed Britain and preserved our countryside. We think removing Agricultural Property Relief (APR) on farmland and slashing Business Property Relief (BPR) for family businesses will saddle families with an unaffordable 20% inheritance tax. Many MAY [will] be forced to sell farmland or businesses held for decades to pay tax. Once a family farm or business is broken up, its legacy and local jobs vanish, weakening rural heritage and potentially undermining our food security.",

We believe these reforms could inflict irreparable harm on rural heritage and food security.",
