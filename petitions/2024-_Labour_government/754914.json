        "additional_details": "We believe weak sentencing, routine bail, and failure to enforce restraining orders allow known abusers to repeatedly breach conditions without consequence. This can put victims at extreme risk and lead to preventable injuries and deaths. We believe laws must prioritise victim safety. Failures in domestic violence responses have cost many lives. We believe dangerous offenders are released despite risk, restraining orders are ignored, sentencing is lenient, and vital evidence is dismissed.",
        "background": "We call on Parliament to increase domestic violence maximum sentences and strengthen bail laws by banning bail to high-risk and repeat offenders. Increase penalties for repeat abuse and restraining order breaches to prioritise victim safety. Risk assessments should be required before release.",
