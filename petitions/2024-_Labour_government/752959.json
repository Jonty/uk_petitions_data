        "action": "Ban the use of netting on roofs and outdoor structures",
        "additional_details": "We believe Parliament can stop this by banning the netting causing it. The Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 places responsibility for maintenance on Property Owners. The Animal Welfare Act 2006 gives trapped wildlife the same protection as domestic animals if trapped after 25 hours. We believe neither are being observed nor enforced.\r\n \r\nSpecialist equipment is often required to free the birds. Most Organisations/Individuals responsible do not want to pay the cost. Under the Animal Sentience Act 2022, birds are sentient beings that should not be tortured.",
        "background": "Thousands of birds are reported to get trapped in netting yearly, and many may die in pain and fear from the horrific injuries sustained trying to free themselves e.g. breaking their entangled limbs. Others may die of dehydration and starvation and rescuers are too late.",
