We think a licensing system is a practical solution that addresses these risks broadly, promoting digital safety without unfair restrictions. The authority would oversee training, registration, and accountability, similar to driver licensing. We think these proactive measure ensures responsible device usage and protects both public safety and digital freedom.",
