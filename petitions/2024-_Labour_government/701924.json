        "additional_details": "We think current campaigns stigmatize children by seeking to ban their smartphone use, though misuse risks extend to untrained adults. We think a licensing system is a practical solution that addresses these risks broadly, promoting digital safety without unfair restrictions. The authority would oversee training, registration, and accountability, similar to driver licensing. We think these proactive measure ensures responsible device usage and protects both public safety and digital freedom.",
