        "additional_details": "The idea of EU troops on Ukraine territory is not favoured by all NATO countries, Hungary, Poland, Chechia, Spain, Slovakia and Italy have all said they would not send troops to Ukraine so there is a deep split in NATO on this subject.  The only way for peace is for Europe including Britain to have sensible dialogue with Russia on ways to come to a permanent peace.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to reconcider its policy to send British troops to Ukraine,  sending British troops to Ukraine would be a disaster and could lead to a war with Russia nobody wants as well as leading to deaths and casualties never seen since the first World War.",
