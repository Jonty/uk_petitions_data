I was shocked to discover that there is no tax relief for training to enable new business setup or for business expansion.\r\n \r\nWe feel that training costs, especially for businesses requiring qualifications, can be a significant barrier to entry for potential entrepreneurs and that self-employed people and small businesses already have a disproportionate tax burden.\r\n \r\nWe believe that successful economies support growth of new and small businesses.",
