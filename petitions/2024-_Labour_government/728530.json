        "action": "Hold a debate on AI automation, mass job loss, and Universal Basic Income",
        "additional_details": "AI and automation are advancing rapidly, threatening millions of jobs in sectors from law to logistics. Many workers may soon find themselves without work, income, or prospects: not due to failure, but because machines can do it faster and cheaper. We believe Parliament must urgently address this reality and explore policies like UBI to ensure no one is left behind in the transition. Without action, the social and economic consequences could be severe and irreversible.",
        "background": "We ask Parliament to debate the economic impact of AI and automation, including projected job losses across sectors, and to explore Universal Basic Income (UBI) as a potential policy response to protect livelihoods and ensure economic stability in the years ahead.",
