The grooming gang fiasco is a failure by the executive, legislature and judiciary branches of government. The victims are those who were helpless, suffering at the hands of brutal unrelenting abuse. Those in power to end this abuse looked on, and allowed this to continue. Society and this parliament owe it to the abused to take firm and robust action against this unacceptable evil.",
