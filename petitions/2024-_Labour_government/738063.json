        "additional_details": "We believe that children deserve the highest level of protection under the law. Sexual abuse against children are among the most heinous acts imaginable. They cause lifelong trauma, shatter families, and strip away the innocence every child has a right to. Current sentencing does not adequately reflect the seriousness of these crimes, nor does it ensure the safety of future generations. Too often, offenders are released back into society, where they may reoffend and cause further devastation.",
        "background": "We call upon lawmakers and the justice system to take decisive action:\r\n\r\n- Introduce life imprisonment as the mandatory sentence for all convicted child sex offenders.\r\n- Put the rights, safety, and wellbeing of children above the freedoms of predators.",
