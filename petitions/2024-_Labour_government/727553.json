        "additional_details": "We believe the current law criminalises compassionate wildlife care and does not affect the grey squirrel population, already well established in the UK.\r\n\r\nSome estimates suggest there are around 2.5 to 3 million grey squirrels in the UK. We think preventing the release of a small number of rehabilitated individuals by wildlife carers does not materially reduce their numbers but imposes, in our view, unnecessary penalties on those trying to help injured or orphaned animals.\r\n\r\nWe believe our proposal would remove what we see as a perverse disincentive on veterinary and conservation practitioners, without advancing the species\u2019 spread and without compromising biosecurity objectives.",
