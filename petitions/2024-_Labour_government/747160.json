        "additional_details": "We believe schools should only give homework to Year 10 students & above as giving homework to students in Year 9 and below may cause stress and impact their development. Students in Year 9 and below may understand schoolwork even better without homework, as it could double their motivation for tests and quizzes, as they may have more time to study. Students could be given homework when they're closer to getting jobs, to prepare them for the real world of projects and work done at home.",
