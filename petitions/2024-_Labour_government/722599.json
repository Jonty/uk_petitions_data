        "additional_details": "In the financial year ending 2024, the DWP reported an estimated 0.1% PIP claims overpaid due to fraud, 0.2% due to claimant error and 0.2% due to official error. This is not enough to constitute removing the benefit for everyone in the UK who relies on it. These benefits offer a lifeline and independence where possible, and the proposed cuts will leave thousands of disabled people at-risk and could lead to the deaths of many if people no longer have the means and funds necessary to survive.",
        "background": "Thousands of people in the UK have a disability, physical or otherwise, and many of these people use Disability Benefits provided by the government as a means to survive. By putting a stop to the proposed benefit cuts, disabled people will continue to have the freedom and independence they need.",
