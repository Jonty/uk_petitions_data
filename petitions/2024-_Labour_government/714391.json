        "additional_details": "Because it will help the planet and I love the sound of our planet not exploding as fast,it would be nice for the planet to explode when it is not exploding because of humans because it was the natural world that did it. Plus it is nice for the poor animals that are getting affected not to be affect anymore. Just imagine a cute polar bear cub sitting on some thin ice about to drop into the water. It sounds very sad so we need to help endangered animals like polar bears instead of killing them.",
        "background": "Can you please spend a little more time on things like our planet so we can save it and a way to do that is to get more bins so less people litter and we could get  more solar panels to reduce the amount of fossil fuels being burned. That means we can help our planet and help us as well.",
