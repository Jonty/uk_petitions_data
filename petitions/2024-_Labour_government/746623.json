Many citizens believe the current administration no longer commands the confidence of the public or Parliament. A formal vote of no confidence would ensure accountability and restore public trust in democratic governance. We therefore seek the opportunity for the electorate to deliver a renewed and legitimate mandate through a general election.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, respectfully request that Parliament hold a vote of no confidence in the current Government. Rising living costs, national unrest and increasing division have caused serious concern. We further urge His Majesty the King to dissolve Parliament and call a general election.",
