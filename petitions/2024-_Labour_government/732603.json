        "additional_details": "There are growing numbers of reported illnesses linked to polluted water, including life-threatening infections. Real-time testing exists. We call on water companies to be levied to fund the Environment Agency to roll it out nationwide, all year round. We think winter testing is essential, as some of the largest sewage discharges occur out of season, when there\u2019s likely to be less public awareness or monitoring. Set clear safety standards. Track and report illness. Provide care for those affected. Protect people, not profits. We think clean water isn\u2019t a luxury, it\u2019s a basic human right and a legacy we owe future generations.",
