        "additional_details": "Domestic violence happens across the UK. New spouses in migrant communities may come from countries with different legal, cultural, and gender norms who may arrive unaware of their rights, protections, or the definition of abuse under UK law.\r\n \r\nSome of these spouses, predominantly women, may become trapped in cycles of violence, unable to identify abuse or reach out for help. In some cases, they may be isolated, controlled, and denied access to education, healthcare, or basic freedoms. We think this may lead to generational trauma, especially impacting young children\u2019s mental and emotional development.\r\n \r\nWe think lack of awareness should not be a reason for lifelong suffering.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to make a Legal Awareness Course mandatory for all spousal visa applicants before arrival.\r\n \r\nWe think this would:\r\n\u2022 Educate on rights and laws\r\n\u2022 Help spot abuse early\r\n\u2022 Support safer integration",
