        "action": "Protect current immigrants with a work visa from any settlement time extensions.",
        "additional_details": "Many current immigrants have spent years working in essential roles, including health and social care, education, religious leadership, and skilled trades. They have integrated into local communities and many have made long-term life plans based on the 5-year settlement path. Changing the rules midway creates instability and financial uncertainty for families who are already settled and contributing, and risks driving away skilled, committed people who want to make the UK their permanent home.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to ensure that any extension of the settlement qualifying time would not apply to those who have already spent years contributing to the UK's economy, communities, and public services under the reasonable expectation that they could settle after five years.",
