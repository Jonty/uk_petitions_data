        "additional_details": "Ptarmigans are red-listed birds restricted to high altitudes in the North-West highlands of Scotland. They are in severe decline and are one of the species most in need of conservation efforts. The RSPB estimates that their population could be as low as 2000 individuals. They used to inhabit the southern uplands and lake district, but they are now extinct in England and heading for extinction in Scotland due to humans and climate change. It makes no sense to anyone to hunt endangered species.",
        "background": "Pass a law to make the shooting of Ptarmigans as game birds illegal to prevent their extinction in the UK.",
