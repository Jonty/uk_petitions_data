        "action": "Ban fish-shaped single-use plastic soy sauce dispensers",
        "additional_details": "Following an Australian state's recent ban on these, single-use plastic fish in takeaway sushi and soy sauce packages are an unnecessary source of pollution. These items often end up in landfills or oceans, harming wildlife and ecosystems. As the UK strives to reduce plastic waste and meet climate goals, banning such items will help lower plastic consumption, protect marine life, and promote sustainable packaging alternatives. With growing awareness, it\u2019s vital for the government to take action on this.",
        "background": "Plastic fish used in takeaway sushi and soy sauce are wasteful, non-recyclable, and contribute to environmental harm. Banning their use would reduce plastic pollution, protect marine life, and encourage sustainable alternatives, aligning with the UK's environmental goals and reducing excess waste.",
