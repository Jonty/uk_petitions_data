However, current sentencing often fails to reflect the true gravity of these offenses, leaving survivors without the justice they deserve.\r\nRaising the sentences for child rapists will send a clear message: Such crimes will not be tolerated in our society.We urge the Government to implement harsher sentencing guidelines to protect the most innocent members of our society\u2014our children.\"",
        "background": "\"We call on the UK Government to significantly increase the minimum and maximum sentences for child rapists. This would ensure sentences reflect the severity of their crimes, provide justice for victims, and act as a strong deterrent to prevent further harm.\"",
