        "additional_details": "We think the government must address this by enacting specific legislation making assaulting a security worker a standalone offence.\r\n \r\nSecurity are often first responders to incidents of crime and violence, yet, we feel they get little recognition or statutory protection, leaving them vulnerable. A dedicated offence could serve as a deterrent and an acknowledgment of their role in protecting public safety. We would want legal protections in line with those for emergency and retail staff.",
        "background": "Security workers play a vital role in maintaining public safety, but can face violence and abuse while performing their duties. Despite their critical role in protecting businesses, venues, and the public, security workers lack the legal protections afforded to emergency workers and shop workers.",
