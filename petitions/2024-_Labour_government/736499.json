        "additional_details": "If a promise is made that is clearly unfunded or unjustified and goes on to cause serious harm to the public or economy, ministers could also face legal action. The only way such consequences could be avoided is by seeking direct public approval through a referendum before making major changes to key commitments. This would help ensure that political responsibility carries real consequences and restore trust in public leadership.",
        "background": "To ensure greater accountability, a new legal measure should be introduced to hold government ministers responsible when they break key manifesto commitments without good reason. This could include financial penalties or even reclaiming benefits and entitlements gained during their time in office.",
