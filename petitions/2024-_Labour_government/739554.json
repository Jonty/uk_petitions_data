I believe that it will make most people happier in the winter, a time when depression is highest, gaining a feeling that the days are longer due to later sunsets and it will also allow more people to witness the sunrise, an equally beautiful moment.",
        "background": "In October every year the clocks are stopped for an hour and in April an hour is skipped. I think that it would be in the best interest of the people to stop this act and instead stick with the current timezone all year round; GMT+1.",
