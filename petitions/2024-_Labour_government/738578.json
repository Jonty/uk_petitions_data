        "additional_details": "Firstly, and most importantly, I would like to point out what a devastating effect this would have for gangs in the UK. With the main source of there income being the sale of Weed, gangs will immobilise, subsequently reducing gang related violence. Moreover, this will open up a possibly multi billion pound industry in the UK and create many jobs for the people. I would also like to point out the proven health benefits of smoking weed, and how it causes much less harm to humans than tobacco",
        "background": "I ask for the legalisation of weed in the UK and a debate that  looks at the positives that legalising weed would have to life in the UK, and how we have already seen these results in other states and countries who already have a legally sanctioned weed market.",
