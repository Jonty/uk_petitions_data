        "additional_details": "Currently, Commonwealth Citizens from 56 countries living in the UK have the right to vote if they are 18 or over and have legal permission to enter or stay in the UK. This includes students, workers, and those with indefinite leave to remain. We call on the government to remove this right unless their country of origin allows UK citizens to vote in a reciprocal manner. Only UK citizens or citizens from countries with reciprocal voting such as Ireland should be allowed to vote in UK general elections.",
