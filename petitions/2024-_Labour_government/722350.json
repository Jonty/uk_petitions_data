        "additional_details": "We think bow hunting is a humane way to hunt animals that is used in America and some of Europe to great success. We think that not everyone wants a firearm and many archers are keen to hunt and often travel abroad. We think legalising Bow Hunting would help control the large numbers of deer and as a method of pest control. We think this would be good for the ecosystem and far better than reintroducing wolves. The argument against Bow Hunting is that it is inhumane. We think modern bows are just as humane as a rifle, so lift the ban please.",
