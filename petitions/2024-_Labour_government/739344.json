        "action": "Scrap Marginal Energy Pricing To Lower Bills And Boost Clean Power Production.",
        "additional_details": "Marginal pricing makes clean electricity artificially expensive, driving up inflation and punishing households already under financial stress. Scrapping it would lower bills, accelerate the green transition, and make heat pumps and EVs more accessible. This reform is urgent, fair, and backed by energy experts.",
        "background": "We want the Government to end the marginal pricing system that pegs electricity costs to expensive fossil fuels. Replace it with a fairer model that reflects actual generation costs and supports cheaper, cleaner energy for households and businesses.",
