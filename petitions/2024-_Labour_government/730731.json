We call for a national compensation fund and a public inquiry into government and council handling of RAAC. We seek laws mandating high-risk building registers, defect reporting by surveyors/solicitors, and 60-year developer liability. We believe mortgage interest should be banned on condemned homes, and first-time buyer status restored for affected owners. We want justice now.",
