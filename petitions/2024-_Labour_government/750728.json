        "additional_details": "This is vital to ease the cost of living crisis and incentivise work.\r\nJustification for this\r\nCost of Living: The 20% tax rate above the Personal Allowance places an unsustainable burden on low earners, driving hardship despite full employment.\r\nTax rates must align with the soaring cost of essentials.\r\nIncentive to Work: Taxing overtime reduces the take-home benefit, discouraging workers from taking on extra shifts. Tax exemption on overtime will directly boost income and rewards hard work.",
        "background": "Reform Income Tax: Significantly reduce the 20% basic rate for low-to-middle income earners or substantially raise the Personal Allowance. Also, introduce a full exemption from Income Tax and NICs for all overtime pay. This is vital to ease the cost of living crisis and incentivise work.",
