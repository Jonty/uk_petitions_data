We believe they can lower hospital admissions, cut NHS costs and greatly enhance quality of life. Current access is inconsistent, creating a postcode lottery. We think universal NHS provision would help ensure fairness, could save lives, and give every person with Type 1 diabetes a better chance to live fully and independently.",
