It nurtures key life skills such as teamwork, resilience, problem-solving, and care for the environment. Making it a mandatory part of the curriculum could ensure all children regardless of background, have equal access to these vital benefits.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to prioritise more outdoor learning by making it a mandatory part of the national curriculum. We think more hours should be dedicated to learning in and about nature across all state schools in England to improve student wellbeing, engagement, and development.",
