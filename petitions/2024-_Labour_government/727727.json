        "additional_details": "Diver safety mustn't be dictated by postcode. \r\n\r\nThis decision leaves a vast area (from Aberdeen to Gt Yarmouth) without ANY emergency recompression provision.\r\n\r\nDecompression sickness (\"the bends\") is life-threatening. It requires immediate hyperbaric treatment. Without these facilities lives will be lost. Survivors may face permanent, life-altering injuries.\r\n\r\nWe urge Parliament to debate this decision & safety implications, to ensure equitable, nationwide emergency care for divers is maintained",
        "background": "We call on Parliament / the UK Government to urgently review NHS England\u2019s decision to remove contracts for three emergency recompression (hyperbaric) chambers located in the Wirral, Midlands & Hull as of 1 October 2025. This creates a critical gap in diver safety & emergency response capabilities.",
