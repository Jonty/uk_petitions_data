        "additional_details": "Silent fireworks provide great entertainment value while being far less traumatic for people and animals who are sensitive to loud noises . \r\n\r\nThe current law around when fireworks can be used is unenforceable, and should be superseded with law that only silent or quiet fireworks should be sold to the public. \r\n\r\nThis would enable people to use fireworks for celebrations while not causing fear to innocent people and animals. It would also  reduce the impact of irresponsible use of fireworks.",
        "background": "We call on the government to legislate against the sale of loud fireworks to the public and to limit the noise level in professional displays.",
