        "action": "Reinstate ADHD shared care plans to ensure access to essential medication.",
        "additional_details": "The ADHD community believes the decision to stop shared care plans violates their human rights, as it denies access to essential medication for a recognized disability. This change is discriminatory, harmful, and undermines individuals' ability to function. We urge the government to reinstate shared care plans, provide clear guidance for GPs, and ensure ongoing access to vital treatment. Removing this support not only impacts health but also disregards the rights and needs of those with ADHD, leaving them vulnerable and unsupported.",
        "background": "I want the government to reverse the decision to stop ADHD-shared care plans and prevent GPs from removing patients from them. Ensure shared care plans are reinstated with clear guidelines to protect access to essential medication for those with ADHD, safeguarding their health and rights.",
