We would like a review to look at the merits of individual assessments instead of blanket bans.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) includes \"rest and leisure\" and participation \u201din the cultural life of the community\" as human rights. We believe that fair play is crucial, but that current policies can unfairly target and exclude trans people, particularly trans women.",

Trans people face exclusion from sports at various levels. We believe this is a violation of human rights.",
