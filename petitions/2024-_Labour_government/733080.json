        "action": "Change the English national anthem from God Save the King, to Jerusalem.",
        "additional_details": "God Save the King is arguably one of the worst national anthems in the world. It is a depressing, tedious, tuneless dirge that utterly fails to inspire. National anthems should reach the *souls* of both direct participants and the watching crowd/fans. I would argue that William Blake's words, and Hubert Parry's music, combine in the most sublime way to produce something that becomes far more than merely the sum of its constituent parts.",
        "background": "I would like Parliament to press for a change so that all the governing bodies of the various sports, at international level, and participating under an English flag, should be allowed to use Jerusalem, and *not* God save the king, as the official English national anthem.",
