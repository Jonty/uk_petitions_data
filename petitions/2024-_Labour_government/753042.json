        "additional_details": "These professionals are being employed more and more, many working beyond their scope, eg. in GP, seeing undifferentiated patients (against the Leng recommendations). Patients have died due to PAs working above their competencies. Trusts are still advertising for PAs/AAs when the role should be taken by a doctor, many of whom face unemployment. Patients are confused by these various 'consultants' who are not medically qualified. They think they're seeing a doctor. Doctors are being replaced!",
        "background": "Govt. accepted the recommendations of the Leng Review into physician/anaesthesia associates (assistants). These recommendations should now be implemented in the light of concerns raised around patient safety, role clarity and the expanding presence of these professionals in healthcare settings.",
