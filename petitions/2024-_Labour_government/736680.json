        "additional_details": "If trade unions fail members\u2014by withdrawing legal support, ignoring grievances, or acting negligently\u2014 there are insufficient routes for redress. The Certification Officer only covers rule breaches, not service quality. We feel legal action is expensive and out of reach for most. We think an independent ombudsman should be created to hold unions accountable, investigate serious failures, and give members a fair, affordable way to challenge mistreatment and service failures. We think union members deserve protection too.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to set up an independent ombudsman to handle complaints from trade union members who have received poor service, legal advice, or representation. There is currently no way that we feel is fair or independent for members to seek redress.",
