        "additional_details": "Recent home\u2011grown terrorism and lone\u2011attacker incidents show civilians face unpredictable threats in everyday settings. Under current UK law ordinary citizens are effectively limited to using a personal alarm as their only self\u2011defence option-a measure that offers no protection against brutal tactics used by attackers. We believe the Government must provide a realistic, regulated alternative by enabling trained, licensed individuals to carry approved non\u2011lethal tools under strict safeguards.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to review laws on offensive weapons and introduce a safe, licensed system allowing citizens to carry approved non-lethal self-defence tools. This should include proper training, secure storage, registration, and independent evaluation.",
