It is contradictory to the long held views of the people of Northern Ireland who by large are highly conscious of animal welfare. \r\n\r\nPeople gaining joy out of the prolonged suffering of a defenders animal is not acceptable and it's time this barbaric practice was put to an end once and for all.",
