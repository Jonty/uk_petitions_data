        "additional_details": "Many students' parents may not have time to make a packed lunch and also cannot afford to spend too much money on not very high quality food. I believe portion sizes are slowly decreasing, but prices are staying the same, if not increasing. I feel that the government should at least look into putting a price cap in place on different items of food and getting rid of these absurd prices. Don\u2019t believe what I\u2019m saying or think I\u2019m over-exaggerating? Go to a school and see for yourself.",
        "background": "I would like the government to set a price cap on food in secondary school canteens. I find it unacceptable that a panini that is clearly not made out of very expensive or healthy ingredients can cost \u00a35. I think the price to portion size ratio is extortionate and people cannot afford this.",
