        "additional_details": "The knife attack on the train from Doncaster to London Kings Cross that stopped at Huntingdon showed how defenceless people are against armed attackers. We are not asking for weapons to be freely available, but for strictly regulated, non-lethal sprays (such as low-strength OC) to be permitted for lawful self-defence under registration, training, and strict control, giving citizens a safe, non-violent option to stop attacks before police intervene.",
        "background": "After the Huntingdon train knife attack where several passengers were injured, we call on the Government to review the total ban on defensive sprays and allow strictly regulated, non-lethal options for self-defence under licensing and training rules.",
