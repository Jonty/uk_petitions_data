        "additional_details": "We believe this prevents providers from recruiting staff, potentially creating shortages and undermining continuity of care for vulnerable children.\r\n\r\nOfsted-regulated children\u2019s residential care homes support children with complex needs. Stability in staffing is crucial to their welfare. We think the April 2024 changes have left providers unable to fill critical roles, despite proving the necessity of these positions through inspections. We think this policy adds barriers for already stretched organisations. We think amending restrictions will help care homes recruit the skilled staff needed to protect vulnerable children.",
