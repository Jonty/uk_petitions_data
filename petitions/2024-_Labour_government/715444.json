        "additional_details": "We think that domestic violence survivors should not have to attend courts near their home or work, as this could risk encounters with their abuser. \r\n\r\nMany survivors of domestic violence already face immense emotional and physical trauma. The current system assigns court locations based on where the case started, often near the survivor\u2019s home or workplace, risking encounters with the abuser. We feel this could increase fear and stress and discourage victims from seeking justice. \r\n \r\nWe think courts should ensure a supportive environment for victims to pursue justice without further trauma or intimidation.",
        "background": "We call for a review to consider how court locations could best be chosen to prioritise the survivor's safety, and potentially reduce emotional stress and prevent further harm.\r\n ",
