We can't all share a working environment, but we can share our mode of travel to work. The disconnect between the world-view of constituents and that of politicians, would be vastly reduced if politicians experienced the reality of the towns and cities their constituents live in as their constituents experience it, and see the people and events they encounter, during their daily commute.",
        "background": "Ensure that every MP and Mayor travels to work using only public transport in their own constituency, and including the London underground when attending Westminster. They must carry no illegal defensive equipment, and must not be accompanied by any security detail.",
