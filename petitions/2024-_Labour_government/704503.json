This is increasing division in society and also allowing false and harmful narratives to flourish at a time when unity, collaboration, and tolerance is required. Notable examples exist of MPs disregarding their constituents in favour of international travel to serve their own ends. Over all we are being done an inter-generational disservice which will continue to cause issues.",
