        "additional_details": "Everyone would think, care workers can switch sponsor with different employers. It's not that easy, it would cost us hefty financial burden.\r\n\r\nAdvise from us: Government should give us visa accordingly, should let us work under any domiciliary care / care home  without putting extra mental burden of switching visa under different employers. We can give interviews under different health care employers and if they feel that we are valuable for them, then they can hire us.",
        "background": "Its a request from international care workers,  we came to uk for work, not for benifits. You can keep ILR for 15 years but give us fair environment for work.\r\n\r\nSponsored employers exploit us, they threaten us to revoke sponsor unless you work for them in their harsh environment.",
