        "additional_details": "This shows a disregard for other passengers and is a deeply antisocial behaviour. Passengers who have politely requested individuals stop the behaviour often receive abuse. This is considered inappropriate behaviour to the majority of the British population. This simple yet effective action will go a long way to highlighting and penalising inconsiderate behaviour that makes using public transport increasingly unpleasant.",
        "background": "Introduce immediately enforceable civil fines for people who play music from speakers or phones, and make calls on speaker anywhere on public transport networks. Police, community support officers and train revenue officers should be encouraged onto trains and issue the fines to offenders.",
