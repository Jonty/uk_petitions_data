        "additional_details": "As a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, the UK has a duty to uphold principles like the right to education and the prohibition of discrimination. A judicial review is a vital legal tool for assessing whether the VAT legislation aligns with these standards. Accepting its findings would show the government\u2019s commitment to human rights, respect for the judiciary, and willingness to reconsider policies where necessary.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to commit to fully accepting any declaration of incompatibility made by the courts in the forthcoming judicial review of the legislation to impose VAT on private school fees, and to re-examine this policy to ensure it aligns with human rights obligations and principles.",
