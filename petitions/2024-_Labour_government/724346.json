        "action": "Reverse the imposition of VAT on repairs to religious buildings",
        "additional_details": "Historic religious buildings like churches and cathedrals are extremely expensive to maintain. The replacement of a Church roof alone can run to hundreds of thousands of pounds. This change in the law will make many repairs to religious buildings unaffordable and put them at risk of demolition or closure. Historic religious buildings are part of the fabric of our society and the decision to charge VAT on repairs to religious buildings is unacceptable.",
        "background": "From 1 April 2025, a cap of \u00a325,000 on the exemption of VAT from repairs to religious buildings was imposed, giving just three months\u2019 notice of the change. I want this decision reversing.",
