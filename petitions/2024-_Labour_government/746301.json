I think, as, not only a Cis Woman, but as a citizen of the United Kingdom, that we should really tackle this problem. It is a natural part of a woman's body, and therefore sanitary products should be free",

It isn't fair for us to have to pay for them, and what we need to think about is how this would affect those who can not afford to pay for these things.",
