        "additional_details": "NHS dental services in the UK face an urgent\u00a0 crisis.\r\n\r\nEighteen-week waits for procedures like extractions and infection treatment are dangerous and inhumane, leading to serious complications like sepsis, which will increase pressure on NHS hospital care services. Increased funding and contract improvements are needed to retain skilled dentists and improve care. Many UK residents cannot afford private dental care due to rising costs. The UK requires dental care to be affordable and accessible.",
