We think the threat to a cashless society consists of total societal collapse arising from the collapse of digital payment networks or the underlying electrical power networks they depend on. We believe that both systems could be vulnerable to cyber attacks by aggressors and solar storms of Carrington event magnitude.",

This could include a legal framework that includes penalties for outlets that refuse cash payment and mandates the maintenance of local cash handling infrastructure by the banking sector.",
