        "action": "Adjust 2028 tax thresholds for cumulative inflation since their 2022 freeze.",
        "additional_details": "Unfreezing tax bands at their frozen values fails to address the real income lost during the freeze period. Without retrospective inflation adjustment, taxpayers remain worse off despite the \"unfreeze,\" as they're still paying tax on income that merely kept pace with inflation since 2022. True reversal of fiscal drag requires restoring thresholds to where they would be had indexation never stopped.",
        "background": "When tax thresholds are unfrozen in April 2028, adjust them to account for all inflation accumulated since 2022. Simply unfreezing them at current levels ignores years of inflationary erosion, leaving fiscal drag intact.",
