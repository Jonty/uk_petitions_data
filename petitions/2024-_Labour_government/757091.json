        "additional_details": "Many people vote for people they believe will represent them best and for candidates which represent the values of a particular political party. We believe it is not fair or democratic for voters who vote for an elected official who switches party, or becomes independent, and does not have to stand again in an immediate election. It stands to reason that some will not support the values of the new party, but to be balanced, some will, but this is assumptive and we believe it should be ratified via an official election.",
        "background": "The Government should legislate to require a by-election to be held if an MP or Local Councillor switches political party in the middle of the parliamentary term so affected constituents get the opportunity to vote in an election to decide who represents them.",
