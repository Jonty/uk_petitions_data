        "additional_details": "It's too easy for politicians to make unachievable pledges when campaigning, safe in the knowledge that they won't be forced to implement them if elected. This undermines politicians' credibility and the public's trust in their promises, which is a significant contributory factor in the low turn out rates for elections. If election pledges were made legally binding, this would ensure that they were properly planned and costed and help to restore the public's trust in political\u00a0promises.",
        "background": "When campaigning in the run-up to general or local elections, politicians and political parties will make pledges in order to attract votes, only to drop many of them once elected without any repercussions, so legislation must be introduced to make these legally binding.",
