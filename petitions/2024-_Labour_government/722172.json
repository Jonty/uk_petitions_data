        "background": "Pay all pensioners at  the rate of the new state pension.  End the widening payment  gap based on age.  Age discrimination is illegal and immoral.  \r\nMPs need to challenge this unfair and discriminatory policy in Parliament.  Older pensioners have the same bills to pay as younger pensioners",
