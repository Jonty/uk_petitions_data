The companion bus passes are issued by the Local Authority to support this need, yet some operators refuse to accept them. We feel this creates confusion, restricts mobility, and discriminates against disabled passengers. A national enforcement would ensure consistency, dignity, and equal access to public transport for all.",

These are official concessions, and we think refusing them undermines accessibility and discriminates against disabled passengers.",
