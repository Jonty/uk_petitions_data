        "additional_details": "As the transition to zero-emission vehicles accelerates, more people are embracing EVs. However, we think a significant challenge remains: most reliable EVs with a sufficient range come with a price tag exceeding \u00a340,000.\r\n \r\nWe believe taxing EVs is already counterproductive, as it could undermine the incentive to switch to cleaner transportation. Adding a luxury vehicle tax on top of this could raise further doubts among consumers about whether going electric is truly the best path forward.",
        "background": "Abolish the luxury vehicle tax for electric vehicles (EVs) and apply only the standard tax rate. We believe this would help ensure a fairer and more consistent approach to sustainable transportation.",
