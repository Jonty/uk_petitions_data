        "additional_details": "Amid growing controversy over the Labour government\u2019s deviation from, and failure to adhere to, the manifesto on which it was elected, a serious constitutional issue arises. Party manifestos underpin informed voter consent and should therefore carry legal force. Failure to honour these commitments breaches public trust and undermines democratic legitimacy, warranting enforceable legal sanctions, with deliberate or persistent non-compliance treated as a fraudulent criminal offence",
        "background": "I want the government to debate this because democracy relies on informed consent. When manifesto promises are broken without consequence, voters are misled & trust erodes. Legal accountability would deter deception, restore confidence in elections, and ensure governments govern on the mandate given",
