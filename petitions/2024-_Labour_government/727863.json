        "additional_details": "We call on the UK Government to honour its original promise of a pathway to settlement for British Nationals (Overseas) who arrived under the BNO visa scheme due to recent announced Immigration White Paper risk undermining this trust.\r\n\r\nAny changes that impact this pathway could contradict the spirit of the UK\u2019s commitment made in 2020 in response to political developments in Hong Kong. The integrity of this promise is vital to maintain the UK\u2019s global standing and moral obligation.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to:\r\n1.\tReaffirm the original 5-year pathway to Indefinite Leave to Remain without imposing retrospective conditions.\r\n2.\tEnsure transparency and consistency in immigration policies affecting BNO visa holders.\r\n3.\tMaintain UK\u2019s historic and moral commitment to BN(O) citizens.",
