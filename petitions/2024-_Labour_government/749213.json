        "action": "Grandparent alienation harms children:courts must protect these relationships.",
        "additional_details": "Grandparent alienation inflicts lasting emotional harm on children, severing relationships vital for their well-being. It is crucial to formally consult children in court cases to ensure their voices are heard. Lengthy court delays worsen distress, especially when children lose all contact with grandparents. Swift resolution of disputes helps maintain these intergenerational bonds and minimises emotional disruption during family breakdowns. Grandparents are family to most children",
        "background": "I respectfully urge the court to recognise that the current framework fails to address the emotional and psychological harm children experience when close bonds with grandparents are abruptly severed, a situation compounded when children are misinformed about the cause.",
