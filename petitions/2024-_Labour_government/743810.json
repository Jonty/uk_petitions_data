        "additional_details": "This could help free up DVSA driving test slots, giving examiners more availability to focus on other driving tests and reduce backlog.\r\n \r\nA2 licence riders will have 2 years of experience which we feel is generally plentiful before being allowed to ride more powerful bikes.\r\n \r\nIt could help make motorcycling cheaper and may encourage drivers to switch to two wheels rather than four.",
        "background": "We should allow automatic A2 to full A licence upgrades for retaining an A2 licence for 2 years. \r\n \r\nThe test for A2 and A are the same, and while the type of motorcycle is different, we feel the test doesn't address the extra power allowed on a 35 kW+ motorcycle.",
