        "additional_details": "Holiday prices skyrocket during school breaks, forcing many families to choose between debt or missing out. Current rules unfairly punish loving parents. A small allowance would ease pressure, support mental health, and improve family wellbeing. Happier, recharged parents raise better-supported kids. This policy would make holidays more affordable, reduce price spikes, and\u2014done sensibly\u2014won\u2019t harm education or attendance.",
        "background": "Allow each student up to five authorised absence days per year for family holidays. Schools would retain discretion, but families would no longer face automatic fines for short, sensible time off outside exam periods, provided overall attendance is good.",
