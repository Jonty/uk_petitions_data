        "additional_details": "We respectfully request  to consider the retrospective impact of the proposed change to settlement rules in the 12 May 2025 White Paper, specifically, the extension of the  (ILR) qualifying period from 5 to 10 years for skilled visa holders already in the UK under the 5-year ILR rule.\r\nWhile the white paper doesn't state this but there has been no clarity regarding this in the recent meetings and created significant uncertainty in our lives.",
        "background": "Skilled visa holders already on the 5-year ILR path in the UK deserve fairness and certainty, not a sudden shift to a 10-year ILR route. \r\nWe who are already living in the UK as skilled migrants should be treated with transparency and fairness and the new rules should not be applied retrospectively.",
