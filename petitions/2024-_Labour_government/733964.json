        "additional_details": "State Pension benefits can only be inherited by a spouse/civil partner. Unmarried partners, adult children, or other dependents are excluded, even if financially dependent. Many may support adult children with disabilities, or are cared for by someone other than a spouse or civil partner.\r\n \r\nWe believe in having a system that recognises real-world relationships and dependency; allowing people to nominate a beneficiary, or offer a lump sum to dependents, could help protect vulnerable loved ones from financial hardship after bereavement.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to change State Pension inheritance rules so that individuals can nominate a beneficiary such as their child, long-term cohabiting partner, or carer \u2013 or offer them a lump sum \u2013 so it is not just a spouse or civil partner inheriting from the pension as at present.",
