        "additional_details": "We urge the UK government to review the proposed change to extend the ILR period for Skilled Worker migrants from 5 to 10 years. This change should not apply to those already living and working in the UK under existing rules. Migrants made life decisions based on the 5-year ILR pathway. Changing it now is unfair, creates uncertainty, and damages trust in the immigration system. The government must honour its original commitments and protect the rights of legal migrants.",
        "background": "We urge the government not to apply the 10-year ILR rule to current Skilled Worker visa holders. Many came here under the 5-year pathway and have built lives based on that promise. Changing rules mid-way is unfair and causes stress. Protect existing migrants\u2019 rights and stability.",
