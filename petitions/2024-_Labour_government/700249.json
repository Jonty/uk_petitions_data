        "additional_details": "The weekly rate for round the clock professional care is \u00a31596. There is a massive difference between carer\u2019s allowance and the amounts charged by private companies. Thus, making more disgusting, the issue of carers not being paid near enough to live on. Carers carry out the same, if not more work, than paid carers, looking after individuals, but the meagre benefit they are deemed fit for, demonstrates the disdain and lack of appreciation that they receive.",
        "background": "We demand the new government credit all full-time Carers, with at least \u00a3800 per week. Carers should be valued within society and their worth should reflect this in the help and benefits they receive. Carers can receive \u00a381.90 a week, however they must provide care for at least 35 hours a week.",
