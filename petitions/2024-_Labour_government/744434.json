        "additional_details": "Public trust in politics depends on honesty. Too often, debate is shaped by misleading claims that divide communities and distract from real issues like the cost of living, healthcare, housing, and education. Without accountability, false information damages democracy. A new law is needed to ensure politicians are truthful and to restore confidence in our political system.",
