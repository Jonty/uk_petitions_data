        "additional_details": "Many international graduates contribute to the UK economy during their PSW visa period but are not recognized in the ILR timeline. Excluding PSW time forces skilled individuals to start over, delaying settlement and discouraging long-term plans. Including it would promote fairness and help retain global talent.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to count time spent on the Graduate (PSW) visa toward the 5-year ILR route. This will recognize the contribution of international graduates, support talent retention, and make the UK a more attractive place to study, work, and build a future.",
