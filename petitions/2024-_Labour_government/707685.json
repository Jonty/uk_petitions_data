We feel this leaves those families with two choices, go in school holidays and spend most of the time stressed, or ask for flexibility. We believe this would give these families the same chance to a break as families without SEN.",

Many children with disabilities or SEN can find it hard to deal with crowds, noise and the general hustle and bustle of travelling in peak times. Yet, these families are penalised for removing children from school for holidays.",
