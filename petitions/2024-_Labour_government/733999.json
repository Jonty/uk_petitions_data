        "additional_details": "Online platforms have become very popular with more and more individuals using them, but they have become places where negativity and hate is allowed. People can hide behind a keyboard, writing words that would never be said aloud to people\u2019s faces. We need to think about the impact this is having on people\u2019s wellbeing and mental health. Think, without nastiness or online hate, online platforms could be a much better/happier place, with more positivity spread to raise wellbeing.",
        "background": "There is a lot of negativity and nastiness on online platforms which makes using them unsafe for the current and future generation. The government needs to enable some sort of AI based detector that immediately disallows  individuals from posting any negative or nasty comments.",
