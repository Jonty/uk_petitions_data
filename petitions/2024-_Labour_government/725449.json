        "action": "Enforce protection for trans women under the equality act as women.",
        "additional_details": "For example if a trans woman is denied a promotion for being seen as a woman then she needs to be protected as a woman not a trans person. If the government show they will protect her as a woman then she can fight this and it may be a deterrent to those who might harm or discriminate against any woman. Being trans and a woman needs two forms of protection, one for each.",
        "background": "The supreme court decision has made it so that trans women cannot face discrimination as women. This denies them being women despite that they regularly face the same misogyny as cis women. \r\nEnsure trans people are protected by the equality act under their actual gender not sex by recognising this.",
