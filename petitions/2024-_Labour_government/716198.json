It would encourage people to commute by bike as opposed to cars which would be more climate-friendly, It would generate a boost in GDP as an increase in government investment, and it would promote exercise among the general population which would decrease pressure on the NHS as people live healthier lives.",
        "background": "We believe that the government should invest in intercity cycle paths to promote cycling as a form of transport while keeping busy roads separate for car use.",
