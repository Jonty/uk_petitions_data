        "additional_details": "We are concerned that some social landlords and council-owned LLPs increasingly rent private market homes without the regulation, oversight, or redress required in social housing. We think tenants may be misled by branding, and issued inconsistent tenancy agreements, leaving thousands unprotected, paying high rents with no fair complaints process or guaranteed standards if the landlord is not registered with the Housing Ombudsman.",
