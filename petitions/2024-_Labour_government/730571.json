        "additional_details": "It's previously been reported that the average age of councillors in England is 60, 20 years older than the latest estimated median age of England and Wales' population. Government is overseeing a move to single-tier unitary authorities which is likely to mean fewer locally elected representatives. We think a review should look at reinstating the pre-2014 pensions scheme for local government and introducing parental leave as a statutory right, as well as consideration of an independent system to set allowances, loss of office payments and any other measures that may make it easier for people of all ages and backgrounds to stand.",
        "background": "We ask the government to formally review the system of support and payment for councillors. We think this will help ensure this most vital of roles attracts and retains high quality candidates who are representative of the communities they serve.",
