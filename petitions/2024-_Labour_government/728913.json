        "additional_details": "Going on holiday as a family isn\u2019t a right, but it is a great privilege\u2014one many hard working families miss out on due to unfair price hikes during school term time.\r\n\r\nThe government now punishes parents harshly for children missing a few school days for a holiday. Parents must either accept these hikes or forgo holidays entirely.\r\n\r\nFamily holidays are vital for making lasting memories, building stronger bonds, and offering learning beyond the classroom.",
        "background": "Airlines and resorts inflate their prices to double, or even triple the average price during the school holidays. \r\n\r\nI would like the UK government to put a cap on how much these prices can inflate during school holidays.",
