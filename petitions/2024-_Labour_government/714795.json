        "additional_details": "We believe extending the Plug-in Van and Truck Grant beyond March 2025 is crucial to achieving the UK's net-zero goals and supporting the adoption of EVs. Many businesses face high upfront costs for electric vans and trucks. Continued support could help reduce emissions and foster investment in sustainable fleets. We believe ending the grant prematurely risks slowing progress, leaving businesses unable to afford cleaner options and delaying the environmental benefits of electrification.",
        "background": "Extend the grant beyond 31 March 2025 to support businesses transitioning to electric vehicles, reduce emissions, and ensure affordability as the market matures. We believe an extension could provide stability for fleet operators and manufacturers planning sustainable investments.",
