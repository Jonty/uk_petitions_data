        "additional_details": "It is unfair for fans in other parts of the uk to have an embargo on football on 3pm on Saturdays. This leads to pirating. Furthermore, people from Edinburgh or any other city are not always going to travel to Southampton or somewhere far to watch a game. It costs the consumer more all in all.",
        "background": "They should raise the blackout and allow football to played on tv at 3pm. The blackout doesn\u2019t have a massive effect on increasing attendance in physical games. At least raise for premier league fixtures since everyone would want to attend the games in person anyway.",
