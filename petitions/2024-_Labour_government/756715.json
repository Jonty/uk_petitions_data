        "additional_details": "Water is essential. In the UK, supply failures, sewage discharges & failing infrastructure show systemic failure in regulation & operation of water co\u2019s. Not due to bad weather or changes in demand, but yrs of under-investment & weak oversight allowing monopoly providers to prioritise dividends over customers & the env\u2019t. Customers cannot switch supplier & lack protection when services fail. Gov\u2019t must act to protect consumers, restore rivers and coasts, & ensure reliable, sustainable services.",
