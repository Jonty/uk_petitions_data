Many people are publishing water bills and showing increases of over 300%. At the same time shareholders are receiving some of the largest payouts in history. Despite the price rises little has been invested in Infrastructure, with sewage being regularly poured into rivers to the point that 100% of rivers have been tested and shown to have harmful chemicals within them as a result.",
