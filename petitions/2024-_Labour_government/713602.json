We believe they exploit regulatory loopholes, poaching fares without necessarily meeting local rules. We think this undermines public safety, drivers\u2019 livelihoods, and trust in the system. We urge the government to develop stricter regulations and close these loopholes to protect hardworking local drivers and ensure a fair, safe, and reliable transport system for all.",

We believe they disrupt the transport system, causing unfair competition and confusion. As a driver, I\u2019ve seen the frustration and income losses caused by this practice. ",
