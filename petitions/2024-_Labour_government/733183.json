        "additional_details": "Uncontrolled breeding leads to:\r\n\u2022\tAn overwhelming number of unwanted kittens.\r\n\u2022\tIncreased burden on animal shelters and rescue organisations.\r\n\u2022\tHigher rates of euthanasia for healthy animals\r\n\u2022\tSpread of diseases among stray and feral cat populations.\r\n\u2022\tNegative impacts on native wildlife through predation and competition.\r\nThe introduction of mandatory neutering is a proven, humane, and effective way to address these issues.\r\nLet us follow other forward thinking countries who have implemented this",
        "background": "We urge the government to consider the introduction of legislation that would make the neutering of cats mandatory, mirroring policies already successfully implemented in several other EU countries. \r\nRescues across the UK are now unable to cope with the sheer volume of unwanted cats that need help.",
