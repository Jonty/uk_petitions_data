        "action": "Protect the 10-Year Long Residence Route for Legal Residents",
        "additional_details": "We request the Home Office and Parliament to protect the 10\u2011year long residence route to settlement. This pathway has allowed legal residents to secure stability after a decade of lawful living, working, and contributing in the UK. Families who followed the rules in good faith would face repeated financial strain. Children raised here deserve stability, not insecurity. Communities benefit from long\u2011term residents who are fully integrated and invested in the UK\u2019s future.",
        "background": "The 10-year long residence route is not merely a policy mechanism; it is a lifeline for individuals and families who have demonstrated commitment to the UK. Abolishing it would be unjust, destabilizing, and contrary to the values of fairness and stability that underpin our society.",
