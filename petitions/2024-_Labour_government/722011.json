        "action": "Allow cash payments for parking and other services.",
        "additional_details": "I urge the Government to take immediate action and direct all local councils to reverse their current policies that prohibit cash payments for parking and other services.The shift to cashless payments excludes many people, including the elderly, those without bank accounts, and those who are not comfortable or familiar with digital payment technologies. Reinstating the ability to pay with cash will preserve personal freedom and also ensure that all citizens have equal access to public services.",
        "background": "Councils should reverse the move towards a cashless system for parking payments. While I understand the desire for convenience and technological advancement, I believe making parking payments exclusively digital undermines an essential right for people to choose how they pay for goods and services.",
