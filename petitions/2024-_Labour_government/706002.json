        "additional_details": "Why This Matters:\r\nThe 2035 ban risks undermining consumer choice, affordability, and the automotive industry's sustainability. Electric vehicles, while promising, remain costly and reliant on mining practices with environmental and ethical concerns. A balanced strategy\u2014supporting innovation while maintaining ICE options\u2014ensures fairness and reduces unintended consequences like job losses and limited rural mobility. Let\u2019s focus on a practical transition rather than a blanket prohibition.",
        "background": "to reconsider and repeal the policy banning the sale of new internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in the UK by 2035.
