        "additional_details": "Bursaries aren't enough anymore. StNs need to be paid for their time with an apprenticeship wage. We work with our nation's sick for the same hours as a qualified. We deal with the grief, exhaustion and stress daily. We feel neglected. Many StNs burnout before reaching the finish line because it is not a sustainable to work 37hrs min per week, unpaid - especially for mature students who may have dependants, or exchange students who do not recieve additional help. We need to be paid for our time.",
        "background": "In the UK, StN on placements are often used as stand in, unpaid labour. As a student nurse, I have been used as a HCSW, Runner and receptionist. Many other student and qualified nurses have shared similar experiences from their training. It's time to pay our student nurses for their work!",
