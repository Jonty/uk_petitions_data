        "additional_details": "The law requires all children to remain in education until the age of 18, yet families are expected to pay for meals while children are in compulsory education. This is unfair.\r\nMaking school meals free would:\r\n\r\nEnsure every child has at least one nutritious hot meal per day.\r\n\r\nEase the cost-of-living burden.\r\n\r\nImprove concentration, behaviour, and learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nPromote equality, as no child is disadvantaged.\r\nIf education is compulsory, access to food during that time should be guaranteed.",
        "background": "The Government should provide free school meals for all children and young people under the age of 18 in education.",
