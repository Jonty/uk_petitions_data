        "additional_details": "As an animal lover and pet owner, I have personally witnessed the alarming effects of high-decibel fireworks on pets. It's not just a fear reaction but a traumatic experience for our furry friends, leading to escalated heart rates, loss of control, and even long-term effects on their overall behavior.\r\n\r\nWe propose that the local government impose strict regulations, reducing the noise levels of fireworks and limiting their use especially near residential areas. We request them to consider the health and wellbeing of all residents, including our pets, while sanctioning permissions for fireworks. Speak up for your pets and those who can't raise their voice.",
