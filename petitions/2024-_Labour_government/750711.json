        "additional_details": "I use Small Heath Highway every day and since the 40mph limit was reduced to 30mph, the road has become far more dangerous. Congestion has increased, cars are bunching together, and drivers are reacting unpredictably with mixed speeds. In bad weather this is even worse. I believe the change has made accidents more likely, not less. I want the BIRMINGHAM CITY COUNCIL to review this decision and restore 40mph where it is safer for everyone.",
        "background": "We want the Birmingham city council to review and reverse the 30mph changes on major Birmingham roads. The reduced limit has caused congestion, unpredictable driving, and increased risk of accidents. We ask for a reassessment and restoration of 40mph where it is proven safer and more effective.",
