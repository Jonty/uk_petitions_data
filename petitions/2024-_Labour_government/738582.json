Currently, people benefit from NHS services without ever being confronted with the financial cost. While the principle of a free-at-the-point-of-use service must be preserved, allowing people the opportunity to contribute in a moment when gratitude is fresh in their minds, could help change perceptions. People are more likely to appreciate what they support.",

This would offer the public the option to tap and donate \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a315, or \u00a320 as a gesture of appreciation/support for the service they have received.",
