She was the most amazing person; I am doing this for her.\r\n\r\nCancer is one of the worst things that someone can go through. And cervical cancer is still dangerous and a massive threat. I think 5 years is far too long to wait, if you imagine how much could change in that period, and that routine testing every 2 years would help enable safe monitoring and save lives.",
