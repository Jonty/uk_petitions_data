We need a change in law that removes the automatic pay rises, and MPs wage rises should be in line with expectations on public sector. If there is a cap or freeze there, so should there be with MP wages. If Public loose entitlement to allowances/support, they too should loose their allowances, they earn a lot more than most.",
