        "additional_details": "PoTS is a common, long term, debilitating health condition which mostly affects young people. 90% will improve with access to treatment, but due to the lack of recognition of symptoms and access to healthcare, the average time from onset to diagnosis is 7 years. Many patients throughout the UK currently have very restricted or no access to specialist NHS healthcare as many regions have no specialist services, and there are no clinical care pathways in the UK, and no UK medical guidelines.",
