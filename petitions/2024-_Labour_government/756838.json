        "additional_details": "Many consumers object to non-stunned slaughter on animal-welfare grounds. Animals remain conscious when their throat is cut and only lose consciousness through blood loss, which veterinary bodies say causes avoidable pain and distress. This petition does not seek to ban religious slaughter, but to secure transparency, consumer rights and respect for differing beliefs. Clear labelling would give people genuine choice, just as food is labelled for allergens, methods of production and origin.",
        "background": "People have the right to know whether the meat they buy comes from Halal or Kosher production involving non-stunned slaughter, so they can make informed ethical choices.\r\nWe call on the Government to require clear labelling on all meat and meat products produced using non-stunned slaughter methods.",
