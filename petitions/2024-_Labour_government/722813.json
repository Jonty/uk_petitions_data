        "additional_details": "We believe this law could help safeguard children by taking a strong stand against potential child abuse in the entertainment industry and supporting child performers' rights to a safe and secure working environment. We believe this offers a solution to a complex problem, as parental involvement could reduce the risk of child abuse in this industry. We believe this law could help promising young talents to fulfil their careers and dreams in a safe way.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to create a law that would require the entertainment industry to allow a parental chaperone to chaperone their minor during all work-related activities, rather than another chaperone being appointed.",
