        "additional_details": "The government must financially support universities, not increase fees.\r\n\r\nThis government wants young people to be more educated and simulateously makes students pay extortionate amounts on higher education. This is particularly damaging in a time of economic uncertainty, a cost of living crisis and increasing graduate unemployment rate. We think there has been years of financial mismangement and the neglect of higher education by countless governments. The government must reconsider and commit to freezing fees and instead fund universities with government grants.",
        "background": "The government must immediately reverse their decision to increase university tuition fees and maintainence loans in line with inflation. We believe that University should remain an opportunity for everyone, not just those who can afford it. ",
