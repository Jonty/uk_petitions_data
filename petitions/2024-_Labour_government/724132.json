Not everyone knows to ask about food being spicy, especially when it\u2019s something not known to be spicy. I have been out for a meal a few times now and have been served an unexpectedly spicy food. The effect it has on people with gastrointestinal problems can lead to hospital visits due to the extreme flare up. There should be a warning label to avoid these circumstances.",
