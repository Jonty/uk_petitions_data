        "additional_details": "We request this because the retrospective application of the November 2025 Earned Settlement proposals is inherently unjust. Individuals already residing in the UK or progressing towards settlement have organized their lives based on existing regulations. Retroactive changes breach trust, violate legitimate expectations, inflict hardship, and conflict with ECHR and family law, undermining fairness and legal certainty.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to apply new immigration rules only to future arrivals. Applying them retrospectively breaches trust, violates legitimate expectations, is cruel to those already on their route to settlement, and conflicts with ECHR and family law protections.",
