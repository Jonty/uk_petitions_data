        "additional_details": "Isle of Man workers face an attack on incomes at a time of exponential increases in cost of living, housing costs and childcare expenses. The Healthcare Levy will dipropionate affect low to middle earners while capping the contribution those earning \u00a3250,000+ per year. The effective rate of the levy will be miniscule to high earners. The island has an unfair 0% corporate tax and a cap on income tax for high earners. IOM residents will proportionately pay higher deductions than UK counterparts do",
        "background": "Intervene in the budgetary processes of the Isle of Man due to wider spread failure to represent the working and employed segment of populous in a fair and considered way during budgetary matters while consistently failing to deliver value for money on capital projects and fanciful objectives",
