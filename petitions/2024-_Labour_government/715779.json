        "additional_details": "Every penny counts! This government are coming after people claiming benefits but \"expenses\" are the same thing. My commute to work is further than my local MPs commute from her home to London and yet she has a second taxpayer funded home in London which is not acceptable. No firm pays for the commuting to and from work. If it about MPs needing to vote frequently, make online voting available. It is better for the environment and the financial situation for the UK.",
        "background": "There are no poor MPs so why should the taxpayer fund their second homes? They get paid over 90k a year and are able to claim for all expenses related to a second property but we shouldn't be paying for that. Especially given the financial status of the country being so poor.",
