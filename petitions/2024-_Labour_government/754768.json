Or even preventing pets returning from holiday.\r\n\r\nWe think the act is unfair in the extreme to adopting pet owners who have done nothing more than rescue a badly treated animal to provide a caring & loving home. An amendment is required to exempt pets that have been rescued following mutilation.",
