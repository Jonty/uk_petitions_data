        "additional_details": "I want the government to introduce a dog licensing system because breed bans don\u2019t really address the real issue\u2014irresponsible ownership. Licensing would ensure owners are accountable, and microchipping would help track dogs and reduce abandonment. It would also fund shelters and animal control, creating safer communities for both dogs and people. Focusing on behavior rather than breed is a much fairer and more effective way to improve safety and welfare for everyone.",
        "background": "The government should scrap breed bans and require dog licensing to ensure responsible ownership. Owners must microchip their dogs and be accountable for their behavior. Fees should fund shelters and enforcement. Risk-based assessments, not breed stereotypes, will improve public safety.",
