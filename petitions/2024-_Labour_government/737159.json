        "action": "Mandate Multiplatform Availability for Software, Media and other Digital Assets.",
        "additional_details": "We need this legislation because platform exclusivity fragments digital markets, forcing consumers to repurchase content or buy specific hardware, eroding true ownership and inflating costs for the user in an era where multiplatform is the standard. It stifles competition, locks users into small ecosystems like Disney's or Nintendo's, and accelerates e-waste. By mandating multiplatform access, we ensure consumer freedom, fair competition, and accessibility.",
        "background": "Enact laws mandating that all digital software, games, and other media be available on all widely used platforms. This includes cross-platform sync of user data such as saves and purchases, allowing consumers to access owned content across ecosystems without any extra costs or exclusivity barriers.",
