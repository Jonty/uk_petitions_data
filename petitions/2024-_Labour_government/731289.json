        "additional_details": "We urge the Northern Ireland Executive and regulatory bodies to review entry-level requirements in psychology and mental health. Specifically, we ask that bachelor\u2019s degree holders be given opportunities to pursue careers in this understaffed, underfunded sector.\r\n\r\nAllowing psychology graduates to enter at various levels will expand the workforce, ease the burden on specialists, and improve access to mental health care in Northern Ireland.",
        "background": "Mental health services in NI and globally face a funding and workforce crisis. Many psychology graduates with bachelor\u2019s degrees can't enter the workforce because a master\u2019s degree is often required for mental health roles. This is a missed opportunity, given the growing demand for services.",
