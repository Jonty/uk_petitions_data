Its sale by Tameside Council for private profit would erase access to local heritage and remove a valuable community space. We want Government to protect it as a public asset and help fund its restoration as an educational, environmental and historical hub for future generations. Surrounded by Sites of Biological Importance, it must be preserved, not sold off.",
