        "additional_details": "As a born and raised Londoner, I believe London should be an independent country as we are so different from the rest of the UK. There are roughly 9 million people living in London and I believe the vast majority of us have a shared identity around being from London but not necessarily the UK. As a child of immigrants myself I very much do not feel English or even fully British, but I identify as a Londoner and I believe this is the case for many others too.",
        "background": "I would like the government to let residents of London and possibly even the whole of the UK hold a referendum allowing London to become an independent country or state. This could include the entirety of Greater London and potentially City of London, should they choose to vote for it.",
