They also deserve safe, specialised environments that understand and support their unique needs. This not only impacts the wellbeing of our children, but also in my view makes it extremely difficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014for parents / carers to maintain employment.",

This should include, a range of inclusive holiday clubs and activities, trained staff equipped to support SEN children and those with more complex or challenging behaviours.",
