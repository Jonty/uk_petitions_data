        "additional_details": "LED bulbs in headlights are becoming more popular in modern vehicles, and are brighter than typical halogen bulbs that were standard in older vehicles.\r\nAn RAC survey of 2,000 drivers found that nine-in-10 (89%) think at least some headlights on cars on the road today are too bright, of which three-in-10 (28%) think most are too bright. \r\nOf the drivers who complain about the brightness of car headlights, 91% say they get dazzled when driving, and three-quarters (74%) say this happens regularly.",
        "background": "Headlights that are too bright pose a significant risk of dazzling, temporary blindness or inadequate sight of the road, especially when driving at night. I am proposing that the government introduce a limits on the amount of lumens a headlight can emit in order to prevent risk to drivers.",
