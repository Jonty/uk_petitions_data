        "background": "Create and maintain ideas.parliament.uk, an Ideas Commons where people can submit and support ideas that create solutions for life in the UK and everywhere our decisions reach. \r\n\r\nAs with petitions, the strongest ideas should receive a formal Government response and be considered for support.",
