We think this raises ethical and legal questions regarding the UK's support and diplomatic relations with Israel. By holding a national referendum, we think we would empower British citizens to express their stance on whether these ties should continue, be revised, or severed entirely, helping to ensure that the UK's foreign policy aligns with values and will of its people.",
