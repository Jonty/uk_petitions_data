        "additional_details": "I believe that the government places varying degrees of focus on public services. The government underfunds a number of public services, including police, fire, and ambulance services. One example of this is police officer compensation. The reason crime is an issue in our country is because we don't have enough police. The UK is collapsing due to crime and other factors like the strain on the NHS. With the direction it is going, it is obvious that the NHS will not exist in a few years.",
        "background": "From the perspective of British nationals, the government should focus on matters such as immigration control and other significant concerns that are detrimental. Raising salaries for key positions will boost interest and strengthen efforts to combat corruption and promote professionalism.",
