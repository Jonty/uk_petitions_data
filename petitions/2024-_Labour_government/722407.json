        "additional_details": "We think this initiative would ensure policies better reflect public opinion, promote transparency, and enhance the democratic process for a more informed and engaged society. Best ideas could help influence government ideas and bring economic, environmental, and social prosperity to the UK. We think it would solve the issue of UBI and could fund it through economic prosperity from better policy decisions. We think the UK would be more democratic, more economically prosperous, and more environmentally friendly.",
        "background": "The policy game predicts outcomes and provides real-time data to guide decision-making. Participants could earn Universal Basic Income based on performance, fostering civic engagement and improving policy outcomes. AI would score the decisions based on economic, environmental, and social outcomes",
