        "action": "Make counselling and psychotherapy VAT-exempt to improve mental health access.",
        "additional_details": "Too many people cannot afford private counselling due to the added 20% VAT. Removing VAT would improve access to essential mental health support, reduce pressure on NHS services, and prevent people from reaching crisis point. Current VAT rules are inconsistent, leave many qualified therapists disadvantaged, and create financial barriers for those most in need of early intervention. This change would support those on lower incomes and ensure VAT rules reflect modern mental health needs.",
        "background": "We want the Government to make counselling and psychotherapy VAT-exempt. This should apply only to qualified, accredited professionals delivering clinical mental health support, not coaching or wellbeing services, to ensure clear and safe boundaries.",
