        "action": "Stop outsourcing UK jobs overseas and invest in training local workers",
        "additional_details": "Outsourcing leads to significant UK job losses as companies move work abroad for cheaper costs. This undermines opportunities for local workers and stops vital skills from being developed in areas like IT and telecoms. By limiting outsourcing and requiring firms to invest in UK training, the Government can protect jobs, create opportunities for young people, reduce unemployment, and ensure the UK builds long-term skills and economic resilience.",
        "background": "Introduce measures to restrict outsourcing of UK jobs abroad. Require companies facing skill shortages to invest in training UK workers. Provide incentives for apprenticeships and reskilling to ensure industries like IT and telecoms develop homegrown talent instead of relying overseas.",
