Registered vehicle owners are held responsible for everything else in regards to driving, this should apply to collisions/hit and runs also. One vehicle wrote my vehicle off and denied it, recently another vehicle has hit my vehicle and also denied any involvement, despite being on cctv. This needs to change.",
        "background": "Change the law so that registered vehicle owners are responsible for all collisions, i have had 2 drivers hit my vehicles and both denied despite being caught on cctv, this is because the registration number was not seen on the cctv footage. Recently another car has done the same and denying it.",
