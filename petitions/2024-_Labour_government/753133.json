        "additional_details": "A VED + MOT regime for touring caravans offers a high-value, low-disruption opportunity to enhance safety, reduce emissions, and generate significant public revenue (c.\u00a395m per annum). Regular inspections will reduce mechanical failures - one of the top causes of caravan incidents.\r\n \r\nWith a fair and pragmatic rollout, this policy would modernise caravan regulation while supporting broader government goals in transport safety and environmental stewardship.\r\n",
        "background": "Touring caravans are currently exempt from MOT testing and pay no Vehicle Excise Duty, despite:\r\n \r\nReports of being involved in thousands of road incidents each year\r\n \r\nCausing an increase in vehicle CO\u2082 emissions\r\n \r\nMaking use of UK road infrastructure without contributing equivalent revenue.\r\n",
