        "additional_details": "There are limits on how much medicine you can buy online, yet no checks on food. We think that supermarkets already have the data and tech\u2014they just need to join it up. We are concerned people are unknowingly adding harmful amounts to their baskets. We think it's a simple change that could improve public health.\r\n \r\nIt could help the obesity crisis, hospital admissions and make people more well-informed and ultimately give some accountability to the supermarkets who we think are part of the problem.",
        "background": "We want the government to require online supermarkets to display real-time nutrition tracking (e.g. salt, sugar) as you shop, allow filtering for dietary needs (like diabetic or gluten-free), warn users when thresholds are exceeded and remove junk food ads for users with dietary preferences.",
