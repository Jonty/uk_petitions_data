        "additional_details": "The UK tax system is unfair, with too many taxes draining people\u2019s income. Families, workers, and businesses are struggling with the cost of living crisis while wages remain low. Essential costs like food, housing, and energy are taxed multiple times. Reducing taxes will make life more affordable, boost wages, support businesses, and improve living standards. A simple, fair tax system will create financial security and reduce stress for everyone.",
        "background": "We want the Government to abolish most taxes and stop creating new ones. Reduce the number of taxes to only a few essential, fair, and simple taxes. Remove hidden fees, duplicate taxes, and unnecessary levies on property, business, and daily living costs to ease the financial burden on all.",
