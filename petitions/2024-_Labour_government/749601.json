        "additional_details": "GCSE Computer Science provides the bedrock of the content for A-Level Computer Science. Many schools already struggle to complete the entire content for A-Level CS with classes that have all done the subject for GCSE.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the government wants to replace GCSE CS with a more ICT focused qualification, which would remove that bedrock for the A-Level.\r\n\r\nIf the government would like to encourage ICT skills, they should introduce a new GCSE ICT to exist alongside GCSE Computer Science.",
        "background": "The government has recently announced its plan to replace the \u201cnarrowly focused\u201d GCSE Computer Science with a \u201cbroader, future facing\u201d GCSE Computing.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the government should not do this and that it would harm student outcomes, as opposed to benefitting them.",
