        "additional_details": "Thousands of civilians remain trapped under siege in Gaza, facing constant bombardment, starvation, and the collapse of medical infrastructure. Among them are the relatives and close friends of UK citizens. Safe and accessible routes are needed to Save Lives, Mirror Precedents and Uphold Humanitarian Values. Inaction is not a neutral stance it risks complicity in the suffering of innocent people. The UK government has the legal tools, infrastructure, and precedent to act. All it needs is will.",
        "background": "We need a Gaza Family and Friends Sponsorship Scheme, modelled on the Ukraine scheme, allowing UK citizens to sponsor relatives and close friends fleeing life-threatening conditions. Prioritise safe humanitarian evacuation routes. Introduce emergency visa options for individuals at imminent risk.",
