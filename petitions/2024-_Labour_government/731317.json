        "action": "Reduce the school summer break to 5 weeks and allow schools to authorise 5 days",
        "additional_details": "Help ease the financial burden on families who want to create memories with their children as holiday companies can not exploit the holidays to increase prices. This will allow parents a term time break without being punished financially when they are already struggling. Education won't be affected as the summer term would be shorter",
        "background": "It is very expensive to take children out of school during summer holidays. If summer holidays were reduced to 5 weeks and schools were allowed to authorise 5 days of holiday , this would allow parents to take their child/ren out during the term making it cheaper for parents and higher attendance.",
