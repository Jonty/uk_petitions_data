        "additional_details": "The far right claims that \"women should be free to wear what they like\" whilst calling for a ban on the face veil, usually incorrectly called a burka. The burqa is a one-piece that fully covers the face and body, leaving just a mesh screen to see through, which is almost completely unheard of in the UK!\r\nMany women, including white British Muslim women, CHOOSE to wear the niqab. Security measures are already in place in airports, court etc.\r\nThe fact is a \"burqa ban\" goes against British values.",
        "background": "British law upholds religious freedom, which is protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. \r\nRestrictions on personal attire would be inconsistent with British values of religious tolerance and gender equality.",
