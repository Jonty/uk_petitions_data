        "additional_details": "I would St. George's Day to be a national bank holiday so everyone can see it as a days celebration. Currently it is hardly recognised as everyone is working, so unless you book a days holiday or it falls over a weekend you don\u2019t get a chance to celebrate. Dedicating a day off on 23 April would allow communities to come together for local events, educational activities, and traditions that strengthen social cohesion.",
        "background": "St George\u2019s Day should be a bank holiday in England because it offers a meaningful opportunity to celebrate our national identity, heritage, and shared cultural values. Just as other nations mark their patron saints or national days with public holiday.",
