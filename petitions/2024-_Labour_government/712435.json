        "additional_details": "\"I would want Parliament to do this because a public inquiry would bring to light the extent of the problem, highlight systemic failures in protecting vulnerable children, ensure that all perpetrators are held accountable regardless of their background, and lead to the development of better safeguarding strategies. It would also provide a platform for survivors to be heard, help in understanding the patterns and characteristics of grooming gangs, and ensure that lessons are learned to prevent future occurrences. An inquiry would also reassure the public that the government is committed to addressing these heinous crimes comprehensively.\"",
        "background": "I want Parliament to initiate a public inquiry into the systemic sexual exploitation of young girls by grooming gangs, focusing on understanding the full scope of the issue, the methods used by these gangs, and implementing measures to protect children and prosecute offenders effectively",
