Evidence shows that inclusive access does not increase assaults. Safeguarding should focus on behaviour, not identity. Respecting gender identity protects the dignity and safety of all, including women and children. Forcing trans women into male spaces and trans men into female spaces creates more harm. Inclusive policies are safer, fairer, and based on evidence.",
