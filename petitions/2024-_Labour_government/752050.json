        "additional_details": "I believe ending or limiting jury trials would weaken fairness and public trust in the justice system further than it currently is. Jury trials allow ordinary people to participate directly in deciding serious cases, preventing power from being concentrated in the hands of the officials. They provide transparency, protect against wrongful convictions, and ensure decisions reflect community values. Parliament must preserve this safeguard.",
        "background": "The Government must commit to keeping jury trials and not introduce any proposals that limit them. Jury trials protect fairness and public accountability in the justice system. Parliament must preserve this essential right without weakening or restricting it.",
