        "action": "Reform MOT testing: minimum pricing and higher professional standards",
        "additional_details": "We believe that current low fees compromise safety and professional standards. We are concerned that current MOT prices may be forcing dangerous undercutting - stations charging \u00a325-\u00a330 may fail items unnecessarily to profit from repairs. The \u00a354.85 maximum fee for cars has not kept pace with inflation compared to other industries. Unqualified testers compromise road safety. We need minimum pricing and higher professional standards to protect drivers and legitimate businesses.",
        "background": "Reform MOT testing for better road safety. Introduce minimum pricing or a national flat rate to prevent dangerous undercutting, and more rigorous checks for new testers and MOT stations gaining qualification.",
