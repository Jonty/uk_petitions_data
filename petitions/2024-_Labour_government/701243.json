        "action": "Petition to make UK overtime pay tax-free, supporting workers and easing costs.",
        "additional_details": "An overtime pay tax-free would help UK workers keep more of what they earn when taking on additional hours, supporting them as they face rising costs of living. This change would benefit individuals working extra hours to meet financial needs and support essential industries facing labor shortages. Implementing a tax-free overtime policy, the Government can alleviate economic pressures on families, encourage spending in local economies, boost productivity, reward the dedication.",
        "background": "We urge Parliament to make overtime pay tax-free, letting UK workers keep more income when working extra hours. This would ease living costs, support key industries, and encourage workforce participation. A tax-free overtime policy would benefit workers, boost spending, and aid economic stability.",
