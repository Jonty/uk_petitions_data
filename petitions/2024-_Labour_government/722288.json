If taken from net wages this then achieves a better living scenario for the children and both parents due to a less stressful environment and creates a better environment between parents also.",
        "background": "With the new tax increases it is making it more difficult for paying parents to afford child maintenance payments while affording to care for the children when the paying parent has the children. Currently it is calculated from gross pay with new tax increases this gives parents less money to live.",
