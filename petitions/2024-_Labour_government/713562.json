An industry has grown up around compliance which we think flourishes because of  numerous 'grey' areas that exist in the governance of the operation of LGVs largely because the implications for operators who unwittingly get it wrong are so high.",
        "background": "The regulations about the operation of LGVs are multi layered and complex and have reached the point were, trainers and enforcers interpret the rules differently making it very difficult to comply. The Government should review and simplify them to ensure they are clear, concise and fit for purpose.",
