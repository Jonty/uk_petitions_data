        "additional_details": "There is growing concern that loopholes in social media regulations & party funding rules allow extremist organisations or individuals to undermine the democratic foundations of the UK. There is increasing evidence of this in overseas elections and even UK-based polls. It is in the national interest & in principle, that the UK government ensures evidence-based reasoning takes precedence over financial resources in political discourse.",
        "background": "Loopholes in party funding regulations allow national parties (or companies masquerading as parties) to receive unbounded funding via local candidates or by non-UK citizens. These & corresponding social media influencing loopholes should be closed.",
