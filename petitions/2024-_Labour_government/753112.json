        "action": "Do not remove jury trials for offences under three years.",
        "additional_details": "Trial by jury has protected the public for more than 800 years and remains a vital safeguard against wrongful conviction and state overreach. Removing jury trials for a wide group of offences would undermine fairness and public confidence in the justice system. Pressures on the courts should be addressed through investment and reform, not by eroding a long established right. The duty of any UK Government is to protect fundamental rights, not weaken them. This is outrageous.",
        "background": "Please keep the right to a jury trial for all offences where it currently applies. The Government should not remove jury trials for cases with sentences under three years and should instead address delays in the justice system without reducing core legal protections.",
