        "additional_details": "I have tried EVERYTHING to get Manchester City Council to listen but they double down and blame driver\u2019s for their own misleading signage. Despite being fully aware of the situation they have continued issuing tickets for the same reason and have shown no initiative to sort it out. Anyone who has received a fine for this reason and has had their appeal rejected (they reject them all) deserves to be refunded for the council\u2019s mistake!",
        "background": "The sign on Collier St. has caused a 318% increase in parking fines since it became misleading in 2018. People believe they are legitimately paying for their parking because the \u2018pay at machine\u2019 sign points directly at the wrong machine (a machine for a private SIP car park).",
