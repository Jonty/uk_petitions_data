        "additional_details": "New drivers deserve the accessibility and freedom to drive without such a significant financial burden. In the UK, young drivers make up only 30% of the population but pay about 50% of all motoring premiums.These high insurance quote is due to the perception of new drivers as being high-risk, despite many being responsible. Therefore, there\u2019s a need for a systemic change. We need insurance companies + stakeholders to rethink how they determine insurance quotes and demand equal and fair premiums.",
        "background": "Premiums for new drivers are ridiculous! with a black box 17 year olds are being charged \u00a34,000+ and without anything from \u00a37,000+ most of these young people are only making around \u00a3400-\u00a31000 a month so it\u2019s physically impossible to buy a car, lessons and insurance. We need a policy in place!",
