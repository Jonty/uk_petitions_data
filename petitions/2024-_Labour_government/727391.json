        "additional_details": "Applying to job vacancies requires applicants to mentally and physically invest themselves in the application process.\r\n\r\nMany employers/recruiters do not choose to recognise the countless hours spent pouring through applications, ghosting applicants post application, some even post-interview. Applicants\u2019 could be left in the dark for months without a clear application outcome.\r\n\r\nIn an increasingly competitive job market, it\u2019s not unreasonable to demand fairer job application conditions.",

We demand post application outcomes within a fixed amount of time with a clearly listed outcome - i.e. acceptance/rejection.\r\n\r\nProtect applicants from being needlessly left in the dark post application.",
