Unregulated 'influencers', 'life coaches' and in some cases negligent practitioners can cause iatrogenic harm and family breakdown without, in our view, proper accountability. We believe some struck-off practitioners can rebrand without oversight. Statutory regulation could end the 'Wild West,' restore public confidence, and protect the integrity of the profession by ensuring all practitioners meet national safety and ethical standards.",
