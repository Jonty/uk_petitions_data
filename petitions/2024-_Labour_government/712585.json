Councils have spent significant amounts replacing lights with \"energy-saving\" bulbs, and I think turning them off defeats the purpose of these investments. I think that instead of cutting essential public safety measures, councils should find other ways to reduce costs.\r\n \r\nI believe residents deserve well-lit streets for both safety and peace of mind.",
