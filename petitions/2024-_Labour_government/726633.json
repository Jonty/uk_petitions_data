Clearly separate legal migrants from illegal immigration in all policy and public messaging.\r\n3. Involve legal migrant voices, especially those without citizenship, in political and policy changes that directly affects their lives.",
        "background": "We work, pay taxes, and follow the rules \u2014 yet all legal migrant workers have no say in UK policies that affect our lives. We\u2019re part of this country. It\u2019s time we were heard. This is about fairness, dignity, and a voice in decisions that matter.",
