We advocate for a minimum of 30% coursework in all courses because we think this would reflect the true work ethic and ability of all students, especially those with anxiety who may struggle under unnecessary exam conditions.\r\n \r\nWe also believe that the current curriculum is outdated and does not include enough practical work. We think subjects should be reviewed and should reflect the true purpose of the course.",
