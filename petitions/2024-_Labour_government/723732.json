We advocate for a minimum of 30% coursework in all courses because we think this would reflect the true work ethic and ability of all students, especially those with anxiety who may struggle under unnecessary exam conditions.\r\n \r\nWe also believe that the current curriculum is outdated and does not include enough practical work. We think subjects should be reviewed and should reflect the true purpose of the course.",
        "background": "We urge the government to review GCSE assessment methods and advocate for a minimum of 30% coursework in all courses. We want the government to review curriculums in all subjects and look into the actual purpose of the course to determine how better to assess students.",
