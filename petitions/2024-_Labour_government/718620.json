        "action": "Make UK tax spending transparent by implementing a blockchain-based system",
        "additional_details": "Currently, UK taxpayers have no direct visibility into how their taxes are allocated. A blockchain-based system would:\r\n\r\n- Ensure full transparency by allowing the public to see how tax revenue is distributed across government departments.\r\n- Increase public trust by reducing waste, fraud, and mismanagement.\r\n- Modernise tax management using secure, efficient, and tamper-proof digital ledger technology.\r\n\r\nImplementing this could set a global standard for transparent governance.",
        "background": "We urge the UK government to introduce a blockchain-based system for tax transparency, allowing taxpayers to track exactly where their contributions are spent in real time.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to explore the feasibility of such a system and conduct a pilot program to test its effectiveness.",
