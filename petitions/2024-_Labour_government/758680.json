        "action": "Repeal Mandatory Folic Acid Fortification in UK Bread Flour",
        "additional_details": "Synthetic folic acid can accumulate as unmetabolised folic acid, with concerns including masking vitamin B12 deficiency, potential cancer progression in some groups, and side effects such as headaches, anxiety, sleep and digestive issues. Genetic variants like MTHFR may impair metabolism, increasing risk. Mandatory fortification removes choice despite uneven benefit.",
        "background": "We call on Parliament to repeal mandatory folic acid fortification of UK bread flour, protect consumer choice, respect informed consent, and replace mass medication with targeted education and voluntary supplementation for those who need it most.",
