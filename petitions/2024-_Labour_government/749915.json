        "additional_details": "Many have workplace skills but need support to access jobs. Support should focus on promoting independence, inclusion, quality of life.\r\n\r\nSome autistic adults without intellectual disabilities do not receive housing support, leaving them without vital support for independent living. This group can be highly vulnerable; their challenges are often hidden and poorly understood by professionals with potentially devastating consequences. Delivering dedicated supported living could enable them to thrive, achieve independence, gain employment, reduce reliance on benefits and deliver economic and social benefits while promoting equality and inclusion.",
