        "additional_details": "My dogs have to be heavily sedated and are so scared. We all hate this time of year when Fireworks are let off, the sale of explosive fireworks should be banned and replaced with \"silent fireworks\" which are available on the Continent. This would allow people to enjoy the firework displays without disturbance to animals and people with young children. Restrict the sale of industrial strength explosive fireworks to licenced displays only and only on one day. The nearest Saturday to the 5th Nov.",
        "background": "Every Guy Fawkes &  New Years Eve & days leading up, the upset & disturbance created by the sale of fireworks is extreme. The general public should only be able to purchase \"silent fireworks\" to limit the inconvenience they cause. Pets & people of nervous disposition experience terror.",
