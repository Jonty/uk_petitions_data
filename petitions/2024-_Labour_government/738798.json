        "action": "Make it law that if you can sign up online, you must be able to cancel online",
        "additional_details": "Currently, many companies (e.g. energy, telecoms, gyms, subscriptions) allow quick online sign-up but force customers to cancel only by phone or in person. This often leads to pressure-selling, unnecessary delays, and unfair admin fees.\r\n\r\nThis practice undermines consumer rights. Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, contracts must be fair and transparent. Forcing consumers to cancel via different, more difficult methods is neither.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to introduce legislation requiring all businesses that allow consumers to sign up for services online to also provide a direct, equally simple online method of cancellation.",
