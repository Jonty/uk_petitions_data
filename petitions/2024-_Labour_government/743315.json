This could include people with  a Trigeminal Neuralgia diaganosis: https://www.gov.uk/definition-of-disability-under-equality-act-2010\r\n\r\nTreatment for trigeminal neuralgia, including access to pain relief, is available on the NHS: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/trigeminal-neuralgia/treatment/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition clearly explaining what you'd like the UK Government or Parliament to do. For example, we could accept a petition calling for the UK Government to fund more research into Trigeminal Neuralgia, if that's something that you'd like to see. "
