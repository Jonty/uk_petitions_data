        "additional_details": "Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men yet has no screening programme.\r\n\r\nWe disagree with the UK NSC\u2019s analysis of the evidence and the weight it has placed on avoiding unintended harms. We believe the Committee has fixated on potential harms that have already dramatically reduced, while under-weighting the very real benefits of early detection. The analysis has not kept pace with modern practice or acknowledged how this would be an improvement on the current inefficient and inequitable system.\r\n\r\nTargeted screening for all high-risk men should be the starting point for building a screening programme that can ultimately protect all men. Early diagnosis saves lives.",
        "background": "We are calling on the Government to reassess the UK National Screening Committee\u2019s (UK NSC) draft recommendation not to offer prostate cancer screening to anyone except men with BRCA1/2 genetic variants, and to introduce screening for all high-risk men.",
