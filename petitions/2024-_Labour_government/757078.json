        "additional_details": "I want the Government or Parliament to call an immediate general election to restore democratic legitimacy and public trust. Major decisions are being made without a clear, current mandate from voters, and public confidence has been undermined by political instability and broken promises. Parliament\u2019s role is to represent the people, not preserve power. An election would allow voters to hold leaders accountable and choose the direction of the country",
        "background": "I want an immediate general election because the current government no longer has a clear or credible mandate from the public. Major decisions are being made that affect people\u2019s lives, livelihoods,and future, yet voters have not had a recent opportunity to express how they feel.",
