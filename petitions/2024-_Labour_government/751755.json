If benefits are truly the concern, restrict them separately. Don\u2019t trap migrants in one sector for 15 years with no freedom to grow, retrain or change careers. The big question is this: is this proposal really about benefits\u2014or is it a modern form of labour slavery, to have labourers for atleast 15years?",
