        "additional_details": "There are now over half a million Romanian-born people living in the UK according to the latest census, making Romanian one of the most spoken foreign languages here and reflecting a significant community that could benefit from access to Romanian GCSE education. We believe that Including Romanian in the curriculum would support linguistic diversity, help children from Romanian backgrounds connect with their heritage, and better serve a large and growing population group in schools.",
        "background": "Require the Government to approve Romanian as a GCSE subject, and help fund exam development and the training of  teachers, to allow students to study and sit Romanian GCSE alongside other modern foreign languages.",
