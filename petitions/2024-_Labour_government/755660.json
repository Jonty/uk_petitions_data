        "additional_details": "Water companies operate as regulated monopolies, meaning customers can find it difficult to switch provider or avoid price rises. In the last year, many customers have faced sharp bill increases to fund infrastructure repairs following long-term underinvestment. Where profits were paid instead of investment, we believe it is unfair for customers to fund these historic failures. Regulation should prioritise affordability, fairness and consumer protection.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to require Ofwat to ban water companies from increasing charges for customers for historic underinvestment where profits were paid to shareholders. Repairs to be paid by reducing shareholder dividends before bill increases.",
