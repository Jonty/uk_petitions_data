        "additional_details": "Promote responsible dog ownership. Cats are beloved family members in millions of UK homes, yet there is no specific offence of a cat being attacked by a dog. If a dog kills livestock, another dog, or injures a person, laws are stronger but dog attacks on cats are not specifically covered. Often a dog can kill without consequence. This is unfair and outdated.\r\n\r\nCats deserve the same protection as other animals if not more. Their emotional value is immense. Let\u2019s make the law reflect that.",
        "background": "Make it an offence for a dog to kill or seriously injure a cat, whether in public or on private property. Introduce penalties for negligent dog owners and compensation for cat owners that reflects the emotional impact & distress caused plus vet bills or cremation costs.",
