        "additional_details": "While free sanitary products are available in some public spaces, access remains very inconsistent and often unavailable in larger areas like work, shopping centres, transport hubs etc.\r\nThere are millions of people who experience period poverty or are forced to leave work or public spaces due to lack of access. \r\nMandating free sanitary products in all public spaces would promote equality, reduce stigma, support public health, and ensure no one is excluded due to menstruation.",
        "background": "We want the UK Government to introduce legislation requiring free sanitary products to be available in all public spaces, including shopping centres, airports, workplaces, schools, sports and leisure clubs, colleges and universities.",
