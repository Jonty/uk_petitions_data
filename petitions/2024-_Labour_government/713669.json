        "additional_details": "In July 2024, on LBC, Treasury advisor Sir Edward Troup suggested that means testing the state pension should be considered. This comment, repeatedly cited in the press, continues to stoke fears amongst workers.\r\n\r\nEmployee NICs are a voluntary investment in a pension. If trust erodes further, workers may redirect NICs, weakening the system. The Government must quash speculation now by committing to never means testing the state pension, to restore public confidence and support economic stability.",
        "background": "I want Parliament to commit to never means testing the state pension. Those who have made the required National Insurance contributions should receive their pension, regardless of retirement wealth. I urge the Government to enshrine this principle in law.",
