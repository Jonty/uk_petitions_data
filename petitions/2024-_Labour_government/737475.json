        "additional_details": "We think the Government should be concerned about this as more and more pet owners are struggling to afford treatments for their beloved pets. Not only this, but with many facing pet insurance increases every year, it is for many no longer affordable to insure pets to help cover vet fees. We think the Government should regulate vet costs, so every animal can get the care they deserve.",
        "background": "About 57% of households in the UK have a pet, yet we think veterinary prices are through the roof.\r\nWith the cost of living increasing, we think there should be a limit on how much profit a veterinary practice can make from selling medications and completing procedures.",
