        "additional_details": "We live in an era of disinformation and misinformation where opinions have become more prevalent than fact in elections. The only way to combat this, is to arm the new 16-17 years old voters with the knowledge of our political system, allowing them to resist the influences of social media and propaganda and focus on their own political interests when voting; Giving them the freedom to choose wisely as well as the incentive to carry on voting.",
        "background": "The government should introduce basic political education for 16-17 year olds (KS4/5) who have recently gotten the vote, so they may be informed when voting. Basic education includes: The voting system (FPTP), The Parties (minor and major), Functions of Parliament. Can take place with PSHE.",
