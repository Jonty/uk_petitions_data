Access to care and GP prescribing of SSRIs can vary by postcode, which can create unfair treatment gaps. These failures can harm education and drive rising welfare costs. EHCP's are also being affected as we feel the H (Health) parts are not being addressed. This can cause further costs to cash strapped local authorities. An inquiry is needed now.",
