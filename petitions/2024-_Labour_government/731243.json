        "action": "Make GCSE English Literature exams open-book",
        "additional_details": "Making the exams open-book would better apply skills needed in real-life scenarios, where people can access resources to inform their decisions. This would shift the focus from recall to analysis and deeper understanding of texts. Students would be encouraged to engage more with literature, using texts to support their interpretations, rather than relying on recall. It also reduces unwanted stress, allowing students to express their analytical abilities rather than their ability to memorise.",
        "background": "The exams should be open-book to encourage deeper understanding and critical thinking. This approach would allow students to engage with the text more analytically, focusing on interpretation rather than memorisation. It fosters long-term comprehension, preparing students for real-world application.",
