        "additional_details": "Although that I am aware of the fact that there was a petition in 2020 for something similar, and it was rejected under the reason that it was not directly related to the government, however, I disagree as under the Motor Vehicles (Compulsory Insurance) Act 2022 it is a requirement to have insurance to drive in the UK. So why should insurers be allowed to effectively charge what they wish with no governance? I am urging to ban or cap, to a fair amount, the increase of premiums after an incident.",
        "background": "I am starting this petition to urge the government to prevent or minimalise insurance companies from increasing premiums for policy holders who have made non-fault claims. This practice, while widespread, penalises those who are not responsible for the incident, undermining the principles of justice",
