        "additional_details": "I believe it is only fair that we challenge Local Councillors in the same way as Members of Parliament. If they are not doing their job they should be removed and replaced with someone who will carry out the wishes of the people who voted them in. In some cases Local Government is the start of a MP's political working life. Do you know who your Councillors is, who may visited your ward at election time and never seen since until the next election?",
        "background": "At present there is no mechanism for constituents to remove a sitting local Councillor other than at the next election, in some cases waiting for 3 or more years. We need a new act of Parliament similar to Recall of MPs but this time Recall of Councillors.",
