        "additional_details": "Make real changes. We've seen how the Trump administration in the U.S. established \"DOGE\" to save money. Perhaps the UK could set up a \"D.O.E.G\" \u2014 Department of Economic Growth \u2014 and heed the practical advice from figures like Rob Moore and Daniel Priestley.\r\n\r\nThis matter requires urgent attention. Invite Rob Moore and Daniel Priestley to meet with Rachel Reeves and Keir Starmer to present their proposed plans and allow them to establish the D.O.E.G.",
        "background": "Yesterday, we learned about Rachel Reeves' plans to stimulate the UK economy, but many of these projects are years away from yielding the necessary results for growth. However, numerous business leaders are offering sensible and innovative ideas that could start boosting the economy from day one.",
