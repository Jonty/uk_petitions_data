        "additional_details": "Technology shapes almost every part of our lives \u2014 how we communicate, travel, work, shop, and use public services. But while digital systems have advanced rapidly, our rights and protections have not kept pace.\r\nGovernments and private companies can collect, track, and analyse personal data on a scale that simply wasn\u2019t possible when most UK laws were written. Without clear limits and modern safeguards, there is a growing risk of excessive surveillance, loss of privacy, and government overreach.",
        "background": "We want the Government to introduce a Digital Bill of Rights that places clear limits on surveillance and protects people from government overreach in the digital age. Modern technologies allow large-scale monitoring and data collection that current laws do not fully address",
