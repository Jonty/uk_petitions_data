        "additional_details": "I'm absolutely heartbroken to read a Facebook post this morning about a dog that is nearly 2 years old  that has lost his life due to fireworks, sadly the shock of the sound of the fireworks has made this dog very scared and he has had a seizure and has been paralysed from this. Sadly this morning the family has had to have him put to sleep.  I'm now hearing other animals have been affected too and I'm sure there are many more. These animals do not have a voice and we are there voices. This post has really touched my heart, its not only the poor animals that have suffered but the families too. This has left me so upset and heartbroken and I feel like I need to start this petition for every animal suffering and there families.",
