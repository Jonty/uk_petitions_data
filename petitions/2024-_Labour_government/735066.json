        "additional_details": "At 18 individuals are legally recognised as adults. They can vote, serve on juries, sign contracts, and be held fully responsible under the law. Despite this many are still paid less than those just a few years older, which is discriminatory and inconsistent with their legal status. Paying less based on age alone is unfair and goes against the principle of equal pay for equal work. Lower wages for younger adults reinforce class and generational inequality.",

Currently, individuals aged 18\u201320 can legally vote, sign contracts, live independently, and are fully accountable under the law, yet they are still paid less than older adults for doing the exact same work.",
