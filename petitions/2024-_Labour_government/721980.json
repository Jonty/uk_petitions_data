Cutting access or freezing payments will push thousands into financial insecurity, worsen mental health and add more employment barriers. These changes could force many disabled people to remain in unsafe or abusive living situations due to a loss of financial independence. We urge the government to protect disability rights. These reforms will increase reduce access to essential care, making many daily lives harder.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to reconsider plans for means-testing, stricter eligibility criteria, and freezing payments for PIP. Instead, ensure PIP remains accessible, fair, and supports disabled people without introducing additional hardship.",
