Fans are locked out by online systems and unfair practices. We urge artists and organisers to bring back in-person sales through local shops and regulate the market. It\u2019s a fair, proven method that supports communities, stops scams, and gives real fans a fighting chance. Let\u2019s restore fairness and protect fans from exploitation in live event ticketing.",

Let fans queue, experience, connect, and access tickets fairly before live music/events becomes a privilege, not a passion.",
