        "additional_details": "We think the UK visa system imposes excessive requirements for EU couples. We think that many applicants have over 10 years of contributions but may be forced to provide too much evidence for their relationship, even if they marry in a few months. We think that without a temporary visa, couples can\u2019t live together, work, or save for their wedding, and that many people live on minimum wages can\u2019t afford high fees. We believe that this is discriminatory and prevents families from reuniting",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to simplify visa rules for EU citizens wanting to start a family with their EU partners in the UK. Introduce a temporary visa allowing couples to live and work together while proving their relationship.",
