        "additional_details": "A decision to ban social media for under 16s (12 - 15 yrs old), isolates people in small demographics\u2014gay kids who don't have support groups in their area. Deprives others of contacting family members and friends outside of school. It also still doesn't solve the issues of child porn, and other things. An excuse is \"ideological grooming,\" the government is doing this now. If you want to ban 10 year olds and under fine, but a blanket ban for all? Let parents be parents and deal with it.",
        "background": "We want parents to be allowed to be parents. The decision to ban social media for under 16s leads to unintended consequences. The excuses for the ban are not justification. Saying they're mature to vote at 16, but not use messenger at 15, doesn't make sense. The difference in age is a day.",
