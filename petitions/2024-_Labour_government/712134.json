        "additional_details": "With many young people in the country becoming victims of child criminal exploitation, we think there is evidence that children are accessing weapons, supposedly to defend themselves, through cheap e-trader websites. Over the past 10 years knife crime has increased by 80%. In the year to March 2024, there were over 50,000 blade-related crimes in the England and Wales (excluding Greater Manchester). We think companies target children, selling knifes at pocket money prices and using cheap delivery services who may not check ID, often posting items through doors.",
        "background": "We think the government needs to ensure overseas online retailers are abiding to UK trade law and weapons laws when selling bladed articles online, as we believe some retailers may be using cheap delivery services who may not follow ID processes which could allow under 16s to access weapons.",
