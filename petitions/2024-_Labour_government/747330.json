We believe if riders had more thorough training, similar to what\u2019s required for larger motorbikes or cars, and better education about bike safety, tragedies may be prevented. Additionally, this could lead to stricter regulations in place for purchasing bikes from private sellers, with proper checks to identify faults before a sale.",
