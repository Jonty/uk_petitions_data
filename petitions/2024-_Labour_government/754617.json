Their lies to gain a majority vote, about \"financial black holes\", about the state of the economy to raise needless taxes, their inability to control illegal migration are all tantamount to their demise. Now Labour have shown their true policies, a General Election should be held to allow the public to vote with true clarity.",

They have lost the trust of the country and are causing harm to the economy and should be held accountable for their lies.",
