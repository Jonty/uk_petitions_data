Currently, the system punishes full-time work; my \u00a31,770 childcare cost exceeds my \u00a31,687 wage, and the Cap steals the \"child elements\" meant for my children\u2019s survival. While non-working households will benefit from the April 2026 changes, working families will see every extra penny \"capped off.\" Stop making it more profitable to stay home than to work 40 hours. Make work pay for us too.",
