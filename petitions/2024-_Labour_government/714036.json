        "action": "Legalize and regulate cannabis for responsible medicinal and recreational use.",
        "additional_details": "Legalizing cannabis will reduce illegal markets, provide safer products, and generate significant tax revenue to support public services like healthcare and education. Other countries have shown legalization can reduce crime, ease pressure on police and courts, and create jobs. It allows for better public health outcomes by regulating quality and promoting responsible use. The UK has an opportunity to adopt an evidence-based policy that benefits society and the economy.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to legalize cannabis, regulate its sale and use, and decriminalize possession. Introduce strict licensing for production, ensure product safety, and tax sales to fund public services. Promote education on responsible use and reduce harm while addressing the illegal market.",
