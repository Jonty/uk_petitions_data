        "additional_details": "Leaving an abusive relationship can often force survivors into serious financial difficulty. Many may flee with nothing while abusers can walk away with assets, leaving victims burdened by debts and poor credit. This punishes survivors long after the abuse ends, trapping them in poverty and trauma. Survivors deserve the chance to recover with dignity, not face years of financial ruin for saving themselves.",
