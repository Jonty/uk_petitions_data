Universities continue to recruit and train PAs, profiting from tuition fees, but graduates can be left unemployed. The PA role was designed to support the NHS workforce, but we think without job security, PAs are being forced out of healthcare. We want the Government to ensure PA integration into the NHS to prevent further workforce shortages and safeguard the future of this profession.",
