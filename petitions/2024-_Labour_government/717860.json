        "additional_details": "In Monton, Manchester there is an increase of teenagers wearing all black with black full face balaclavas attacking and assaulting people and children, often at knife point. They attack on electric bikes in gangs.  Without face coverings im sure they would not be as 'brave'! A policeman was pushed off his bike in broad daylight by a gang of such youths recently. Im sure this is a national concern. There are no meaningful deterrents anymore , these kids so not care who they hurt or target",
