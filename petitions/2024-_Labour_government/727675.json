        "additional_details": "Skilled workers make long term committments to move to the UK based on existing immigration rules.\r\nSkilled workers pay significant taxes, fill essential roles, boost local economies, raise families and don\u2019t access public funds.\r\nTo change the settlement rules midway undermines the confidence that we have in the UK\u2019s legal & immigration system and causes emotional, financial, and professional burden on those who played by the rules and leaving them no choice than to return to their home country",
        "background": "Maintain the current 5-year ILR route for Skilled Worker visa holders who are already living in the UK before the rule change takes effect. Provide official clarification to reduce the anxiety among workers, families, and employers.\r\nHonor the terms under which existing migrants entered the UK.",
