        "additional_details": "Alston argues that the UK government's austerity policies, since 2010, have deliberately gutted the social safety net and inflicted unnecessary misery on the most vulnerable.  This has led to: \u00a0 \r\n\r\nA rise in poverty, despite record employment.  \u00a0 \r\n\r\nIncreased homelessness and reliance on food banks.  \u00a0 \r\n\r\nDecimation of social services and legal aid. The low attendance of MPs at the debate on the UN report on poverty in Britain is a cause for concern. Invite the UN special rapporteur to return.",
        "background": "The report's author, UN Special Rapporteur Philip Alston, urges the UK government to:\r\n\r\nReverse regressive measures such as the benefit freeze and the two-child limit.  \u00a0 \r\n\r\nRestore local government funding to fight poverty.  \u00a0 \r\n\r\nReform Universal Credit to be more humane and less punitive.  \u00a0",
