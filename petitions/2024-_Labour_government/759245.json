        "additional_details": "Continued private ownership places it at risk from neglect, commercial pressures, and closure. Public ownership would allow the pier to be managed transparently in the public interest, prioritising heritage conservation, public access, and community benefit. We call on the Government to explore legal and financial mechanisms, including support for acquisition by a local authority or community trust, to safeguard this irreplaceable asset for future generations.",
        "background": "We ask the Government and Parliament to raise the discussion of public ownership of Teignmouth Pier to secure its long-term protection, accessibility, and future for the community. Teignmouth Pier is a historically significant structure and an important part of Devon\u2019s coastal heritage.",
