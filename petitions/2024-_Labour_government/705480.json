        "action": "Remove unnecessary privilege and self-enrichment for MPs",
        "additional_details": "The past 14 years were plagued by a government that constantly threw their privileged positions in the faces of the British public. This kind of person should not be in a position of power or responsibility, but they're attracted to government due to the lucrative opportunities that come with the position. Sir Keir stated that \u201cpublic service is a privilege\u201d. Let\u2019s enshrine that in law. This ties in with Sir Keir\u2019s pledge to return politics to public service and he has the majority to impose it.",
        "background": "I propose that the role of MP be reverted to its intended function - a servant of the people, someone who seeks to improve the lot of their constituents, not just feather their own nests. This will have the knock-on effect of ensuring that people who run for government do so for the right reasons.",
