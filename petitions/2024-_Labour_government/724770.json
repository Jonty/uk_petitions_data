        "additional_details": "Letting agents currently operate without formal oversight, and we think this has led to hidden fees, withheld deposits, potentially misleading advertising, and pressure tactics. We think tenants can be exploited, and landlords may be unfairly blamed for poor agent conduct. We believe this lack of accountability damages trust in the housing market and leaves the public vulnerable.\r\n \r\nHousing is essential and we believe letting agents must be held to professional standards.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to introduce increased regulation for letting agents by establishing an independent regulator with enforcement powers, a mandatory licensing scheme, recognised qualifications for letting agents, and transparent fees and conduct standards.",
