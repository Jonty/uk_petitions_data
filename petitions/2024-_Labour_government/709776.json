        "additional_details": "Private parking companies may impose strict time limits to pay, which I think is penalizing drivers for factors beyond their control, like malfunctioning machines or queues. Additionally, in my view, Blue Badge holders and those in medical emergencies face unfair fines. I believe that by regulating these practices, the Government could promote fairness, accessibility, and protect vulnerable individuals from potential exploitation, ensuring the system works in the public's best interest.",
        "background": "We call for legislation to regulate the practices of private parking firms, including:\r\n- allowing pre-payment or payment at the time of departure\r\n- offering free or discounted parking for Blue Badge holders\r\n- exempting parking for medical emergencies from Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs).
