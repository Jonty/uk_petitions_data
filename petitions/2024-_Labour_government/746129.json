        "additional_details": "Applying the 10-year ILR rule to people who are already living in the UK would be unfair and disruptive. Many residents have built their lives, careers, and families here based on the existing 5-year rules. Retroactively changing the rules would create unnecessary hardship and instability. Implementing the 10-year requirement only for future arrivals protects the rights and stability of current residents while ensuring fair treatment for newcomers.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to apply the 10-year ILR rule only to new arrivals, ensuring that current residents can continue their path to permanent residency and citizenship under the existing 5-year rules.",
