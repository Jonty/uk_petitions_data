        "additional_details": "We do not think \u00a329000 is anything near the wages of an ordinary person, and that there are families and loved ones forced to live in different countries from one another because they cannot afford to meet the requirements of having a \u00a329000 joint income per year needed to be able to apply for a family visa as a partner and bring their loved ones to live with them in the UK. We also believe that children who don't see one of their parents and suffer mentally because of this, and that this threshold of earnings is unreasonable and unrealistic in the current financial state of the world.",
