        "additional_details": "Liz Kendall\u2019s proposed 4-point eligibility rule for PIP would see millions of sick and disabled people left without any support. PIP is not an out of work benefit, and many disabled people rely on it to find work and to stay in work. That is why this proposal cannot go ahead.\r\n\r\nI also urge the Government not to proceed with the abolishment of contributions-based ESA in favour of a \u201ctime-limited\u201d Unemployment Insurance. ESA is a vital lifeline for people who are not eligible for Universal Credit.",
        "background": "I am calling on the UK Government to not proceed with Liz Kendall\u2019s proposed cuts to disability benefits.\r\n\r\nAccording to the UK charity Oxfam, applying a 2% wealth tax on assets worth over \u00a310 million could raise up to \u00a324 billion within a year. This is what the Government should be focusing on.",
