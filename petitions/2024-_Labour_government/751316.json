        "additional_details": "We acknowledge the Government\u2019s concern about the misue of access to public benefits. A fair transitional approach would be to allow Skilled Worker migrants already in the UK to complete ILR after five years under a condition that they do not access public funds. The proposal to extend the ILR qualifying period by another decade creates uncertainty, disrupts family life, exposes Skilled Workers to greater risk of exploitation, and causes significant emotional, financial, and practical hardship.",
        "background": "We respectfully request that the UK Government avoid retrospective changes to immigration policy and maintain the existing 5-year ILR pathway for current Skilled Worker visa holders creating a \u201cNo-Benefits, No Public funds\u201d Rule to prevent the misue of access to public benefits.",
