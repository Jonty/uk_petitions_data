        "action": "Reverse the April 2026 dividend tax rise and review its impact on SMEs",
        "additional_details": "We are concerned the April 2026 dividend tax rise places additional pressure on SMEs and founders already facing higher costs, tight margins and limited support. For many small businesses, dividends are part of how cash flow is managed, income is paid, reinvestment is funded and stability is maintained. Increasing the tax burden reduces the capital available for hiring, growth and resilience, ultimately discouraging entrepreneurship and weakening the UK\u2019s small-business economy.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to reverse the April 2026 2% dividend tax rise and review its impact on SMEs. For example,many small business owners use a salary-plus-dividend structure, meaning this rise increases their overall tax burden and adds pressure to founders/SMEs who are vital to UK economic growth",
