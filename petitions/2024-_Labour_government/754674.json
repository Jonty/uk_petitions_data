This is entertaining, given that compared to the 19th century the 20th century had dramatically low levels of paper petitions per year.\r\n\r\nParliaments exist to redress grievances as much as for amending & strengthening the laws. Yet the public have been gradually excluded from challenging corruption, our privileges now being disregarded near obsolete. Neutalized",
