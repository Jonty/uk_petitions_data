        "additional_details": "Recent research indicates that levying full VAT rates on meat and dairy products and zero on fruit and vegetables, could improve dietary health, reduce environmental impacts, and boost government revenues. We believe eating less meat and dairy as a result of VAT reform would reduce cases of diet-related diseases such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes, and may cut greenhouse gas emissions.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to end financial support, such as grants, for meat and dairy producers to encourage farmers to produce plants rather than meat and dairy. We also want the Government to add VAT to all their meat and dairy products to encourage healthier and more compassionate dietary choices.",
