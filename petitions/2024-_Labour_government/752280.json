        "action": "Raise tax thresholds with inflation to protect incomes and support growth",
        "additional_details": "Since 2010, almost everyone in the UK has become poorer in real terms as prices have risen faster than wages and frozen tax thresholds have dragged millions into higher bands. People work harder yet take home less, leaving families struggling and the economy weakening. This hidden tax rise reduces spending, hurts businesses and increases reliance on benefits. Indexing thresholds to inflation would restore fairness, improve living standards and support real, sustainable growth.",
        "background": "Require all income tax thresholds, including the personal allowance, higher-rate bands and the \u00a3100k taper limit, to rise automatically each year in line with inflation. End the current freeze on tax bands and ensure the system keeps pace with the real cost of living.",
