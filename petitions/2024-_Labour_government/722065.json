        "additional_details": "Providing bereavement leave recognises the significant impact of pregnancy loss and promotes better mental health and well-being for those affected. It also sends a compassionate message that the UK government understands the importance of allowing parents time to grieve and recover after such a heartbreaking experience. A loss before 24 weeks is no less painful than a later loss and the emotional, physical and mental toll it takes on parents must be acknowledged.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to introduce two weeks of paid bereavement leave for mothers and partners who experience pregnancy loss before 24 weeks.",
