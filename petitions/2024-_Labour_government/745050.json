        "additional_details": "We ask the Government and Parliament to stop plans to extend ILR from 5 to 10 years for Skilled Worker visa holders already in the UK. Our visas promised settlement after 5 years. We have paid National Insurance and taxes, without taking a penny in benefits. Changing rules now is unfair, breaks trust, and harms families. We urge you to protect the 5-year ILR route for those who came in good faith under existing rules.",
        "background": "We applied for Skilled Worker visas with the promise of ILR after 5 years. Changing this to 10 years for those already in the UK breaks that promise, disrupts families, and undermines trust. Keep the 5-year ILR route for existing visa holders.",
