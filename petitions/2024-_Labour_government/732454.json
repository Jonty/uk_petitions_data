        "action": "Make MPs live on a middle-class income while serving in office.",
        "additional_details": "We propose that MPs receive only a median UK income while in office, with no access to personal savings or luxury assets. Second homes, excessive expenses, and luxury travel would be restricted. A post-term bonus or pension would be awarded based on service quality, assessed independently. This reform would promote fairness, empathy, and rebuild public trust by ensuring MPs live under the same conditions as those they represent.",
        "background": "We want legislation requiring MPs to live solely on a standard middle-class income during their time in office. No access to personal savings or luxury perks. This would create fairer, more empathetic, and accountable governance.",
