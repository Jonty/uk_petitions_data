        "additional_details": "Classic TV comedies are part of our cultural history and reflect the language and attitudes of their time. Constantly editing them to meet changing rules risks erasing social context and misrepresenting the past. \r\nA \u2018classic comedy\u2019 exemption would protect these shows, allowing them to be broadcast largely uncut with appropriate warnings. This would preserve their historical value while giving audiences the context to understand them.",
        "background": "Require Ofcom to exempt TV comedies over 40 years old from strict language rules. Like classic cars, they reflect their time and have cultural value. Broadcasters should be able to air them largely uncut, with context warnings, not edits based on shifting standards.",
