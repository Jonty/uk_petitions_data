        "additional_details": "Update UK child cruelty laws to include emotional and psychological abuse. Currently, victims are left unprotected unless physical harm can be proven. The law must recognise emotional abuse as equally serious, ensuring justice for survivors of non-physical cruelty. The government should provide clear training and guidance for police, CPS, and social workers so every child is protected. No child should grow up believing their pain doesn\u2019t matter simply because it can\u2019t be seen.",
        "background": "Current UK child cruelty laws do not adequately protect children from emotional and psychological abuse. The law should be updated to recognise and prosecute non-physical forms of abuse that cause lasting harm.",
