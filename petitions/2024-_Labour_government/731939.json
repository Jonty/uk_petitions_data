        "additional_details": "Some recent research, for example from MIT, Forbes, and other institutions indicates the significant impact energy consumption by data centres can have on our climate.\r\n \r\nData centres can use a huge amount of energy and water daily. The associated emissions may contain large amounts of pollutants which have been reported to contribute to cancer and other serious health issues. Some communities in different parts of the world are forced to use plastic bottles of water to bathe or may find waste residue in their \u201cclean\u201d water supply, in part because of pollutants.\r\n \r\nWe think we need to set a global example of excellence and keep our Net Zero promise.",
        "background": "We think as a country that has put much emphasis on ensuring our air and water is kept clean and accessible for the future of our children, it's imperative that the Government requires a halt in construction of all new data centres until more self-sustaining, eco-friendly, safe solutions are found.",
