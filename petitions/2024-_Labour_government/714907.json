        "additional_details": "We call on the UK Government to repeal Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 and replace it with breed-neutral, evidence-based policies focusing on responsible ownership. BSL unfairly targets dogs based on appearance, not behaviour, and has proven ineffective in reducing attacks. Resources should be used to tackle neglect, poor training, and irresponsible ownership. Introduce education and behavioural assessments to improve safety and fairness. Scrap BSL now.",
        "background": "We want the UK Government to repeal Breed Specific Legislation across the UK and replace it with fairer, more compassionate evidence based policies that focus on education and promoting responsible dog ownership rather than just the outward appearance and measurements of a dog.",
