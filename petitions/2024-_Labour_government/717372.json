        "additional_details": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves previously identified economic growth, employment and house building as her highest priorities. The reopened railway would do exactly that. A youngster living in Colne wanting to go to Leeds University, or for a job in Skipton, has exactly the same need for a fast, frequent train service as a kid in Ealing or Woking.\r\nSELRAP costed works at \u00a3298mn. A considerable sum, yet still pales in comparison to the HS2 reaching \u00a366bn JUST to Birmingham. The value for money is clear.",
        "background": "For over 20 years locals have campaigned for the reopening of the Colne-Skipton line. A vital link between Lancashire and its Yorkshire neighbor. Yet time and again we face empty promises.\r\nIts time words were finally put into action and investment made in the north!",
