But being a recovering addict, I always found a way to join sites by a change in name, spelling, mixing around words in my address, different emails etc from the ones I registered with the self-exclusion site. The worst of my gambling was 2023 and I self-excluded in 2020 for 5 years. I think this should never have been allowed to happen and the rules should be changed to strengthen ID verification.",
