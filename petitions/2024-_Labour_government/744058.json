It could encourage a healthier standard of living, reduce reliance on GPs and hospitals, and protect the freedom to socialize independently of work, letting people focus on living and choosing how to spend their time, lowering incentives for crime and drug involvement. Jobcentre Plus buildings could be repurposed for housing, gyms, or community services.",
