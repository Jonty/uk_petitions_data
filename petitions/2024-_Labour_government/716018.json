Does this government care for those within the villages surrounding the airport?

Our government must support its constituents and if a third runway is to agreed upon, the villages must not be forced to go!",

That means that many properties and other buildings will be subjected to CPOs (compulsory purchase orders) in areas such as Sipson, Harmondsworth, Harlington and Stanwell Moor. We find this abhorrent as people have their homes and lives here.",
