        "additional_details": "Pavement parking is a direct threat to public safety. It forces vulnerable pedestrians\u2014children, the elderly, wheelchair users, and parents with pushchairs\u2014into the road and into the path of moving traffic. This selfish act turns our pavements into a dangerous obstacle course. The current slow enforcement process fails to protect people. We need rapid, escalating fines and penalty points to create a real deterrent, stop this dangerous practice, and make our pavements safe spaces for everyone.",
        "background": "Legislate to mandate local traffic authorities to enforce endorsable fines for pavement parking within 24 hours of the offence, including when based on public photographic evidence. Fines should start at \u00a3100, escalate daily for ongoing offences, and rise annually with the Consumer Prices Index.",
