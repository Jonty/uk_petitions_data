        "additional_details": "Cats are beloved family members, and we think it is unjust that drivers can hit a cat without any obligation to report it. Like dogs, we think cats deserve the same protections under the law. We think adding cats to Section 170 of the Road Traffic Act would promote accountability and encourage more cautious driving in areas where cats roam. We believe this change could lead to greater road safety, reducing reckless driving and showing that the welfare of all pets, including cats, truly matters.",
