        "action": "Legalise the possession and use of pepper spray in self-defence.",
        "additional_details": "Life in modern Britain is increasingly unsafe. More or less every week we see yet another attack. \r\n\r\nThe ban on pepper spray is an outrage to our freedoms at the best of times, but particularly under such crime-ridden conditions. It leaves the vulnerable, particularly women and the elderly, without any practical means of defending themselves.\r\n\r\nIf the authorities fail or refuse to protect us, we must be allowed to protect ourselves.",
        "background": "We demand the legalisation of the possession and use of pepper spray for self-defence, together with strict penalties for those who abuse this right to make unprovoked attacks themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is unjust to criminalise the law-abiding for taking reasonable steps to survive a possible attack.",
