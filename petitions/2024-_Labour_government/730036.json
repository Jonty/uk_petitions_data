        "additional_details": "Women\u2019s health is always pushed to the back burner within healthcare, this is a threat to women\u2019s health. Early intervention is key for cervical cancer, and reducing screening puts women\u2019s lives at risk. The amount of cellular changes that could occur with no presenting symptoms in 5 years is astounding, and without more regular screening, morality among patients with cervical cancer will undoubtably increase. Evidence shows that early intervention leads to increased chances of survival.",
        "background": "The NHS has just released information that routine cervical smear tests will be done every 5 years rather than every 3 years. This will undoubtably lead to an increased amount of women being diagnosed too late and increased death rates for cervical cancer.",
