        "additional_details": "The Cancer Act 1939 bans advertising any cancer treatment, even those backed by credible research. This silences innovation, blocks patient access to information, & prevents doctors from discussing holistic or repurposed therapies. It also denies patients the \u201cRight to Try\u201d \u2014 restricting access to repurposed drugs, herbal & naturopathic remedies that may offer hope when conventional options fail. We call for reform to protect choice, enable safe innovation, & bring the Act into the 21st century.",
