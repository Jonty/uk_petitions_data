        "additional_details": "The Government has recently announced plans to abolish Essex County Council in favour of Unitary Authorities.\r\n\r\nUnder these proposals, Basildon Borough Council will merge with Thurrock Council. The boundaries of Basildon do not properly serve the needs of its residents.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the areas of Basildon located North of the A127 should join the proposed Mid-Essex Authority. This will allow residents on both sides of the A127 to have a Council that better reflects their needs.",
        "background": "We call upon the Secretary of State to do all they can to support the aim of removing Billericay, Wickford and villages north of the A127 from Basildon Borough Council, so that they might be better served elsewhere.\u00a0",
