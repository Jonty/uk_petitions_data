        "additional_details": "Special Guardians step up when a child cannot live with their parents. They provide love, stability, and a permanent home \u2014 often keeping children out of the care system and saving the state thousands each year. But support for Special Guardians is currently a postcode lottery. Some councils offer help, while many provide nothing at all. This leaves families struggling and children facing unequal life chances depending on where they live. We are asking the Government to ensure fair, standardised support for all Special Guardians, so that every child has the stability they deserve, no matter their postcode.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to provide dedicated funding to councils so that financial support for Special Guardians is consistent across the UK and aligned with fostering allowances.",
