        "additional_details": "The Acts, passed without public consent, no longer reflect modern needs. Unequal devolution leaves England without a parliament, while Scotland seeks independence. Voiding the Acts would restore sovereignty, enabling both nations to govern independently. We urge a public debate and action to restore English and Scottish laws, prioritizing people\u2019s will over an archaic union. The current system is not working, we need self determination.",
