        "action": "Allow law abiding citizens to carry regulated, non lethal self defence items",
        "additional_details": "Following the horrific knife attack aboard the LNER train on Saturday 1st November 2025, it is clear that ordinary people can find themselves defenceless in the face of violence.\r\nCurrent UK law prohibits carrying any item intended for self defence. Citizens may only use objects that \u2018come to hand\u2019 during an attack, leaving them unprepared and vulnerable.\r\nMany European countries, allow regulated possession of non lethal self defence tools such as pepper spray or taser.",
        "background": "We want the Government to review and update self defence laws to allow law abiding citizens to carry non lethal self defence items, such as pepper spray or personal taser with incapacitant features, under strict regulation. This would help people feel safer and better protected in public spaces.",
