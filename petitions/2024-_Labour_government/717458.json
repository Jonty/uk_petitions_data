        "additional_details": "Some pensioners are disadvantaged by having to pay more because they are home much of the day and we feel they are penalised for being tied to electric only heating systems.\r\n\r\nMany retired people spend most of their time at home cooking, cleaning, watching tv, enjoying hobbies etc and, unless they do all this during the night, they are disadvantaged financially because their electric storage heaters consume their energy during the night at a cheaper rate. We think the daytime rate is unfairly higher than the norm and this is grossly unfair on people with limited incomes. We think the daytime rate should be reduced to the same as the standard daytime rate for fairness.",
