        "additional_details": "Victims of child rape suffer lifelong trauma, yet offenders often serve only part of their sentence before release. Keeping them in prison long-term also costs taxpayers millions. We believe these funds should go to victim support, child protection, and prevention. The death penalty would deliver justice, deter such crimes, and ensure offenders can never harm another child again.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to reintroduce the death penalty for those convicted of raping a child. Life imprisonment is the current maximum sentence, but we believe the severity of this crime warrants the ultimate penalty to deter offenders and protect children.",
