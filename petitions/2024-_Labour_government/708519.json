        "additional_details": "The narrative is to 'escape' abuse but the reality is, many find that if they have a child with a perpetrator, they never can. I feel children are not safe in their care. Children have been killed. Women have been killed. I feel abusers continue to abuse their victims through court and by using the one thing that matters to them most, their children.",
        "background": "We want the Government to automatically remove parental responsibility from convicted perpetrators of domestic violence to ensure the safety of children and victims of domestic violence. I think this would mean children and victims can live freely, not in fear of continually being dragged to court.",
