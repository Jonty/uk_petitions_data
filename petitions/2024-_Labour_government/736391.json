        "additional_details": "The Sustainable development goal is allegedly geared towards health and wellbeing with community resources supporting envirronmental goals. Allotments have a miniscule affect on climate in comparison with large agriculture. Allotments are a lifeline both socially, physically and mentally with thousands waiting for allotment plots we want action to protect all allotment land at an affordable price. This is our land not the councils to dispose of at a whim.",
        "background": "We want the government to halt all and any plans to force the closure and selling of vital allotment sites which councils are legally required to provide. Ensure allotment fees are based on community incomes and not removed under the sustainable development goals.",
