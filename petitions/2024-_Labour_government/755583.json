        "additional_details": "I have been to multiple hospitals across the North East of England, and a consistent issue is finding parking. The vast majority of the parking at the hospitals is often dedicated to staff, meaning patients can be showing up 30-40 minutes early to find a parking space and still being late to appointments. On top of this, patients can then be competing over parking spaces resulting in increased risk of driving mistakes in the car parks, increased likelihood of illegal parking (blocking ambulance routes).",
