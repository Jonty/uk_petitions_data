        "action": "Improve Access to Affordable, Safe Medical Cannabis for UK Patients",
        "additional_details": "Personal or collective cultivation would provide patients with steady, affordable access to medical cannabis, reducing stock shortages, quality issues, and high costs.Many cannot afford current prescription costs, depriving them of essential, life-changing medical relief.\r\n\r\nIn countries like Malta, Luxembourg, and Canada, patients can legally grow a small number of cannabis plants. A similar 'grow your own' scheme in the UK would grant patients more choice, autonomy, and critical financial relief",
        "background": "Approximately 63,000 patients in the UK rely on medical cannabis, with an average monthly cost of \u00a3272. We urge the government to allow patients to cultivate medical cannabis for personal use under a regulated framework, providing affordable, safe access and mitigating many issues we patients face.",
