        "action": "Allow children from the age of 15 to drive to and from school",
        "additional_details": "Allowing 15-year-olds to drive to and from school promotes responsibility and independence. This age is a crucial time for developing life skills, and driving helps teens learn time management and self-discipline. It also eases logistical challenges for families, reducing the burden on parents who often juggle work and transportation duties. Additionally, more teens driving can alleviate traffic congestion around schools, creating safer environments. Empowering young people to drive fosters a culture of responsible driving, preparing them for adulthood while enhancing community dynamics.",
        "background": "Allow children to independently transport themselfs to their place of study and back from the age of 15 to enable a sense of independence earlier within their lifespan.",
