        "action": "Petition to Legalize Pepper Spray for Licensed and Approved Females in the UK",
        "additional_details": "We urge the Government to legalize pepper spray for self-defense by females aged 18 and over, subject to a strict licensing process, due to rising sexual assaults and strained public services.\r\n\r\nWe are facing a surge in sexual violence, with women disproportionately affected. Overstretched police forces struggle to ensure public safety, leaving many women feeling vulnerable. Pepper spray, a non-lethal self-defense tool, is banned under Section 5(1)(b) of the Firearms Act 1968.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to:\r\n\r\nAmend the Firearms Act 1968 to permit licensed females to carry pepper spray. Introduce a regulatory framework, including mandatory training, background checks, and renewable licenses, to ensure responsible use.",
