        "additional_details": "The recent tragic train attack has exposed serious gaps in public safety across our rail network. Every day, millions of people travel through train stations with no bag checks or visible security screening. \r\n\r\nPublic transport should not mean public vulnerability.\r\nPassengers and staff deserve to feel safe.\r\n\r\nWe urge the UK Government and rail authorities to act now before another tragedy occurs. Sign this petition if you believe safety should come before convenience.",
        "background": "We are calling on the Department for Transport and Network Rail to urgently introduce airport-style security at major train stations across the UK. This could include:\r\n\t\u2022\tMetal detectors and bag scanners at station entrances\r\n\t\u2022\tVisible security presence and random screening at smaller stations",
