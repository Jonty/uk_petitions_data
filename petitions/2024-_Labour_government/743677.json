        "additional_details": "We think too many people face spiralling fines simply because letters are sent to old addresses after they move. Renters, students, and families in unstable housing can be hit hardest, punished not for avoiding payment but for missing post. We feel that in a digital age, relying solely on paper letters is outdated and unfair. We already do taxes, banking, and healthcare online \u2014 we think debt enforcement should be no different. Digital communication could help protect vulnerable people and stop avoidable debt traps.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to urgently make digital communication (email, text, online portals) mandatory for all debt collection and enforcement letters, with post as a backup. This could help ensure people aren\u2019t unfairly penalised for missing letters sent to old addresses.",
