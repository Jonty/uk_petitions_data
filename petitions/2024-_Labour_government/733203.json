        "additional_details": "Wealth inequality hasn\u2019t been this severe since the 1980s. Just 50 families hold more wealth than half the UK, while workers face the highest tax burden since WWII. Patriotic millionaires support a 2% tax on assets over \u00a310m, which could raise \u00a324bn and protect vital services from further cuts.",
        "background": "A 2% tax on assets over \u00a310m could raise \u00a324bn, helping plug fiscal black holes identified by Rachel Reeves. Reducing the need for future public service or benefit cuts, further tax increases, and would help the current economic climate when 50% of the wealth in the UK is held by 50* families.",
