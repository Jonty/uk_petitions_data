We call for an independent review into fair, transparent pay metrics that reflect genuine service and accountability. If performance matters everywhere else\u2014why not in Parliament? Reform would reward effort, deter complacency, and reconnect politics with the values and standards voters rightly expect\u00a0and\u00a0deserve.",
