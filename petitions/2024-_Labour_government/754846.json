Why are we always putting others first above our own local needs? This could be a very dangerous move, as these flats are on the seafront where many families visit every year. A lot of these people are unvetted, and could pose great risk to the local community. We have seen this time and time again, and it is still continuing every day.",

These flats are intended for asylum seekers whose asylum claims are being processed. This means they could be in these flats for years, whilst our locals continue to struggle.",
