        "additional_details": "The Government is proposing to increase the qualifying period for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) from five to ten years. This has caused concern among migrants who came to the UK in good faith, relying on rules that promised settlement after five years. Many left stable lives abroad, believing this path would lead to security. Applying this change retrospectively would breach the principle of legitimate expectation and impose significant financial strain. \r\n.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to confirm unequivocally that the proposed increase in the ILR qualifying period will not be applied to those already in the UK on a five-year route to settlement.",
