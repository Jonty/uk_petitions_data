We are concerned that as a result, vulnerable people are left with overgrown or painful nails, or forced to wait weeks for NHS podiatry appointments that may not be clinically necessary. This can lead to unnecessary discomfort and strain on NHS services.\r\n \r\nWe believe the government should require nail care to be part of personal care, not a clinical task \u2014 and that providers should be supported to carry this out safely with appropriate training and risk assessment.",
