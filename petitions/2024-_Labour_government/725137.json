        "additional_details": "Every year, countless kittens and cats are abandoned, suffering neglect and cruelty. We think the current penalties are not enough to deter.\r\n\r\nBy introducing random home microchip checks, we think this could hold owners accountable, ensure pets are registered, and prevent abandonment.\r\n\r\nWe also call for harsher penalties to better protect animals and ensure that those who abandon pets face serious consequences. With these measures, we think we can reduce animal suffering and promote responsible pet ownership in the UK.",
