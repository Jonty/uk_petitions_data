        "action": "Provide urgent, fair, and proportionate UK support for Sri Lanka disaster relief",
        "additional_details": "Sri Lanka faces catastrophic floods and landslides amid an economic crisis. Tens of thousands are displaced, urgently needing food, water, medical care, and shelter. Current UK aid (\u00a31M) is far below what other disasters received. Fair, substantial support is vital to rebuild lives, homes, schools, hospitals, and essential infrastructure. The UK has a moral duty to act, given historic ties, Commonwealth solidarity, and the UK Sri Lankan community deeply connected to their homeland",
        "background": "Increase emergency aid to \u00a340\u201350M, create a multi-year Sri Lanka Reconstruction & Resilience Fund, invest in rebuilding homes, schools, hospitals, bridges, and essential infrastructure, and ensure UK support is fair, proportionate, and urgently delivered to match the scale of floods and landslides",
