        "action": "Reform local planning processes for fairness, efficiency, and accountability",
        "additional_details": "Planning delays, poor communication and excessive costs erode public trust and harm communities. Homeowners face unnecessary demands for costly reports, indefinite waiting and limited accountability from underresourced planning teams. Reform will ensure planning serves its purpose: enabling timely and fair decisions that benefit residents, businesses and communities. Streamlined processes and improved engagement will make planning more efficient, accessible, and supportive of local needs.",
        "background": "Enforce timelines to ensure adherence to statutory decision periods, improve communication for transparency, reduce costs by eliminating unnecessary reports and require councils to consult residents and stakeholders to address inefficiencies, simplify processes, and better align with community needs",
