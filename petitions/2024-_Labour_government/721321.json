        "additional_details": "This approach undermines the fundamental principle of equality before the law and perpetuates a system where some individuals are treated more leniently based on their ethnicity or background rather than the severity of their offense. I urge you to abolish these guidelines and work towards a fair and impartial justice system where all individuals are held to the same standards, regardless of their background or ethnicity,and where sentencing based solely on the nature and severity of the crime",
        "background": "we cannot allow a  two-tier justice system and sentencing guidelines that unfairly discriminate against anyone.  I strongly object to the guidelines that state ethnic and faith minority groups are less likely to receive custodial sentences, creating a disparate and unjust application of the law.",
