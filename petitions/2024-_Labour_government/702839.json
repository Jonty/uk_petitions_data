        "additional_details": "I believe that it\u2019s a very fair thing to allow. Some 16 year olds are very well educated when it comes to certain topics in politics and some are even educated on politics in other countries not just the United Kingdom. If a 16 year old has the legal right of consent then they should have the right to vote because consent is an even bigger right. A lot of 16 year olds even express their views of social media platforms and even debate their parents on political issues.",
        "background": "I want there to be a vote or debate in parliament about this idea. This is due to the fact that some 16 year olds are heavily invested in the politics of this country. Those 16 year olds who aren\u2019t probably just wouldn\u2019t vote.",
