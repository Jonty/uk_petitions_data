        "action": "Make English Literature GCSEs open-book",
        "additional_details": "The government should make English Literature GCSEs open book because it encourages deeper analysis rather than memorising quotes. It reduces stress, supports students with weaker memories, and reflects real-life skills where people refer to texts. Open book exams also create a fairer system and allow teachers to focus on understanding and interpretation, not just revision. This would make the subject more accessible and meaningful for all students.",
        "background": "English Literature GCSEs are meant to give children the analytical skills they need for the future. The current predictable structure of exam questions and exams being closed-book means students just learn useful quotations for the sake of it and their accompanying explanations, making it nullified.",
