        "additional_details": "Some trusts are reportedly planning to cut a large amount of posts. Recruitment freezes and stricter visa rules can make it extremely hard for skilled migrant workers to find new jobs, which could risk the loss of essential NHS staff and the disruption of vital services. Many have paid thousands in visa fees and served through COVID-19 but may face losing their livelihoods and visas.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to launch a review into protections for NHS Skilled Worker visa holders who have made significant contributions. We are concerned many face losing jobs and visas due to NHS cuts. Protections and allowing redeployment without extra visa fees could help retain vital staff.",
