        "action": "Allow women and young girls to be able to carry pepper spray.",
        "additional_details": "It is very rare that a woman or girl is able to fight off an attacker using just their strength alone. We have to take care of our women and children and I feel that making pepper spray legal is only going to benefit the victims. We have to give them a fighting chance to stop this happening. Currently women and girls are afraid every time they have to leave their homes, day or night. This is the bare minimum that could be done to help stop so many attacks happening.",
        "background": "With the rise of violence against women and girls, I am creating this petition to let them carry pepper spray if they choose to do so. Right now there is nothing legal for us to protect ourselves if an attack was ever to arise.",
