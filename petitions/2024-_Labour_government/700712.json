        "additional_details": "Around 10% of the UK population is lactose-intolerant. So why is lactose, in our view, an easily removable ingredient, in so many medications?\r\n \r\nVeganism and vegetarianism are more popular than ever, with many of the population avoiding animal products. So why are so many medications still in animal gelatine capsules? As it stands, it can be difficult for allergy sufferers, vegetarians and vegans to find suitable medication.\r\n \r\nWe want sensible protections for allergy sufferers and animal lovers alike.",
