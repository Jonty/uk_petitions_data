The person must have an inevitably progressive illness, disease or medical condition that cannot be reversed by treatment, and must also be expected to die within 6 months.\r\n\r\nSubsection (2) of the Clause makes it clear that a person is not to be regarded as terminally ill by reason of them being mentally ill or having a disability.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about this in the Bill's Explanatory Notes, available here: https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3774/publications\r\n\r\nIf you'd like changes to be made to the Bill, you could start a petition about that. Or if you'd like changes to the support for disabled people more generally, you could start a petition setting out what action you'd like the Government or Parliament to take. \r\n"
