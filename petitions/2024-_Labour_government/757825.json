        "additional_details": "Children age 14-16 are undertaking GCSEs and there are many useful resources, especially on YouTube that assist in learning. Also, many teenagers use social media as an online space to make friends and interact with a community. People in Y10/11 have taken lessons and courses in social media safety in school and there is an element of trust in them to be safe. A 13 year old is far less mature and unaware of the risks of certain things online. Finally, all voting on this aren't affected at all.",
        "background": "The government in all likelihood is going to introduce rigid social media restrictions, and it should be a more rigid ban on u13 instead of u16.",
