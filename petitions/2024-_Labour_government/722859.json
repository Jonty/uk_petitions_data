        "additional_details": "We believe requiring more notice is a simple way social care providers and charities can be better supported without costing the government. We think local authorities need more time to do their calculations so in requiring local authorities to provide more notice, the government should also give local authorities more time to determine their funding rates.\r\nWe call on the Government to require Local Authorities to provide at least a month\u2019s notice of changes to funding rates for social care providers and charities.",
        "background": "Every year social care providers and charities wait for news of the change to funding rates set by Local Authorities. Sometimes they don\u2019t hear till after the new financial year has started, which makes it impossible to follow governance processes with Trustees or to budget properly.",
