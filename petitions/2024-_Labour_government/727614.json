        "additional_details": "Changing the rules now breaks trust, disrupts lives, and may discourage skilled migration. Overseas sponsored workers are really worried about future of their kids as well. We request the UK Government to reconsider this policy and restore the original 5-year ILR route for sponsored overseas workers\u2014especially those who served during the COVID-19 crisis\u2014with compassion, fairness, and integrity",
        "background": "The new rule extending ILR eligibility from 5 to 10 years for overseas sponsored workers is unfair. Thousands, including NHS Nurses ,care workers, engineers, and IT professionals, served the UK during COVID-19, risking their lives",
