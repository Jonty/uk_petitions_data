        "additional_details": "Applying new 10\u201315 year settlement rules to people already part-way through the 5-year Skilled Worker pathway is unfair and destabilising. Migrants relied on clear Home Office rules when planning their lives and families. Changing requirements mid-route undermines trust, creates hardship and harms the UK\u2019s reputation. Transitional protection is essential for fairness and legal certainty.",
        "background": "Ensure Skilled Worker visa holders already in the UK can complete their promised 5-year ILR pathway under the current rules, with no retroactive extensions or recalculations to their qualifying period when new settlement rules take effect.",
