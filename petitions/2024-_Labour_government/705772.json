        "additional_details": "We think anyone who harms an animal should never be trusted with one again.\r\n \r\nWe think there is no reason to believe that a person who has shown a capacity for cruelty will change, especially without proper rehabilitation. We believe a lifetime ban could ensure that once an individual is convicted of animal abuse, they will never again have the power to inflict harm on another animal under their ownership. Animal ownership is a privilege, not a right, and cruelty shouldn't be tolerated.",
        "background": "The government should impose a lifetime ban on animal ownership for anyone who causes deliberate suffering to animals. Under current laws, courts can impose bans but these may be short-term, allowing offenders to own animals again after a short period.",
