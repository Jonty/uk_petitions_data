        "action": "Review contrail mitigation strategies in light of jet fuel chemistry changes",
        "additional_details": "Recent studies show that modern jet fuel additives lower the humidity threshold for contrail-induced clouds to form, leading to more persistent and widespread contrails. This alters local weather, sunlight, and climate. We urge the Government to review current mitigation strategies and update aviation policies to reflect these changes in fuel chemistry. Implementing these low-cost mitigation measures could significantly reduce contrail-induced cloud cover and its impact on weather and climate.",
        "background": "We ask the UK Government to review current scientific understanding of contrail mitigation, such as small altitude or route changes. Modern jet fuel additives may increase contrail growth, spreading clouds and affecting weather patterns. We urge the Government to update aviation policy accordingly.",
