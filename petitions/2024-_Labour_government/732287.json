        "action": "Implement contrail mitigation strategies reflecting current jet fuel chemistry",
        "additional_details": "Fuel additives have lowered the humidity threshold needed for contrail-induced cirrus to form and persist. This enhances their spread, alters local weather patterns and daily sunlight, and reduces the effectiveness of older mitigation strategies. We ask the Government to implement existing contrail avoidance methods without delay to eliminate unnecessary cloud cover, and update aviation policy to reflect current jet fuel chemistry so that mitigation measures remain effective and targeted.",
        "background": "Current scientific understanding of contrail mitigation\u2014such as small changes in altitude or route\u2014should be applied immediately as low-cost, effective adjustments. Modern jet fuel additives increase contrail growth and spread. We urge the Government to implement mitigation policies to reflect this.",
