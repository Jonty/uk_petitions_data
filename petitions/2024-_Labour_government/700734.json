        "additional_details": "The UK has some of the highest regional inequality of any European country (IPPR). Productivity, income, and health are significantly lower in North England. Numerous studies highlight that these widening regional inequalities are hindering the growth and prosperity of the country as a whole whilst stifling social mobility and opportunity. I think the HS2 project was a step in the right direction and is crucial for addressing Britain's infrastructure gap and revitalising the Northern economy.",
        "background": "I want the Government to extend the HS2 project from London to Manchester and Leeds. The Government should also improve rail infrastructure in the North. I believe this is vital to boost connectivity, bridge rural-urban divides, reduce poverty, and future-proof the rail network.",
