        "additional_details": "I believe it will save the NHS. People are waiting longer to see a GP/specialist or have diagnostic tests, resulting in delayed treatment. This results in them being more likely to have to access emergency care because they have become acutely unwell. An easily treated illness or disease can become more complex due to late diagnosis and treatment resulting in higher costs to the NHS. I believe that more people accessing private healthcare will reduce the pressure on the NHS waiting times, A+E admissions and inpatient ward stay.",
