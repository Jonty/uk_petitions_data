        "additional_details": "Heating a home in freezing weather is unavoidable, especially for vulnerable groups. The \u00a325 payment for 7 sub-zero days ignores shorter cold snaps, even though daily heating costs are the same. We think a daily payment system ensures fairer support aligned with modern living costs, protecting those at risk. We believe rising energy prices make this vital to prevent financial hardship, and that this practical change reflects today's challenges and ensures payments match real needs, supporting people more effectively.",
        "background": "We think the Cold Weather Payment should reflect daily costs, not just a weekly threshold. Heating a home costs the same per day regardless of whether the cold snap lasts 3 days or 7. Introduce daily payments for each day the temperature stays below 0\u00b0C to align support with actual expenses.",
