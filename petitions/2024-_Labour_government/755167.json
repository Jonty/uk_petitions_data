        "additional_details": "Protecting children is paramount; however, these proposed amendments would represent a serious and disproportionate intrusion into the privacy and human rights of the British public. They would introduce routine digital surveillance without any evidence of effectiveness. The technology likely to be deployed has a record of being ineffective and could prove expensive. This funding would be better directed towards children\u2019s services, which have a long and proven history of protecting children.",
        "background": "Suggested amendments to the Children\u2019s Wellbeing and Schools Bill, made by Lord Nash, Baroness Cass, and Baroness Benjamin, would require nearly every smartphone or tablet to surveil its owner by continuously scanning the device. This proposal must be rejected.",
