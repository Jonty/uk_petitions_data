        "additional_details": "Allowance Too Low\r\nRising costs mean people pay tax without real income gains. \u00a320,000 is more realistic.\r\n\r\nHelping Workers\r\nA higher allowance boosts take-home pay and eases household pressure.\r\n\r\nEconomic Boost\r\nMore retained earnings encourage work and support businesses.\r\n\r\nStopping Stealth Taxes\r\nFiscal drag pushes people into higher bands unfairly; raising the allowance fixes this.\r\n\r\nSupporting Recovery\r\nMore disposable income fuels spending and economic recovery.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, respectfully call upon the UK Gov. to increase the personal tax-free allowance from the current \u00a312,570 to \u00a320,000. This change is urgently needed to reflect the real cost of living in the United Kingdom, support working households, and stimulate economic stability and growth.",
