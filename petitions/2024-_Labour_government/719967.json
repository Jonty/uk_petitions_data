        "additional_details": "The fine for not having a ticket before boarding is \u00a3100 plus the fee of the ticket and for many people this is a lot of money especially if the passengers are struggling to buy beforehand in time plus several other reasons which may have hindered them and therefore being able to buy on the train is of importance and should not require an immediate fine since we are in the times of a living cost crisis.",
        "background": "Passengers should be allowed to purchase tickets on the train and not required to only be able to purchase them before they board. The reason being is that passengers may be running late and may need to board quickly and therefore may not get the chance to go to the ticket office in time.",
