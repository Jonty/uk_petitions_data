        "additional_details": "Dementia is not only a condition of old age. Many people are diagnosed in their 50s with young-onset dementias such as Frontotemporal Dementia. My mum has been diagnosed with both Frontotemporal Dementia and Young-Onset Dementia, yet we were told support is limited because she is not pension age. Age-based rules leave families without vital help. We call for dementia support to be available from age 50, based on need, not age. Dementia does not wait, families should not be forced to.",
        "background": "We call on policymakers and health authorities to increase available support for people with young-onset dementia as currently some support is only available to people of state pension age. Additional resource should also be made available to improve chances of early diagnosis.",
