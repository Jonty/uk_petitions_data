        "action": "Justice for Innocent Lives: Bring Back the Death Penalty for Child Killers",
        "additional_details": "The UK government must protect its most vulnerable\u2014our children. The intentional murder of a child is the most heinous crime, yet current laws fail to deliver true justice. Life sentences with parole mean killers could walk free. The death penalty ensures they face the ultimate consequence, deterring future crimes and protecting society. With strict safeguards to prevent wrongful convictions, this law would restore public confidence in justice.",
        "background": "1. Reintroduce the death penalty for adults convicted of the premeditated murder of a child.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Establish strict legal safeguards to ensure fair trials and prevent wrongful convictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Implement a judicial review process to oversee such cases with the highest level of scrutiny.",
