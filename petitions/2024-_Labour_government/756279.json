For services like energy and water, estimated increases can often be overcalculated, causing financial hardship.\r\n \r\nWe believe this proposal ensures:\r\nProtection: Customers are shielded from large or erroneous withdrawals.\r\nTransparency: Organisations must provide clear calculations for any increase.\r\nControl: Customers must approve increases or cancel before funds leave their account.",

If a withdrawal attempt exceeds this cap, the bank must automatically block payment and notify the customer. Payment should only proceed when authorised and a new cap is set.",
