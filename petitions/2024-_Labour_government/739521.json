        "additional_details": "This includes schools, transport, GP services, shops & flood defences. We believe the current target risks a legacy of unsold private homes and destroyed communities. Without mandated affordable housing, we are concerned families remain unhoused. Rushing development without upfront infrastructure investment could overwhelm public services, erode village character and destroy the environment. We believe this approach fails on its own terms and sacrifices communities for a flawed numerical goal.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to review their target to build 1.5 million homes. We want the review to focus on affordable houses and social housing over private sales.  We urge the Government to mandate that developments can only be approved with guaranteed investment for essential infrastructure.",
