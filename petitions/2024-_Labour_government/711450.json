        "additional_details": "25% of Council Tax that we pay is used to finance the pension pot of council employees, a luxury that most of us in the real World could never afford. It is time for a fairer system of paying for day to day services instead of paying for ever growing bloated councils, many of which cannot manage properly the vast amounts of money they obtain from Council Tax.",
        "background": "Council tax has become a burdensome financial drain on householders. The basic responsibilities of councils such as refuse collection, libraries & education, have been cut back by councils to a large degree, whilst expensive employees, together with their pensions have become obvious beneficiaries.",
