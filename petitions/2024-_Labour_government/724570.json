        "action": "Fair Insurance for Young Drivers: Stop the Skyrocketing Costs",
        "additional_details": "The government should implement stricter regulations to prevent insurance companies from charging extortionate prices. They can introduce price caps, ensure transparency in premium setting, and enforce competitive practices to reduce monopolistic behavior. Additionally, promoting the use of independent oversight bodies can ensure fair pricing. Offering subsidies or tax incentives to encourage competition and innovation in the insurance sector would help drive down costs for consumers.",
        "background": "Introduce regulation to cap insurance premiums for young drivers, ensuring they are not disproportionately high compared to other age groups.\r\nEncourage competition within the insurance market, enabling more affordable and accessible options for young drivers.",
