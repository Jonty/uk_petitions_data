        "additional_details": "Keeping kids locked up at school during the day and letting out just in time for dusk during the winter is ruining the heath of the nation. Both physically and mentally, it's enough that we need to deal with the extremes of the seasons but also being faced with reduced daylight when it matters the most is absolute madness. It's something that could be easily trialied by first reducing the period from November to February and review the benefits.",
        "background": "Stop changing the clocks every six months, we need to keep to British summertime. It's going to promote productivity and greater well-being. Free the people from the tyranny of the dark nights and embrace a brighter future.",
