        "additional_details": "Too often, non-smokers \u2014 including children, asthmatics, and people with respiratory issues \u2014 are forced to walk behind or through clouds of smoke or vapour in public. This is unpleasant, unhealthy, and unfair. People should be able to move freely outdoors without inhaling second-hand smoke or vapour. Having smokers and vapers stay in one place until they finish would make shared spaces cleaner, healthier, and more considerate for everyone.",
        "background": "The government should introduce a law prohibiting smoking/vaping while people are in transit,such as walking on pavements, crossing roads, or moving through public areas. Smokers and vapers should only be allowed to use designated stationary areas, away from others, before continuing their journey.",
