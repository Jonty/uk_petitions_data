        "additional_details": "Lots of teenagers use social media to escape the stresses of growing up, to talk to their friends online, to just have fun. It's a way of decompressing, and taking that away can put teenagers in a worse place mentally. Ask any teenager and they will likely protest this ban.",
        "background": "Banning social media for teenagers feels unecessary. By this point they are decently mature and preventing teenagers from accessing social media will likely cause an increase of violence amongst teenagers due to boredom. Banning it for under 13's keeps kids safe, whilst giving teens freedom.",
