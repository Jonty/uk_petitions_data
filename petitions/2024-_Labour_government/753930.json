        "additional_details": "This branding will represent the UK\u2019s rail sector across multiple platforms and be the face that passengers see. It should be timeless and well considered to ensure it respects the heritage of our railways and leads us into the future. British Rail created the iconic Double Arrows in 1965 which has served as the de-facto identifier of the railway for 60 yrs. The proposed branding does not carry the same weight, and is weak on a world stage where Britain has continually set the standard for rail.",
        "background": "Department for Transport have developed a new brand for the launch of Great British Railways which should be reconsidered to ensure it is fit for a long term future.",
