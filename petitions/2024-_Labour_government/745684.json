        "additional_details": "The UK health and care system relies heavily on international doctors and nurses who dedicate their skills and years of service to supporting patients across the country. We ask the Government to keep the required residence period for ILR for doctors and nurses for 5 years and exempt from 10-year rule. This would recognise their vital contribution to the National Health Service, help retain skilled healthcare professionals, and strengthen workforce stability in the UK\u2019s health sector.",
        "background": "Healthcare professionals have been on the frontline during national crises & ensuring the continued functioning of vital services. We think extending ILR timeline undermines their contributions. Instead keep the ILR requirement and reduce the workforce shortage and avoid uncertainty on their future.",
