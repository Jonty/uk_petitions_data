We believe schools should encourage children from early years to understand personal and physical boundaries. We believe it makes no sense to force them to undress in a public setting, and we feel communal changing creates an unsafe environment for pupils. Body insecurities, menstruation and physical comparisons may be highlighted, and peer judgment/bullying may result from children being exposed in this way.\r\n",
