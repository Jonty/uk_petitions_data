Employment agencies may outsource the HR/payroll administration for those on their books to umbrella companies. \r\n\r\nIt is common practice for umbrella companies to deduct the costs of accounting for employer NICs, as part of the fee they charge the individual who is providing their services this way.\r\n\r\nYou may wish to start a new petition calling for a ban on umbrella companies from deducting the costs of accounting for accounting employers NICs, if that is what you would like."
