        "additional_details": "Modern LGVs are equipped with advanced safety features, which we think can make them as safe as cars at higher speeds. We believe raising limits could reduce risky overtaking, improve logistics efficiency, cut costs for businesses, particularly in rural areas, and align the UK with European standards. We believe the change could ease congestion, lower emissions from smoother traffic flow, and better reflect today\u2019s roads and vehicle capabilities.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to raise Light Goods Vehicle (LGV) speed limits (up to 4t GVW) to match cars. We think 50mph (single carriage) and 60mph (dual carriageway) limits are outdated ignoring modern vehicle safety, efficiency, and today\u2019s economic needs potentially unfairly penalising our workforce.",
