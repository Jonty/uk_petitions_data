It will reduce ambulance delays during handover and will create hospitals to have the capacity to cope that they so desperately need. The 60 new hospitals would restore our fantastic NHS, create thousands and thousands of jobs, and allow us to develop our health service with patient care and innovation at the heart of everything.",
