        "action": "Remove VPN restrictions and device-level surveillance from the Schools Bill.",
        "additional_details": "Restricting VPNs requires universal ID checks. This destroys privacy and autonomy and creates a loop where surveillance triggers workarounds, which are met with further control. \"software\" is a backdoor that scans messages and can result in false positives, also breaking encryption. This threatens whistleblowers & journalists who are fundamental to democracy. Who decides exemptions? It is authoritarian to treat all citizens as suspects. Police should use targeted stings, not mass surveillance.",
        "background": "Amend the Children\u2019s Wellbeing & Schools Bill to remove any clause on digital guidance that threatens encryption/privacy. Remove VPN ban for minors and all mandates for \"tamper-proof system software\" on personal devices. Prohibit any age-verification requirements for VPN and communication services.",
