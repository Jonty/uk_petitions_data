        "action": "Introduce requirement for all dogs to wear humane basket muzzle in public spaces",
        "additional_details": "No other type of muzzle can be used that does not fit these requirements.\r\n\r\nWe think this measure could reduce the increasing number of dog attacks on people, other animals, and livestock. It could be a proactive public safety step that respects both animal welfare and the concerns of the wider community.\r\n \r\nMany responsible owners already take precautions, but unpredictable behaviour can occur even in well-trained dogs. Requiring muzzles in public places could help protect the public and reassure those who feel unsafe around dogs.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to require that all dogs wear humane, breathable muzzles whenever they are outside their owner's private property. The basket muzzles must allow dogs to open their mouths, pant, breathe easily and drink water or have treats, while also preventing biting incidents.",
