        "additional_details": "Fireworks cause severe distress and harm to animals each year. Pets, livestock and wildlife can experience panic, injury, escape attempts and long-term trauma due to loud explosions.\r\n\r\nPrivate fireworks are used unpredictably over extended periods, making it difficult to protect animals. Restricting fireworks to licensed public displays would reduce suffering while allowing celebrations. The Netherlands has approved a nationwide ban on private consumer fireworks to protect animals.",
        "background": "Introduce legislation to ban the sale and use of private consumer fireworks, restricting fireworks to licensed public displays, in order to protect pets, livestock and wildlife from distress, injury and long-term harm.",
