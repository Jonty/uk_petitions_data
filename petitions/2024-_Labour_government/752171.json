        "action": "Save billions; modernise the state; move civil servants from DB to DC pensions",
        "additional_details": "Why should hardworking workers - pay for \"golden pensions\" for bureaucrats, which they can't afford themselves. This switch could save billions annually. Moreover the UK could save hundreds of billions in reduced pension liabilities over the long term. A shift to DC schemes would help modernise the civil service and make its employment terms more in line with a dynamic labour market. Live within our means, make civil servants pensions more affordable and create a fairer society.",
        "background": "The majority of hardworking private sector workers - who create real wealth for our country - are on \"new\" DC pensions, which pay out less and mean their income is uncertain. In contrast, many civil servants benefit from golden \"old\" costly taxpayer funded DB pensions, which guarantee their income.",
