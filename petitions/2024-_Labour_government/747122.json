        "action": "Regulate or Ban Excessively Bright LED Headlights",
        "additional_details": "The widespread use of high-intensity LED headlights has created major safety concerns for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. Despite being designed to provide better visibility for drivers, their blinding glare often causes the opposite effect for other roads users. Older drivers or those with light sensitivity are much more affected making nighttime driving unsafe. Sudden exposure to intense light can cause migraines or eye strain which increases the risk of collisions and driving anxiety.",
        "background": "The government should enforce safe limits on LED headlight brightness and hold manufacturers accountable. There are too many cars with blinding lights that make night driving stressful and unsafe. Proper enforcement and standards will protect everyone and make roads safer for all users.",
