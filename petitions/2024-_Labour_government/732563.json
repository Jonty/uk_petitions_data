I do not use my left side to drive and so don't need to grip anything with my left hand. I have read about lots of other people being refused the mobility side because they can drive and plan journeys etc. I feel we are being denied our independence for which PIP was intended.",

Some disabled people who drive are being refused this lifeline due to being able to \"plan and carry out a journey\" etc. I think this is extremely unfair and needs to be changed.",
