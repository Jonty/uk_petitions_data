        "additional_details": "Despite its current state, I believe Chippy's Quarry has the potential to be a beautiful, restored area with a dual purpose: providing a fishing spot for residents and a haven for local children.\r\nIn recent years, crime rates in Leeds have edged upwards, attributed to the lack of safe, engaging spaces where people can spend their free time. Observing the younger boys around the pond, it's clear that if this space could be cleaned up, it would offer them an appealing alternative to street life.",
        "background": "Growing up in Leeds, I've spent countless afternoons with friends by the local pond affectionately known as Chippy's Quarry. However, fishing there has become increasingly difficult due to the poor water conditions and the unsightly litter lining the banks.",
