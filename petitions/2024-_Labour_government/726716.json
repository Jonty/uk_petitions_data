        "additional_details": "North Somerset\u2019s policy is discriminatory, outdated, and inconsistent, excluding standard PHVs from bus lanes while allowing others. This causes confusion, increases congestion and emissions, undermines trust, and may breach the Equality Act. It disadvantages disabled passengers, fragments transport, and ignores best practice seen in neighbouring councils. Immediate reform is essential for fairness and safety.",
        "background": "Require all councils including North Somerset to allow all licensed private hire vehicles (PHVs), not just taxis or minibuses, access to bus lanes to ensure fairness, reduce congestion, and align with neighbouring authorities\u2019 policies.",
