        "additional_details": "Trial by jury is a cornerstone of our justice system, giving ordinary people the power to decide the fate of the accused. Juries maintain fairness, democracy, and public trust, keeping the legal system grounded in the community rather than concentrated in the hands of a few.\r\n\r\nRemoving jury trials would erode democracy, place strain on judges, and increase criminal appeals (causing further backlog). Juries are not a problem to be fixed; they are the very safeguard of a fair legal system.",
