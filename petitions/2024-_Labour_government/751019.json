        "additional_details": "Many university students with parents that earn \u201cenough\u201d for them to receive minimum student finance are left struggling during their studies. This can be down to many factors which Student Finance England may not consider. We believe thresholds are unrealistic and unrepresentative of the current economy. Many parents may also have specific situations where they cannot support their child financially - especially other dependents and their own expenses. We feel it also does not account for single parent households.",
        "background": "We believe student finance maintenance loans are no longer reflective of household incomes. Two parents on the average UK salary means their child may be entitled to minimum. We believe this needs to be reconsidered immediately.",
