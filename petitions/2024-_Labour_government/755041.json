        "additional_details": "The Rural Fuel Duty Relief Scheme is intended to address higher fuel costs in remote, rural and island areas where prices are consistently higher and alternatives to private transport are limited. Despite appearing to meet published eligibility criteria, we feel areas such as Argyll remain excluded. Fuel is essential for residents, local businesses and the delivery of services. \r\n \r\nWe are concerned that possible exclusion may place additional pressure on households and local economies. The Government should review eligibility to ensure the scheme operates fairly and consistently.",
        "background": "At a time of ongoing cost-of-living pressures, we want the Government to urgently review eligibility for the Rural Fuel Duty Relief Scheme to ensure fairness, consistency and equal treatment for remote, rural and island communities, including those in Argyll.",
