        "action": "Improve and enforce national architectural standards",
        "additional_details": "We\u2019re asking the Government to enforce higher architectural standards for new builds: proper design codes, quality materials, and homes that are built to last, but also reflect, emphasise and redefine the local identity. \r\n\r\nWe need review boards with real power to enforce these changes. Architects, not just property planners. People can\u2019t be expected to care about towns built like no one cared to begin with. This should be a basic right. Not something we need to pay extra for.",
        "background": "Too many new builds in the UK are designed for profit, not for people. They go up fast, look identical, and start falling apart within ten years. Made with poor materials and fixtures, and no reflection of local identity. Meanwhile, homes with a dash of character become overpriced and unattainable.",
