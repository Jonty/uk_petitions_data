        "additional_details": "In our view independent tackle shops are more than retail spaces; they are community hubs that preserve fishing traditions, support conservation, and contribute to mental health and well-being. We think these shops face rising costs and intense competition, risking closure. Without government intervention, we think a vital part of UK heritage may disappear. We think targeted grants could ensure these shops' survival, helping them adapt digitally and continue their contribution to communities and environmental education.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to make \u00a325,000 digital transformation and viability grants available. We believe this support would protect the heritage and sustainability of these shops as vital cultural and community assets.",
