        "additional_details": "While I appreciate the complexities surrounding these closures, I urge the government to take a firm stance in collaboration with local councils. It is vital that new venues are secured before any stadium closures occur. The loss of these venues not only threatens the future of Speedway but also the livelihoods of those involved in this sport and its dedicated fans.\r\nI urge the government to push for for new venues to be located in the UK.",
        "background": "My deep concern regarding the ongoing closures of sporting stadiums, particularly as they relate to motorcycle sports in the UK. The recent decisions have had a significant impact on our local communities and sports, especially Speedway, which has been a cherished tradition for over 100 years.",
