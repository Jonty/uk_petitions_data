        "additional_details": "Changing the route for family visas from 5 to 10 years is a drastic and unfeeling step. Many families, like myself have worked since coming to the UK, paying taxes and striving to integrate and make this country our own. The 10 year route is not just heart wrenching, it is a slap in the face. I have been working my fingers and soul to the core for this day- May 2026- to be free from worry, uncertainty and the financial burden that comes with renewing a visa and now that is being torn away",
        "background": "I want the government to reconsider and keep the current 5 year route for family visas",
