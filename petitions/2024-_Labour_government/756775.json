        "additional_details": "We believe the Islamic Republic of Iran has neglected the needs and will of its people for 47 years. Now, people are in the streets demonstrating against the regime and calling for a transition to democracy. Rather than listening and accepting their demand, the regime has decided to cut internet access, phone lines, and other means of communication with the outside world, and are reported to be suppressing protesters with live ammunition, which have killed thousands.",
        "background": "We urge Parliament to severe all diplomatic ties with Iran, withdraw recognition of the regime as the legitimate government of Iran, and expel any Iranian diplomats from the UK, in the wake of recent events and reported human rights abuses that have been committed there.",
