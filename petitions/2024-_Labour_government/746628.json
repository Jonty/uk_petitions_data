        "additional_details": "If families were allocated funding at a similar level to agencies, we could offer carers a competitive wage that would significantly improve recruitment and retention, while still being more cost-effective than paying a care company. This approach could ease the burden on families and raise carers\u2019 pay, making them feel more valued and recognised for the vital work they do. We believe it could also prevent parent burnout, and support employment and reducing reliance on costly crisis services.",
        "background": "The current level of funding provided to families through direct payments makes it extremely difficult to recruit staff and deliver essential care, often pushing families into crisis. At present, families can only offer less than half of what can be paid to a care agency.",
