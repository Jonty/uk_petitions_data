        "additional_details": "We urge the UK Government to reform the CMS by:\r\n\r\nIntroducing a minimum child maintenance payment for all, regardless of employment;\r\n\r\nTying support to cost of living and regional baselines, not just declared income;\r\n\r\nAuditing lifestyle and assets, not only pay slips;\r\n\r\nStopping temporary overnight care claims as a loophole;\r\n\r\nEnforcing stricter verification and consequences for manipulation.",
        "background": "I want the government to reform the Child Maintenance Service by closing loopholes that let parents avoid paying. Support should reflect the real cost of raising a child, not just income. There must be minimum contributions, proper enforcement, and asset checks.",
