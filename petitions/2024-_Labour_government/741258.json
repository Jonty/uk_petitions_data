        "action": "STOP PYLONS require underground route via M1/A50, protect countryside & security",
        "additional_details": "Overhead pylons (an outdated technology first used in 1928) would permanently scar countryside, destroy wildlife habitats, damage heritage sites, and harm tourism and rural communities. They are also more vulnerable to accidents, sabotage, or extreme weather, posing national security risks. Under-grounding the line along M1 & A50 corridors minimises environmental and visual harm, protects communities, safeguards landscapes, and ensures energy is delivered securely and sustainably.",
        "background": "Require National Grid to deliver the Chesterfield to Willington upgrade via underground cables, and route the line alongside existing infrastructure of the M1 & A50. This avoids new pylons cutting through and destroying countryside& communities and reduces risks to national infrastructure security.",
