        "action": "Require Mandatory Salary Transparency on All Job Advertisements",
        "additional_details": "Mandatory salary transparency promotes fairness, efficiency, and trust in recruitment. It allows jobseekers to make informed decisions, reduces pay disparities, compels employers to uphold equitable pay practices, and saves time for applicants and employers. It ensures that businesses set fair wages instead of placing the onus on individuals. Nations with such laws have stronger workplace equality. The UK can lead by instituting legal transparency and enabling a fairer job market.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to legislate mandatory salary disclosure in all job advertisements, requiring clear pay details for every role. This fosters transparency, fairness, and ensures jobseekers can make informed decisions, free from misleading terms such as \"competitive salary\".",
