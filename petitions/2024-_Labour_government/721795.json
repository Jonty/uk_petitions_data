        "additional_details": "The Family Justice System is out dated and broken. Children are being dragged through long winded procedures unnecessarily, they are made to talk to various different organisations who often misinterpret situations and send reports into the court that are factually incorrect. Muddying the water for the children and parents involved, causing more harm than good. For too long now these children have not been heard properly and are being failed by this system. It is time to put the children first.",
        "background": "Allow children from the age of 10 years and up to speak within a controlled Court Environment directly to the Judge. Children should be able to speak directly to the person who is making decisions about their future. Such decisions can have a negative impact on children and the law needs to change.",
