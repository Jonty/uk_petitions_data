        "additional_details": "We feel that such decisions could have a negative impact on children and the law needs to change.\r\n \r\nIn our view, the Family Justice System is out dated and broken and children are being dragged through long winded procedures unnecessarily. Currently, they talk to various different organisations who could misinterpret situations and send reports into the court that are inaccurate. We think this muddies the water for the children and parents involved and may cause more harm than good. For too long now these children have not been heard properly and we think they are being failed by this system. It is time to put the children first.",

We believe that children should be able to speak directly to the person who is making decisions about their future. ",
