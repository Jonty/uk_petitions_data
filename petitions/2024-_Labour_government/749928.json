        "additional_details": "UK car insurance unfairly targets young and new drivers with extremely high premiums, even when they drive safe vehicles and have clean records. In many European countries, insurance follows the car instead of the driver, making it simpler and more affordable. The UK should review this model to create a fairer system for all motorists.",
        "background": "Reform the UK car insurance system so that insurance follows the car, not the driver. This would make cover simpler, fairer, and more affordable, especially for young and responsible drivers who currently face extremely high premiums despite safe driving habits.",
