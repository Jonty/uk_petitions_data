I loved staying here but leaving all the families and loved ones behind and can't live with them is really a tough time. We are already been prohibited from bringing dependents which was already very hard for most of us , every day start with that little hope that we gonna be live together after some time , 5 years is already a very long time , please don't make too hard by making it 10 . we should have the opportunity.",
