        "additional_details": "Therapeutic work is currently only VAT-exempt if delivered by a doctor or clinical psychologist. The majority of therapeutic professionals however, including psychotherapists, hypnotherapists and therapeutic coaches are not doctors and must charge clients VAT.\r\n\r\nMental health services are life-saving for those dealing with a variety of issues, ranging from depression, anxiety, trauma to addiction.\r\n\r\nIn the UK, treatment for mental illness is not currently given the same regard as physical illness.",
        "background": "Mental healthcare is not a luxury. Currently, mental healthcare is taxed, unnecessarily burdening those in need. Unlike VAT-free physical healthcare, mental healthcare is subject to 20% value-added tax (VAT).\r\n\r\nWe would like the government to make all therapeutic services exempt from VAT.",
