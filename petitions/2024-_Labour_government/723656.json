States shall provide effective mechanisms for\r\nprevention of, and redress for:\r\n(a) Any action which has the aim or effect of\r\ndepriving them of their integrity as distinct\r\npeoples, or of their cultural values or ethnic\r\nidentities;\r\n(d) Any form of forced assimilation or integration;\r\nThe UK is a Christian country and we are suppressed by two tier justice.",
        "background": "A huge proportion of the UK population believe that the country is being ethnically cleansed, through mass immigration. In the 2021 census 16% of the population was born abroad. 2024 saw 1.2 Million people immigrate to the UK. This is unsustainable and incompatible with British values.",
