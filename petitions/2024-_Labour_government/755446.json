        "action": "Expand statutory SEN allowance entitlement to Teaching Assistants in SEN schools",
        "additional_details": "TAs in SEN settings often take on duties beyond those of mainstream support staff, such as: managing complex behaviour plans, delivering therapy or intervention programmes, monitoring medical or sensory needs, and using specialist equipment or communication systems (e.g., PECS, Makaton, AAC).\r\n\r\nWe believe these responsibilities mirror tasks of higher-paid specialist roles, yet we feel TAs are not compensated accordingly. SEN TAs should receive the statutory SEN allowance because we believe the role demands specialist knowledge that significantly exceed standard classroom duties.",
        "background": "Many SEN teaching assistants (TAs) handle complex behavioural, medical, and communication needs. We feel current pay doesn\u2019t reflect the intensity or value of the work. Low pay contributes to recruitment & retention challenges. We believe TAs should receive SEN allowances.",
