        "additional_details": "Many people feel let down by Keir Starmer\u2019s government. Rising costs, cuts to services, and broken promises have left trust in leadership low. This petition calls on MPs to listen and support a vote of no confidence so we can have honest leadership that truly represents the public\u2019s needs and gives the country a fresh start.",
        "background": "We want MPs to put forward and support a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Public trust is falling fast, and many people feel unheard. We need leadership that listens and acts. If the PM can\u2019t carry the country, it\u2019s time to let the people decide.",
