        "additional_details": "Removing trial by jury would threaten democracy if a government were to come into power that arrests people for simply disagreeing with them. Trial by jury protects the human right of right to a fair trial by introducing unbiased members of the public.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the reason of the \"backlog\" can be solved by more funding to courts/judges, and should at least have an end date if that were the reason, which is not present in the reforms, which is especially dangerous for the reason above.",
        "background": "The Justice Secretary announced that trial by jury would be scrapped for crimes with sentences less than 3 years. We want the government to not do this, since it is a threat to democracy and to human rights.",
