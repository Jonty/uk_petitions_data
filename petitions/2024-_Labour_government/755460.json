        "additional_details": "Government needs to represent the people of this Country \r\n\r\nPublic trust is eroding as Government imposes policies that increasingly place a strain on UK households. \r\n\r\nRising costs, taxation, declining services, Council Tax burdens, illegal immigration severely highlight the disconnect. Anger reflects a serious breakdown in confidence and widespread scale of dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nParliament MUST address the total erosion of trust and re-engage with those they are in power to serve - the electorate.",
        "background": "Across the UK, millions of people feel ignored and disconnected from the Government. Trust is at historic lows as decisions affecting everyday life are made without engagement or transparency. Parliament must debate this widespread dissatisfaction and put into place measures to restore public trust.",
