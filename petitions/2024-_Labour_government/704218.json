        "additional_details": "Children can often be left out of the process despite being old enough, with a right to be heard & can be affected when used without penalty by a parent to cause pain, misery & abuse for the other.\r\n\r\nI think it's a more equal starting point & automatic 50/50 shared care could help remove the ability to use children this way & the upset & conflict it causes.\r\n\r\nI think the system is full of disparity, inconsistent, unfair, archaic, sexist, often favouring mothers when both parents are equally good.",
        "background": "Parents should get 50/50 shared care of their children without lengthy court hearings if no safeguarding issues & both families can provide care. Currently I feel parents have to fight for more or any care, using time & money better spent on the children, negatively affecting the parent & children.",
