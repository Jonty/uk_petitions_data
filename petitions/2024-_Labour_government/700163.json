        "additional_details": "As stated current laws aren't working, so we want a ban on members of the public being able to purchase fireworks without the need for any i.d, or a licence etc.\r\n\r\nEach year towards the end of summer the amount of time that bonfire night seems to go on for seems to extend into weeks and weeks, having an effect on ex military with PTSD, disabled people ( especially those with stress and nervous induced conditions), as well as pets, horses, farm animals and wildlife.",
        "background": "The law is unworkable fireworks are used as weapons and as part of anti social behaviour. Current laws presume that you are close to where the fireworks are being released and can give the relevant authorities all the information required and that is just not possible, so nothing is done.",
