        "additional_details": "We feel there are many instances where motorists disrespect and trespass private lands for parking, despite it is usually very clearly marked. Sadly, this is currently considered as a civil dispute and residents are unable to seek protection from the authorities. We think this has to be changed urgently as the current rules leave people in distress, particularly when this becomes a regular problem. We think it is not feasible to take each motorist to court for a dispute, and is unaffordable.",
        "background": "Introduce legislation to expand the rights of UK property owners against people who park on their property, such as the right to get the trespassers' vehicle towed or clamped and fined. We think regular trespassers should pay an increased penalty or endorsement on their driver's license.",
