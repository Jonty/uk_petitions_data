        "additional_details": "Annual insurance costs have become increasingly unaffordable, especially for young drivers and small business owners who rely on their vehicles for work. I have found that quotes of \u00a34,000 or more are not uncommon for modest cars, and, for vans/business, insurance quotes can by around \u00a311,000.  A government-backed option would introduce fair pricing, encourage competition, and make essential transport accessible again.",
