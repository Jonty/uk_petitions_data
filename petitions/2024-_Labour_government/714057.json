        "action": "Amend The Animal Welfare Act 2006 To Give Cats Better Protections On Roads",
        "additional_details": "We want section 4 of the Animal Welfare Act to include a direct amendment that holds drivers accountable if they fail to stop and report a collision involving a cat on the basis they left a cat to unnecessarily suffer. Asking a bit of decency is legislated for by asking drivers be made responsible for seeking help for an injured cat is a perfectly reasonable & simple ask. Legislation currently leans toward encouraging unnecessary suffering by allowing drivers to flee the scene. It must change.",
        "background": "It is perfectly legal in the UK to hit a cat when driving and leave them scared, alone and in pain roadside. Cats are important, loved, valued family members and, as it does for dogs, the law should reflect this. We want legislation that recognises cats as a species worth helping if injured on roads",
