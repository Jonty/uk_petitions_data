        "additional_details": "Parent and child spaces are often at a premium and are so placed to enable safer transit across a car park and/or to provide additional space to accommodate getting children etc in and out of the vehicle. These spaces are rarely free owing to inconsiderate parking by motorists who are not eligible to park in those spaces. There is no policing or policy around this issue at the moment and as a parent I am seeing more and more people abusing these spaces.",
        "background": "More policy/policing/fining of people who park in spaces for parent and child when they are not eligible. Disabled people have allocated spaces for access requirements and the government should protect the right of parents for similar accommodation of needs. Maybe a badge system like the blue badge",
