        "additional_details": "We believe Max and Keira\u2019s Law was a vital first step, but that family vetoes still block hundreds of donations every year, even when someone clearly chose to donate. Consent rates have fallen since 2020 and the waiting list is now the highest in a decade, with thousands waiting and hundreds dying whilst waiting for a donation each year. We should respect donor wishes, ease pressure on grieving families, and give patients the second chance they deserve.",
