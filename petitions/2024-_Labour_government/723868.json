        "action": "Stop Labour\u2019s cuts to disability benefits\u2014protect the lives of disabled people.",
        "additional_details": "The UN and Equality and Human Rights Commission have already condemned the UK's failure to protect disabled people\u2019s rights. These proposed cuts will exacerbate an already dire situation, violating the UK's human rights obligations. Disabled people rely on this support for survival and independence, and it is crucial that the government protects them rather than stripping away essential services in the name of cost-cutting.",
        "background": "We demand that the Labour government immediately abandon its proposed cuts to disability benefits. These cuts will disproportionately affect disabled people by pushing them further into poverty, compromising their access to essential services, and worsening mental and physical health outcomes.",
