        "additional_details": "Since 2017, new car prices have increased dramatically. The \u00a340,000 threshold now unfairly penalizes families buying essential vehicles, especially hybrids and EVs which the government promotes. Raising the threshold to \u00a355,000 will incentivize cleaner vehicle adoption, reflect market realities, and create a fairer tax system, supporting the transition to greener transportation.",
