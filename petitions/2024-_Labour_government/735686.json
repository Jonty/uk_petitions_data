Chickens improve mental health, teach children responsibility, and bring joy to everyday life. Council tenants are often unfairly denied this due to outdated blanket bans. We\u2019re asking for fair, responsible access\u2014so all tenants can enjoy the personal and environmental benefits of keeping a few pet hens, just like homeowners can.",
        "background": "Give all UK council tenants the right to keep up to 4 pet hens (no cockerels). Chickens reduce food waste, provide fresh eggs, improve wellbeing, and support sustainable living. Responsible keeping should be a right, not a privilege. Stop unfair tenancy bans.",
