        "additional_details": "All illegal immigrants when stopped by the police should be sent to the camps, to be assessed to see if they are genuine asylum seekers or just financial migrants, criminals or wanted in other countries, these camps would create jobs for British people, not cost as much as the hotels and most importantly make British people feel safer and in control of the British borders, those who fail the asylum tests can then be removed more easily as they are all in one place not hiding all over Britain",
        "background": "Build secure camps with accommodation, canteen, laundry, doctors surgery, etc, to ensure the illegal immigrants and asylum seekers are comfortable and safe, then the authorities can confirm identity and asylum requests, also stopping illegal working, reducing crime and make British people feel safe.",
