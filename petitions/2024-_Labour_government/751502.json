        "action": "Allow Class 3 mobility scooters to carry a disabled person and a passenger",
        "additional_details": "Mobility scooters are legally defined as single-seat vehicles, so two-seat scooters cannot be used on pavements or roads. Many disabled people cannot travel safely alone and may need a passenger for support, guidance, communication, medical needs or because they are parents who must bring their child. Allowing one passenger on Class 3 scooters (up to 8mph) would increase safety, independence and accessibility while keeping all existing speed and safety limits.",
        "background": "Change the law on mobility scooters (\u201cinvalid carriages\u201d) so a Class 3 scooter may legally carry one disabled person plus one passenger at up to 8mph.\r\n\r\nCurrent regulations only allow a single seat and make it unlawful to use a second seat on public roads or pavements, even at low speed.",
