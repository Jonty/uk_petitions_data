        "additional_details": "This could benefit thousands of people as no one gets the right amount of education about these topics as they should in school. In school you learn about Pythagoras Theorem which you won\u2019t need to use later on in life but these key topics are very relevant when you are an adult, making it important you get the best understanding of it now to help you with houses and more.",
        "background": "Life economics would be a subject in school, 1 hour a week, learning about real life scenarios you need to be aware of. For example you need to have some understanding of taxes, pensions, mortgages and how to spend or save your money.",
