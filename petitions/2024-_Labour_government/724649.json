        "additional_details": "Govt.& the Home Office should change their policy to uphold fairness, legal consistency & the UK\u2019s reputation.  The Home Office is failing to apply its own rules consistently, while universities delay reporting awards issues beyond students\u2019 control. This results in injustice, uncertainty, and loss of future opportunities for graduates. It undermines confidence in the UK\u2019s immigration system and deters future international students.It affects UK Int'l market not suitable for naitonal interest.",
        "background": "Govt. Must ensure consistent Graduate visa decisions by formally recognising lawful variation from FLR under Section 3C. Discretion should apply where delays are beyond students\u2019 control, especially late award reporting. Clear guidance is needed for caseworkers & universities must report awards.",
