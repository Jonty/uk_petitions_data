        "action": "Make SEN training mandatory for all teachers in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "In almost every class is a child with SEN. Not all teachers have the knowledge on how to support these children in the correct way. Mandatory training would improve understanding of autism, ADHD, dyslexia, speech and language needs, emotional/behavioural needs, and other common SEN profiles.\r\n\r\nThis would help reduce exclusions, improve learning outcomes, and support both teachers and pupils. Consistent SEN training would create fairer, more inclusive education across the UK.",
        "background": "We want the Government to require all teachers to complete basic Special Educational Needs (SEN) training, both during initial teacher training and as part of ongoing professional development.",
