In setting price controls Ofwat's aim is to allow for a return on capital that is no more than necessary for an efficiently run company to get the funding they need, and that ensures customers only pay for a reasonable level of financing costs.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about Ofwat's price controls here:\r\nhttps://www.ofwat.gov.uk/regulated-companies/price-review/"
