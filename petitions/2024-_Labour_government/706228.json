I believe these timeframes are too broad. I think the current compensation levels are not reflective of time lost, making it difficult for someone to get their life back on track who has been wrongfully imprisoned for a long period. I also want the review to consider taxation to ensure these payments are clearly tax exempt as I believe it is only fair that compensation is not taxed. ",
