        "action": "Amend the Planning & Infrastructure Bill to ban wind farms on protected peatland",
        "additional_details": "We believe these amendments are needed to protect peatland\u2019s ecological integrity: benefiting climate, biodiversity, water quality and flood risk mitigation. We think that new energy policy statements increase safeguards for peatland, but aren't enough, and still greenlight development on shallower peat - which science warns against. There are concerns that the Sec of State may ignore potential damage to protected sites and approve 'Critical National Priority' windfarms on peatland subject to \u201ccompensation\u201d - which we believe is impossible in a near timeframe.",
        "background": "We want the government to amend its Planning & Infrastructure Bill to:\r\n1. Ban wind farms on peatland in the National Site Network and SSSIs in England, and\r\n2. Require the restoration to good conservation status of peatland\u2019s interlinked mosaic of habitats, including irreplaceable blanket bog.",
