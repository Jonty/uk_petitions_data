        "additional_details": "We think many Ukrainian refugees returned to Ukraine, for various reasons including what we feel is the woefully inadequate Homes for Ukraine accommodation or lack of support, safe in the knowledge that the UK is a safe-haven for them. They are not using taxpayer resources while outside the country, so we think should they be allowed to extend their permission to visit or move back in an emergency. In some cases, they may be relatives of children or vulnerable adults in the UK and unable even to visit and care for them.",

We think they should be able to extend their visa with the support of a sponsor regardless of whether they are residing in the UK.",
