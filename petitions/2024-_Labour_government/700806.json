        "additional_details": "Fireworks should not be available to the wider public in my opinion. They are super dangerous if in the wrong hands and can cause life changing injuries or even death, every year fireworks cause problems which then put strain on all of the emergency services. They should solely be available for controlled, safe events and only sold to groups/people/event organizers who have to obtain a special license from local councils to enable the purchase of fireworks from specialist supplies. Fireworks should no longer be available to buy from regular shops. The law needs to be changed.",
