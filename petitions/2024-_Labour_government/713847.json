There is a gang culture growing in our major cities that are carrying knives and guns to purposely commit murder. There is no deterrent for these heinous crimes because life in prison today meas a few years. If anyone plots to take or does take a life then their life should be forfeit.",
        "background": "The UK government should as soon as possible hold a referendum nationwide on whether the British public want the death penalty reinstating for the most serious of crimes. At this present time there is no deterrent that can make people think twice before breaking UK laws.",
