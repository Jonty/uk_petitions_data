        "additional_details": "Many Skilled Worker visa holders made the decision to move to the UK based on the current 5-year ILR pathway. They have contributed significantly to the UK economy, paid taxes, supported essential public services, and built lives here with families. Changing the ILR requirements retrospectively would disrupt thousands of families, including children who are settled in UK schools and communities.\r\nWe urge the Government to:\r\nRetain the 5year ILR pathway for all existing Skilled Worker visa holders.",
        "background": "We ask the UK Government not to apply the proposed extension of the Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) qualifying period from 5 years to 10 years to migrants already in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa. Any such change should apply only to new applicants from the date the policy comes into effect.",
