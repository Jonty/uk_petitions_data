        "additional_details": "Millions of people in the UK face rising costs and cuts to vital support like the Winter Fuel Payment, forcing them to choose between heating and eating. Meanwhile, MPs benefit from taxpayer-funded perks and pay rises. This is unfair and creates a disconnect. Removing these perks and halting pay rises would show solidarity with the public, restore trust, and ensure that MPs face the same financial realities as those they represent",
        "background": "We urge the Government to end unnecessary perks for MPs, including expense claims for energy bills, rent, and subsidised food and drinks. Additionally, all MP pay rises should be frozen to reflect the financial hardships faced by the public. MPs must lead by example and share the sacrifices.",

It is important to note that while in some venues the cost of providing the service exceeds the income received in sales, other venues in the Commons make a profit which contributes to reducing overall costs. The House of Commons publishes details of the cost of House of Commons catering services: https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/foi/transparency-publications/hoc-transparency-publications/catering-services/transparency-reporting-catering-services/\r\n\r\nCustomers of the House of Commons Catering Services include some of the 650 MPs but also around 14,500 other pass-holders, many of whom are staff on lower wages that work irregular hours. In addition, members of the public and non pass holding visitors to Parliament also have access to these services. The irregular hours and the unpredictability of Parliamentary business contribute to increasing the net cost of providing a catering service. To offset this many of the restaurants, dining room facilities and their staff, are used to cater for private events at times when they are not required by the House. This is one of a number of measures used to reduce costs."
