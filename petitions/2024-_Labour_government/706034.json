        "action": "Grant a free speech law that allows for freedom of speech to be protected.",
        "additional_details": "Allowing free speech allows people to have open and honest discussions. Moving away from political correctness, we should be allowed to speak our minds without having to worry about being arrested for what we think, providing it doesn't incite violence. Blasphemy, contentious or difficult topics should be allowed to be spoken about. To abolish the right of the governed to speak freely is the first step to becoming a dictatorship, and having free speech allows people to stay free and democratic.",
        "background": "We in the UK do not have a free speech law, unlike most Western countries. To be allowed to have free speech is a fundamental right in the western world. Being allowed to say what we wish, without incitement to violence or hatred, is something that should be protected. Bring in a free speech law.",
