        "additional_details": "We believe this restriction harms youth athletes and qualified coaches from Hong Kong who are trying to build a life in the UK. It may stop young people from developing in sport and force experienced coaches to abandon their profession. Hong Kong is not a major sports labour exporter, and we feel BNO migrants pose no threat to UK athletes or the UK sports job market. On the contrary, we feel they can strengthen local communities and support grassroots sports.",
