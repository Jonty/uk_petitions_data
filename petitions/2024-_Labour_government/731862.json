        "additional_details": "We believe any consequences for an MP\u2019s vote, that may mean damage to their careers, should be treated as unparliamentary conduct.\r\n \r\nWe think that without enforcement by whips, there will be more need for party leadership to build consensus by proposing legislation that is consistent with the party's declared principles and current manifesto. We believe MPs will be more empowered to vote with integrity, guided by values rather than obedience.\r\n \r\nIn our view, abolishing whips will restore the independence, dignity and accountability of MPs and will let them vote with conscience and constituents in mind, while keeping party leadership anchored to core principles.",
        "background": "We want Parliament to abolish its party whip system entirely. We think this would help MPs to feel freer to vote according to their conscience and their constituents' interests.",
