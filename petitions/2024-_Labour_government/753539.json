        "additional_details": "Trial by jury is the only mechanism by which ordinary men and women may hold authority to account. It is the voice of the people in the courtroom, ensuring that justice is not dictated solely by officials of the state, but tempered by the conscience of the community. To abolish this right is to silence that voice, to strip the citizen of their last defence against tyranny, and to betray the legacy of those who fought to secure our freedoms.",
