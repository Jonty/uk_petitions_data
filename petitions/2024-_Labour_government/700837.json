        "additional_details": "We think the \"signposting\" agreement between the government and the insurance industry is a failure. 85% of people aged 80 PLUS are NOT signposted to alternative insurers, when refused a quote. We believe many 80 plus adults are not offered competitive alternative quotes when using online search tools. We think it is discriminatory for this age group to be requested to pay more than other drivers. We believe this increases the stress, isolation and financial hardship of the elderly.",
        "background": "Parliament must review the exclusion of financial services from the age discrimination provisions of the Equality Act. We think over 70's should not routinely, based upon their age, be charged more for car insurance than any other sector of society.",
