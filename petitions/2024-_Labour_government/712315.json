        "action": "To allow Air Travel for Small Pets in the Cabin on UK Flights (under 8 kg).",
        "additional_details": "This change would align the UK with modern pet travel standards, promote animal welfare, and support pet owners who consider their pets part of their family. It would also benefit tourism and travel industries by removing barriers for travellers with pets.\r\n\r\nWe urge the UK Government and the Department for Transport to work with airlines and relevant stakeholders to introduce this much-needed policy change.",
        "background": "UK prohibits pets from traveling in the passenger cabin on commercial flights, with exceptions only for assistance animals. This restriction significantly limits pet owners\u2019 travel options and forces pets into the cargo hold, which can be a stressful and unsafe experience for many animals and owners",
