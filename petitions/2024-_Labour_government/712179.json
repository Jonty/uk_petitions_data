He would be a well deserved recipient of this honour. He never gave up on Rob and if Rob was here he would agree with the above. He is an ordinary man that just wanted to do something for his dear friend. If you asked Kevin he would probably decline the award and that I did not do it to get an award he purely done it to help his FRIEND Rob. A legend !",
