        "additional_details": "Although the notion to lower the voting age to 16 is great, it would be irresponsible to give younger people the right to vote without providing them with sufficient education and information on politics in order to help them make an informed decision on election day. Furthermore, there has been an increase in political disillusionment as well as more populist ideas amongst the youth, and this could be counteracted by giving them lessons from a young age on how politics works in the UK.",
        "background": "In order to prepare young people for the lowering of the voting age, we deem it necessary to provide compulsory classes on politics to help people make informed choices on election days, increase voter participation, and help young people understand how political systems work and affect them.",
