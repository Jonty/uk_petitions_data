If it is to be replaced it's replacement needs to hold the water company's to account.\r\n\r\nIf a water company is struggling financially it needs to be nationalised even if that means shares become worthless.\r\n\r\nNo more paying out of huge dividends to shareholders and rewarding failure\r\n\r\nNo more excessive salaries and bonuses for senior managers.  \r\n\r\nLaws need to be created to make it a criminal offence for water companies to dump raw sewage into waterways etc",
