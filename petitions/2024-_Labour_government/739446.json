        "additional_details": "We believe rental properties are essential. We are concerned there was a drop in the number of rental properties in Q1 of 2025. This supply shortage can lead to rental increases for residential properties. It was estimated that 42% of household income in London was spent on rent in 2024. We believe additional tax on Landlords will lead to the burden being passed on to the tenants. We believe it will lead to further increases in inflation and may lead to increases in homelessness.",
