UK law places limits on the total amount of time someone can work during a week and the minimum amount they can be paid an hour, but it doesn't specify how many or which days of the week they have to work. This would be a decision for employers and the employee.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for the legal maximum number of hours during a week to be reduced or a legal limit placed on the days that people can work, if this is something you would like to see happen."
