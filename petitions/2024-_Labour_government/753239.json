        "additional_details": "We are concerned by serious allegations of violence against protesters in Tanzania raise urgent human rights concerns. We believe the UK should not continue unrestricted aid without an independent investigation. Suspending non-humanitarian aid and supporting an impartial, international investigation could help establish the truth, ensure accountability, and protect democratic freedoms. We believe UK action is vital to uphold human rights, prevent further abuses, and encourage fair political participation and credible elections.",

The UK should push for accountability, support democratic and electoral reforms, and ensure opposition voices and civil society can freely participate.",
