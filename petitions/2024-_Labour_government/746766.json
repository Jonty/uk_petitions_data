        "additional_details": "A surprise wealth tax could discourage investments & entrepreneurship at a time when the UK needs private sector confidence.Individuals have already paid income tax,capital gains tax,inheritance tax,and other levies \u2014 a further one-off charge would amount to double taxation.Sudden fiscal shocks risk driving capital and business abroad,reducing tax receipts in the long term and further deficit in the budget.Transparent,consultative policy-making builds trust in government and markets alike.",
        "background": "The Government should rule out introducing any sudden or \u201cone-off\u201d wealth tax in the upcoming Budget,which measure would unfairly penalise those who have already paid tax on their income and savings,create uncertainty for investors and small business owners,undermining confidence in the UK economy.",
