When I returned home I was saddened to discover that the items I bought were originally from a retailer that I choose not to use due to their poor labour conditions. I did not notice this in the shop because the labels had been removed, and as a consumer who is trying to consider the ethics of what I buy, I believe I have the right to know where items I am buying have come from.",
