Additionally, we feel it does not address the real issues of housing shortages and the need for more affordable homes. By removing the bedroom tax, we think the government can support vulnerable citizens and promote a fairer housing system.",
        "background": "We think the government should remove the bedroom tax because we feel it places an unfair burden on families and individuals. Many people rely on housing benefits to help cover their rent and we think the bedroom tax reduces this support without considering their specific needs.",
