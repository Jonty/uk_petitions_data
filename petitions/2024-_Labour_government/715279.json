        "action": "Lower the legal driving age to 16 and a half years old for a Provisional License",
        "additional_details": "Driving is a critical life skill that facilitates independence and a sense of accountability.\r\n\r\nThis is the foundation for greater maturity. \r\n\r\nSlightly reducing the minimum driving age with a provisional could ease the journey of teenagers into adulthood, offering them a head start on mastering this vital responsibility. \r\n\r\nEarlier exposure allows young drivers to gain experience gradually, ensuring they are more capable and confident behind the wheel as they take on broader life challenges.",
        "background": "Introducing driving at the age of 16 and a half years old under strict supervision encourages safe driving and it gives more time to practice. Driving at a younger age in the UK would boost accessibility and opportunities, aligning with practices in the United States where driving young is common.",
