        "additional_details": "The Autism Act 2009 aimed to improve support and create more opportunities for autistic people. However, despite the Act's provisions, progress has been limited since its publication. Authorities have cited allocated budgets for promoting equality and diversity for autistic individuals, but there is ongoing evidence that they continue to face significant challenges in various aspects of daily life.",
        "background": "7 in 10 autistic people are unemployed This is largely due to a lack of awareness and reluctance from employers to make reasonable adjustments for autistic employees. To address this, I propose making it mandatory for all employers to undergo autism awareness training.",
