        "additional_details": "The Cycle to Work scheme costs \u00a3130m but delivers \u00a3573m in benefits, boosts productivity, supports cycling businesses, and cuts congestion and emissions. Unlike uncapped EV salary sacrifice, a cap would restrict affordable, healthy, low-carbon travel. It gets 200,000 people cycling each year. Protect and expand it to improve public health, air quality, local economies and our shift to sustainable transport.",
        "background": "The Cycle to Work scheme should be maintained in its current form and expanded to include self-employed workers, with improved access for lower earners so more people can benefit from affordable, healthy, sustainable travel.",
