The BBC has become outdated, expensive, and politically biased. It\u2019s time to scrap the licence fee and let the public decide what they watch \u2013 and what they pay for.",
        "background": "The current system forces hard-working people to pay for a service they may not use. It\u2019s time for change. We call for a fairer, voluntary system where the BBC is funded through a subscription service.",
