        "additional_details": "I believe healthcare workers deserve a fair and secure pathway to settlement because they play a vital role in supporting the NHS and caring for communities across the UK. Allowing ILR after 5 years would recognise their contribution, improve job stability, and help retain experienced staff in a system that urgently needs them.\r\nHealthcare workers face demanding conditions, long hours, and significant personal sacrifices.",
        "background": "I want the Government to allow healthcare workers to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) after completing 5 years on a Health and Care Worker Visa, with no additional requirements beyond the standard eligibility criteria. This would recognise the essential contribution of healthcare workers.",
