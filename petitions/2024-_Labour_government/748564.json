        "additional_details": "Social media platforms have become key sources of news and political discussion for millions of UK citizens. We think that when these platforms are owned or controlled by individuals or organisations based outside the UK, there may be risks to democratic processes, public safety, and national security.\r\n \r\nWe believe recent events and inflammatory public statements by high-profile platform owners highlight the need for accountability, and safeguards against any manipulation of UK public opinion and political discourse.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to commission an independent review into the influence of foreign individuals and entities with significant control over major online platforms used in the UK. The review should assess potential risks to national security, democratic integrity, and the spread of misinformation.",
