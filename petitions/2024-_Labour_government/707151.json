        "additional_details": "We must feel confident in all postal services to deliver our purchased goods without damage or being stolen. We not only pay for the item but we also pay for delivery so we deserve for packages to be delivered to hand, not our drive way or door step with zero confirmation of the home owner even being home. In the last 3 months I can talk about 5-10 items that I have purchased to be delivered that have all been left outside without knocking or leaving with a neighbour and I am just one person.",
        "background": "I would like the government to stop postal services from leaving packages outside of houses without ringing the bell of homes. So that purchased goods stop being at risk of theft or damage from rainy weather.",
