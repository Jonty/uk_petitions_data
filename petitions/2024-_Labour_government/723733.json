        "additional_details": "In the times we\u2019re living with an unstable and erratic US, an aggressive Russia and unjust China we must create stronger ties and alliances in Europe. Joining the EU would be a great way to achieve this goal. We\u2019ve tried being separate and the country has still not recovered. We have a duty to ourselves and our future to reverse this mistake.",
        "background": "The government should have another referendum to rejoin the EU. Leaving the EU was a terrible mistake economically, politically and defensively. The ties created for us and the stability it brought was so important and needs to be re established.",
