        "additional_details": "I think it is important for future generations to learn about injustices Palestinians have faced throughout history since the 1948 Nakba. By teaching this aspect of history to future generations, I believe it will hopefully stop the dehumanisation of Palestinians and Arabs/Muslims to an extent. I propose that Nakba education covers the 1947 UN partition of Palestine, Britain\u2019s role in the Israeli Palestinian conflict and how many Jews living in Arab countries moved to Israel because of the Nakba.",
        "background": "I believe the recent war in Gaza is a wake up call to the dehumanisation of Palestinians and injustices they face. I propose to make teaching about the Nakba part of the national curriculum. I believe this will help ensure this never happens again and will help Palestinians to finally have justice.",
