        "additional_details": "Many Skilled Worker visa holders moved under existing rules, investing and actively contributing to the UK economy in the hope of securing a good lifestyle for their families, whilst encouraging their children to further study to contribute to the economy. Hence, we request the Government to allow dependent children of Skilled Worker Visa holders to pay home tuition fees at UK universities.",
        "background": "We are concerned the proposed changes to ILR routes could significantly affect the hopes and dreams of many dependent children of Skilled Worker visa holders, possibly hindering their goals, postponing their degrees due to high international tuition fees and entering lower skilled jobs.",
