        "additional_details": "We call on the UK government to relocate pet entry checks to the passenger terminals, so airlines can offer in-cabin pet travel into the UK, just as they do in many other parts of the world. Now is the perfect time for this petition, as it aligns with the UK\u2019s reintroduction of the EU pet passport and supports government goals for tourism, animal welfare, and inclusive travel. This update would ease stress for pets, simplify travel for owners, and safeguard the UK\u2019s high biosecurity standards.",
        "background": "Dogs aren\u2019t allowed to arrive in the UK in-cabin, even though many airlines support it. Why? Inbound UK pet checks happen away from passenger terminals, forcing pets to travel as cargo. Yet pets can fly out in-cabin as checks happen inside passenger terminals. So pets can fly out, but not back in.",
