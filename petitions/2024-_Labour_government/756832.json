        "additional_details": "Charging interest on student loans burdens graduates with growing debt, often \u00a350k+ while many never fully repay due to income-contingent terms.\r\nWe believe that abolishing interest would make higher education truly accessible, without a lifelong financial penalty and also boost social mobility and productivity by freeing young people from debt drag. Education benefits society; taxpayers already subsidise it\u2014we want to remove this unfair tax on ambition.",
        "background": "Cancel interest charges on all student loans. We believe placing this burden on the backs of those that want to succeed in life is abhorrent and short-sighted. These charges penalise our brightest and best, the very people that contribute the most to society.",
