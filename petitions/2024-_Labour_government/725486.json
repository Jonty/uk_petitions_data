        "additional_details": "IBD is a lifelong, incurable condition needing daily medication to manage pain, prevent flare-ups, and avoid hospitalisation. Unlike some other long-term illnesses, IBD doesn\u2019t qualify for free prescriptions in England. This can create financial strain and health inequality. We believe making prescriptions free would ease pressure on patients and the NHS, ensuring those with IBD can access the treatment they need without worrying about cost.",
        "background": "We want the Government to add IBD, including Crohn\u2019s and colitis, to the list of conditions eligible for free prescriptions in England, and to fund this. People with IBD need lifelong medication. We think this change would ensure fair access to essential treatment and reduce financial pressure.",
