        "additional_details": "I\u2019m deeply concerned about the UK's move toward Digital IDs and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), and how these could threaten our privacy, freedom, and access to basic services. No one should be forced to use digital-only systems to prove who they are or to spend money. I believe we need strong legal protections to ensure cash, cards, and traditional IDs always remain available\u2014and that no digital tool is ever imposed on the public.",
