        "additional_details": "The current regulation \"Under control\" gives a false sense of security and can be interpretable. Dogs are animals that strongly respond to instincts, which can result in danger for adults, children, and other dogs. Nothing can effectively stop a dog from behaving aggresively or making others feel threatened (under control) except from a physical restraint. Dogs without leads cause unnecessary distress or injury to dog owners who have actual control over their dogs, by keeping them on leads.",
