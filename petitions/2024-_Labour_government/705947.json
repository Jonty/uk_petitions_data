        "additional_details": "We call upon lawmakers to implement stricter laws regarding hit & run incidents involving cats that will ensure drivers are held accountable if they fail to stop and report such accidents. Asking a bit of decency is legislated for by asking drivers be made responsible for seeking help for an injured cat should be a perfectly reasonable & simple ask. No more petitions, generic responses or excuses, people want action like legislation that recognises cats as a species worth helping if injured.",
        "background": "It is perfectly legal in the UK to hit a cat when driving and leave them scared, alone and in pain roadside. Cats are important, loved, valued family members and, as it does for dogs, the law should reflect this. Legislation currently leans toward encouraging unnecessary suffering, which must change",
