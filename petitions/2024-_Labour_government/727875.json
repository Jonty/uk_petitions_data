        "additional_details": "We believe rent prices in cities like Manchester, London, and Birmingham are soaring, leaving families, low-income workers, and vulnerable tenants struggling to keep up. We are concerned that without rent caps, landlords and agencies can impose unfair increases, pushing people into financial crisis or homelessness. We believe rent caps could protect tenants from exploitation and ensure that housing remains affordable and accessible in high-rent areas across the country.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to impose rent caps in major cities such as Manchester, London, and Birmingham, to stop landlords and agencies from imposing unfair hikes. We feel this can ensure affordability and penalise excessive increases, protecting vulnerable tenants from being priced out of their homes",
