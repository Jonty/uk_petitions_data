        "additional_details": "We believe law-abiding people in the UK have no legal way to carry effective self-defence tools. This proposal calls for an opt-in scheme legalising registered non-lethal items like pepper gel, stun devices, and kubotans strictly for self-defence. This policy proposes that misuse, especially against law enforcement, would lead to a permanent ban. These tools are illegal, even if used to escape an attack. We believe a national registry could record ownership and ensure full accountability.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to create a opt-in scheme for UK citizens and residents to legally register and carry non-lethal self-defence items like pepper gel or stun devices. Misuse, especially against police or legal authorities, would result in a permanent ban from the scheme.",
