        "additional_details": "The governing party is widely seen to have misled voters and abandoned key manifesto commitments. Had its true intentions been made clear during the campaign, the election result may have been markedly different. Democratic accountability now demands that the electorate be given the opportunity to respond to this breach of trust.",

This would ensure that voters have a fair and accurate basis on which to make their democratic choice",
