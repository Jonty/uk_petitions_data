Funding for men\u2019s mental health services.\r\n2. Campaigns to normalise seeking help.\r\n3. Education teaching boys it\u2019s okay to talk about emotions.\r\n4. Easier access to resources through a central platform.\r\n5. Peer mentoring to connect men with shared experiences.\r\n \r\nWe believe by acting now, we can save lives, break stigma, and build a culture where men feel supported to seek help. ",
