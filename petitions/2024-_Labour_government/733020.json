        "action": "Make it mandatory for MPs to wear badges of the organisations lobbying them",
        "additional_details": "We are very concerned about lobbying and know it is rife in politics. We believe publishing donations to MPs on the Electoral Commission website is not enough because many people are likely unaware that this resource exists, and the exact details and context around individuals and organisations lobbying MPs often requires intense research to find out who is donating to a party or individual and why that is significant. We think wearing badges of political sponsors should be made mandatory for MPs to wear to make this information more clear, and hold MPs more accountable.",
        "background": "Mandate that MPs must wear badges representing individuals or organisations who lobby them, in a similar way to athletes wearing sponsors' logos on their kit. We think MPs should be more transparent with their politics and make it easier for the public to see whose interests they represent.",
