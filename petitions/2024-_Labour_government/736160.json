        "additional_details": "Healthy foods are, on average, twice as expensive per calorie, as less healthy foods, and are increasing in price.\r\nTo afford the government's recommended healthy diet, (including eating at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables each day) the most deprived 5th of the UK would spend 43% of their disposable income on food, rising to 70% for families with children.\r\nCreating allotments as part of housing developments would encourage and help families to grow their own vegetables and to be healthy.",
        "background": "When new developments are built, there should be an allotment space  provided for people to be able to become more self-sufficient . This will be vital for those who cannot afford to eat healthily. It will also create a social space, and somewhere for children to learn where their food comes from.",
