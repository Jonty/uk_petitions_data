It also includes the recruitment and training of 450 new driving examiners.\r\n\r\nIn November 2025, the Government announced that military driving examiners will help deliver up to 6,500 more tests: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mirror-signal-manoeuvres-military-driving-examiners-mobilised-to-cut-test-backlog\r\n\r\nThe DVSA expects to achieve a seven-week waiting time for driving tests by November 2027: https://www.nao.org.uk/press-releases/watchdog-urges-dvsa-to-address-driving-test-delay-backlog-and-cut-waiting-times/\r\n\r\nIf there are additional measures you would like the Government or Parliament to take to reduce driving test waiting times, you could start a petition asking for that."
