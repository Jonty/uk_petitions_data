        "additional_details": "Care workers play a crucial role in supporting the UK\u2019s health and social care system. Many have left families behind and face emotional distress due to separation. Denying dependants for in-country applicants is unfair and affects our well-being and job performance. Allowing family reunification would boost morale, retention, and show appreciation for our hard work and dedication. We urge the Government to support care workers by amending this policy.",

Care workers have families, and separation affects their well- being. At least let those in the UK reunite with their families, acknowledging their vital contributions.",
