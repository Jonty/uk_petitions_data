        "additional_details": "All nurses, doctors, and carers form a single interconnected team, and every role is crucial to maintaining the health and wellbeing of the nation. Favouring one group over another fails to recognise how these professions depend on one another to keep services functioning. Extending the five-year ILR pathway to all professions within the sector is morally right, economically sensible, and supports continuity of care, and aligns with the principles of equality and gratitude that the UK upholds.",
        "background": "Health and social care professionals have carried the United Kingdom through its most difficult moments, and government policy should reflect the full scale of their contribution. Keep 5-Years ILR For all Healthcare visa holders, Carers, Nurses and Doctors, No One Should be excluded.",
