        "additional_details": "SCAs can be declined at a GP's discretion. However, we are concerned about reports that GPs in some areas are being advised to decline SCAs in all instances. This can lead many people to pay costs we feel are exorbitant or to abandon potentially vital medication. We think this can undermine NHS goals, and can exacerbate financial strain for those with untreated ADHD. We believe urgent intervention is needed to help protect patient health and help ensure more equitable access to care.",

We think a review could help ensure all SCAs are reviewed individually and fairly and not refused. We want better integration of privately diagnosed patients into NHS pathways, and continuity of care.",
