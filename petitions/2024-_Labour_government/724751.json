In 2011, it was estimated that over 50% of these fires are started by young people, sometimes due to curiosity or thrill-seeking. We would like this programme, which will take place in high-risk areas, to involve collaboration with fire services, schools, and youth groups to educate young people on fire safety, wildfire risks, and prevention, helping reduce fire-setting behaviours.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to fund a programme of Fire Safety Engagement Sessions to educate youth on fire safety, prevention, and wildfire risks. We believe this can reduce fire-setting behaviour, protect the environment, and build positive relationships between the youth and fire services.",
