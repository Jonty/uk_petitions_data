        "additional_details": "Many of us have employer sponsorship promises pending our Graduate Visa expiration. The 10-year rule may lead employers to reconsider, causing setbacks. We request a 5-year ILR pathway to maintain stability\r\n\r\nAs significant contributors to UK's economy, healthcare, social care, energy, and other sectors, we believe our efforts warrant consideration. Granting 5-year ILR would recognise our value and support continued growth. \r\n\r\nWe urge the government to consider this or the start date for a future date.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to reconsider the 10-year ILR rule for current Graduate Visa holders when making the switch to Skilled Worker Visa, given the initial 5-year promise when we arrived. Retrospective fairness is crucial.",
