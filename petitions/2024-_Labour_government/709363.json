        "additional_details": "UK households are struggling with soaring energy bills, yet energy companies report \u00a3457 billion in profits, exploiting the energy price cap as a target rather than a limit. Vulnerable families are forced into fuel poverty while corporations prioritize shareholder gains. Reform the price cap, enforce transparency, and cap excessive profits. Windfall taxes on these profits should fund aid for low-income households and energy efficiency programs.",
        "background": "Stop energy companies profiteering while UK households face soaring bills. Reform the price cap, cap profit margins, tax excess profits, and enforce transparency. Use windfall taxes to aid vulnerable households and promote fair pricing. Protect consumers and ensure energy fairness now",
