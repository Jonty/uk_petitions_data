        "additional_details": "In 2021, it was reported that there are 409 gambling related suicides every year in England. A 2020 study showed 37% of 11\u201316-year-olds in England and Scotland had gambled in the previous year, so I believe action should be taken to not just try and stop people who already gamble, but to stop people starting in the first place. I think it is horrible watching TV at night, as gambling adverts seem non-stop and regular, this leading to temptation to begin the habit.",
        "background": "I think that gambling is a major problem in the UK and regulation on TV adverts seems very loose, with a quick \"be gamble aware\" at the end. I would like the Government to review current regulation for gambling adverts on television. A review could help reduce the levels of problem gambling.",
