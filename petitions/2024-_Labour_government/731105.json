        "additional_details": "Trust in politics is broken. We believe that MPs can mislead the public and face no consequences, it suggests one rule for them and another for us. We think the current Recall of MPs Act 2015 is too weak, as it only applies after a criminal conviction with imprisonment or a suspension from the House of Commons of at least ten sitting days. Voters must have a proper mechanism to hold their own representatives to account for dishonesty. This is about basic integrity and giving voters a real say.",
        "background": "We think that if an independent body finds an MP has deliberately misled the public, their constituents should be able to trigger a binding recall vote. This could give voters the power to remove MPs who break their trust with the electorate, forcing a by-election.",
