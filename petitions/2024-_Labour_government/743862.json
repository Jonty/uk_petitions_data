        "action": "Stop mandatory Digital ID that attacks Christian faith and observance.",
        "additional_details": "Many Christians believe Revelation 13 warns against compulsory systems of identification tied to buying and selling. To accept such a system would, in their conscience, be to deny Christ. Mandatory Digital ID is incompatible with Christian faith. Forcing compliance would breach Article 9 of the Human Rights Act 1998, which protects freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Parliament must provide exemptions so Christians can live faithfully without exclusion from society.",
        "background": "Mandatory Digital IDs are incompatible with commonly held Christian theology. Parliament must provide exemptions on religious grounds so believers are not forced to act against conscience or compromise their faith to access essential services.",
