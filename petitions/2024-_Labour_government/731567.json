        "additional_details": "We believe pets are not a luxury but loved and valued companions and contribute to emotional and mental wellbeing for so many including the elderly. Some animal rescue centres may be full and unable to help, resulting in healthy animals being put down or left to suffer without basic care. We believe that if VAT is no longer charged on all veterinary fees, it could go a long way to rectifying this situation.",
        "background": "Following reports of some pet owners not being able to afford vet fees, we believe it is time for the Government to remove VAT from veterinary fees for pets so that it is no longer charged on animal health care which is essential for their health.",
