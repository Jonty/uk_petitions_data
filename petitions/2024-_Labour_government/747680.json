        "action": "Introduce legislation to ensure national marking of Remembrance Day",
        "additional_details": "This Act should ensure its cultural, historical, and solemnity be protected for future generations. We think Remembrance Day is of paramount national importance, ensuring we honour the sacrifices of our Armed Forces and maintain a collective national memory. While currently observed, its protections rely on convention and public will, making it vulnerable to future legislative or societal changes that could dilute its meaning. Dedicated legislation could provide a robust, statutory safeguard for its integrity and prevent the gradual erosion of this tradition of remembrance.",
        "background": "We call upon the House to debate and introduce a specific Act of Parliament to legally protect all established provisions and customs of the national Remembrance Day (11th November and Remembrance Sunday) events. ",
