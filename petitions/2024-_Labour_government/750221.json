        "action": "Restrict fireworks to official celebration days and strict hours",
        "additional_details": "Currently fireworks go on for weeks, at random times every single night, causing distress to vulnerable people, wildlife, and pets. Because they are set off unexpectedly, it is difficult for people to plan and keep pets and vulnerable individuals safe indoors. If dates and times were restricted to official celebration dates and set times, arrangements could be made to ensure the safety and wellbeing of pets and vulnerable people. Fireworks have now gone out of hand and need strict regulation.",
        "background": "Restrict fireworks to official celebration days and strict hours, such as Bonfire Night, New Year\u2019s Eve, Diwali, and Chinese New Year, and only allow them between 7:00pm and 9:00pm (with the exception of New Years Eve - between 12am and 12:30am). Anyone breaking these rules should face heavy fines.",
