        "additional_details": "We believe that, America has been effectively occupying Europe, since the end of WW2, whilst costing the UK tens of \u00a3billions in contributions. America seems to have swapped it's self appointed role of 'world policeman' for the more overt role of international piracy, not out of strength, but in desperate fear of economic collapse. We feel that the 'promissory notes' of such a country, cannot be trusted, let alone for them to be used as the main international trading currency",
        "background": "We call on Parliament to: stop funding wars, legislate the closure of all American military bases in the UK and apply to join BRICS trading nations. We believe that Britain has been in the shadow of it's distant transatlantic neighbour for too long and that it's time to break free.",
