        "additional_details": "Fireworks misuse can lead to injuries, fatalities, and damage to property, as they\u2019re often used to target people and vehicles. They also distress pets, especially dogs, and can harm individuals with sensitive hearing, like those with autism. Additionally, fireworks-related incidents strain fire services, diverting critical resources. Banning public sales would help prevent these risks, creating safer, controlled settings for families to enjoy fireworks displays with minimal chance of accidents.",
        "background": "Please ban the sale of fireworks and sparklers to the public, limiting purchases to licensed event coordinators and trained professionals. Enforce laws to restrict fireworks displays to open, non-suburban areas, ensuring safer, controlled environments for fireworks use.",
