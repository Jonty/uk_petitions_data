        "additional_details": "Recent debates over the scope of executive power, the use of Henry VIII clauses, and the suspension of Parliament in 2019 have highlighted the fragility of our unwritten system. A written constitution would ensure that short-term political interests cannot erode democratic principles and civil liberties.",
        "background": "The UK is one of the few democracies without a written constitution. Our rights and freedoms are scattered across laws and conventions, leaving them vulnerable. A written constitution would protect civil liberties, limit government power, and strengthen democracy for future generations.",
