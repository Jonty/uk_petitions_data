        "additional_details": "We think that making neutering free for pets such as bunnies, cats, and dogs could decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies and lower the risk of  animals being abandoned. We think making neutering services free could reduce the numbers of animals in shelters waiting for homes and lessen the burden on these often under-resourced shelters. We think neutering may lead to healthier lives for pets, reducing their risk of developing certain types of cancers. We think it's time we advocate for the welfare of our furry friends and contribute to a more sustainable pet population management solution.",
        "background": "Fund vouchers to cover the cost of neutering pets. The price of neutering animals varies between vet clinics but we think it is still expensive and unaffordable for some people. We think this would help to reduce the amount of abandoned and unwanted animals.",
