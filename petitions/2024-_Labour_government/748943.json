        "additional_details": "Firstly, the acceptance of gifts risks influencing the opinions and decision making of elected officials or those who have financial control of tax payer funding.\r\nSecondly, MP\u2019s, Lords and public servants should all feel the same financially pressures as those they represent. It is simply outrageous that people in such a privileged position seem fit to accept such gifts under the noses of those they were elected to represent.",
        "background": "MP\u2019s, Lords and all public servants must not be permitted to accept gifts of any kind. For example, gifts such as food, drink, tickets to events, financial donations such as paying for fuel or staffing costs or any other financial assistance must be stopped immediately.",
