        "additional_details": "I think the current cap of \u00a33,000 per week for child maintenance calculations can result in excessively high payments that go beyond supporting a child\u2019s basic and reasonable needs. I think this can place an unfair financial burden on higher-earning parents and may be open to misuse. I think a lower cap would better balance the needs of the child with the rights and responsibilities of both parents.",
        "background": "I urge Parliament to review and reduce the current \u00a33,000 weekly income cap used to calculate child maintenance payments. I believe the existing cap can lead to disproportionately high payments that exceed a child\u2019s reasonable needs and place an unfair burden on paying parents.",
