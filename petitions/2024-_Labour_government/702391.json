        "additional_details": "Citizens should be able to hold the government to account at all times, not just during General Elections. The law needs to be changed so that a petition of 'no confidence' to parliament, containing the signatures of at least 51% of the population means a General Election is immediately called.",
        "background": "At present a vote of no confidence can only be called by parliament, leaving majority governments in an almost untouchable position. This means that governments can break promises or make decisions that are destructive to the country, and the electorate can do nothing until the next election.",
