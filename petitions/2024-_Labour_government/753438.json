        "additional_details": "We believe the NHS and social care are trapped in a cycle of short-term reforms that change with every government. This can create instability, wasted resources, and poor outcomes for patients and staff. We feel that other countries, like Ireland and Denmark, have successfully used cross-party plans to achieve long-term improvement. We believe we need the same stability, to rebuild public and staff trust, and that without political cross-party consensus, all improvement and transformation attempts will fail.",
