It affects everything in society from housing, to schools, to healthcare as well as the economy, which we believe has become all for the worse based on per capita. We feel it is time for the Government to listen to the people of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. We want it to stop for at least a period of 5 years, to take stock and re-evaluate risks and benefits to UK.",
