        "additional_details": "The town were I live was a beautiful place. However, after decades of neglect, it has become an almost semi-derelict industrial town. We believe this deterioration has been exacerbated by the Home Office's use of the town to house Migrants and newly Released Offenders from outside the area, accommodating them in HMOs and flat units \u2013 in a town where there are precious few job opportunities.",
        "background": "We call on the government to set a firm planning cap - to be adhered to by local authorities - on the level of flatlet and HMO development of a maximum 10 per 1,000 population. We believe this would help ensure that community infrastructure, character and cohesion are not stressed or destroyed.",
