While international aid has its place, we must ensure that the nation's own challenges are resolved first. The UK is not a charity, and its resources should reflect the priorities of its citizens.\r\nPerhaps the government should start a dedicated charity and ask for voluntary donations, rather than giving away money that doesn't belong to them.",
