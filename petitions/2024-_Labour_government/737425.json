        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, urge the Prime Minister to dissolve Parliament and call a general election. Polls show Labour\u2019s support has fallen from its 2024 landslide to the low-20s, sometimes behind Reform UK, with only 13% approving the government\u2019s record. Record small-boat crossings, early prisoner releases, economic concerns, and ministerial resignations have eroded confidence. A fresh mandate is needed under the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022.",
        "background": "Dissolve Parliament and call a general election now, allowing voters to choose a government that can address immigration, economic stability, crime, and integrity in public office, restoring trust and delivering on the promises of effective change.",
