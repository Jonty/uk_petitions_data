        "action": "Referendum on royal family and abolish the monarchy and make the UK a republic.",
        "additional_details": "Parliament should abolish the monarchy as it undermines democratic principles by being an unelected institution, conflicting with modern values of meritocracy. The monarchy is costly, diverting taxpayer funds that could support public services. Increasing public sentiment, particularly among younger people, favors a republic that promotes accountability and inclusivity, better reflecting the diversity of the UK. Transitioning to a republic would align governance with current societal values.",
        "background": "The UK government should hold a referendum on abolishing the monarchy, as it undermines democratic values and imposes significant costs on taxpayers. Increasing public support for a republic reflects a desire for greater accountability and inclusivity, aligning governance with modern societal values",
