It conceals their identities and transforms them into unidentifiable figures.\r\n\r\nBalaclavas have gained notoriety as the accessory of choice for those who wish to commit crime without facing accountability. The anonymity provided by these garments is not just a minor concern.....it is a Major concern and the police must be granted powers to stop, forcibly remove these garments from wearers and confiscate them.",

The police should also be granted the power to forcibly stop all 2 wheeled bikes (motorbikes, ebikes, push bikes, surron electric bikes) where the rider(s) are wearing  balaclavas in public.",
