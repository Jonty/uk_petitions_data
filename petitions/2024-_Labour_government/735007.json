        "additional_details": "The Online Safety Act 2023, receiving Royal Assent on October 26, 2023, aims to protect children and adults online by imposing duties on social media companies and search services to manage illegal and harmful content. It is enforced by Ofcom, with phased implementation, including child safety duties effective from July 25, 2025. However, the act has faced significant criticism for its potential to undermine free speech, privacy, and innovation, leading to calls for its prohibition or repeal.",
        "background": "The Online Safety Act risks free speech, privacy, and innovation with vague rules and burdens on small platforms. Repeal it for targeted laws that protect kids, respect privacy, and foster tech growth.",
