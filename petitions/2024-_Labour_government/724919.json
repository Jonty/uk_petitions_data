        "action": "Allow the exchange of Moroccan driving licences for UK licences",
        "additional_details": "Many Moroccans living in the UK face unnecessary challenges when trying to legally drive, despite holding valid and verifiable Moroccan licences. Allowing a licence exchange would promote fairness, facilitate integration, and support mobility for work and daily life. Other non-EU countries already benefit from such agreements, and Morocco should be considered for inclusion.\r\nWe believe this is an important step for the growing Moroccan community in the UK.\r\nThank you.",
        "background": "We ask the UK Government to negotiate a reciprocal agreement with Morocco to allow holders of Moroccan driving licences to exchange them for UK driving licences without the need for a driving test.",
