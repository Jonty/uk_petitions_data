        "action": "Replace proposed generational tobacco ban with new legal age of 21",
        "additional_details": "The task of enforcing a generational ban will fall on independent retailers \u2013 and yet so far our voice has been ignored; we urge the government to listen on this matter. Violence and abuse against retailers is already at an all-time high; increased ID checks and restrictions would make this worse and push people towards the black market.\r\n\r\nRaising the age to 21 would be simpler to enforce, clearer for shoppers & staff alike, reduce youth smoking and allow adults to make an informed choice.",
        "background": "A generational tobacco ban is unworkable and should be replaced by raising the legal age to purchase tobacco products from 18 to 21. As a convenience retailer, I'm deeply concerned that a gen ban would increase instances of violence and abuse against retailers and fuel the tobacco black market.",
