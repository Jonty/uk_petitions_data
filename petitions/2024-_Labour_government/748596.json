        "additional_details": "For too long, AI developers have gotten away with what we think is the effective theft of millions of creative works without permission, as a way of training their generative AI models. If a regular person redistributed this material, they could face thousands of pounds in fines. Artists deserve protection, control, and compensation for how their work has been used without their consent, while tech companies currently face no legal accountability.",
