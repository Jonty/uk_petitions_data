        "additional_details": "TFL have been abusing their powers for many years now. Private hire drivers have been left in lurch once again. Currently due to TFL system update, drivers who have renewed their TFL license are still waiting. For many drivers this is their only source of income, pushing them towards homelessness and poverty. Even when drivers receive their license, they will be working all hours to pay back the money they have borrowed. TFL are charging \u00a3310 for license however, nothing has been provided.",
        "background": "To ensure TFL provide drivers with an adequate solution regarding their private hire license. Either issue license to drivers ASAP or provide an extension whilst they work on their new system.",
