        "action": "Reform oversight of Private Parking Enforcement and trade associations.",
        "additional_details": "Private parking enforcement relies on trade associations to regulate their members. When they fail to investigate complaints or follow their procedures, there is no effective esculation route. The DVLA and Department for Transport decline to intervene, leaving motorists without protection. This disproportionately affects the eldarly and vulnerable, who often pay unjust charges due to confusion, poor signage, or inaccessible appeal processes. Independant oversight is needed to close this gap.",
        "background": "Introduce independant oversight of private parking enforcement, require trade associations to follow enforceble complaints processes, and ensure the DVLA investigates non-compliance where accredited bodies fail to act.",
