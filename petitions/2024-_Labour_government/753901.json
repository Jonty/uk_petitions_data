        "additional_details": "Skilled workers contribute for many years but remain tied to a sponsoring employer, limiting mobility and slowing economic growth. Allowing LLR after 5 years would reduce pressure on businesses, help fill skill shortages, and keep welfare protections in place. It gives workers fair mobility without granting early settlement.",
        "background": "Introduce a new Limited Leave to Remain (LLR) status for skilled workers after 5 years, allowing them to work for any employer without sponsorship while keeping restrictions on access to public funds. ILR would still remain at 15 years.",
