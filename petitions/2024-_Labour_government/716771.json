        "additional_details": "Birmingham City Council recently declared bankruptcy in September 2023 due to severe financial mismanagement, including poor budget planning and costly legal settlements. It is unacceptable that residents are now being asked to pay the price for these failures. Hardworking individuals, pensioners, and low-income families should not be forced to bear the consequences of the council\u2019s mistakes.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned residents of Birmingham, strongly oppose the proposed increase in council tax. At a time when many households are already struggling with the rising cost of living, this additional financial burden is unfair and unjustifiable.",
