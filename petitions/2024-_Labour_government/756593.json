Remember many armed service veterans have had to put up with Poor accommodation, Poor Pay & poor conditions during their service careers. It is a total insult to tax these pensions. They should not be taxed. Armed service personnel are not respected or looked after in this country & never have been. Charities have to fill the gaps that Governments should be fulfilling. No wonder its hard to recruit,",
