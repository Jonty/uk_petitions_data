Despite our various contributions to our home country, we lack essential parliamentary representation there.\r\n \r\nWhile other issues are important, we think that extending representation to overseas citizens is crucial for inclusivity. It's time for the UK to expand its parliamentary representation to include us, ensuring we can shape the future of our home country.",
