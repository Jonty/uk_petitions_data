        "additional_details": "We believe that finance has never been so important. Money plays a vital role in all young peoples' lives, and yet we believe we fail to arm them with the financial knowledge that they need to take into adulthood. In modern times, online fraud is common, many children have bank accounts, students face rising university costs, and some young people need to navigate car insurance. To us, it is clear that we need financial education that is statutory in all secondary schools in England.",
        "background": "Financial education should be made compulsory by statute for all secondary school students in England. This would be delivered by all schools to all students. Currently, it is included in the national curriculum, but not all schools (e.g. academies or free schools) have to follow it.",
