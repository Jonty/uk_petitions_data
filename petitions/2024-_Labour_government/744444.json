Mandate a six-week health check-up for all women who experience preterm births to review their physical and psychological health.\r\n\r\nIn the UK, babies born before 24 weeks are not recognised as viable by law, which we believe leaves families without the necessary support and recognition during such an emotionally taxing time. Furthermore, many women who experience preterm births do not receive consistent follow-up care to monitor their physical and emotional well-being after the ordeal. This lack of mandatory check-ups represents a significant oversight in ensuring the health of mothers who have endured the trauma of preterm delivery.",
