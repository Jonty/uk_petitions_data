Image creation is being used in malicious ways - such as creating nude images of underage children - and it is also removing the humanity of the online space. It puts hard working artists out of jobs and the internet is full of uncanny images that our children are growing up to be rotted by. Not to mention the environmental and energy impact AI has and the dangers it holds on the future. People now no longer know if what they are seeing is real or fake.",
