        "additional_details": "The UK Supreme Court has ruled that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex, 'sex is binary' an utterly vague and exclusionary definition.\r\n\r\nThis disqualifies them from sex-based protections, displaying non-understanding on how misogyny affects trans women. Furthermore, trans women with a Gender Recognition Certificate are also disqualified from classification as a woman.\r\n\r\nThis practically invalidates the purpose of a Gender Recognition Certificate, and Equality Act 2010.",
