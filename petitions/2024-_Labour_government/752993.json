        "additional_details": "Children don't need homework because it often adds stress and takes away time for rest, play, and family bonding. Instead of deepening learning, it can overwhelm students and widen gaps between those with support at home and those without. Reducing homework lets kids recharge, build creativity, and return to school more motivated, healthier, and better prepared to engage meaningfully in class each day. Giving children this balance strengthens their well-being and long-term success.",
        "background": "Homework burdens students after long school days, reducing family time and harming mental health. Banning it would allow children to rest, explore interests, and return to class more focused, improving learning outcomes and overall well-being for every student in the nation today. Now.",
