It kills thousands of protected species and they very rarely catch the culprits. There are no deterrants to prevent people from starting these fires, so camera should be posted at the most hit Heathlands to deter criminals, but also if they are live streamed, viewers can watch and monitor and alert authorities when there is a fire",
        "background": "Every year we get multiple fires on the Heathlands in Dorset, particularly during an amber warning period. Often the culprits are not caught as the Heathlands have little to no surveillance and some are so large and not overlooked. This would act as a deterrant and could be monitored.",
