        "additional_details": "Health Concerns:\r\nChlorine washing treats chicken carcasses with chlorine-based solutions (e.g., chlorine dioxide or hypochlorous acid) to kill surface bacteria like Salmonella:Campylobacter.

The process might obscure systemic flaws where bacteria thrive. \r\n\r\nWelfare Concerns:\r\nThe bigger issue is what chlorination enables: lower animal welfare standards.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to enact legislation banning the import of chlorinated chicken from any country to protect UK food safety and animal welfare standards.",
