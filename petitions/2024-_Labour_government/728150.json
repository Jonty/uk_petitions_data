        "background": "The British people voted to leave the EU in good faith, based on a clear promise of national sovereignty, border control, independent law-making, and the freedom to pursue global trade opportunities. The new Brexit reset with the EU, clearly highlights that Referendum of 2016 has not been honoured.",
