We also want there to be a transitional period before any changes commence and further consultation of all parts of the industry before any changes are implemented. \r\n\r\nThousands of professionals\u2014mostly women\u2014trained under frameworks like the level 7, investing years of work and savings. They opened clinics, signed leases, and many are sole providers for children. We want to ensure they are not banned from practicing which we think would be unjust and negatively impact mental health and stability.",
