        "additional_details": "We believe current rules impact people living in urban areas, where off-street parking is rare. We think public charging points are often costly, insufficient, and frequently occupied by non-EV vehicles. We think this creates significant barriers to EV ownership, limiting efforts to meet environmental targets and reduce carbon emissions.\r\n\r\nWe think this change could enable more people to adopt EVs, make sustainable transport more accessible, and ensure safe, minimally disruptive charging solutions for those without off-street parking.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to review the Highways Act 1980 to permit the safe use of charging cables across pavements, under specific conditions. These include cables being placed under protectors, laid flat and straight from property to vehicle, and used during periods of low pedestrian traffic.",
