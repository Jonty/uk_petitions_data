        "additional_details": "I want the government to allow conjugal visits because they help inmates keep family bonds, support mental well-being, encourage good behavior, and improve rehabilitation. Strong relationships reduce stress, strengthen stability after release, and lower reoffending. This respects dignity, creates safer prisons, and supports reintegration and stronger communities.",
        "background": "We want the government and parliament to recognize the importance of preserving family bonds and to implement legislation that grants eligible incarcerated individuals the right to conjugal visits in a safe and regulated manner.",
