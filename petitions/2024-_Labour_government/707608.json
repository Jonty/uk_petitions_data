        "additional_details": "From Jan\u201822-Oct\u201823, private jets of 200 of the world's richest people emitted the same amount of carbon as almost 40,000 Britons. In 2022 alone they made 27793 flights - just 0.5% of the 5.3m private flights that year, while public airlines formed only 7% of UK emissions. Right now jet fuel isn\u2019t taxed at all but we think it could raise billions in tax income to improve people\u2019s lives.\r\n\r\nWe think this data show the disproportionate impact of the privileged few. We believe the government need to act to bring an end to this.",
        "background": "UK Government must legislate to:\r\n*Tax jet fuel\r\n*Increase other taxes & duties on planes with few passengers\r\n*Require fuel for outbound flights to be bought in the UK to avoid tax evasion and curb carbon emissions\r\n*Require private jets to carbon offset ",
