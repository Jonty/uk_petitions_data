The mental health and safety of both public and animals makes this an important matter.\r\nA member of my family who is an ex war vet gets triggered each and every year with more and more fireworks being set off. And they even do it as early as October instead of on Guy Fawkes Day. Then this continues up until after Christmas which is ridiculous as you can understand. There is a law no loud noise after 10pm.",

Please swap to noiseless ones. They are also cheaper!",
