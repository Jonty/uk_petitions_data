        "additional_details": "The inquiry must thoroughly investigate systemic failures by police, social services, and local authorities that allowed these crimes to persist, ensuring accountability and the implementation of stronger safeguarding measures. \r\n\r\nIt must also be empowered to confront uncomfortable truths, including the backgrounds and ethnicities of perpetrators, while remaining impartial, evidence-based, and focused on delivering justice and meaningful reforms to protect vulnerable individuals.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government to launch a national, government-led inquiry into child sexual abuse and rape gangs, with a commitment to report fully within 18 months and during this Parliament. Despite widespread concern to date this has been blocked by the Labour Party, undermining public confidence.",
