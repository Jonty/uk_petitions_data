        "action": "Prevent the undemocratic abuse of land-owning privilege.",
        "additional_details": "Far too much of the farmland surrounding towns and villages is owned by single, land-owning families. This facilitates the sudden sale of vast tracts of rural countryside for development, thereby completely altering the entire character of settlements and over-burdening local services. Far from being the self-proclaimed 'guardians of the countryside' small numbers of individuals have been acting in the manner of feudal land barons, creating enormous personal wealth by cashing in on our heritage.",
        "background": "Land-owning families or companies must be barred from owning entire tracts of farmland surrounding towns and villages. Changes of land use above specified acreage or in edge-of-settlement locations must be forbidden, thereby ensuring that essential rural characteristics of local areas are protected.",
