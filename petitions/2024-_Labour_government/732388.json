        "additional_details": "It is very difficult for a parent to ban their child from using a smartphone when there is so much social pressure from the child's peers to be doing so. No one wants their child excluded socially because they don't  have a smart phone. However the risks to all children using social media are real and need to be addressed at a national level. This is why we need help from the government to ban smartphones below the age of 16 to help parents protect their children.",
