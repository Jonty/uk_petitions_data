        "additional_details": "We believe London, our Capital City, is different to every other city in the country and belongs to every man, woman and child throughout the UK. It is our largest city and is one of the most influential cities across the globe. As such, we think all UK residents should have a say as to who holds the position of Chief Executive of the Greater London Authority. When it comes to voting for our London Mayor I would like Parliament to allow all eligible UK residents to be able to vote, not just Londoners.",
        "background": "Only people who live in Greater London are allowed to vote for candidates in the Mayoral elections. We think London carries so much influence across the globe and the majority of UK residents have no say as to who 'heads up' and manages our great city, and we should. London belongs to us all.",
