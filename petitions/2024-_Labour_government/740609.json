Women are dismissed with \u201cjust lose weight,\u201d offered only the pill, or denied fertility care due to BMI, though PCOS itself causes weight gain. This is discriminatory. PCOS raises risks of diabetes, high blood pressure, liver disease, infertility, anxiety and depression. I was diagnosed at 15, given no follow-up, and now live with multiple related conditions. Women with PCOS deserve recognition, fair care and real NHS support",
        "background": "We urge the Government & NHS England to recognise PCOS as a long-term condition, end diagnosis delays, train doctors, provide joined-up care, fair fertility access, reinstated treatments, funded research, licensed medicines, and free/subsidised support. Women deserve real NHS care.",
