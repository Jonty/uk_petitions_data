        "additional_details": "We want the government to allow local councils to retain the power to decide when planning committees should grant or deny planning applications, but streamline the process, speed it up and give final decisions. Inform the public more openly in order to give them time to support or oppose.\r\n \r\nWithout this control, green belts could be swallowed up at an exponential rate, a process which may not be reversible.  \r\n",
        "background": "We think removing local planning committees from the decision making process for building applications could mean local people have less of a say in what happens to their communities. Building is necessary but we feel the government's plans could affect small communities and access to services.",
