The impact on farm animals wildlife and domestic animals is tragic. Neighbours let off fireworks behind my stables. I have to stand and watch my terrified horses hurt themselves and there is nothing I can do without endangering my life. No notification has to be given in these instances and there is nothing I can do to stop it. Sheep and horses have aborted their young due to this.",
