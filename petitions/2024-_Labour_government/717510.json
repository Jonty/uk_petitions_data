        "additional_details": "I ask why a member of the Emergency Services that has completed 15 years is less deserving of recognition. I ask that UK Emergency Service\u2019s Long Service medal be issued at 15 years, aligning it with the UK Armed Forces. I think members that fall short of 20 years service walk away with no recognition of their dedication and sacrifice. I also ask that Emergency Service personnel that have already retired, completing more than 15 years service but less than 20 years service also be eligible.",
        "background": "Emergency Service members may be unable to complete their 20 years service due to sustaining injury on duty resulting in being medical retired prior to this time. We think the 20 year rule disproportionately affects women as many leave the services prior to their male counterparts to have children.",
