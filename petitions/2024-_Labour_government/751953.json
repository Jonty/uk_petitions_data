Retrospective changes cause stress, disrupt children\u2019s education, family life, and long-term plans. Implementing rules backdated without notice is unfair, undermines human rights, and affects people\u2019s emotions.

Apply new ILR rules only to new applicants after the White Paper, or provide transitional time similar to Care Worker and Graduate Route changes to prevent disruption to families, children\u2019s education, and financial plans.\u201d",
