        "action": "Add military preparation and cadet training into the national curriculum",
        "additional_details": "We think that integrating cadet programs into the curriculum could support a well-rounded education by building discipline, leadership and teamwork. These programs could promote responsibility, resilience and civic values, preparing students for both civilian and military careers. Inspired by successful military preparation colleges, this approach could develop confident, capable citizens ready to contribute to society. We think this could be a good investment in youth development and national readiness.",
        "background": "We want the government to include cadet programs as part of the national curriculum. They could fund training and resources, partner with military and education bodies and pilot the program in schools to ensure smooth nationwide implementation.",
