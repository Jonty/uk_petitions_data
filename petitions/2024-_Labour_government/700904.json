        "additional_details": "On average, more than 100 horses were killed or injured every year in the UK between November 2010 and March 2024 due to incidents involving fireworks (BBC 2024). \r\n\r\nFireworks can also be distressing for people with dementia, PTSD, autism and elderly people. \r\n\r\nSilent fireworks can now be purchased so that communities can still celebrate. Parliament should ban the sale and use of non-silent fireworks in order to protect the welfare of animals and people.",
        "background": "Fireworks cause animals and humans extreme fear and stress. It is estimated that 45% of animals show signs of fear when they hear a firework (Blackwell et al. 2005). The Animal Welfare Act 2006 (Legislation.co.uk) states that it is an offence to cause unnecessary suffering or harm to animals.",
