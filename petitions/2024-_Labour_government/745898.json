        "additional_details": "UK nutrition labels are only required to show total sugars, combining natural sugars (e.g. from milk and fruit) with added sugars (e.g. from syrups and concentrates). Advice from the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition limits free (added) sugars to 5% of calories, yet consumers can\u2019t always track this. Clearer labelling could support obesity prevention, reduce diabetes and heart disease, cut pressure and costs on the NHS, and align the UK with countries like the US and Canada.",
