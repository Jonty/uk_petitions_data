We think statistics on domestic violence against men are lower due to the amount of the crimes being unreported, but the effects are no less to a victim.",

There are men who have to suffer with the lasting effects of domestic violence and crimes against men are often unreported but shouldn\u2019t be viewed as inferior or completely disregarded.",
