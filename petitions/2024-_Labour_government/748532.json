        "additional_details": "We believe that ride share companies profit while drivers carry all risk and cost. They change rates without consultation, leaving drivers struggling with fuel, maintenance, and inflation. We want new rules ensuring drivers keep at least 80% of fares, fair pay standards, and oversight of fare algorithms. The government must act now to protect hardworking drivers from ongoing exploitation and restore fairness in this essential industry",
        "background": "We believe digital ride share drivers face growing exploitation from platform companies. They can take big commissions while paying little to drivers. Drivers work long hours but can earn less as fares and profits rise. Drivers now demand government action to end this unfair system.",
