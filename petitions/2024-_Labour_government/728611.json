Job sites are outdated, built for parents, not Gen Z. Careers advice in schools isn\u2019t working\u2014young people feel confused, lost, and left behind. The system rewards connections, not potential. We need a modern, fair, skills-based way to help all young people find work, not just the lucky few. Let\u2019s change how the UK hires its future.",
        "background": "The current system for finding a job is built around CVs and job boards meant for the 1950's. It\u2019s biased, outdated, and is nothing to do with potential. We want the Government to remove CV's and make who you are as a person what decides if you get a job\u2014not paper CVs. Give young people a chance.",
