In the year ending March 2024 there were 360+ abuse-related deaths and 98 suicides. Victims often stay silent out of fear or coercion. This Bill would let families act early, prevent serious harm or death, and ensure police take proactive measures. If refused, we ask what steps will protect victims and save lives.",
