        "additional_details": "Families of home educated children can have limited financial resources as they are responsible for covering all the costs of their children's education, including textbooks, materials, and tutoring. GCSE exam fees can be substantial, especially for families taking multiple exams, creating a financial barrier that may discourage some home-educated children from pursuing further qualifications. We think that charging fees for GCSE exams for home-educated children creates an unfair disparity.",
        "background": "We believe all children, regardless of their educational setting, deserve equal opportunities to access higher education and employment. We think that charging fees for GCSE exams for home-educated children creates an unfair disparity, as their peers in state-funded schools have these costs covered.",
