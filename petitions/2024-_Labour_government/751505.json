        "additional_details": "Many people on Skilled Worker visas feel they were promised a 5-year pathway to ILR, and we believe these changes go against their human rights, as it may be perceived that  they were deceived and taken advantage of. We believe they should have the right to a 5-year qualifying period for settlement and that the changes should only apply to those who come after April 2026. We feel the Government is undermining the very people who have worked and paid taxes, and who may have left their families and lives behind.",
