Recovery is hard enough without temptation around every corner. Reducing alcohol visibility could offer real daily support and could help protect underage and vulnerable people from constant exposure. We know first-hand how powerful this support can be.",
        "background": "We want legislation that requires supermarkets to sell alcohol only in one designated area, away from entrances, aisle ends, and checkouts. This could support people in recovery, reduce triggers for addiction, and limit exposure to children and vulnerable individuals.",
