        "additional_details": "So people can start using public travel like they used to without fear,panic,and alarm, these kids are out of control and unlimited travel is helping these gangs to travel to fight others in different towns,I'm sure some of the parliament has seen comments in fife jammers posts about them fighting or setting fires,I'm amazed there's not a petition already for this, people are fed up, staying cooped up in there own homes making Thier mental health worse, which will impact more on NHS services which are diabolical already",
        "background": "Limit journeys to school trips only& expandable for work,youths are abusing it,using it to fight,cause chaos on buses,bus stations leaving ppl too scared to use buses, fear gangs with hoods& balaclavas,leaving ppl unable to travel, know I'm not the only person,who fears to travel, especially alone",
