        "additional_details": "Around 350 riders on died from motorcycle accidents in 2022. We believe an increasing number of incidents may be linked to poor road surfaces. In 2021, it was estimated there were around 1.4 million motorcycle users on the road in the UK. We believe this is a very small % of the total volume of traffic who must pay VED for road surfaces they are unlikely to have damaged! We believe this is unjust and a lack of consideration by the Government for the UK\u2019s motorcycling community.",

We believe accidents are being caused by the state of the roads, including delamination of the road surface but motorcycles don't have the weight to severely damage the roads.",
