        "additional_details": "Many families feel the only way they can afford a holiday is to take their children out of school during term time. Whilst parents understand this can have an impact on a child's education, time spent as a family away from the stresses and strains of everyday life is highly valuable to a family. \r\n\r\nGovernment and local councils have implemented fines for families who do this, however, this is not a deterrent, as it is often cheaper to pay the fine, and take a cheaper holiday in term time.",
        "background": "Ban holiday companies from increasing their prices at school holiday times and be consistent during the year. For a typical family of four a holiday during school holidays can increase by 100%. This is totally unfair and discriminates families with children.",
