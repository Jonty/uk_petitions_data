        "action": "Reopen the maternity unit at Samuel Johnson Community Hospital",
        "additional_details": "Accepting this proposal would help women access this vital service closer to home.\r\n\r\nThe maternity unit was available for mothers considered low-risk to give birth in, until the service was suspended in 2020. Antenatal and post-natal care continue to be provided in Lichfield, but women have to travel elsewhere to give birth.\r\n\r\nThis proposal would increase provision in an area with a rising population and free up capacity elsewhere, therefore it is in the best interests of mothers and the NHS.",
        "background": "Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent Integrated Health Board (ICB) should reopen the midwife-led maternity unit at Samuel Johnson Community Hospital in Lichfield. Currently, women in South-East Staffordshire and Derbyshire have to travel to sites much further away to access maternity care.",
