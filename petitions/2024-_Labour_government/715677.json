        "additional_details": "Families are suffering irreparable harm at being torn apart in adoption cases, and other cases involving a separation of children from their parents.\r\n\r\nAdoption should be used \"when nothing else will do\", but it is often used as the \"gold standard\" of care, not because it leads to better outcomes for children, but because it is cheaper for the government.\r\n\r\nThis is unacceptable and is a serious abuse of Human Rights, and all adoption cases must stop immediately and be investigated.",
        "background": "Many innocent families are being subject to Public Law/Child Protection cases as a way for local authorities to avoid providing adequate support for children and families identified or suspected to require support.\r\n\r\nThe Family Courts enable this approach, which must cease and be investigated.",
