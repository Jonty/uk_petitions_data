        "additional_details": "\u201cCats are legally recognised as sentient beings and family pets, yet there is currently little accountability when they are injured or killed on the road. This lack of protection allows avoidable suffering, emotional trauma to owners, and irresponsible driving to go unpunished. A clear law would create a duty of care, require drivers to stop and report incidents, and ensure that reckless or deliberate harm is properly investigated and prosecuted. Such legislation would improve animal welfare and road safety, and recognise that cats deserve the same legal respect and protection as other companion animals.",
        "background": "am calling on the Government and Parliament to introduce legislation that makes it a criminal offence to intentionally or negligently strike a domestic cat with a vehicle and fail to stop, report, or seek veterinary assistance.",
