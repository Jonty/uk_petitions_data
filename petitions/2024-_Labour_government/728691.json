        "action": "Require annual eye tests for drivers over the age of 70",
        "additional_details": "As people age, their vision often deteriorates, sometimes without them noticing. Poor eyesight is a major factor in road safety, particularly for elderly drivers. Currently, drivers over 70 only self-certify their fitness to drive when renewing their licence. This may lead to dangerous situations if vision problems go undetected.\r\nIntroducing mandatory annual eye tests for drivers over 70 would ensure early detection of issues, promote safer driving, and reduce the risk of accidents. This policy would be a reasonable safeguard to protect both elderly drivers and other road users, similar to measures in other countries.",
        "background": "Introduce a legal requirement for all drivers over the age of 70 to pass an annual eye test in order to retain their driving licence.",
