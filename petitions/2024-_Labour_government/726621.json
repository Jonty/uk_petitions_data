        "additional_details": "We believe the current rule delays stability, which may hinder access to education and healthcare. We believe a 3-year route aligns with children\u2019s best interests under human rights law, fosters integration, and supports their right to a secure life in the UK, which may be their only home. We believe this change could benefit thousands, ensuring compassion and fairness in the UK\u2019s immigration policy.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to reduce the 7-year wait to apply for ILR to 3 years for UK-born children, allowing them to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain sooner. We believe this will ensure stability, integration, and fairness in line with their best interests and human rights.",
