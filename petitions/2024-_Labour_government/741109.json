        "action": " Remove the 2-Year Limit for CICA Claims for Sexual Abuse Survivors",
        "additional_details": "Many survivors cannot apply to CICA within the current two-year limit because of trauma, fear, shame, or simply not knowing their rights. This rule can deny them access to justice, recognition, and vital financial support. Removing the time limit could give survivors a fair opportunity to claim compensation, feel validated, and begin to rebuild their lives after abuse.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to allow survivors of sexual abuse to submit CICA applications at any time, not limited to two years. This could give child survivors the chance to claim support when they are ready, without being penalised for delays caused by trauma, fear, or lack of awareness.",
