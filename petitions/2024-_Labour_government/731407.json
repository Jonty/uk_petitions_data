Over 38,000 people entered unlawfully in 2024, with criminal gangs ruthlessly exploiting the chaos for profit. This blatant disregard for our laws weakens border security, floods public services, and costs taxpayers billions. The Government\u2019s weak response has failed. Immediate, uncompromising action is needed to stop the boats, fast-track removals, punish smugglers severely, and reassert full control of the UK\u2019s borders.",
