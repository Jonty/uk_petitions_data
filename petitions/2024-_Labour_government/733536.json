        "action": "Add Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients to NHS Prescription Fee Exemption",
        "additional_details": "IBD patients often take immunosuppressants, increasing their risk of infections and need for antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals. Alongside long-term meds, they may need short-term treatments like iron for anaemia, pain relief, skin care, and GI support. Managing IBD involves multiple ongoing prescriptions, highlighting the need for NHS prescription fee exemption to ease financial strain and ensure consistent access to vital care.",
        "background": "IBD is a lifelong, incurable condition like Crohn\u2019s and Colitis that causes chronic inflammation in the gut. It\u2019s not currently exempt from NHS prescription fees, placing financial strain on patients who need constant treatment. Many must choose between daily essentials and vital medication.",
