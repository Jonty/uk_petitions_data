Failures to respond may result in findings against them and entries upon their credit file. We think this is being abused and can leave the defendant having to pay for the claim to be reheard. Also require court staff to conduct validity of an address for claimant/defendant to ensure they reside & are aware of cases.",

Require court officials be responsible for service of all claims forms/packs & conducting address checks before service to ensure respondent resides at address of service.
