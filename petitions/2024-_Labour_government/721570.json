        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to change the nationality requirements so citizens from allied countries, such as our NATO allies and not just from Commonwealth nations or the Republic of Ireland, can join the UK military. We believe many people from allied nations are eager to join but are restricted by current rules. We believe by allowing more applicants, it could increase recruitment by opening opportunities to those willing to serve, fill shortages, and strengthen military capability.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to allow citizens from the UK\u2019s close allies to join the UK Armed Forces, as we think it could strengthen military capability, address recruitment shortages, and reinforce global partnerships. We believe it could also promote unity, shared values, and ensure a diverse force.",
