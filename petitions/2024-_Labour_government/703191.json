        "additional_details": "The use of non-hate crime orders undermines fundamental principles of justice and fairness. These orders allow individuals to be penalised for actions or speech that do not meet the legal definition of a hate crime, creating a slippery slope where subjective judgments can lead to overreach and potential misuse of authority.\r\n\r\nThey also create a chilling effect on free speech, where individuals may feel unable to express themselves out of fear of being unfairly penalised.",
