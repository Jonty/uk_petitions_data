        "additional_details": "We urge the government to consider applying a grandfather clause to legal residents on the current 5-year ILR path. Residents who began this path made life decisions based on existing rules. Changing requirements mid-way undermines trust despite compliance with current laws. Many affected individuals have lived, worked, paid taxes, and raised families in the UK for years. The UK has used grandfather clauses before to protect those affected by policy shifts.",
        "background": "With the release of the \u201cRestoring Control Over Immigration\u201d white paper, many UK residents are now facing uncertainty and unnecessary hardship due to extended ILR requirements. We urge the government not to apply these proposed rules to those on the current 5-year path.",
