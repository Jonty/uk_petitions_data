        "additional_details": "If the government refuses to let parents take them out of school in term time, they should ban holiday companies ripping families off by huge hikes in price in school holidays. I have seen holiday costs double in price if booking the first week of the school holidays compared to the week before. If holiday companies were prevented from doing this, then parents would not have the need to take them out of school in the first place!",
        "background": "Look at each case individually, rather than just an automatic fine without any background information. Children with good attendance and doing well at school, should be allowed a small period of time off in term time. Taking kids out of school sould stil be stopped for kids with poor attendance.",
