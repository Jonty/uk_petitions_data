        "additional_details": "It is totally pointless to have PMQs when more than half the questions are pre-advised questions from MPs on his own side and he doesn\u2019t answer the rest.\r\n\r\nThe weekly charade of PMQs does not \u201chold the government to account\u201d if the Speaker does not demand actual answers to questions from the opposition parties, especially when the majority of questions are from the government\u2019s own MPs. As it stands, PMQs is merely a vehicle for the PM to repeat tendentious propaganda soundbites.",
        "background": "Make all questions in PMQs only from Opposition parties. The Speaker should insist on all questions being answered in a straightforward and honest manner, as the only function of PMQs is to hold the Governing party to account.",
