Billions are invested in persuading us that this or that processed food is HEALTHY when in fact the messages on the packets (eg: Added vitamins! Low in fat/sugar/salt!) are misleading and fool many people that they are doing the best for their health. Research has proved that high fat diets are NOT bad. High starch diets ARE. Many myths about food are busted in \u201cSpoon-Fed. Why Almost Everything We\u2019ve been Told About Food is Wrong\u201d Professor Tim Spector.",
        "background": "I want the government to promote better health and to RESIST lobbying by powerful food industries who fool us all into eating ultra-processed foods which damage our health and increase levels of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, strokes and other harms. Food labelling needs improvement and honesty.",
