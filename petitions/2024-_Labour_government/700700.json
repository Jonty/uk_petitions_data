        "additional_details": "We also think all teaching assistants should be level 2 SEN qualified.\r\n\r\nWe think these schools need professionals who are trained so they can support each child with their different needs. That could be communicating in different ways or coping with day-to-day struggles.\r\n\r\nWe believe that teachers need specific qualifications and should only be teaching with a specific SEN teacher qualification. This is paramount.",
        "background": "We want the government to create a policy to require more training courses for individuals working within special educational schools. We think teachers should be required to do an extra year on top of their PGCE to get a specialised SEN teaching qualification.",
