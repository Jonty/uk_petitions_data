        "additional_details": "Many of these roads lack dedicated cycling infrastructure, which we believe can create hazards for both cyclists and motorists. We call for a ban on cyclists using roads over 30mph, except for authorised events, to reduce accidents caused by speed differences. We think this could:\r\n\r\n- Improve traffic flow and prevent dangerous overtaking \r\n- Encourage better cycling infrastructure \r\n- Enhance safety for all road users.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this is not anti-cycling but a necessary measure to save lives.",
        "background": "We want the Government to prohibit cyclists on roads with speed limits over 30mph (except organised events) for Public Safety. We think that by restricting cycling on high-speed roads and encouraging alternative infrastructure, we can reduce accidents, improve traffic efficiency, and protect lives.",
