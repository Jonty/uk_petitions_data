        "additional_details": "We believe the current education system is outdated, performance led and test heavy, and provides a \"one-size-fits-all\" education, failing pupils, parents/carers, staff and communities. We think the current system fails to nurture the talents and abilities of a diverse range of individuals.\r\n\r\nSchools should be inclusive, nurturing and confidence building institutions where needs and struggles are validated and children are able to express themselves\r\n\r\nPut children first!",
        "background": "We want an education system that is more student-centred and holistic, with a greater focus on mutual respect, socialising, mindfulness, freedom for teachers, individual strengths, emotional development, positive reinforcement not punishment, and equal opportunities.",
