We think current laws are too weak for today's world where backing can be funnelled through offshore accounts or companies set up in our country to provide a funding channel. We think it is undemocratic for the politics and messages of smaller parties to be drowned out by corporate sponsors of large parties.\r\n \r\nPrevent UK elections following what we see as a costly, undemocratic money circus in the USA.",
