        "action": "Do not apply the proposed 10-year ILR requirement to existing UK residents",
        "additional_details": "UK residents today have made significant life decisions based on the existing 5-year ILR policy. Retrospectively changing policy would be unfair, financially and emotionally distressing, and would undermine trust in the UK immigration system. These individuals contribute to UK's economy and society, and should not be penalized. Legal immigration needs to be controlled, but any policy changes should be applied prospectively, with protections for those already in the UK under current rules.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government not to apply the proposed extension of ILR qualifying period from 5 to 10 years to individuals who are already legally residing and paying taxes in the UK. This change should apply only to new residents entering the UK after the policy is implemented.",
