        "additional_details": "Hong Kong's 1997 handover to China lacked a referendum, denying its people self-determination. We think this undemocratic act was worsened by refusing BN(O)s full UK citizenship, a right we think they deserved as former British subjects. The BN(O) visa offers residency and a path to citizenship, but we think it doesn't correct this historical injustice. We think BN(O)s, under British colonial rule, should have the same rights as any British citizen.\r\n \r\nWe believe this would uphold the principles of democracy and human rights by correcting historical wrongs and ending inequality.",
        "background": "We want the government to address what we feel is a long-standing injustice and grant BN(O)s full citizenship rights we think they deserve. We think this would be a recognition of their historical ties to the UK and also a reaffirmation of the UK's commitment to democratic principles & human rights.",
