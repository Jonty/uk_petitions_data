In serious cases the House of Commons can already expel an MP (i.e. they lose their seat and a byelection is held), for example because they have been guilty of a very serious breach of the Code of Conduct for MPs. MPs are also automatically disqualified (so lose their seat and can\u2019t stand for election) if they are imprisoned for more than one year. We're also not sure who you would like to be responsible for firing MPs.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
