They Don\u2019t. \r\nIf Capital Punishment is used it can decrease the cases of sexual assault as there is a more harsh punishment which makes the offenders afraid. 4 years in prison is not enough for the life time of trauma the victim will suffer with. Do you really think 4 years can change a person mind? No. They will just do it again when they get out.",

It gives trauma and affects relationships. It can give the victim an unwanted pregnancy or STD\u2019s it can also leave them needing surgery.",
