We believe true asylum seekers are fleeing conflict from unsafe countries. If they have travelled through a safe country, we believe they are no longer seeking asylum but are illegal economic migrants who should have some skills our country needs to be granted access. We believe this should apply retrospectively to all asylum seekers who previously arrived.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to update migration laws so asylum seekers who arrive from a designated safe country are automatically refused and deported to the designated safe country they travelled from. ",
