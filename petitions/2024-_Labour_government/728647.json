It lowers humidity (which mould thrives on) and filters out dust and pollen.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan it dry the air too much?\u201d\r\nOnly if left blasting all day or set too cold. Most units are adjustable\u2014and far better than breathing in mould.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo they need lots of upkeep?\u201d\r\nNot really. Just clean the filters now and then. A small task for a big benefit.",
