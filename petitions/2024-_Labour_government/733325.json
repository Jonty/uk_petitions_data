        "additional_details": "There is no support for families when it comes to holidays.\r\nYou are either on benefits or very low minimum wage job and a week holiday cost during school holidays is ridiculously high,  its not affordable.\r\nThen there is the issue for those that have a working parent/s and cannot get time off work during school holidays so they have no choice but to choose days during school term because its the only time they can get off work!\r\nFamilies need more support on this matter as its not always by choice",
        "background": "Make councils authorise absence to children for 5 days off school per academic year for family holidays. Families need to be able to go away and have quality family time together and 5 days isnt going to cause any harm! If anything it will boost positivity in the children and a restart for everyone",
