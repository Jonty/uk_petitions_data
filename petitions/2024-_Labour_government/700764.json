        "additional_details": "Lone parent households make up around 16% of all UK households. Single parent employment in the UK has fallen since 2019. In 2019-20, after housing costs, 45% of single parents were in relative poverty, compared to 22% of parents in a couple and 49% of children in single parent households were in relative poverty. \r\n \r\nThe impact on child health and wellbeing of poverty is well documented. We think that removing the current universal credit take-home pay deductions for lone parent households could give them the opportunity to work themselves out of poverty.",
        "background": "As a lone parent household I am continually fighting to keep myself and my children out of poverty, but no matter how much I work, my earnings are capped by universal credit deductions. I feel that removing the deductions would allow me to work my family out of poverty.",
