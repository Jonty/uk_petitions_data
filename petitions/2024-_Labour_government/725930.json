        "additional_details": "Sunlight is a natural resource vital for the continuation of almost all ecosystems.  The Sun is a Solar body that has no ownership, therefore natural sunlight is a resource that should be accessible to all without restriction.  No state, or combination of states or agencies should seek to tamper with the atmosphere in ways that seek to reduce sunlight, there are far too many unforeseen, and unforeseeable, possible adverse outcomes that could effect us all.",
        "background": "We wish to stop the UK Government, or partner agencies, from conducting, financing or commissioning experiments with the aim of reducing sunlight intensity or limiting access to sunlight in its natural form, within its own jurisdiction or in international partnership.",
