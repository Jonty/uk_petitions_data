        "additional_details": "Government decisions to release prisoners early, revoke winter fuel payments, failure to meaningfully address immigration and surrendering British Sovereign Territory without parliamentary scrutiny are such examples of recent government folly.\r\nMany of these actions appear to diverge substantially from the commitments made during the 2024 General Election campaign. This has led to a widespread perception that the Government no longer has a democratic mandate to govern.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, call for a general election to be held immediately so that the British public can decide who governs in their name. Democratic accountability must be upheld, and the people deserve a Government that truly represents their will.",
