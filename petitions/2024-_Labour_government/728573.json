        "additional_details": "Trans people are under intense public scrutiny, suffering discrimination, misinformation and hostility. The presence of trans women in women\u2019s services is portrayed in media as a threat to women\u2019s privacy, dignity and safety. Trans people are ordinary diverse people wanting to live their lives in peace, knowing they are not their sex assigned at birth. Public authorities should work to foster good relations between trans and non-trans people and eliminate discrimination against trans people.",
        "background": "Parliament, government and public authorities should follow the public sector equality duty to advance equal opportunity for trans people, minimising the disadvantages they suffer and encouraging them to participate in public life, promoting understanding and tackling prejudice.",
