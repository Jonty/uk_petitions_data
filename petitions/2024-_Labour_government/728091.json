        "additional_details": "We believe the UK-India deal allows Indian IT workers to avoid NI while UK workers pay full tax and NI. We are concerned about outsourcing firms exploiting this. We are concerned about imbalances in visas, voting rights, use of the NHS and schooling. We feel the deal may lead to earnings leaving the UK for their home country, offering little economic return. We believe this deal could be damaging economically and undermine public trust in the UK\u2019s trade, tax and immigration systems.",
