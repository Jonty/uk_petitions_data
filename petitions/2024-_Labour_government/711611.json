Those who do can face inadequate care and struggle to get all the treatments they may need. Some practices only treat private patients, leaving locals excluded. A 50% mandate, requirements to ensure full and NHS treatment is carried out, and ensuring local NHS access could reduce inequality, tackle the dental crisis, and protect public health.",
