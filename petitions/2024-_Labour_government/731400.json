        "additional_details": "We believe that morale and confidence in leadership is low, and that many officers feel overstretched, under-supported, and caught in outdated systems. We think public trust in policing has fallen due to misconduct cases, and what many see as poor leadership and lack of accountability. Reforms must protect good officers, modernise training, and ensure communities feel safe and heard.\r\n \r\nPolice officers need to know they can rely on their government and their senior police officer leadership to back them.",
