        "additional_details": "Local elections have been delayed in some areas, leaving councils without a renewed mandate. We ask the Government to suspend council tax in affected authorities until elections occur and a new council is formed. We believe these undermine democratic rights protected under the LGA 1972, LGFA 1992 and Article 3, Protocol 1 of the Human Rights Act, which requires free and regular elections.",
        "background": "Local elections delayed in some UK areas leave councils operating without a renewed mandate. Residents should not be required to pay council tax to a council past its elected term. Government must suspend council tax collections in areas where elections are postponed & reinstate once a vote is held.",
