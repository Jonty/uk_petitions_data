Imagine applying for a mortgage and being told because you earn more than \u00a330,000 a year, you\u2019ll have to pay a higher rate of interest. \r\n\r\nThere is currently no incentive for workers to pay off their student loan. The government never acknowledge that most people 30 and under pay an additional 9% on any earnings on top of their 20/40/45% of income tax.",
        "background": "Stop charging higher punitive interest rates on student loan repayments. Higher earners who already contribute the majority of income tax should not be subject to higher interest on their student loan. Everyone should be subject to the lowest interest rate (currently 4.3%).",
