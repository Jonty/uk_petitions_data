        "additional_details": "Under FPTP, voters often face a choice between silence or casting a vote that won\u2019t deliver representation. The VETO lets them formally withhold consent when the ballot fails to offer an adequate option. A majority VETO triggers a rerun, making consent a condition of election. This reform empowers voters and ensures no one takes office without real democratic legitimacy.",
        "background": "Legislate to add a binding \u201cVETO\u201d option on ballot papers in UK elections. If over 50% of voters select VETO, the election is void and rerun. This empowers voters to reject elections that fail to offer adequate representation and ensures majority consent is required.",
