        "additional_details": "Parliament must act to reverse this dangerous and premature decision.\r\n\r\nUnder the Montevideo Convention, a state must have a defined territory, permanent population, government and capacity to enter into relations with others. We consider that a Palestinian state would currently satisfy none of these criteria. We believe recognition thus defies international norms, rewards terrorism and obstructs peace, and that the Government should rescind recognition to uphold these standards, protect the UK\u2019s integrity in foreign policy, and ensure Britain does not embolden extremists at home or abroad.",
        "background": "The UK should rescind its recognition of a Palestinian state, which we believe does not meet the criteria of the Montevideo Convention. We believe recognition rewards terrorism, undermines peace, and falls short of longstanding international norms. ",
