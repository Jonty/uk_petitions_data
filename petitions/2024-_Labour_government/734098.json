        "additional_details": "With people living longer and the cost of living at record highs, many individuals are struggling to save adequately for retirement. At the same time, inheritances, often built through a lifetime of taxed income and asset growth, are subject to further taxation upon transfer. We think this future facing reform would promote long-term saving and intergenerational investment and encourage greater financial independence reducing pressure on the state pension system.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to review current inheritance tax rules in the context of ongoing pension reform and the challenges facing working-age people today.\r\n \r\nWe propose that individuals should be able to invest their full inheritance into a pension fund without incurring inheritance tax.",
