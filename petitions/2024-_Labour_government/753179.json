        "additional_details": "The Government should act because jury trials protect ordinary people from bias, error and unchecked power. They ensure fairness through community oversight and strengthen trust in the justice system. Removing them would erode a core democratic safeguard. Real reform means investing in courts, judges and staff to fix delays without weakening our fundamental rights.",
        "background": "The Government should protect the right to jury trial, invest in courts and staffing to cut delays, and address the backlog through funding and reform \u2014 not by reducing public participation or weakening fundamental justice safeguards.",
