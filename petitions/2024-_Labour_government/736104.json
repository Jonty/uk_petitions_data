        "additional_details": "For too long, MPs have dodged real public scrutiny. Many ignore their constituents and rely on staged, filtered debates. This petition demands one day a year where Parliament faces real people\u2014nurses, builders, farmers, teachers\u2014chosen by all parties. 600 citizens. No spin. No hiding. Just answers. It's time the public had a formal seat in Parliament. A day for true democracy, where the people get to speak and the government is forced to listen. Only a non democratic government would deny this.",
        "background": "We call for a yearly Public Question Time Day where 600 everyday citizens\u2014selected by parties in Parliament\u2014can directly question the Prime Minister and Cabinet. No pre-approved scripts. No media filters. No MPs. Real accountability from the people to those in power. Recorded for all to see.",
