        "action": "Change guidelines to reduce delays in diagnosing myeloma and improve detection.",
        "additional_details": "Myeloma affects around 5,700 people in the UK each year, but it is often diagnosed late. Many patients are misdiagnosed with conditions like arthritis or back pain, only receiving a correct diagnosis once complications arise. A simple blood test could detect myeloma early, but many go months without it. On average, it takes 97 days to diagnose myeloma, more than three times longer than breast cancer, diagnosed in just 16 days. These delays are common but preventable and need urgent action.",
        "background": "We want the government to update NHS guidelines with NICE, ensuring GPs can identify early myeloma signs. This includes improving access to essential diagnostic tests, raising awareness about myeloma, and providing better GP training to reduce delays in diagnosis and improve early detection.",
