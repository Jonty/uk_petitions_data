        "additional_details": "We feel that passing farms through generations is essential to UK farming. Until now, inheritance tax exemptions have made this possible by allowing farmland to pass without taxation. We think that changes to inheritance tax will harm UK farming deeply, with some farmers predicting their families will be forced out within two generations.\r\n \r\nWe think the government is framing the policy around the targeting of rich landowners, but we believe this policy will affect farming families of all sizes.",
        "background": "We think that changing inheritance tax relief for agricultural land will devastate farms nationwide, forcing families to sell land and assets just to stay on their property. We urge the government to keep the current exemptions for working farms.",
