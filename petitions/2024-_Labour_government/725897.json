        "additional_details": "Principly, who in the UK has consented to this? the deployment of geoengineering is a violation of human rights specifically the right to life and a healthy environment. I think the public have a right to know what they will be sprayed with and in what concentrations? What research has been conducted on the damages to ecosystems? What will happen to solar panels if we remove the sun?  There are far too many questions that need answering before these experiments commence.",
        "background": "ARIA recently announced that UK scientists are to shortly commence geoengineering experiments in the UK as part of a \u00a350m government funded programme.  This decision needs to be halted immediately and debated in parliament.",
