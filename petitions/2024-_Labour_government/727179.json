        "action": "Reform Motability: End fees, benefit bias, and unfair WAV access for families",
        "additional_details": "Motability was created with Government backing in 1977 and holds a monopoly over disabled vehicle leases. Families who work but don\u2019t claim benefits are now penalised with high WAV fees. With \u00a34.4bn in reserves and no competition, this must be reviewed. Access should be based on need, not income.",
        "background": "Review and reform the Motability Scheme. End benefit-based fees for WAVs. Ensure access is based on the disabled person\u2019s needs, not their parents\u2019 income. Introduce a fair rent-to-own option and review the monopoly held since 1977 to allow for more choice and transparency.",
