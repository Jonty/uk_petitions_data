        "action": "Protect prison staff",
        "additional_details": "Last year alone there was roughly 10,605 assaults on prison staff which is an increase of 15% on the year before. These reports very rarely make the news and so they aren't spoken about enough. Officers are not given adequate protection against attacks such as stab vests and other PPE. I believe that it is forgotten about that prisoners have access to things such as razor blades and other objects that can be used as weapons such as mop handles and kettles. Sometimes even kitchen equipment.",
        "background": "The safety of all prison staff is severely compromised. We need the government to put measures in place to protect everyone working in prisons with a focus on prisoner facing roles such as prison officers/ PCO's and nursing staff. It's time for the government to protect its staff.",
