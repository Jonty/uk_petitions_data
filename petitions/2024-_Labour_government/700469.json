        "additional_details": "The negatives of fireworks outweigh the positives. Fireworks do the following:\r\n\r\n- Stress out animals, often to point of causing death\r\n- Trigger people with PTSD and trauma (e.g. soldiers)\r\n- Harm those with sensory issues, due to the unpredictable noise\r\n\r\nIf the government think fireworks should remain something 18+ folks can purchase, they should limit the harm they do to animals and PTSD sufferers and those who more easily face sensory overload.",
        "background": "Purchasing and owning loud fireworks should not be allowed for the general public. The Government should introduce a law stating that noisy fireworks should only be permitted for professional shows and events - this will mean they are handled safely, cleanly, and at predictable times.",
