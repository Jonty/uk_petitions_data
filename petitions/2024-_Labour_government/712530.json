        "additional_details": "A few schools may offer optional self-defence training to female students, however this is not available in most schools and violent crime affects everyone; we think these skills should be beneficial to all students. We think this is a long term, cost-effective solution to a country wide problem, and could see greater results the longer it was implemented. We think it could potentially reduce violent crime nationwide by prevention, and minimise harm.",
        "background": "We think self-defence is an essential life skill as we think violent crime is a major problem and cause of concern in the UK. We think this could be prevented if the public knew how to avoid violent situations, and could effectively protect and remove themselves from confrontation if necessary.",
