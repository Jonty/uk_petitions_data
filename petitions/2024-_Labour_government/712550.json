        "additional_details": "We feel it is crucial that our education system includes deforestation as a topic in every school year to ensure pupils are aware of the effects and what they can do to prevent it.\r\n\r\nWe think the situation we face today is driven by people and companies prioritising profit over the environment. Our country is committed to becoming greener, and we think addressing deforestation is a key step. By halting deforestation, we can create a healthier planet for wildlife and humans. This effort could also inspire other nations to take responsibility and join the global movement to protect our environment for future generations.",
