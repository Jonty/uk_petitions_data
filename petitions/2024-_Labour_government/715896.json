        "additional_details": "I fear some AI companies could employ tactics such as 'opt-out' forms that are overly complicated or don't work properly.\r\n \r\nAs a songwriter it can take decades to perfect your craft. It's difficult to get people to stream your music and make any money. One comfort is your songs are an original, unique statement of character, lasting long after your life. It's upsetting to think that AI could instantly consume the uniqueness and dilute it, creating similar songs.",
        "background": "I would like the government to ban AI companies from training AI using music streaming. I think it's unfair to songwriters and that even if there were an 'opt-out' for their music, it would be difficult to contact every AI company to advise they didn't want it to be used for the AI learning.",
