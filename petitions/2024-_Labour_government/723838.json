        "additional_details": "Numerous surveys have been done which show people want the richest to pay their fair share of tax. Another recent survey has shown that 3 out of 4 millionaires actually want the government to tax them more. Instead this government continues hurting the poorest in society. I can understand Rachel Reeves not wanting to increase taxes for working people but this should be the working class not those with vast amounts of wealth hoarding their gold like dragons. Let trickle down some of that wealth.",
        "background": "It\u2019s time the Government asked those with the most money to help them balance the books. For fourteen years the Tory party decimated our public finances whilst the rich just got richer. Public services have got worse, our NHS was almost broken. The Government should introduce a 2% wealth tax.",
