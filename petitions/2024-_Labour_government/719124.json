        "additional_details": "We believe Infantry Fighting Vehicles have proved to be an extremely effective tool on the battlefields of Ukraine. We think they provide an increased amount of protection, mobility and firepower when compared to lighter wheeled vehicles and could save lives. With public finances stretched, this transfer may be beneficial as it comes with no new cost to the taxpayer.",
        "background": "The UK has approximately 632 Warrior IFVs: 80 awaiting near-term disposal and the rest expected to be scrapped by 2030. The Government should offer to transfer them to Ukraine. We think this would provide an increase in Ukraine's capabilities, without incurring cost to the Treasury.",
