        "additional_details": "Every citizen deserves a voice in shaping their freedom. Digital IDs may promise convenience, but they also risk mass surveillance, data misuse, and loss of privacy the foundation of democracy itself. The people of the UK must have the right to decide whether to trade liberty for control. A referendum isn\u2019t resistance to progress, it\u2019s a stand for choice, transparency, and the principle that government power should always remain accountable to the people.",
        "background": "I\u2019m calling on Parliament to give the British people a choice a referendum on Digital IDs. This isn't a small policy change it\u2019s a fundamental shift in our privacy, freedom, and identity. The government must let us decide if we want a future of digital control or the freedom to remain independent.",
