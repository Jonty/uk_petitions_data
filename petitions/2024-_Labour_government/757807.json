        "action": "An immediate by-election to be called if an MP defects to another party.",
        "additional_details": "The government should introduce a clear legal requirement that any MP who defects from the party they were elected under must trigger an automatic by-election. This would protect democratic mandates, uphold voter trust, prevent political opportunism, and ensure constituents always have a direct say when their representation fundamentally changes.",
        "background": "A by-election after an MP defects is essential to democracy. Voters elect a party and its values, not just an individual. Changing allegiance breaks that mandate. A by-election restores trust, accountability, and gives constituents the right to choose their representation again.",
