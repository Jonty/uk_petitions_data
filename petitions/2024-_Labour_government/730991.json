        "additional_details": "We believe it could help music education flourish in schools. We believe access to instrumental music lessons should not just be for the wealthy or elite. We believe that if a child wishes to learn an instrument, they should be able to without any financial barriers. A UK Music report stated the music industry contributed \u00a37.6 billion to the UK economy in 2023. We are concerned it could decrease if we do not invest in our youth. In 2021, the Scottish Government abolished these fees. We can do the same!",
        "background": "We urge the Government to full fund 1:1 music instrument lessons for all children aged 11-16 in all secondary schools in England. We believe this could close the \u201ccultural capital gap\u201d by ensuring all students can access these lessons regardless of their household income. ",
