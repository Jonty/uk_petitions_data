        "additional_details": "We believe the Climate Change Act 2008 and related Net Zero targets are both now in effect based on just one side of a two-sided scientific debate as we do not consider there to be a scientific consensus on the hypothesis of human emissions causing climate change. We consider that one side only of a two-sided scientific debate is not an acceptable basis for significant legislation that could have major impacts of the UK's economy and citizens. We want the issue of Climate Change to be reconsidered from scratch based on views and evidence from all sides.",
        "background": "We consider that Parliament must revoke The Climate Change Act 2008 and related Net Zero targets as since 2008 when The Climate Change Act became law many hundreds of scientists up to the highest Nobel Laureate level have jointly declared \"There is no climate emergency\".",
