        "additional_details": "Electric hand dryers terrify some autistic children. They can cause them to panic, cry, cover their ears and wipe their wet hands on their clothes. Autism affects 1 in 100 people in the UK; many with noise sensitivities avoid toilets or outings. We think paper hand towels as a quiet alternative are simple, low-cost and effective. They can reduce anxiety, and make public spaces inclusive for autistic children and adults.",
        "background": "Require public toilets (including shops, restaurants, and public buildings) to provide paper hand towels as an accessible alternative to electric dryers. This could support proper hand drying and hygiene for people with sensory sensitivities, such as autistic individuals distressed by dryer noise.",
