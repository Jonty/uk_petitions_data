        "action": "Review the Vaping Products Duty \u2013 Protect Public Health and Small Businesses",
        "additional_details": "This duty will drastically raise prices on refillable e-liquids, making them unaffordable for many ex-smokers. Meanwhile, disposables\u2014linked to youth vaping\u2014are impacted far less. The flat rate risks pushing people back to smoking or into the black market. Small businesses will suffer, and public health gains will be lost. We urge a fairer, evidence-based approach.",
        "background": "We want the Government to review the Vaping Products Duty, reconsider the flat \u00a32.20 per 10ml rate, and engage with small businesses to avoid devastating public health tools, pricing out ex-smokers, and fuelling the black market.",
