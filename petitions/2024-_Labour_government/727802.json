        "action": "Stop Changes to ILR/Citizenship Residency Rule",
        "additional_details": "Migrants who came to the UK legally have worked, paid taxes, and contributed to public services and the economy. Many moved here during critical periods like COVID-19, with families, under the understanding that they could settle after 5 years. Changing the rule to 10 years now is unfair, destabilising, and erodes trust. The UK should honour existing commitments and protect those who followed the law and helped build this country.",
        "background": "Do not change the ILR and citizenship residency requirement from 5 to 10 years, as proposed in the May 2025 White Paper. This change unfairly penalises migrants who came legally, built families here, and contributed to the UK in good faith under existing rules.",
