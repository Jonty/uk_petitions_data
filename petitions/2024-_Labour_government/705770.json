        "action": "Halt the transfer of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius",
        "additional_details": "The Chagos Islands have significant strategic importance to the UK and its allies, playing a crucial role in regional stability and maritime protection. The transfer compromises our national and international security.\r\nThe Chagossian people, with their historic ties to the islands, were not sufficiently consulted. This deal has not fully considered their interests.\r\nWe urge Parliament to halt the transfer, and hereafter follow due parliamentary process on matters of sovereignty such as this.",
        "background": "The Government announced in early October it will give up the British Indian Ocean Territory, and hand it to Mauritius.\r\nIn the interests of national security and of the Chagossian people, we ask that the Government call a halt to this plan, and retain sovereignty of these islands.",
