        "additional_details": "Many schools - particularly secondary refuse students access to the toilet during lesson times. Going to the toilet is a human right and shouldn\u2019t be refused.\r\n\r\nYoung females find this a particular challenge especially during menstrual cycles. Many schools including our own require you to go to the Drs and pay for a note from the gp to allow a child a \u2018toilet pass\u2019 - other schools even go to the length of locking toilets! Protect our kids and make it law in schools to use the toilet as needed.",
        "background": "Stop schools taking away human rights\r\n\r\nAccess to sanitation and toilets is a human right in the UK\r\n\r\nSchools\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) states that children have the right to access clean, appropriately stocked toilets whenever they need to",
