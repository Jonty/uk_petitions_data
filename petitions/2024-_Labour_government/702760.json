        "additional_details": "I think the DVSA should upgrade the booking site so only one booking can be done per license, unless someone has failed a test. I believe the government should review the booking process so that it is closely monitored with heavy fines and ADI badges taken off people caught selling tests. I believe the online booking system is vulnerable to bots which can buy multiple tests. I believe that extending the validity of the driving theory test certificate to 3 years could help with this process.",
