For 810 years that right has protected citizens from political overreach in our courts of law.\r\nThis government cannot claim a mandate to remove that right as there was no manifesto promise to alter a person's right to trial by Jury so any government elected by a voting minority has no right to remove fundamental rights from the people without a full referendum vote.",
        "background": "The government should cease all plans to withdraw the people's right to a Jury trials unless the people indicate their willingness to surrender that right via a referendum.",
