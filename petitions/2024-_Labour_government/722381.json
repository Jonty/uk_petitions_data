        "additional_details": "* I have seen so many school children suffer from deteriorating mental health, and a introduction to something like this would be beneficial for them.\r\n* This balances work and rest more equally, which is part of children\u2019s rights.\r\n* Teachers can also benefit from this, since they have more time to prepare lessons and organise.\r\n* More time to prepare for exams, assignments, etc\r\nThere are so many more reasons why this could be such a crucial thing to students and teachers.\r\n\r\n The current school week in hours is 30 hours, so if any parent is worried about missed education, we could also introduce Monday-Wednesday school days ending at 4pm and Thursdays ending at 3pm.",
        "background": "I think that children would benefit from a introduction of 3 day week-ends. This has many benefits for both teachers/school staff and students.",
