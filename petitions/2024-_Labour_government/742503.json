Get all their homework done as they had extra 40 minutes of the day to be free. Allow students who live far away to rest as they may need to wake up earlier than the rest of the students and it would make school a lot more fun and a better learning experience.",
        "background": "Parliament/Government should make school days start at 9 am and end at 3 pm to allow students to rest properly and have a good nights rest and to start form time across most schools at 9:30 am resulting in a school day of 5 and a half hours.",
