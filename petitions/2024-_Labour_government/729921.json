        "action": "Reform paternity leave to ensure fair and equal parental rights",
        "additional_details": "Improving paternity leave would support child development, strengthen family bonds, and help to close the gender pay gap by encouraging more balanced caregiving responsibilities. Reforming the system would better reflect the shared role of parents in raising children and help to create a more inclusive, supportive society for all families.\r\nThe current provisions do not reflect the needs of modern families or promote gender equality. We want the Government to reform statutory paternity leave.",
        "background": "We urge that the Government extends statutory paternity leave beyond the current two weeks, increases paternity pay to a level that makes it financially viable for all fathers and partners to take time off, and ensures equal parental leave opportunities for same-sex couples and adoptive parents.",
