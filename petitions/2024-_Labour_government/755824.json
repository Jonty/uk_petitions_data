        "additional_details": "We think the CMS lacks transparency, proportionality and due process and that it operates in favour of the receiving parent. Calculated on gross income, weak due process and opaque enforcement can disproportionately impact paying parents. Unexplained arrears, deductions and reasons can cause financial distress, instability and documented mental health issues. Reform is needed to align with basic tax principles, administrative justice, and accountability, while preventing misuse of the system.",
        "background": "Reform CMS by calculating maintenance using net income, tax maintenance as income for the receiving parent, allowing reductions for denied contact, mandatory auditable arrears explanations, cease liability at 16, ensure due process before deductions, prosecute false declarations by either parent.",
