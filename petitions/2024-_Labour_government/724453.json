        "additional_details": "Currently, only MPs can trigger a vote of no confidence. We believe this power should also be available to the people, especially in times of widespread dissatisfaction. A defined legal process would ensure this power is democratic, orderly, and used responsibly.\r\n\r\nThis reform would strengthen public accountability and restore trust in our democratic system.",
        "background": "We call on Parliament to introduce legislation allowing UK citizens to trigger a public vote of no confidence in the Government. If a set number of verified signatures is reached, the law would require a binding national vote on whether the Government should stay in office.",
