Many schools lack the resources to provide adequate support, leaving students without the help they need. Increased government funding would ensure every school can offer professional mental health services, helping students cope with challenges and succeed in their education.",
        "background": "We want the Government to increase funding for mental health services in all schools, ensuring that every student has access to professional support. This includes hiring more school counsellors, funding mental health training for staff, and integrating mental health education into the curriculum.",
