        "action": "Close the loophole that allows Russian oil into the UK",
        "additional_details": "Russia is getting hundreds of millions of pounds in revenue from its crude oil sales to India, Turkey and China.  In buying refined fuel from these countries, the UK supports this trade which helps fund Russia\u2019s unprovoked, unjustified and illegal war against Ukraine.  We believe it is time for the UK to stop doing this.  We need effective sanctions in order to show our solidarity with Ukraine. As the current sanctions do not fulfil their function, we believe that they need to be amended.",
        "background": "We call upon the UK government to amend the sanctions against Russia to include fuels that were refined in other countries but made from Russian oil.  Buying fuel from these countries means that Russian oil is still coming into the UK in the millions of barrels. Current sanctions are not working.",
