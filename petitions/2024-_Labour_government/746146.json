        "additional_details": "At present a digital ID petition has nearly 3 million signatures, the Online Safety Act petition exceeded 500,000, and multiple petitions on illegal migration and benefits have huge support - yet we feel the government has dismissed them all. Currently, ministers can ignore millions of concerned citizens after a brief debate. We believe mandatory votes at 1M signatures and referendums at 5M would force government to act on issues the public cares deeply about, restoring accountability to a broken system.",
