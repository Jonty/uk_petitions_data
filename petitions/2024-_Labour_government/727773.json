        "additional_details": "This proposal would unfairly impact the future of thousands of migrants who have followed UK immigrations rules, paid taxes, supported the economy of the country, supported public services and built their lives in Britain.\r\nThese individuals form the backbone of many essential services and have made long term life decisions, financial, familial, and professional based on the current 5 year settlement framework. \r\nThat cause insecurity and distress for legal residents and their families.",
        "background": "We implore you to raise this issue in Parliament and:  \r\n- Oppose extending the ILR qualifying period for legal migrants.  \r\n- Provide transitional protections for those already on the 5-year pathway.  \r\n- Acknowledge the contributions of taxpaying, rule-abiding immigrants.",
