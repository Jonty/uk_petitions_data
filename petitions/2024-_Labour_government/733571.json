        "additional_details": "It has become far too easy for parties to lie to the people about what they will do after being elected with no real consequences for doing so. This situation renders our democratic system significantly compromised as we the people no longer have a say in what happens to our country, our vote becomes uniformed, and hence void. This bill will mean the power is given back to the people and their vote will once again stand for what they believe it to stand for, rather than an ulterior manifesto.",
        "background": "A bill which requires parties to officially define their manifesto before general elections in a legally binding document. A new regulatory body established of impartial authority to determine whether governments have breached said document. In emergency situations an appeal may be made to alter.",
