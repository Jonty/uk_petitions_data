        "additional_details": "We believe that Institutions that fail to act should face penalties for their negligence. We believe major banks in England and Wales have ignored clear cases of blackmail and money laundering, allowing criminals to exploit victims. We believe banks have failed to report suspicious activity through Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), leaving victims unprotected. I urge Parliament to put forward stricter AML laws, hold banks accountable, and protect victims from financial coercion. We think stronger oversight, penalties for negligence, and victim support systems are essential. The Government must act now.",
