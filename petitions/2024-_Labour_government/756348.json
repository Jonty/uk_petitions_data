        "additional_details": "The licence fee currently makes the BBC totally independent of public opinion or requirements. Whatever the BBC says or does its income is theoretically guaranteed by the iniquitous legally imposed licence fee. It is clearly insulting for TV viewers to have to pay a fee to the BBC so they can legally watch GB News, Sky News or ANY other live TV programmes. Objectors face prosecution with a fine or prison sentence by refusing to pay the licence fee.",
        "background": "Parliament must scrap the licence fee and make the BBC a subscription only service. Any form of UK taxpayer funding is totally unacceptable.",
