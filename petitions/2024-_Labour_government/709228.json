I understand the need for taxation but this is double taxation and extremely stressful to our aging population.\r\nThe death tax is something that causes a great deal of stress and drives wealth out of this wonderful country.",
        "background": "Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway and the list goes on all have no death tax. The USA has a 13million dollar threshold, before a penny of tax is paid. Why cant we make it that people want to stay here for there entire lives, instead of leaving so there hard work is not taken away.",
