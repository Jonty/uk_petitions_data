        "additional_details": "The Saturday \"3pm blackout\", introduced in 1960, is out of date and does not benefit football fans. Tickets to football matches are becoming increasingly expensive and hard to purchase due to the number of people who want to attend games. The 3pm blackout was intended to help football clubs financially. Premier League clubs earn much of their money from TV rights and the sale of other items, like merchandise. Clubs would earn a lot more if all their games were televised and UK fans would not miss out.",
        "background": "Remove the Saturday 3pm TV blackout for all Premier League matches. Football fans in other countries can watch every Premier League game, while fans in the UK cannot. Removing the 3pm blackout would financially benefit the football industry and football fans.",
