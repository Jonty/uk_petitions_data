        "additional_details": "We believe that this has reduced morale for staff who provide essential frontline care and that many care workers feel their families are treated as a burden, despite their important contribution.\r\n \r\nCare workers pay taxes and fill key shortage roles, and their contribution should not be judged solely on salary thresholds that are set by the Government.\r\n \r\nWe request that the Government reinstate the right to bring dependants, and ensure fair immigration policy supports family unity for all contributing workers.\r\n",
        "background": "We ask the Government to allow all Care Workers (SOC 6135) and Senior Care Workers (SOC 6136) to bring dependants under the Skilled Worker visa route. We feel the current policy has significantly affected family life, for care workers who are separated from spouses and children for long periods.",
