        "additional_details": "Our grievance is the compulsory nature of the TV license fee. Despite paying for this service, we are not receiving the quality and unbiased information we are entitled to expect. It is a fundamental right of the public to have access to reliable and impartial news, and as such, this failure represents a breach of trust and misuse of public funds. The consequences of the BBC's repeated instances of biases and inaccuracies extend beyond misinformation. It is time to end the TV license for everyone.",
        "background": "Recent failures have highlighted significant breaches in the BBC's duty. As consumers, we are no longer receiving a satisfactory service. Instead, we are subjected to impartiality breaches, inaccurate reports, antisemitism and institutional failures. Enough is enough.",
