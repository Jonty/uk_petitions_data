        "additional_details": "Taxing people on already taxed money for tips is wrong. The person gifting the tip has already paid tax on their money, a new tax bracket is then worked out for the person receiving the tips which can vary from month to month making the calculations differ resulting in the receiver of a tip having to pay more tax. To tip someone is a personal thing and I believe amongst many others to be taxed on this is criminal.",
