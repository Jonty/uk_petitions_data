        "action": "Ban the sale of fireworks to members of the public and amend the legal hours.",
        "additional_details": "Fireworks cause widespread distress: pets experience anxiety and injuries, wildlife faces disorientation and death, and people with PTSD and autism endure severe stress. Silent fireworks minimise these impacts while still allowing celebrations. Restricting times (7-11 PM) further reduces disturbances. A ban on public sales would curb dangerous misuse and prevent accidental injuries, ensuring public and environmental safety. It's time to balance celebration with community wellbeing.",
        "background": "Ban the public sale of fireworks, restricting them to silent displays on key celebrations (Bonfire Night, Diwali, Chinese New Year) between 7-11 PM. This protects wildlife, reduces distress for pets, and prevents trauma triggers for people with PTSD or autism, ensuring community safety.",
