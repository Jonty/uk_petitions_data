        "additional_details": "The Equality Act 2010 requires public bodies to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people. However, autistic parents in SEND proceedings are often expected to manage complex legal cases without adjustments. We want a review of the system to include considering what reasonable adjustments can be offered to parents who declare a disability, and how tribunals can proactively identify and provide these adjustments rather than relying on parents to repeatedly request them.\r\n \r\nWe also call on the Government to extend legal aid to cover all SEND tribunals where the parent or carer is disabled and to create a SEND Equality Officer role to oversee the process to ensure it meets standards for accessibility, and that tribunals comply.\r\n",
        "background": "We think autistic parents are currently denied equal access to justice when representing their children in the Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND) Tribunal, and call on the Government to review this as autistic parents deserve equal access to justice when advocating for their children.",
