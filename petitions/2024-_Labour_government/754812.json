The Government should improve coordination with ports and border agencies, properly consult affected communities, and ensure emergency services and local roads are not routinely disrupted.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to urgently review and reform Operation Brock on the M20. Its frequent use causes severe disruption to residents, businesses, emergency services and the environment. Fairer, more effective alternatives must be developed and communities consulted",
