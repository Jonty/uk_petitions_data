        "additional_details": "I believe British lives are blighted by this legislation. Our steel making capabilities (best in the world) devastated, with thousands of redundancies. Our car making industry devastated, again with thousands of lost jobs. I believe millions in wasted money on carbon capture. Green windmills costing billions that don't work efficiently. Solar Panels (in the UK) that cover the landscape, rather than farm the land to feed us. That's only scratching the surface of the cost to all of us.\r\nThe Climate Act MUST be repealed, and this madness stopped.",
        "background": "Previous government(s) rammed through legislation committing the UK to achieving net zero. Only voted for by MP's. Never consulting the public. Now we're saddled with it, and feeling the 'real' cost to every person in the land.",
