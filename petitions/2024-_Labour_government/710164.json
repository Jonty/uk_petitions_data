        "additional_details": "Historically, medical research has disproportionately focused on men\u2019s bodies. We believe this has left gaps in the understanding and treatment of conditions unique to or more prevalent in women. We think this lack of investment in women\u2019s health could have contributed to delayed diagnoses, inadequate treatments, and preventable suffering for millions of women across the UK. \r\n \r\nBy funding dedicated research on women\u2019s bodies, the Government could help address these inequalities, improve health outcomes, and pave the way for a healthcare system that truly supports everyone. We believe it\u2019s time to close the gender health gap and ensure that women\u2019s health is not an afterthought.",
