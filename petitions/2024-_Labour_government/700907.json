        "action": "Make all fireworks both public sale and commercial noiseless.",
        "additional_details": "The government or parliament should pass a law making fireworks noiseless so that military veterans suffering from PTSD and animals are not left in a state of fear in which they have no escape from. Imagine yourself in a terrifying situation that you can't escape from, where you can't stop shaking, can't sleep and end up having a mental breakdown. That is how animals feel and PTSD sufferers have it worse as they know what is coming, but are unable to avoid it. It is torture for them.",
        "background": "I firmly believe that fireworks should be made noiseless in the UK. Every year animals and people are affected by the noise of fireworks. \r\n\r\nMilitary veterans who suffer from PTSD are severely affected by the sound of fireworks, as are all animals ranging from domestic pets to livestock.",
