        "additional_details": "The UK's First Past the Post system enables governments to impose laws eroding fundamental rights, often without the majority's support. This must change. If one million citizens petition against such laws within six months of enactment, a binding referendum must take place. If the people reject the law, it must be repealed. The final power to safeguard freedoms like speech, protest, and privacy rests with us\u2014the people\u2014NOT politicians or political parties.",
        "background": "UK governments can pass oppressive laws with little public backing, trampling rights like privacy and liberty. Citizens need a Citizens Bill of Rights with referendum powers to veto laws that threaten freedom. People are the guardians of liberty NOT politicians",
