        "additional_details": "Fireworks are being set off constantly, not just on festivals, creating loud noise, air pollution, and distress for people, pets, and wildlife. Streets and public spaces are unsafe due to careless displays. We urge the Government and local councils to enforce the rules, limit fireworks to specific events, and protect public health, peace, and safety across the UK.",
        "background": "We want the Government to ban the public sale of fireworks and allow only licensed, organised displays. This will reduce noise, pollution, and risks to people, pets, and property, while ensuring celebrations are safe, controlled, and environmentally responsible.",
