        "additional_details": "Speed cameras on motorways can distract drivers and cause sudden braking and confusion, especially where speed limits change frequently. It has been noted that this can increase accident risks rather than reduce them. Fines also lead to higher insurance costs and stress. The Government should focus on improving road surfaces and maintenance, ensure clearer, consistent speed limits, and consider safely increasing motorway speed limits where conditions allow.",
        "background": "We want the Government to remove speed cameras from motorways in England.  There is strong evidence that they distract drivers, cause sudden braking and confusion when limits change, and increase accident risk. The focus should be on education and clear, consistent speed limits instead.",
