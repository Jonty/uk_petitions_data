        "additional_details": "We believe Somaliland meets all criteria for statehood under international law. We believe its 1960 union with Somalia is invalid, as it was never legally formalised. Since 1991, we think Somaliland has built a stable democracy, ensured peace, and contributed to regional stability. We think the UK, with 200+ years of history with Somaliland and as the first to grant it independence, has a moral and historical role to lead the effort for re-recognition, rectifying this long-standing injustice and reinforcing international law.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to re-recognise Somaliland as an independent state, restoring what we believe is its rightful place in the international community in accordance with international law, established historical precedent, and the principle of state continuity.",
