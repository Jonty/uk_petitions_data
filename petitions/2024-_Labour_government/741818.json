        "action": "Extend the Fuel Duty Freeze for Motorists For At Least Two More Years",
        "additional_details": "The freeze helps to reduce the cost of transport, helping provide financial relief for drivers as well as businesses by staving off fuel inflation in the face of rising prices. Government estimates suggests 36 million people are currently positively affected by this freeze. This petition only concerns duties on fuels for individual motorists, who we believe are most at risk of these rising prices, and businesses using road transport, with raises for other fuels potentially helping to offset the continued freeze.",
        "background": "Extend the temporary cut on fuel duty for motorists, set to end in March 2026 for a minimum of 2 more years, ensure fuel duty rates for motorists continue to stay frozen at the current headline rate during this period and set clear targets for further freezes in the future.",
