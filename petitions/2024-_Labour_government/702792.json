        "action": "Ensure Freedom of Speech & Expression: Align UK Laws with Democratic Principles",
        "additional_details": "Current UK laws have led to imprisonment for non-violent statements or historic social media posts. This stifles dialogue, fosters self-censorship, and erodes trust in justice. Reforming laws to protect free expression, while prioritising alternatives like education to address hate speech, would ensure speech is criminalised only when inciting violence or direct harm. This approach avoids undermining rehabilitation, safeguards freedoms, and fosters open debate.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to reform speech laws to protect free expression, vital in a democratic society. Speech that does not incite violence or harm should be safeguarded, ensuring individuals are not prosecuted for non-violent, historical, or controversial opinions.",
