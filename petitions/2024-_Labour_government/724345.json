        "additional_details": "For a decade, the open border between Ireland and N, Ireland has allowed for the free movement of citizens. However, we think this policy has been exploited, leading to a surge in illegal immigration. We think the unchecked of individuals across the border has contributed to rising public violence and unrest, that threaten the safety of our communities. We believe that the government should take action to this situation by adding reinstating checkpoints.",

By adding checkpoints, we think the Government could manage cross-border movement, prevent illegal activities and people illegally crossing. We want the government to take immediate action on this issue",
