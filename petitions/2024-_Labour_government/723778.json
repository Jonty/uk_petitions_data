        "action": "To pass a law making election manifesto legally enforceable.",
        "additional_details": "By introducing this law, political parties would be held to account for their promises.  If they fail to deliver on commitments, voters should have the ability to challenge the government through legal means. In some cases, a party should be removed from office or face legal consequences for not fulfilling its pledges. The law would ensure that parties and politicians prioritise their commitments to the public. I believe this law will make politicians more accountable to people they represent.",
        "background": "We want the UK government to make political party manifestos legally binding documents, holding parties accountable for the promises they made during elections. Currently, there is no legal obligation for parties to fulfil their manifesto pledges once elected, no recourse if promises are broken.",
