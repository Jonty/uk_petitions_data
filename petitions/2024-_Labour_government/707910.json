        "action": "Lower the earnings threshold for family visas to ensure reunification.",
        "additional_details": "The high earnings threshold for family visas creates unnecessary barriers, separating families and causing emotional and financial distress. Many people on lower wages, including key workers, struggle to meet this requirement. Reducing the threshold would promote family unity, reduce hardship, and ensure that families can live together, strengthening social bonds and supporting well-being. Family reunification should not depend on income, as it is a basic human right.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to reduce the financial requirement for family visas. The current threshold excludes many families from being reunited, causing hardship. A lower earnings requirement will allow more people to bring their loved ones to the UK, supporting family unity and well-being.",
