        "action": "Require food establishments to have adrenaline autoinjectors readily available",
        "additional_details": "Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) can be life-threatening and often requires immediate treatment with adrenaline (epinephrine), commonly administered through EpiPens. In our view with food allergies becoming increasingly common, the potential risk of accidental exposure in restaurants, cafes, and other food establishments is a serious concern. We have seen too many fatal incidents where people including children have died because of consuming foods they are allergic to. We think having adrenaline autoinjectors available could help save lives.",
        "background": "We call on the UK government to introduce legislation requiring all food establishments to have adrenaline autoinjectors e.g. EpiPens readily available and ensure staff receive basic training on their use. We believe making these available in food establishments could save lives.\r\n\u2028",
