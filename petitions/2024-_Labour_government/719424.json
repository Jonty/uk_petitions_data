        "additional_details": "A wailing siren's constantly changing pitch can disguise Doppler effects and interaural timing cues, which can make it difficult to discern the direction and distance.\r\n \r\nWe think a two-tone siren provides more predictable and consistent auditory cues that the brain can use for localisation.\r\n \r\nAlso, we want our emergency personnel to behave - and be treated like - British bobbies, not American cops. We view the siren an important subconscious nudge as to who we are and how we should behave.",
        "background": "We feel there has been an increased use of American style \u201cwailing\u201d sirens on our emergency service vehicles. We think this is a mistake, and that these are less safe. We believe they also represent a loss of a small but important bit of cultural capital.",
