        "action": "Restore winter fuel payment to people getting old pension born pre April 1953",
        "additional_details": "The difference between the old and new pension is surely an injustice. Age is a protected characteristic under the Equality Act. The old pension should really be brought up to the level of the new pension. Restoring the winter fuel payment to pensioners in this category would be a very helpful first step.",
        "background": "When reviewing the winter fuel payment, please prioritise people receiving the old pension: women born before 6.4.1953 and men born before 6.4.1951. The gap between the old and new pension increases with each triple lock. The need for pensioners to be protected from cold increases with age.",
