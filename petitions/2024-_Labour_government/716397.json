We think it is highly likely this analysis has never been done. In our view, the government is replacing hundreds of thousands of acres of green land with hundreds of thousands of tonnes of metal, plastics and concrete, and it is doing all this without the explicit permission of its citizens and, seemingly, without any understanding whatsoever of the net impact. One of the biggest transformations of Britain must be understood by the public.",
