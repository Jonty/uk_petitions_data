        "additional_details": "This will result hopefully in less dog attacks and attacks on humans who try to intervene usually resulting in the human getting hurt themselves . A law passed would deter hopefully the mindless owners who have no regard for nervous dogs and owners who feel frightened and let down by authorities , namely the police who very rarely do any thing about these things happening as it is often difficult to trace owners after they leave the scene,",
        "background": "I would like Parliament to pass a law please due to a lot of recent attacks on dogs which are on leads which are then attacked , mauled and resulting in some cases the death of family pets, making it illegal for owners to walk dogs off lead.",
