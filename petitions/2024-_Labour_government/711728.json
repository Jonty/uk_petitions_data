        "additional_details": "Public support has emerged for \"Maggie's\r\nLaw,\" which calls for a centralized microchip database for breeding care and welfare. Without mandatory tracking and health checks, the rise in hereditary diseases and psychological distress will continue. The solution to this lies in the creation of a centralized microchip database dedicated to breeding care and welfare. This would enhance existing legislation to further protect licensed and unlicensed breeding dogs and promote responsible pet ownership.",
        "background": "The practices of both licensed and unlicensed breeders have led to countless dogs and puppies enduring health problems and psychological distress. This situation underscores the critical necessity for a centralized microchip database to enhance breeding standards and promote better care and welfare.",
