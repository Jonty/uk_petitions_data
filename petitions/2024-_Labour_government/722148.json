        "additional_details": "The UK is a rich and developed nation, yet the roadsides (particularly on motorway slip roads or dual carriageways) are strewn with litter. The authorities need to start taking this issue more seriously, for the sake of wildlife and the environment. Plastic litter is getting stuck in trees and polluting rivers. Animals are getting trapped and strangled when they encounter plastic waste. It is a national disgrace and a big clean up is the first step to start tackling this.",
        "background": "I would like the government to address the growing environmental issue of roadside litter in the UK. Highways England and local authorities should clear up this rubbish, but this is not done regularly enough. A dedicated team needs establishing to clean up the roadsides on a regular basis.",
