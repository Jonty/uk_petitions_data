        "additional_details": "We've seen first hand how the OSA has severely affected numerous adults, but especially towards those who're on benefits due to a wide range of mental & physical disabilities. Credit Cards AREN'T acquirable by those who rely solely on benefits from the Government, and this must be addressed and corrected.\r\n\r\nFor example; if the T&C for a site states that a user must be 13 to use its paid services, then an account that is 5 years old should be able to purchase and view age restricted content.",
        "background": "The current advise set by ofcom for multiple platforms is to perform Age Verification via Credit Cards. This is Ableist in nature & dehumanizes disabled individuals by restricting and barring us access to content we have full legal right to.",
