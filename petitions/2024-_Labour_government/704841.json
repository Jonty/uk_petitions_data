        "additional_details": "We think it\u2019s alarming that 2.8 million people in the UK cannot afford basic period products, with a 75% increase from 2022 highlighting the urgency. Period poverty affects health, dignity, and participation in daily life. We think a free pad and tampon scheme through the NHS would reduce financial strain and support equality. We think this initiative would improve menstrual health, align with public health goals, and create a more inclusive society.",
        "background": "We think the Government should fund an NHS scheme where individuals should be able to sign up to receive free essential period products each month, as we think access to basic period hygiene should be available to everyone who needs it.",
