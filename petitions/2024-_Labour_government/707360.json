        "additional_details": "Fire alarms can save lives. In the year ending March 2023, people were 12 times more likely to die in a fire if they didn't have a working smoke alarm in their home. Smoke alarms can provide critical early warnings, especially for vulnerable individuals like children or the elderly. We think they are cost-effective and align with other safety laws, such as seatbelt mandates. Mandating alarms could ensure safety, reduce preventable deaths, and relieve emergency services.",
        "background": "We urge the government to make it illegal for homes in England to be without fire alarms. This measure could ensure a basic standard of safety, protect lives and reduce the risk of preventable tragedies caused by house fires. Let\u2019s prioritise safety in every household.",
