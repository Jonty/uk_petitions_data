        "additional_details": "Some secondary age students find that the current RSHE curriculum is irrelevant and outdated. Students have lessons about healthy eating and emotions, yet many still do not know how to pay bills, pay taxes or help someone that is severely injured. Life skills are crucial to the futures of our youth, and in turn the future of this country. Our curriculum must be updated and must change now.",
        "background": "We believe the current RSHE curriculum does little to nothing to support secondary students in their adult life. We must replace RSHE lessons with lessons in basic life skills, such as first aid, how to pay bills, how to find and follow recipes, critical thinking etc. This is our country's future.",
