Not all are fortunate to have a private pension, and many rely solely on a state pension. This is also needed to counteract increased energy prices (which increased from 01/01/25). According to the House of Commons Library - \u201cEnergy prices have fallen since summer 2023, but are still be well above pre-'energy crisis' levels and there is little prospect of large cuts to bills in the near future.\u201d",

We think we should go for a tapered approach to the WFA instead of a straight cut off, based on household income. We think the current cut off is not reasonable.",
