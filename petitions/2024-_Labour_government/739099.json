Graduates can\u2019t afford to live or build careers, causing wasted talent, harming UK productivity, innovation, and societal health. We demand automatic Universal Credit for job-seeking grads, tailored job support, clear hiring standards, and fair-paid career programs. Graduates seek dignity and opportunity; the government must act now.",

Unpaid roles, underemployment and ineligibility for Universal Credit leaves them without financial support, highlighting a systemic failure.",
