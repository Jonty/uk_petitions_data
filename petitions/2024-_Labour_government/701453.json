        "additional_details": "Reports suggest that 36,000 penalty charge notices are issued every day in private car parks. We believe the appeals process is unfit for purpose. The private parking industry even launched its own code which came into force on 1st October 2024. We think this code fails to address the need for fair caps on charges, fully independent appeals and an end to potential harassment. We believe it's time for the Government to legislate to help protect motorists.",
