        "additional_details": "A report has suggested that drink driving collisions represent 17% of all deaths on UK roads and this has increased over the last 15 years. By contrast, Australia introduced RBT in the 1980\u2019s and has seen a significant and sustained drop in road fatalities since. It has been reported that the key ingredients for success appear to be continued, highly visible police enforcement together with extensive publicity. We believe we must adopt the same deterrent strategy.",
