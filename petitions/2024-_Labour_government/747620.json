        "action": "Reverse the cuts to International Baccalaureate (IB) funding in state schools",
        "additional_details": "Having studied and taught the IB, I\u2019ve seen how it broadens horizons, raises aspirations, and builds global awareness. Cutting IB funding in state schools, with no consultation, makes it a privilege only for the wealthy, forces state pupils into a narrow British-centric curriculum, and could deepen social divides. It goes against the Government\u2019s supposed principles of equality, opportunity, and levelling up that should underpin our education system. Reverse this decision now or be poorer for it",
        "background": "The Government should reverse its decision to withdraw funding for the International Baccalaureate (IB) in state schools. Removing this support without consultation will make the IB available only to private school students, undermining equality and access to a world-class education.",
