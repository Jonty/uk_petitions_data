        "additional_details": "We understand the need for a balanced immigration policy, but we respectfully urge you to consider the impact of such a significant change on those who have already invested years in the UK, contributing to its economy, public services, and diverse society. Many of us are just a year or two away from applying for ILR, and this abrupt shift feels like a moving of the goalposts, affecting not just our careers but our families and mental well-being.",
        "background": "The skilled migrant community is deeply concerned about the proposed extension of the Indefinite Leave to Remain period from 5 to 10 years, announced on May 12th. Applying this change retrospectively would unfairly disrupt lives and alter the expectations many relied on when choosing to relocate.",
