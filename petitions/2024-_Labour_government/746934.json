        "additional_details": "Wigan Council forced through 18m warehouses towering over homes and a school - no Environmental Impact Assessment, no Landscape Review, no public consultation, and maps that erased local houses. \r\n\r\nFamilies are breathing dust & living in shadows. We have been subjected to pollution, noise, & health problems - & the warehouses will be open 24/7.\r\n\r\nThis is a systemic failure that demands independent investigation & accountability. Government must intervene and review how this was allowed to happen.",
        "background": "The Government should commission an independent investigation into Wigan Council planning department's handling of the Astley Business Park warehouse development, examining its planning processes, competence, ethics, and oversight, and suspend further work until the review is complete.",
