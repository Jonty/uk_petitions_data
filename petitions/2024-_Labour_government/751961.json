        "additional_details": "We believe the current maintenance loan system is not fit for purpose and that students do not receive enough support to fund their studies. This can stop students from attending university or may force them to work, which can negatively impact their studies. We believe much of these failings are driven by the disparities in cost of living between UK cities, which the current system does not accommodate for. To address this, we believe the amount a student receives should vary based on the cost of living of where they study.",
        "background": "Currently students studying in London receive a higher student loan than students studying in other cities. Yet outside of London, the figure is uniform, despite vast disparities in the cost of living between different university locations.",
