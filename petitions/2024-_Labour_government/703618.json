        "action": "Introduce a mandatory driving test for moped/small motorcycle users",
        "additional_details": "I believe that across the UK, especially London, many riders drive dangerously and fail to follow road traffic rules, which I believe may be due to inadequate training. I think that it is too easy to ride with an L plate and this puts riders, pedestrians and other road users at risk of preventable collisions. As someone who has often felt unsafe due to the actions of some reckless moped riders, I believe this measure is essential for safer roads.",
        "background": "I urge the government to require all moped and small motorcycle users to pass a mandatory practical and theory driving test before they can ride on a public road to ensure that all road users possess the necessary knowledge and skills to drive safely and responsibly.",
