        "additional_details": "We want the UK Government to resume Syrian asylum claims because the situation in Syria remains unstable and unsafe, even after the fall of the Assad regime.Thousands of Syrian asylum seekers have been left in legal and emotional limbo and this is unacceptable. These individuals are unable to work,study, or plan their future. Families remain separated, children grow up in fear and mental health deteriorates with no hope and no future. Resuming the process is humanitarian obligation.This delay is unfair, unjust and inhumane.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government and the Home Office to immediately lift the pause on Syrian asylum claims and resume processing now. Six months after the fall of the Assad regime. Syria is not safe and remains deeply unstable despite the fall of the Assad regime on 8 December 2024.",
