        "additional_details": "We believe there are unethical practices which must be exposed, condemned, banned, and never repeated.\r\n\r\nGovernment-commissioned documents like Mindspace reveal how fear, emotional priming, and perception manipulation can be used to steer public behaviour. These tactics can undermine informed choice, public trust, and democratic freedoms. The public must be protected from such unethical manipulation. These coercive psychological practices must be banned by law in all government advice and communications to safeguard individual autonomy, transparency, democratic accountability, and the right to decide with freedom.",
