        "additional_details": "We think there is inadequate knowledge about the underlying causes of psychosis; diagnosis is based purely on symptoms shown and medication given on a 'trial and error' basis. In our view, existing anti-psychotics may have low efficacy and serious side effects- some sufferers refuse their medication, which may result in relapses and compulsory hospitalisations. On average, people with schizophrenia / bipolar die 15-20 years prematurely. Poor recovery rates are bad for sufferers and cost the NHS and the economy.",
        "background": "We think the government should direct more research funding to determine the underlying causes of psychosis, develop preventative treatments and evidenced diagnoses. We want more investment to accelerate the introduction of more effective medications with fewer serious side effects.",
