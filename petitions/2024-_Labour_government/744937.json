This decision would have a deeply damaging impact on our children\u2019s education, wellbeing, and sense of security, while also placing our dedicated teachers\u2019 jobs and livelihoods at risk. Schools are at the heart of our community, providing not only learning but also stability, support, and opportunity. We urge the council to reconsider this proposal.",
