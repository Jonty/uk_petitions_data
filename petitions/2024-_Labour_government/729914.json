        "additional_details": "Hongkongers with British National (Overseas) status are British nationals and should not be treated the same as other migrants. We have a unique historical connection to the UK. In 1981, the British Nationality Act stripped us of our British citizenship (formerly CUKC) without the consent of Hongkongers. This was followed by the handover of Hong Kong to China without full democratic consultation with its residents. The UK government has a moral and historic responsibility to us.",
