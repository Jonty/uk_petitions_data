        "additional_details": "Funding caps mean providers will have to cut services once limits are reached, leading to years-long waits and fewer assessment options. Which is already happening within the NHS. Right to Choose was created to ensure fair, timely access to care. These restrictions risk worsening inequalities and delaying vital diagnoses and support. \r\nThese changes will not only lead to so many continuing to suffer, desperate for help and treatment, but also those taking their lives.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to stop Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) from imposing funding caps on Right to Choose providers. These limits will drastically reduce patients access to ADHD and Autism assessments. \r\nThese are life saving assessments.",
