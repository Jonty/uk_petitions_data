        "additional_details": "Renewable energy is generally cheaper to produce than gas. However, units of electricity are sold at the price of the most expensive unit needed to meet demand at a particular moment in time: gas. Therefore, we think energy companies have been able to charge consumers more for renewables than we feel they should. We think that any savings should be passed on, and that the data and technology exist for such transparency and cost saving.",
        "background": "Mandate energy providers to stop charging the same price as expensive gas for much cheaper renewable energy. We think they should pass any savings on to consumers, rather than keeping them as profit.",
