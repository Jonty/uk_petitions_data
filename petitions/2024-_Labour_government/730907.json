        "additional_details": "The UK government's PIP changes threaten vital support for ADHD/autism. Stricter eligibility, like needing 4+ points in one activity, ignores how invisible disabilities cumulatively impact daily life. Removing psychological distress from mobility assessments will isolate many. Restricting how PIP is spent undermines autonomy and access to therapies. This will cause immense hardship and must be stopped.",
        "background": "The UK government's new bill threatens PIP for those with ADHD/autism. It makes it harder to qualify and restricts how funds are used. We need Parliament to stop these changes, keep PIP flexible, and ensure fair assessments that recognise invisible disabilities.",
