        "action": "Ban bottom trawling in Marine Protected Areas and protect 30% of UK sea",
        "additional_details": "Bottom trawling destroys seabed habitats, releases carbon, and harms marine biodiversity. Over 90% of UK Marine Protected Areas still allow it. The UK has pledged to protect 30% of oceans by 2030, but most MPAs lack effective enforcement. We need real action: ban bottom-towed gear in all MPAs and extend proper protection to 30% of UK seas. This will help restore marine life, cut carbon emissions, and support sustainable fishing and coastal communities.",
        "background": "Fully ban bottom-towed fishing gear in all UK Marine Protected Areas. Enforce protections and expand them to cover at least 30% of UK waters by 2030, in line with the UK\u2019s global environmental commitments",
