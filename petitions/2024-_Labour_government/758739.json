        "additional_details": "It\u2019s simple - at the current rate of decline the number of pubs and hospitality businesses will continue having a massive impact on employment, business growth, supplier impact,  communities and social well being. If action is not taken immediately community hubs will be lost and never return. VAT in hospitality is the highest in Europe, business rates are not calculated on profit. Young people support is non existent.",
        "background": "Urgently review the impact of the last two UK Budgets on the hospitality sector, including rising employment costs, energy prices, supply chain inflation and business rates. The current business model is unsustainable. We ask the Government to bring targeted support or reform where necessary asap.",
