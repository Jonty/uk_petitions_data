        "additional_details": "I believe fewer animal bites would occur if animals were better understood. This could reduce the number sent to shelters and released into the wild, disrupting ecosystems. For example, after Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles aired, many bought red-eared sliders without proper care knowledge. Now invasive across several continents, they outcompete native turtles and spread disease\u2014which I believe is because many people release pets they can\u2019t manage.",
        "background": "I urge the Government to require a test, conducted by animal professionals, for anyone who wants to own a pet. I think this test could ensure they can properly care for the animal. I think a separate test should be taken for each and every animal, as they all have different needs and requirements.",
