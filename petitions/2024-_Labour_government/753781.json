        "additional_details": "We were given a one time vote is what David Cameron said. A referendum that would be withheld no matter what the outcome. Ever since nearly every MP as done everything they can to reverse this because it didn\u2019t go their way. Starmer ask many times for another referendum with the backing of the labour and some Tory and Lib Dem\u2019s. Now he\u2019s saying he will not rule out rejoining the EU. This country is doing far better than when in the EU even though they will have you believe the opposite",
        "background": "Respect the referendum vote of 17.4 million. Starmer is talking about taking us back into the EU we voted leave and won the majority vote. One man can not be allowed to reverse this vote on his own. Stop this reversal or better don\u2019t even allow the consideration of this reversal.",
