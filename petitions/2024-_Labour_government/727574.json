        "additional_details": "Mental health is included in UK law, but there\u2019s no legal requirement for prevention. Too many workplaces wait for crisis before taking action. We need enforceable standards\u2014like risk assessments, early intervention training, and preventative policies\u2014to protect people before they break, not after. Prevention must be law, not a luxury.",
        "background": "Update the Health & Safety at Work Act to require employers to take specific, enforceable action to prevent mental ill-health. This includes mandatory risk assessments, training, and standards that are not currently set out in law.",
