        "additional_details": "It is hard for these children to cope academically in highschool. I have twins with EHCP's that struggle on a daily basis and it is heartbreaking to listen to them question why they are not able to transition onto certain college courses if they are unable to acheive the expected GCSE grades. They try their best everday but are still far off from the expected pass grades and will be sitting their exams soon. It is unfair that they are graded the same as a child with no learning disability.",
        "background": "There should be some leniency on grading GCSE's or a lower pass grade for these children so they have a better chance to progress onto further education.",
