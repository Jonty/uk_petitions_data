        "additional_details": "Tourism businesses are struggling with the impact of misleading weather app summaries, which deter visitors from outdoor attractions.\r\n\r\nCurrently, many apps use single summary icons that can inaccurately represent an entire day's forecast. E.g., a brief shower in the morning may lead to a rain icon for the entire day, discouraging potential visitors.\r\n\r\nA change will encourage users to view detailed forecasts rather than make a snap decision. This would better support the UK\u2019s tourism industry.",
