        "action": "Conduct a review of immigration laws and their impact on BNO holders.",
        "additional_details": "The Historical Roots of the Windrush Scandal report outlines racially biased immigration laws that disproportionately impacted non-white Commonwealth citizens. However, it does not directly link these laws to the ongoing challenges faced by BNO holders. The report found laws were designed to reduce the proportion of people living in the UK who did not have white skin. We believe the legacy of these practices continues to affect BNO holders, especially in immigration rights and nationality inheritance.",
        "background": "We want a thorough review of immigration laws and government records to evaluate how past governments and their policies have impacted non-white BNO passport holders, including migration restrictions and limited opportunities, and to assess the lasting impact of these policies on BNO holders.",
