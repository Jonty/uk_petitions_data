Our village has limited infrastructure, including healthcare access, public transport and our schools. These services are already under pressure and may not be able to support a sudden increase in demand. The wellbeing of both current residents and any new arrivals must be considered. We believe Plas Y Rhos is  not appropriate or supportive setting for this purpose.",
