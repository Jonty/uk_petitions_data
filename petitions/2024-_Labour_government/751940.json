        "action": "Keep the 5-year ILR route for health and social care workers",
        "additional_details": "We work on the front line, caring for vulnerable people every day, often in physically and emotionally challenging roles. We pay full tax and National Insurance, yet being called part of the \u201cso-called Boris wave\u201d feels unfair and disrespectful. Many carers are stressed and worried about their future because of the proposed 15-year ILR route. We ask Parliament to honour the 5-year ILR route we were promised, recognise our essential contribution, and treat care workers with respect and fairness.",
        "background": "We want the government to keep the original 5-year route to Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) for health and social care workers. This was the rule when we arrived in the UK, and it should not be changed to a 15-year pathway.",
