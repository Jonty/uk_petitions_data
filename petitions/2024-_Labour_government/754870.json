        "additional_details": "Individuals who have been in the UK for more than two years have established stability, community ties, and expectations based on the existing rules. Changing their path to indefinite leave to remain would be a retroactive change, creating uncertainty and disrupting their lives. We ask the government to uphold fairness and legal consistency by respecting the rules that were in place when these individuals entered the asylum system.",
        "background": "We want the Government to allow asylum seekers and their families who are already living in the UK to remain on the current 5-year route to Indefinite Leave to Remain. Any new settlement rules, including a proposed 10-year ILR route, should apply only to people who arrive in the UK in the future.",
