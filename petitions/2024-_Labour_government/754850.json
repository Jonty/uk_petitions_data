        "additional_details": "I would like parliament to consider our past, and how pigeons have aided us. They carried messages during the war, they delivered them for us, they were like our telephones. But since real telephones came about, many feel we don\u2019t need them anymore and they\u2019re considered pests, which we believe is untrue and so unfair. We believe these birds deserve sanctuary for their service, and that it should be illegal to use pest control on them. I see birds trapped in nets and unable to feed their babies due to pest control methods.",
