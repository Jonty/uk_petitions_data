        "action": "Remove the need for people to have gender dysphoria to legally change gender",
        "additional_details": "The NHS's inability to provide support at acceptable speeds can and will result in a diagnosis taking a long time to actually be processed. This is not only unacceptable, but could also create mental health problems for the person wanting to change their legal gender, which is completely unnecessary. Furthermore, the idea that this diagnosis is needed to change their gender reinforces the discriminatory ideology that transgender people are \"mentally ill\", which keeps prejudice alive.",
        "background": "As of now, one of the requirements for someone to legally change their gender is to have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Parliament should remove this requirement and allow people to legally change their gender, even without the diagnosis of gender dysphoria.",
