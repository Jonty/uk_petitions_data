        "action": "Allow legal medical cannabis patients in the UK to grow their own medicine",
        "additional_details": "Many legal medical cannabis patients are unable to afford their prescriptions or access them consistently. This leads to reliance on unregulated sources or the risk of criminalisation for self-growing. Home cultivation under controlled, licensed conditions would reduce harm, lower costs, and align with compassionate access models already used in other developed countries. Patients deserve safe, affordable access without fear.",
        "background": "Create a licensed framework that allows legal medical cannabis patients to grow a limited personal supply at home. Similar models exist in Canada and the US. This would reduce cost, increase access, and protect patients from unnecessary criminalisation.",
