        "additional_details": "My dog Koda was deliberately targeted when sausages containing needles were left in our garden for him to eat. He suffered severe pain, needed emergency surgery, and would have died without immediate vet care. This cruel act caused lasting trauma for him and immense emotional and financial hardship for our family, including emergency veterinary care, increased insurance, and costs from moving home for safety.",
        "background": "I want the government to strengthen laws protecting animals by introducing mandatory prison sentences and lifetime bans for anyone who deliberately harms animals, including poisonings, ensure offenders cover veterinary and related costs, recognise victims\u2019 trauma, and improve prosecutions.",
