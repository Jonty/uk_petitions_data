Adequate training must be provided to police forces and there must be a presumption in that training for women to be dealt with by female officers upon request.",

Last year there were almost 50,000 offences of coercive control recorded by the police in England and Wales but only a very small number of these resulted in convictions. This conviction rate must be improved.",
