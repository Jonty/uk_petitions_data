        "additional_details": "Night shift work significantly impacts physical and mental health, disrupts natural sleep cycles, and increases the risk of serious health conditions, as recognised by the World Health Organization. Despite these risks, many night shift workers are paid the same as daytime workers.\r\n \r\nWe think this is unfair and does not reflect the extra burden of working through the night. \r\n \r\nWe think a legal requirement to pay 50% above the minimum wage would:\r\nCompensate workers for the health risks and social sacrifices involved.\r\nImprove recruitment and retention in essential night-time roles.\r\nEnsure fairness for those keeping essential services running 24/7.",
        "background": "I propose that staff who work between the hours of midnight and 6:00 AM are paid at least 50% more than the National Minimum Wage by law.",
