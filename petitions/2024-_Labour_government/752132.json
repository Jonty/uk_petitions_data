        "action": "Ban halal slaughter methods in the uk",
        "additional_details": "The government should stop halal slaughter because it is not in line with animal welfare and belongs to a religion the majority of the UK does not follow. The slitting of the throat of animals and letting the animal bleed out whilst it is still conscious is truly sickening as the animal will be able to feel everything. Instead we should use more humane methods of slaughter including stunning the animal. Also the majority of the UK population is not Muslim and therefore doesn't need halal rituals",
        "background": "The government should ban halal slaughter methods in uk abbatoirs and slaughter houses. Instead Muslims who wish to eat it should have to import it from Arabic countries rather than have the wider, Christian and atheist majority, population being forced to partake in a religious ritual.",
