One can only conclude this choice weighs significantly more in the favour of banning countryside pursuits than it is AW reform. \r\n\r\nRural life underpins British national heritage and must be preserved at all costs, free of hyperbole from activists, nor weaponised as an appeasement tool for backbenchers.",
