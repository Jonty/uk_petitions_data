        "additional_details": "We are asking the Government to act because a blanket ban on electronic training collars would remove a lawful option relied on by some dog owners and trainers to manage dogs safely and responsibly. Prohibition would not distinguish between misuse and appropriate use and risks unintended consequences for animal welfare, public safety, and responsible ownership. A proportionate, evidence-led approach is therefore needed.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to oppose the introduction of a blanket ban on the use of electronic training collars for dogs in England and instead commit to a proportionate, evidence-led approach that allows for regulated and responsible use.",
