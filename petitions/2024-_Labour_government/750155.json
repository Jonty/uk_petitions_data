        "additional_details": "This years bonfire night was on a Wednesday. People started setting off fireworks the Friday before bonfire night and still set off fireworks the Sunday after. This can cause problems with people\u2019s pets and livestock. The fireworks scare the animals and in some cases can kill them. If this was limited to 2 nights a year it could reduce the anxiety of people's pets & livestock. Where necessary, animals can be sedated.",
        "background": "We want the government to limit fireworks and bonfires to 2 nights a year only: bonfire night itself and the closest Saturday. We also think there should be a timeframe of 6pm to 9pm. Issue fines for anyone who doesn\u2019t comply.",
