        "action": "Delay Stamp Duty changes to ensure a fair transition for homebuyers!",
        "additional_details": "Across the country thousands of homebuyers are facing unexpected financial pressure due to sudden changes to stamp duty. Many have spent months securing mortgages and navigating the legal process, only to be hit with significantly higher fees if they miss an arbitrary deadline. \r\n\r\nFor some, this could mean stretching their finances to the limit and for many more, it may mean losing their dream home entirely. We urge the government to extend the deadline - avoiding financial strain and disruption.",
        "background": "Push back the deadline for stamp duty changes creating a 12-month transition from the Autumn Budget announcement to give buyers enough time to adjust. Support first-time buyers onto the property ladder by increasing the Stamp Duty relief threshold to make homeownership affordable.",
