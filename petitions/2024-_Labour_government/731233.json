        "action": "End of double taxation on working parents whose children attend private schools.",
        "additional_details": "Pursuant to s.7 Education Act 1996, parents must ensure suitable full-time education for their children.\r\nThose opting for private education discharge this duty at personal cost, saving the taxpayer over \u00a38,000 per pupil per year.\r\nImposing VAT on school fees constitutes disproportionate and discriminatory fiscal burden on a specific group, against the UK equality laws.\r\nOther public sectors (health & transport) are VAT-exempt and many OECD nations exempt or offer tax relief on private education.",
        "background": "Since 1st Jan 2025, parents discharging their statutory duty via independent schools face double taxation paying full Income Tax and 20% VAT on fees.\r\nThis is fiscally inequitable, unfair and punitive.\r\nWe respectfully petition HM Government to revoke VAT or provide corresponding tax income relief.",
