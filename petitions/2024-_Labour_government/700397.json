        "additional_details": "Without this change thousands of family run farms will be forced to sell up, resulting in huge multi nationals becoming the major land owner. Multi nationals have no interest in improving biodiversity or animal welfare, they are focussed on purely making profit. Resulting in increased loss of local knowledge, heritage breeds and crops and the displacement and destruction of generations of family farms.",
        "background": "The Government must cancel its proposed changes to Inheritance Tax, in respect of APR and BPR (Business Property Relief) on farmland and business assets. Family run farms are vital if the UK is to be self sufficient in food, protect the countryside and improve the environment.",
