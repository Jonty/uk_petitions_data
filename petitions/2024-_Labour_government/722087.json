        "additional_details": "Disabled individuals should not be treated as burdens; they deserve support, as recommended by the UN Committee on the Rights of Disabled People (2024). Cutting these benefits would be detrimental to disabled people\u2019s lives. Many are currently living in poverty, due to rising costs of living, and this number will only rise with the cuts proposed by The Government. Welfare reform should not mean those with a disability should have to suffer the consequences. An alternative solution must be found.",
        "background": "We want the government to stop the proposed cuts to welfare benefits, including Personal Independence Payment (or PIP), Disability Living Allowance (or DLA), and similar disability benefits.",
