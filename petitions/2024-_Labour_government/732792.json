        "additional_details": "MPs should be fully focused during parliamentary hearings, not distracted by mobile phones. Their role is to represent the public and make crucial decisions. I urge Parliament to ban personal phone use during sessions, except when essential. In emergencies, MPs' families should contact a monitored line. This would uphold professionalism, mirror standards in other workplaces, and help restore public trust in the democratic process.",
        "background": "MPs should not use personal phones during parliamentary hearings. It\u2019s unprofessional and distracting. A ban should be in place, with an emergency contact system for families to reach MPs if needed. This ensures focus, respect, and proper conduct in Parliament.",
