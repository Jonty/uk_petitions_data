In many cases products have not arrived or have been poor quality. I believe it is fine to order from overseas if you know who the overseas company is and shipping process described accurately but when these companies deliberately shown on their website that they are UK based, I think this is fraudulent and action needs to be taken.",

I think this should not be allowed and there needs to be an investigation into this malpractice and it needs to be banned. I think people are being scammed out of their hard earned money.",
