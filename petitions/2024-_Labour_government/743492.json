        "additional_details": "A majority vote in Holyrood should mean that the people of Scotland have spoken. Blocking a referendum under these circumstances undermines the very principle of the Union, which is supposed to be voluntary and democratic. \r\nThe Labour government has stated it will refuse to allow another referendum on Scottish independence, even if the SNP win a clear majority at the next Scottish Parliament election. This is unacceptable and undemocratic.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, believe that democracy must be respected in Scotland.\r\nWe call on the UK Government to respect democracy and allow a referendum on Scottish independence if the SNP win a majority at the next Scottish Parliament election.",
