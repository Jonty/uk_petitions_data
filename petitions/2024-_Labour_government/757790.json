        "additional_details": "We, the people of Blackpool, the tourists, the tram enthusiasts want the depot saved. Volunteers have primarily run it as a visitor attraction, putting countless hours of work into restoring and running the trams and raising money for it's preservation. Without the depot the trams have nowhere to go but be scrapped or sold off. Blackpool illuminated and heritage trams are as part of Blackpool as the Tower, piers and Pleasure Beach is! Part of our culture and history. They need to be saved!",
        "background": "Blackpool was the first & last place in the UK to have trams. Been here since 1885. Since 2011, modern trams were introduced & heritage & illuminated trams have run together. The local council is threatening to pull down the old depot, leaving the heritage trams to cease running forever in Blackpool",
