High housing costs suppresses consumer spending and drive up public spending.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Empower local councils with funding and authority to build homes directly.\r\n\r\nLet's stop outsourcing responsibly. Let's start building again, at scale, with purpose and with the public sector leading the way!",
