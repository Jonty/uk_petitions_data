        "additional_details": "We believe any attempt to make a company provide access to protected, private customer data, which even the company may not have the ability to access, undermines citizens' ability to protect their private data. We're concerned that in utilising this power, the Government may make citizens less safe, more open to hacking, and for no obvious benefit in our view. This power has been derided by many since the last Government brought it in; we think it should have been removed by this one.",

We don't want any companies to pull privacy features from the UK market, potentially as a result of the Act and its use.",
