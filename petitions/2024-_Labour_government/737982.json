        "additional_details": "By making student loans interest free, the government can provide a much needed relief to students & help them achieve their full potential. This approach would also be more equitable, as students would only be paying for the actual cost of their education. This would allow them to focus on their careers & contribute to the economy without the weight of excessive debt",
        "background": "Students from low income families get penalised with Interest to pay back over years, whilst higher waged families pay a one off payment for their education & dont need to pay back extra Interest rates, Students should only be responsible for paying back the cost of their Course when they start work",
