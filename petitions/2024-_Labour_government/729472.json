        "action": "Suspend fishing rights to non-UK vessels in British waters to stop the boats",
        "additional_details": "Up to now, there has been no incentive to stop small boats being launched from France, despite the UK paying for action. Their policing is ineffective and could be viewed as enabling small boat crossings.\r\n\r\nIf access to English fishing waters was to be suspended until sustained reductions in small boat crossings could be demonstrated, this would have a positive impact and the government must adopt this approach urgently to protect our borders and national security.",
        "background": "Europe must take urgent and coordinated cross-border action to stop economic migrants reaching the UK on small boats.\r\n\r\nAccess to UK fishing grounds should be suspended for European trawlers until tangible reductions are evidenced. Small boat crossings cannot be allowed to continue to rise!",
