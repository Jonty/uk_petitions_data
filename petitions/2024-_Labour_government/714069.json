        "additional_details": "The LPW scheme allows listed places of worship of all faiths across the UK to reclaim the full amount of VAT they pay on repairs of over \u00a31000. \r\nRemoving it means 20% more needs to be raised by local people to pay VAT to the Government, this increases pressure on overstretched finances.  \r\nLPW's provide a safe space for people to connect and belong in community. Studies have shown the high value of 'faith capital' which benefit the lives of old and young all over the country. LPW's are a lifeline",
        "background": "The Church of England\u2019s Cathedral & Church Buildings team is increasingly concerned that this scheme, administered by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and funded jointly with HM Treasury, may not be extended beyond its current end date of 31 March 2025. Parishioners are deeply concerned.",
