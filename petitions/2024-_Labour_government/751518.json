        "additional_details": "Experts warn that taking painkillers from those in severe need is a cruel health policy. The review should consider evidence from stakeholders and campaigners. Chronic pain has a devastating impact, and every available tool is needed. When patients are properly medicated, many can function, work, and rely less on benefits, reducing strain on public services.",
        "background": "Around 15.5 million people suffer from Chronic Pain (Verus Arthrtis, 2021). A number of commonly used and vital treatments for pain relief and management are no longer recommended, and we believe the new guidelines do not meet the needs of people suffering from chronic pain.",
