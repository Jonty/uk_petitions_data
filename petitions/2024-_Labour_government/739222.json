Permanent BST helps avoid dark winter afternoons, which may make communities safer and more welcoming.\r\n3. Ending clock changes may prevent disruption to sleep, work, travel and digital systems \u2014 potentially boosting productivity.\r\n4. More daylight reduces energy use, helping households with bills and supporting climate goals.\r\n5. Other nations have shown permanent daylight saving works, the UK should lead with a modern, consistent approach.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government and Parliament to keep the UK on British Summer Time (BST) permanently\u2014by ending the bi-annual clock changes and remaining one hour ahead of GMT year-round.",
