        "action": "Reinstate rail electrification to Syston immediately.",
        "additional_details": "Electrification currently ends just short of Leicester station, a key transport hub serving a key city. Leicester therefore misses out on the prestige of full integration into the electrified rail network. Having the route fully electrified between St Pancras International and Leicester stations would give the project far greater strategic and commercial value than stopping short at Wigston, which currently undermines the effectiveness of the entire scheme.",
        "background": "We call on the Department for Transport to reinstate plans to extend electrification of the Midland Main Line as far as Syston, ensuring Leicester Station is fully wired into the network. This would strengthen Leicester\u2019s economy and leave the wiring at a more strategic point.",
