        "additional_details": "Dartford is a multicultural borough, yet far-right groups are targeting our community. Flags have been placed on lampposts and postboxes, not as patriotism, but as deliberate intimidation.This mirrors a history of the far right misusing national symbols to threaten minorities. Residents never gave permission, and local authorities have failed to act, creating fear. If unchecked, this risks escalating into harassment, violence, and division. Parliament must act now to stop this intimidation",
        "background": "To remove unauthorised flags from public spaces, make it a criminal offence to place flags and symbols on public property without permission, especially when used to harass or intimidate and enforce clear rules for displaying flags, ensuring councils prevent racist misuse of public space",
