        "additional_details": "We believe the ban on puberty blockers has caused untold suffering to trans children in the UK, and the suffering must not be allowed to continue. We think it goes against article 8 of The United Nations Convention On The Rights Of The Child.\r\n\r\nUnder the convention, children have the right to their own identity \u2013  including their name, nationality and family relations. No one should take this away from them, but if this happens, the convention states that state parties must provide assistance and protection so children can quickly get their identity back.",
        "background": "We want the Government to reverse the restrictions it has introduced relating to the prescription of puberty blockers to children. The Government introduced legislation banning them from being prescribed by the private sector and NHS primary care to under 18s not already taking them.",
