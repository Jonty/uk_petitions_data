        "additional_details": "There are enough roofs in the UK to provide the electricity needed rather than destroying fields and building nuclear power plants. With battery storage and modern technology the money you want to spend to  build nuclear plants and create solar farms, would be enough to put panels on all existing roofs at no cost to the home/building owners, wether in be five panels or thousands.",
        "background": "Instead of the continual debate on solar farms in green fields,pass a bill to put solar panels on all roofs on both domestic and commercial buildings that have the correct directional configuration, this rather than using valuable farm land. Make it mandatory to install solar roofs on all new builds",
