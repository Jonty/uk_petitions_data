        "additional_details": "We believe the current rule unfairly excludes single-income families earning just over \u00a3100,000, while dual-income households earning \u00a3198,000 still qualify. We think that changing and allowing all households with income under \u00a3200,000 to be eligible for free childcare would encourage people to work harder without facing a financial penalty for exceeding the cap. It could also ensure they continue contributing more tax to the economy while receiving the same support as higher-earning dual-income families.",
        "background": "Under current UK policy, families where each parent earns just under \u00a3100,000 totalling nearly \u00a3200,000 are eligible for 30 hours of free childcare. In contrast, a single-income family earning just over \u00a3100,000 does not qualify for this benefit.",
