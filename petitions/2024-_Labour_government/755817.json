Visiting arrangements allow many offenders with sexual convictions to attend visits at the same time and same space as children, causing distress to families. We think this is a serious safeguarding concern. Prison visits should be safe, child-appropriate environments. We are calling for mandatory separation of child visits from prisoners convicted of sexual offences to protect children\u2019s safety.",
