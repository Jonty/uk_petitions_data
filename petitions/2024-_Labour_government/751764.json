I have been unable to register with an NHS dentist for 2 years now - yet a private appointment I could get with 1 day's notice, therefore it is not a shortage of dentists, it is a broken system. I refuse to pay for services I am unable to access - I am happy to pay for them directly myself, privately, when the government stops charging me for them. If this was a privately run comapny, it would be labelled a scam.",

Yet the government is still allegedly using National Insurance Contributions to fund them \u2013 I refuse to pay for something I do not have access to. I demand the funds to be reimbursed and the NI lowered.",
