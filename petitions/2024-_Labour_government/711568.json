        "additional_details": "The Act was passed under the Parliament Acts and we feel there was not strong support for stringent restrictions of hunting. We think most of the Act is any way legally ineffective and its prohibition of hunting is easily circumvented. We think the Act does not contain sufficient exemptions and extends to people's private land which undermines centuries of precedent.",
        "background": "We believe that the Hunting Act 2004 constitutes an unjustifiable interference with the public's right to enjoy a private life. We further consider that the Act attempts to encroach centuries of traditions of hunting wild animals. We ask that the Act be repealed.",
