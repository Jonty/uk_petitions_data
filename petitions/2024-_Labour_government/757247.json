        "additional_details": "I propose to update the current reversing module, known as 3a, to include actual real world reversing in bays. Another option is to add an additional day or two, which is dedicated to being able to reverse into loading bays, safely and accurately.\r\nMany training schools have the availability of such space to be able to implement this. These measures could also help improve employment chances.",
        "background": "Since Brexit, the UK has struggled to fill thousands of class 1 HGV jobs due to a shortage of drivers. At present, there is funding available for training to become a class 1 HGV driver, however, we feel the course does not cover reversing that will be involved whilst in the real working world.",
