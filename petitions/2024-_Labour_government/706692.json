        "additional_details": "Outdated Financial Model\r\nThe BBC's funding model, based primarily on the license fee, is outdated and in need of reform. In an age where streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and YouTube dominate, many people question why the BBC still relies on a mandatory tax to fund its operations. The license fee is a regressive form of taxation. Calls for a shift towards a subscription-based model or a more diverse funding structure especially as younger generations move away from traditional TV.\r\nScandals and Trust Issues\r\nScandals involving the BBC have further undermined public confidence in the broadcaster. High-profile incidents, such as the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal. \r\nQuestions\r\nThe public is no longer willing to fund a broadcaster that may not represent their interests.",
        "background": "The call to abolish the BBC TV license fee has gained momentum, driven by various factors including the cost of living crisis, criticisms of the outdated financial model, and ongoing scandals surrounding the BBC.",
