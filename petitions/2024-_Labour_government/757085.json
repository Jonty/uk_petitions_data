I get that it\u2019s so we can remember it but we\u2019re just going to go over it the next day. Homework is exhausting and sometimes we can\u2019t do it because we might have after school  activities or personal things going on. Homework can also cause mental health problems to people because it can simply be too much for them. We need to ban homework from all schools in the uk",
