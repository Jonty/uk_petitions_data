        "additional_details": "Recreational cannabis users in the UK can face serious health risks from contaminated illegal products. There is research suggesting cannabis can contain toxic heavy metals which may cause cancer and long-term health problems. We believe that there has been an increase in these products which could cause medical emergencies. We think legal regulation with mandatory testing would help protect citizens from criminal suppliers who prioritize profit over public health.",
        "background": "Create a legal framework allowing regulated recreational cannabis use for UK citizens. This would involve safety testing, eliminating heavy metal contamination, and preventing synthetic cannabinoid adulteration which we believe is causing health crises across Europe and America.",
