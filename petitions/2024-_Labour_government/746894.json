        "additional_details": "Many pre-2006 borrowers struggle for decades under growing interest, while newer borrowers see their loans written off after 25 years. This is unfair, causes stress, and traps people in debt for life. Updating the rules will bring justice, relief, and fairness to thousands who worked hard and now face endless repayments.",
        "background": "Change the repayment rules for pre-2006 student loans so they are written off 25 years after repayment starts, not when borrowers reach age 65. This will make loan terms fair and consistent for all borrowers.",
