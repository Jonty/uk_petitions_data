        "action": "Protect Inverclyde. Keep full criminal checks for all taxi licence applicants.",
        "additional_details": "I want this because removing overseas criminal checks puts public safety at risk. If someone has lived abroad for years, the council would have no way to see serious offences committed elsewhere. Local drivers face strict vetting and every applicant should meet the same standard. Families, vulnerable people and the wider community deserve to know that anyone licensed to drive the public has been fully checked.",
        "background": "The UK Government should require Invrrclyde, and local authorities in Scotland to maintain full overseas criminal record checks for all taxi and private hire driver applicants who were born outside the UK or have lived abroad for 6 months or more, and prevent councils from removing these safeguards.",
