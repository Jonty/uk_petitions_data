        "additional_details": "Hurricane Melissa has devastated Jamaica, destroying homes, schools, hospitals and infrastructure, leaving communities in urgent need of food, water, and shelter. The UK\u2019s \u00a32m aid package is only a fraction of what\u2019s needed for recovery. By contrast, the UK has given far greater support elsewhere. The scale of this disaster and Jamaica\u2019s historical and cultural links to the UK and being part of the commonwealth, justifies a more substantial and compassionate response.",
        "background": "To urgently increase its financial assistance to Jamaica following devastating hurricane Melissa that has left thousands homeless, displaced, & without access to basic necessities. \u00a32m is insufficient given the scale of the disaster and the historical commonwealth ties between the UK and Jamaica.",
