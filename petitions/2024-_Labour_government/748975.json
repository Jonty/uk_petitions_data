        "action": "Public Right to Carry Self-Defense Tools in the UK",
        "additional_details": "I urge the UK Government and Parliament to amend existing legislation to allow responsible citizens to carry non-lethal self-defense tools, such as pepper spray and tasers. This should be done with clear guidelines, proper training, and strict regulations to ensure public safety and prevent misuse.\r\n\r\nBy doing so, we can empower individuals to protect themselves effectively, reduce the likelihood of knife-related crimes, and ultimately create a safer environment for everyone.",
        "background": "In light of the rising incidence of knife crime across the UK, the safety of the public is increasingly at risk. While UK law permits the use of reasonable force in self-defense, it also prohibits carrying self-defense tools like pepper spray and tasers in public without lawful authority.",
