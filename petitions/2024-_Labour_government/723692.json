        "action": "Implement a wealth tax at 2% tax on wealth over \u00a310 million",
        "additional_details": "The wealthy\u2019s savings are increasingly financing household and government debt, rather than productive investments. This cycle perpetuates inequality as the rich benefit from interest payments while the lower classes struggle with debt. To address this, a wealth tax on the richest could fund income tax relief for working families, potentially boosting consumption and economic growth. This redistribution could help alleviate the financial squeeze on the middle class and help standards of living.",
        "background": "The government must aid the working class as many struggle with rent and bills. Covid saw the wealthy grow richer. Income is taxed, but wealth isn\u2019t. A 2% tax on \u00a310 million would take \u00a3200k from a \u00a3500k passive gain (5% savings). This could address inequality and help struggling citizens.",
