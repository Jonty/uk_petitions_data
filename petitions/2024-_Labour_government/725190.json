        "additional_details": "British households face some of the highest energy costs in the world. This is not solely due to global markets but to a system that makes the public pay three times:\r\n1. To consume energy, even when generated from cheaper renewables\r\n2. To build infrastructure, via taxes and green levies that subsidise private energy developers\r\n3. While others profit, particularly the Crown Estate, which generated \u00a31.1 billion in 2023/24 through seabed leases, a portion of which funds the Sovereign Grant",
        "background": "We ask Parliament to debate the UK\u2019s energy pricing model, specifically the way consumers pay multiple times for energy: (1) through bills, (2) through taxes and subsidies for infrastructure, and (3) while institutions like the Crown Estate profit from public resources. We call for urgent reform.",
