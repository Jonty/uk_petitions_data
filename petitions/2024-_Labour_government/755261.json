        "additional_details": "A woman is killed by a man every 3 days in the UK and in the year ending March 2023 police recorded 103,135 rape and serious sexual offences. VAWG feels isolating, but the numbers show that women aren't alone. A national telephone number would provide vulnerable women with a clear, immediate point of contact for advice in emergency and non-emergency situations. This aligns with police chiefs' 2024 call for a whole-system approach to DA and VAWG and would strengthen responses across the board.",
