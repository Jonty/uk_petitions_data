        "additional_details": "I want the government to abolish Secure Borders UK because its existence makes marginalised groups such as people of colour and LGBTQ+ people feel unsafe; again, I am also worried about people wrongfully being deported or even killed just because of the colour of their skin or where they work, for example.",
        "background": "ICE in the US has deported and killed American citizens, and I\u2019m worried the same thing will happen here. Those who have been detained by ICE have also been kept in inhumane conditions. I want the government to abolish Secure Borders UK before people are unjustly deported or killed.",
