        "additional_details": "Not many jobs require a person to wear such rigid uniform of blazers, jumpers, ties etc. These are costly and irrelevant to working class families. A higher % of children from public schools will end up in service-related industries or civil servant roles, which require a more reasonable, comfortable, flexible uniform such as Cargo pants, polo shirt, or smart casual. Uniforms stifle identity and individualism, forcing conformity during crucial years of self-discovery and expression.",
        "background": "Public high schools have set the standard of uniform too high claiming it is flexible, encourages identity and to prepares the children for the work place, however it is not relevant attire to most working class jobs, only a small amount of careers require such constrictive clothing",
