        "additional_details": "As one of the British Army's founders of the Special Air Service (SAS), he led daring behind-the-lines raids that caused significant disruption to enemy forces. His indomitable courage, exceptional physical strength, and sheer determination made him one of the most decorated soldiers of the war, A Victoria Cross, the highest military award in the United Kingdom, was denied to him. It was rumoured that his strong stance on mental health issues led to this unjust exclusion. Unbelievably brave.",
