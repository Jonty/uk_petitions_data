        "additional_details": "A recent report by Citizens Advice noted a 68% increase in people asking for advice on temporary accommodation. Many temporary accommodation sites with some of the worst cases of damp and mould are managed by private landlords licensed by councils. Awaab's Law as it currently stands, lets them off the hook. We think that Awaab's Law must be extended to cover all forms of temporary accommodation, including those with license agreements, as soon as possible, particularly given the poor standards in many sites managed privately.",
        "background": "Awaab's Law is one of the most significant pieces of legislation to come into force to tackle damp and mould in housing. We want the government to implement the extension of the Decent Homes Standard (DHS) and Awaab\u2019s law to all temporary accommodation as soon as possible.",
