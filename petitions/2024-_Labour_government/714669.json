        "additional_details": "Many people don't know their blood group unless they need to for medical reasons or have given blood. In an emergency where someone needs a blood transfusion, blood has to be taken and tested. Valuable time and money is wasted in this process. Carrying a card (as diabetics do, for example) or accessing medical records with blood types recorded could save lives. A card could also be kept visible at home, as other medical emergency information often is, in case a medic/ambulance attends the home.",

I would also like there to be an official card people could carry stating their blood type so it is easy to access along with our medical history.",
