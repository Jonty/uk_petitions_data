        "additional_details": "Our neighbourhoods are more built-up than ever before and private household fireworks are causing more distress, not just to defensive animals, but also to people. Fireworks also get into the wrong hands and those individuals cause much distress with their anti-social behaviour.\r\nIt's about time the Government put a ban on private households letting off fireworks,\r\nWe are supposed to be a nation of animals lovers, so let's show it by signing the petition to stop these private household fireworks.",
        "background": "The feeling from other animal owners about banning private fireworks is increasing every year, yet here we are AGAIN in the same situation! Fireworks are getting bigger and louder. Animals, be it pets or wildlife are fearful of these loud bangs and whistles. My cat runs and hides. It\u2019s not fair.",
