In the dark they were not easy to see. If coat manufactures were required to add a reflective strip to coats these children would be much more visible and would be safer when walking to and from school as traffic would be better able to see them.",

Most of these coats seem to be dark colours. Adding a reflective strip will make them easier to see and may save lives.",
