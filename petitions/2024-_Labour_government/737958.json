        "additional_details": "It is evident that all political parties favour loyal party members and supporters with key posts.  However, it is similarly evident that some of those individuals appointed are neither competent or experienced to fulfil those roles.  There should be a process that examines the appointment of MPs to cabinet positions to ensure that they have proven relevant experience and capability to exercise these significant and national critical roles.",
        "background": "The UK electoral system means that a party with a majority will form a government.  The electorate have no say over individuals that will serve in ministerial posts, including that of Prime Minister.  This effectively removes the electorate from influencing the composition of the cabinet.",
