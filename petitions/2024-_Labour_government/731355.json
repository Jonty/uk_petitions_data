We think some children are limiting how much they drink during the day so they don\u2019t have to go to toilet and some girls are struggling with menstruation where access to use the toilet may be denied to them during certain times of the day. We think children are being punished for using the toilet when they need to. We're concerned that this can happen in the year 2025.",
