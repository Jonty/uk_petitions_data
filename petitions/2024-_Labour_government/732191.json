We think this would determine fairer charging to capture larger properties and ensure Council Tax charges take into account the criteria the Valuation Office lists as how a Band is allocated, ie, square footage, and property valuation.",
        "background": "Change the council tax bands to make the bands better reflect square footage of larger properties. In 2014 Labour discussed a tax on properties valued over \u00a32 million this hasn\u2019t happened. We think band H is too loose, it doesn\u2019t account for properties valued in their millions.",
