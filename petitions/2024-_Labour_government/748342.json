        "additional_details": "Symptoms of ADHD: a recognised disability, include: executive dysfunction: forgetfulness; distractibility; a lack of object permanence; poor organisation / time management. This can make it extremely difficult to remember to pay for parking with newer systems (no lift-barrier or ticket booth / pay online later / discrete visuals). Unintentionally, people with ADHD can incur rising fines, as payment can be delayed (executive dysfunction, poor working memory). Over time, these costs can be sizeable.",
