        "additional_details": "Losing a pet in a violent attack is deeply traumatic, causing grief,shock,and fear.The lack of legal action leaves victims feeling powerless and abandoned by law.\r\n\r\nWe call on Parliament to:\r\n\r\n1.Amend the Dangerous Dogs Act to make it a criminal offence for a dog to attack and kill cats or other pets.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.Ensure all such incidents are investigated by police.\r\n3.Hold owners accountable and promote responsible dog ownership through education and enforcement.\r\n\r\nOur pets are family \u2013 their lives matter",
        "background": "In the UK, if a dog attacks and kills a cat or another pet, it is often not a criminal offence. The Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 only covers people and assistance dogs, leaving other pets without protection and their families without justice",
