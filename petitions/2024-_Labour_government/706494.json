We think an outright ban on knife possession, except for specific purposes, and mandatory jail terms regardless of first offence, could significantly reduce the availability of knives, deter offenders, and protect our communities. This is an epidemic and has to stop. We believe consequences have to be seen to prevent the deaths of more young children.",
