        "additional_details": "There is currently nothing in law that gives cattle whom are mammals, like humans, any right to have sufficient shelter, and in 2025 with the means to do so, now is the time to be more humane to them. If they can stay dry, and with their huddling behaviour, they would have much more chance to survive the colder months being protected from rain and snow, if this law was implemented. We as citizens and those in a position to do so, should do our utmost to do this for them.",
        "background": "To make it mandatory by law to ensure all owned animals that are mainly kept outside are protected from rain, so that they have more chance of surviving and having a better quality of life if they can keep dry or mainly dry (and therefore warm enough too), especially through the winter months.",
