        "additional_details": "We are concerned that as a result, more animals could be surrendered, and about the potential effects on vaccination and neutering rates, and preventable deaths. We believe that corporate ownership of vet practices prioritises profit over welfare, worsening the crisis. We ask the Government to investigate rising vet costs, regulate pricing, provide subsidies for essential care, and support animal rescues with vet fees. Veterinary care must not be a luxury \u2014 all pets deserve access to treatment.",
        "background": "Review and regulate veterinary care to ensure its affordable and accessible to all. Vet costs rose 60%+ from 2015-2023 with more increases since. Costs vary regionally but basic consultations can cost \u00a365+ and some costs like advanced scans may exceed \u00a31000, unaffordable for many.",
