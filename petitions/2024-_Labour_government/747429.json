People are using ai to complete there school work from elementary to university. People are using it to make news videos to spread misinformation that now looks completely real. It is not only a danger of misinformation but now child safety! People are using ai to create child porn, and as we know ai uses real sources to create its content. Absolutely disgusting. It needs to stop.",
        "background": "I want a complete ban on personal use of ai. I understand use of ai in companies but with it being released to the public it has been used inappropriately and the only solution is to ban ai for personal use. Also, any ai videos should be legally marked that they are ai or else they will be fined.",
