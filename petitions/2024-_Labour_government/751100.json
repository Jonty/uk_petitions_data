Commission a new impact assessment which includes lived experiences and data on the gendered nature of this issue and how it may affect victims of domestic abuse\r\n\r\n2. Remove the proposed Child Abduction clause (Part 7, Clause 104) in the Crime and Policing Bill which extends criminalisation to parents who retain their child abroad.\r\n\r\n3. Amend the existing Child Abduction Act 1984 to include clear protections for victims of domestic abuse and intolerable situations such as destitution. \r\n\r\n4. Align the Bill with the UK\u2019s domestic abuse strategy and international obligations to protect victims and children",
