We play a vital role in keeping people safe, well, and independent at home. This should be recognised with fair pay.",
        "background": "Despite the essential nature of our role, care workers are still among the lowest paid. Many of us are earning minimum wage while taking on responsibilities that are physically and emotionally demanding. We provide frontline, life-changing support, yet we are not treated or paid as professionals.",
