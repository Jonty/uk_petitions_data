        "additional_details": "We are concerned that school complaints may be handled by school staff or school governors who know the headteacher well and who are often friends, which may lead to bias, cover-ups, and unfair outcomes. We believe many parents and students have faced ignored or mishandled complaints due to this issue.\r\n \r\nWe think an independent body would ensure impartial, fair, and transparent investigations, hold school leaders accountable, restore trust in schools, and help ensure they are properly protecting and supporting students.",
        "background": "We ask the government to create an independent body to investigate all school complaints from the start. The investigators must not be connected to schools, or Local Authorities, to help ensure fair, transparent outcomes and accountability for school leaders when serious issues are raised.",
