        "additional_details": "As a young driver, attempting to get any kind of driving test now is close to impossible unless you want to pay \u00a3300+ for a POTENTIAL slot, which a lot of the time is a scam.\r\nThis makes it more stressful and difficult for the learner driving population, and by amending the way you can book these tests, slots will be much more legitimate, and with only provisional license holders being allowed slots and reselling to be illegal, stops the crisis we currently have of driving tests in our country.",
        "background": "Booking a practical (or even theory) driving test is extremely difficult due to resellers, so making the reselling of tests should be illegal.Further by providing unique verification like a passport number AND PROVISIONAL (not full) licence number, and only allowing one test for each licence number",
