We feel this unfairly affects long-term residents who study, work, and contribute here. Fee rules should reflect residency, not immigration status.\r\n \r\nWe believe removing the ILR requirement would make higher education fairer for long-term UK residents and support national workforce needs, especially in shortage areas like healthcare. Students who have lived here for three years should not face overseas fees simply because their immigration status has not yet reached ILR.",
