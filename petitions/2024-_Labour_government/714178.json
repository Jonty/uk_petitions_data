        "additional_details": "We think this policy would be in the interests of the domestic workforce and the government as it would prioritise UK workers applying for vacant job roles in the country and assist the government in reaching its aim of reducing net migration from historic highs.\r\n \r\nWe think it would also help wean employers off immigrant labour where it isn't necessary and highlight particular sectors where it is, so the government can develop initiatives to train the domestic workforce for the roles in those sectors.",
        "background": "We want the government to reinstate the Resident Labour Market Test, requiring employers to advertise a job role in two approved places for 28 days to show that the position can only be filled by a non-British national before sponsoring a Skilled Worker visa for the role.",
