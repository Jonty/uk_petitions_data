Yes relying on social media isn\u2019t a good thing but if you put a screen time it may help",
        "background": "If your wanting to do a ban put it on under 13\u2019s or for under 16\u2019s make it have a screen time limit on the certain apps like 1-2hrs a day and then the rest of the time they can\u2019t have it till next day as a lot of over 13\u2019s are more mature then 16\u2019s so either don\u2019t do the ban or do a screen limit",
