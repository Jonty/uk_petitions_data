A lack of affordable homes can push vulnerable people into temporary, unsafe accommodation, worsening poverty and mental health. Building more council homes could provide stability, reduce homelessness, and improve living conditions for thousands. Immediate action is vital to address this urgent social issue.",

Many are forced into temporary or unsuitable accommodation, affecting their health and well-being. We believe we need more council homes to reduce waiting lists and prevent homelessness.",
