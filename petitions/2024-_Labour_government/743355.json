        "additional_details": "The UK Government must not introduce mandatory Digital ID or abolish physical cash.\r\n\r\n\u2013 Digital ID centralises power and risks creating the framework for a social credit system.  \r\n\u2013 A cashless society removes personal choice and forces every transaction to be tracked.  \r\n\u2013 Together, these measures undermine privacy, freedom, and democracy.\r\n\r\nWe demand that Parliament guarantees:  \r\n1. No mandatory Digital ID for UK citizens.  \r\n2. Protection of the right to use physical cash in all transactions.  \r\n3. A commitment that no citizen will be penalised for lawful opinions, purchases, or choices.",
