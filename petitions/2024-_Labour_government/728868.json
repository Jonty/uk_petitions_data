        "additional_details": "I believe by making the youth do national service, it could give them a sense of pride in their communities & the country. We believe it can allow them to give something back and help build, assist or enhance any areas they would bring benefits too. It could also teach them better discipline by bringing structure and teaching new skills. I also believe it will ensure we are well-prepared to defend our shores unlike some of our allies and friends.",
        "background": "Bring in national service for all young people to do before they come into adulthood. It was previously used in this country, and it is the norm in many other countries. We want this due to wars nearby, the state of our youth and bad or criminal behaviour amongst young people.",
