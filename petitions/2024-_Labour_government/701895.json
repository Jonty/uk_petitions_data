        "additional_details": "We need to safeguard children. We believe under 16s should be able to be considered victims of domestic abuse, and that kids need more education about domestic abuse within a relationship and access to domestic abuse services. I\u2019d like the age to be lowered so under 16s can get the help they need if they find themselves in an abusive relationship.",
        "background": "The law defines domestic abuse as abusive behaviour by one person towards another, where both people are 16 or over. We think this should be changed. Our daughter Holly, aged 15, was murdered by her ex-boyfriend and we think this case should have been looked at in the context of domestic abuse. ",
