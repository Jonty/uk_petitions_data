        "additional_details": "The UK\u2019s immigration debate has grown hostile and misleading. EU nationals contribute significantly to vital sectors like healthcare and social care. Post-Brexit, the UK should not treat EU neighbours the same as distant countries. We urge Parliament to reject misinformation and adopt a fair, secure, and compassionate immigration policy that recognises our historic ties and shared values with the EU.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to review and reform its post-Brexit immigration policy toward EU citizens. We ask that the UK recognises the unique relationship it shares with EU member states and creates a system that is fair, secure, and humane \u2014 not driven by fear or political rhetoric.",
