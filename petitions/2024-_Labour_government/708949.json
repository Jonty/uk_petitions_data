        "additional_details": "Many pesticides are banned in UK because of the dangers they pose to human health and biodiversity. These dangers are as serious abroad as they are in the UK. We believe that allowing them to be exported, meaning that companies producing them in the UK can profit from legislation that may be weaker elsewhere, is hypocritical, callous, and ultimately poses a threat to our own well-being.",
