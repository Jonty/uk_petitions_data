        "additional_details": "We ask for police bodycam footage from closed cases to be subject to FOI requests, while maintaining compliance with GDPR. Bodycams and video storage are publicly funded so we think they should be subject to public scrutiny. In the US, similar footage is sometimes released, and can promote trust. If cases are closed and GDPR is complied with, we think there is no valid reason to withhold footage. It could help ensure transparency, accountability, and responsible use of public resources.",
