        "additional_details": "With the UK\u2019s age of consent being 16 and many campaigns pushing for a voting age of 16, it is quite evident that the government and general public see a 16 yr old to be capable of making decisions of that of an adult. The government should therefore consider that the same level of decision making should be applied to people of this age, when convicted of offences that would warrant a Whole life order should they have been over the age of 18 and therefore should be tried and sentenced as such.",
        "background": "Revise the legal minimum age that a convicted criminal may receive a Whole life order as contained within the Sentencing Act 2020 Cpt.321 reducing this age further following the 2022 amendment reducing the minimum age to 18 down further to 16.",
