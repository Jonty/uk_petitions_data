        "additional_details": "In the early 1970s, \u00a310 was a valuable uplift for those without income, to help with the increased costs associated with Christmas time. It would have helped towards paying for heating and electricity, food and drinks or Christmas presents for kids. It would have been the equivalent of approximately \u00a3180 today adjusted for inflation. \u00a310 today won't even buy a round of drinks, wouldn't pay for a quality Christmas pudding or buy a box of decent Christmas Crackers. \u00a310 quite frankly is insulting.",
        "background": "Adjust the Christmas Bonus given to benefit claimants, from \u00a310 - when it was introduced in 1972 - to reflect inflation (approx \u00a3180 in 2025). Make the uplift only available for British citizens, who have been claiming benefits for a minimum of 6 months. ",
