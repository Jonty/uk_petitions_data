Many of these have resulted, often belatedly, in successful prosecutions, but limited attempts have been made to ascertain what lies behind these offences.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are a growing number of reports of victims asserting that various authorities were aware of their plight, but failed to provide appropriate protection or recourse for them.\r\n\r\nWe now need the facts.",
