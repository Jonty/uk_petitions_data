        "action": "To deport convicted dual national terrorists to their other country of origin.",
        "additional_details": "Because there are currently tens of thousands of convixted terrorists residing in the UK who are on a goverment terrorist watch list. Unfortunately we do not have the resources to monitir all of these potential terrorists. Therefore if the UK government could deport convicted terrorists with dual citizenship to their second country that would make the UK safer as it would allow the Security Services to monitor the potential terrorist threat to the UK more effectively.",
        "background": "I would like there to be a debate in Parliament about the feasibility of deporting convicted terrorists to their other country of residence if they have dual citizenship. On deportation to another country I would like their UK passport to be confiscated and their UK citizenship cancelled.",
