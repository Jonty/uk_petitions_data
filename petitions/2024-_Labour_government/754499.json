        "additional_details": "This petition is inspired by Fraser, an 8-year-old child, who has noticed that he can rarely find his name on merchandise when visiting garden centres. For children, seeing their name on an item can be exciting, affirming, and inclusive \u2014 especially when siblings and friends are able to find theirs easily.\r\n\r\nWe believe that:\r\n\t\u2022\tFraser is a popular and recognisable name\r\n\t\u2022\tChildren should feel included and represented\r\n\t\u2022\tAdding one more name is a small change that makes a big difference\r\n\r\nWe respectfully ask garden centres and their merchandise suppliers to add \u201cFraser\u201d to their standard range of personalised and novelty products, alongside other common names.",
        "background": "We call on garden centres and gift suppliers to include the name \u201cFraser\u201d on personalised and novelty merchandise.\r\n\r\nMany garden centres sell personalised items such as mugs, keyrings, pens, magnets, signs, and children\u2019s gifts featuring popular first names. \u201cFraser\u201d is frequently missing.",
