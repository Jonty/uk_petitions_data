This is a distraction from real events that need urgent government attention. The new PM has not been voted into office. If a leadership contest for PM ocurres then MPs will think twice about a leadership contest if it means triggering a general election. All the unelected PMs have caused considerable issues such as May, Truss, and soon Starmer! Government has stopped governing!",
