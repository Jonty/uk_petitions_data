        "action": "Prevent Justice Secretary David Lammy from axing jury trials in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "The right to a trial by jury has ensured fair and unbiased judgement from 'lay people' within the UK for hundreds of years and has consistently resulted in justice. A removal of this system would cause nothing but uproar within the legal system and a revocation of our basic rights as a British citizen. The magna carta itself states a right to a fair trial by jury. I implore the Government to not go ahead with this proposal and for the justice secretary to reconsider his actions.",
        "background": "Recently the Justice Secretary proposed a ban to jury trials to assist with the backlog in the courts, this would remove a jury from all trials other than serious offences. Parliament and the Government should not allow this as it goes against a fundamental right awarded to citizens in the UK.",
