        "additional_details": "First, economic opportunity. Joining the United States could provide the UK with access to one of the world\u2019s largest economies without the complexities of negotiating trade deals. \r\n\r\nSecond, political stability. The UK has experienced significant political uncertainty in recent years. Becoming part of the United States could offer long-term political certainty and stability by aligning with a globally influential and economically powerful nation.\r\n\r\nThird, enhanced defense and global influence.",
        "background": "We urge the UK Government and Parliament to formally debate the potential integration of the United Kingdom as a member state of the United States of America. This petition requests that Parliament explore the legal, economic, political, and social implications of such a union.",
