        "additional_details": "We urge the Parliament to direct the Home Office to grant visas to childless care worker dependents. Many are without children due to financial, health, or personal reasons. Family life should not be judged by having children. Those who arrived before rule changes now face unfair separation. Administrative reviews offer little hope. This harms well-being, mental health and contradicts UK values. Please act with compassion and fairness to keep families united and protect their rights.",
