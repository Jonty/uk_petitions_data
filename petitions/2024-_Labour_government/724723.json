        "action": "Require local authorities to allow free parking: minimum 15 mins on public roads",
        "additional_details": "We believe that some local authorities are extending parking restrictions and removing grace periods on public highways. We feel they are not considering the negative impact on local businesses and the wider public. We think a 15 minute grace period could take some of the anxiety and stress out of driving. We want to enable drivers to pull over to drop off or pick up a passenger, pop into the shops for a few essentials, stop for safety concerns or simply to read the restriction sign and see if they can pay without the worry of picking up a fine.",
        "background": "We want the Government to pass legislation requiring all local authorities to include a minimum 15 minute grace period in all pay to park schemes on public roads. We think this should apply to all existing schemes as well as new.",
