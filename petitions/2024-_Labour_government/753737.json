        "additional_details": "We urge the Government to implement two vital changes for child safety and quality of care:\r\n\u200bStaff-in-Ratio Must Be In-Room Practitioners: The staff-to-child ratio must strictly include only those practitioners physically present and actively supervising children in the specific room. Close loopholes allowing non-direct care staff (admin, management) to be counted.\r\n\u200bMinimum Qualification Ratio (2:1): Mandate a minimum of two qualified staff (Level 2+) for every one unqualified member in the statutory ratio. This guarantees consistent expertise and leadership, preventing burnout and ensuring the safe, high-quality care children deserve.",
        "background": "\u200bUrge the Government to strengthen nursery staff-to-child ratio laws by mandating two key changes to the EYFS. The safety and quality of young children's care hinge on the expertise of practitioners. Current regulations lack safeguards, risking understaffing and inadequate support in child care.",
