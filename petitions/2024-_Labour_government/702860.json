        "additional_details": "The Conservatives and most recently Labour as examples have ignored their pre-election mandates and have done the complete opposite. Ensuring that a winning party adheres to their pre-election mandates brings a tighter bond between the Government and the voting public. The public cannot change a Government once in power when that Government does not follow their mandate, and for five years this causes public unrest. If a party goes against their pre-election mandate, then the public have a right to then vote out that government. Just like they voted them in.",
        "background": "To create a Law that states a political parties pre-election mandate MUST be adhered to and followed when in power. Not following their mandate MUST be made illegal as it makes a mockery of UK Politics.",
