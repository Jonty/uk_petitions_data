        "additional_details": "In 50/50 custody arrangements, only one parent is recognised for DLA, Carer\u2019s Allowance, and benefit cap exemption. This is unfair and creates unequal financial burdens and emotional strain and fails to serve the best interests of the child who relies on care and support in both homes especially in cases like mine, where our 8-year-old has had cancer treatment for over four years. I care for them half the time but receive no support. The rules must change to reflect modern shared parenting.",
        "background": "Review and reform the rules that assign all benefits (e.g. DLA, Carer\u2019s Allowance, and benefit cap exemptions) to one parent in shared custody arrangements. In cases where parenting is split 50/50, both parents should be recognised as carers and receive appropriate support.",
