        "additional_details": "Under the current law, water companies have a duty to connect to all new developments to the sewer system, including systems which may be over-capacity. This can lead to flooding, sewage overflows and environmental damage. Councils might not refuse applications on these grounds. We believe we need a legal safeguard to help stop unsustainable development and protect communities, infrastructure, and the environment from further harm.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to legally require water companies to object to planning developments once the sewage system is over-capacity. This could stop new developments proceeding without confirmed infrastructure upgrades.",
