        "additional_details": "Many hate crime victims, including LGBTQ+, Black, Jewish, & other marginalised people\u2014are denied safe housing. Unlike domestic abuse victims, they receive no automatic priority, leaving many homeless, financially trapped, or stuck in unsafe areas. In 2024, it was reported that around 140,000 hate crimes were recorded, yet victims face barriers to rebuild their lives. We believe this reform will save lives, reduce public spending, ease pressure on emergency services & reduce welfare dependency.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to introduce a law giving hate crime victims the same housing priority as domestic abuse victims. This includes ending \u201clocal connection\u201d rules, allowing victims to apply for social housing anywhere and ensuring councils give urgent support to those fleeing hate crimes.",
