        "additional_details": "Many hate crime victims, including LGBTQ+, Black, Jewish, & other marginalised people, are denied safe housing. Unlike domestic abuse victims, they receive no automatic priority, leaving many homeless, financially trapped, or forced to stay in unsafe places. In 2024, the Home Office recorded around 140,000 hate crimes, yet victims face barriers to rebuild their lives. We believe this reform will save lives, reduce public spending, ease pressure on emergency services & reduce welfare dependency.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to amend housing legislation, giving hate crime victims the same housing priority as domestic abuse victims. This includes ending \u2018local connection\u2019 rules and residency requirements, allowing victims to apply for social housing anywhere, in safety.",
