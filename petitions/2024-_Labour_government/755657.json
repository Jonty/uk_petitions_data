        "additional_details": "Many areas, including our own, have already experienced serious environmental disruption from HS2 and New Road developments, including loss of green space, habitat damage, increased pollution, traffic and noise. Despite this, we feel further planning approval has focused on drive-through retail, supermarkets and car parks that primarily benefit commuters and commercial interests.\r\n\r\nWe are concerned that local young people are left with fewer free, natural places to go, which may worsen mental health pressures and reduce access to nature. We are calling for policy-led environmental compensation via government funding of projects such as  protected, high-quality natural parks or walking spaces that restore biodiversity, support wellbeing, and give something meaningful back to communities.",
        "background": "Communities affected by developments like HS2, New Road and commercial developments deserve environmental and social investment. We call for funding to create a high-quality natural park or walking space for wellbeing, young people, and nature recovery \u2014 not more car-led retail infrastructure.",
