        "additional_details": "The Supreme Court ruled that the Equality Act\u2019s protected characteristic of sex should be interpreted as referring to biological sex. This is contrary to all official guidance issued since 2010, but undermines the purpose of the GRA which brought into law the ECtHR ruling in Goodwin vs UK.\r\n\r\nIn addition, guidance has been that ordinarily trans people \u2018self identify\u2019 the spaces they use. Since 2009 NHS guidance has included trans people on the basis as does the 2003 PACE Codes.",
        "background": "Enshrine that sex for the purposes of the Equality Act (EA) includes sex as recorded on birth certificate following the issuing of a GRC and transgender people\u2019s rights by enshrining their ability use single sex spaces according to their gender identity unless exclusion is proportionate.",
