The English National Concessionary Travel Scheme is meant to help eligible elderly and disabled people to travel for free by bus. In our view, disabled people who rely on carers are not travelling for free if they have to pay for their carers. We want carers of disabled people who have a bus pass for free travel, to have free carer bus passes too.",
        "background": "Amend the English National Concessionary Travel Scheme, Transport Act 2000 and relevant legislation, and fund mandatory free bus passes for all carers of disabled people. There are disabled people who cannot travel without their carers and we think carers should be able to travel with them for free.",
