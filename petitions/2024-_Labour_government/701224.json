        "action": "Support the \"Palestine Statehood\" bill to be voted on in Parliament on 29th Nov.",
        "additional_details": "Such a move would not only affirm the Palestinian people's right to self-determination but also help establish a foundation for lasting peace in the region. For decades, Palestine has been denied full sovereignty, and the expansion of Israeli settlements, land confiscations, and recent actions in Gaza have further diminished the feasibility of a peaceful two-state solution.\r\n\r\nSupporting this bill would allow the UK to take a principled stand aligned with the international consensus.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, urge you to consider the historical context, the strong international support, and the urgent need for a peaceful resolution. By voting in favour of this bill, the UK government will contribute to a significant step towards stability and justice in the Middle East.",
