They enable access to harmful or illegal content, facilitate cyberbullying, promote constant distraction, and increase vulnerability to peer pressure and exploitation. \"Not seen, not heard\" policies that allow smartphones to remain in pockets or bags are insufficient which fail to prevent misuse and do not align with statutory safeguarding duties under Keeping Children Safe in Education (Sections 134\u2013137).",
