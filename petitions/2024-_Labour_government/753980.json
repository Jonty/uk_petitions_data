        "additional_details": "We assess fitness to drive following medical investigations/diagnosis to determine whether a medical condition is affecting road safety. This closure will result in many clients/patients not being able to access the support they need, losing their freedom and independence, and negatively affecting their mental health and well-being.  It will also result in people continuing to drive that should have surrendered their license, impacting on their own safety and a danger to other road users.",
        "background": "This must be debated in Parliament.\r\nIt is fundamental to road safety to ensure that all road users are safe to drive following a DVLA notifiable condition. \r\nGovernment must maintain this service either by finding a new provider or supporting the UHDB NHS Trust to make a U-turn on their decision.",
