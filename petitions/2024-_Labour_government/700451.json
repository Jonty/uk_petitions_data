        "additional_details": "We think this would compensate vulnerable road users, such as cyclists and pedestrians, more quickly and effectively. Pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders are often unable to obtain compensation because of a lack of adequate evidence. If a vulnerable road user is killed they are not there to give evidence; if they are seriously injured it may be impossible for them to give complete or satisfactory evidence of the circumstances in which they were injured.",
        "background": "Introduce presumed liability for civil cases relating to certain road collisions, to shift the burden of proof. It would mean when vulnerable road users, e.g cyclists & pedestrians, claim against a more powerful road user (a driver), the driver would be presumed liable unless they prove otherwise. ",
