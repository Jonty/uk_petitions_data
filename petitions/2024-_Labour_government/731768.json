        "additional_details": "Motorcycle noise is currently unregulated in the UK with no specified limit on noise emission. Motorcyles are regularly modified aftermarket purely to increase noise which is detrimental to the environment and peoples lives in general. There is zero reason for this to be permitted. There is zero reason to permit motorcycles to create excessive noise for no reason other than the rider wanting their vehicle to be \"noisier\". It is pure anti-social behaviour and easily delay with by legislation.",
        "background": "I would like statutory regulation limiting noise emissions to 80Db or less for motorcycles in the UK. Police should be given powers to roadside noise test motorbikes and noise emission should form a statutory requirement of motorcycle MOT testing which it currently, and incredibly is not.",
