We feel this is dangerous, as we believe that our flags belong to all citizens, irrespective of their political views, race, gender, age or other descriptor. The flag should be a symbol of unity \u2013 the common denominator that reflects shared values. We believe they are too precious to be used to become a symbol not of what we share, but what divides us.",
