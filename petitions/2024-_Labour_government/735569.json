Its invasive age verification risks doxxing users and forces websites to block UK citizens, stifling access to vital online communities and information. This disproportionately burdens small platforms and chills free speech. We need a new approach that genuinely protects users without sacrificing privacy, access, or freedom of expression. Repeal the Act and create balanced, effective legislation.",
