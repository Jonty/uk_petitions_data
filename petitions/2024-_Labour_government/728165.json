        "additional_details": "In 2016, the UK voted to leave the EU. \r\n\r\nLabour\u2019s plans and sudden deals to reverse this without a fresh public mandate breach the trust of the people and undermine democracy. The party did not campaign on rejoining EU structures, and no such proposal was in its 2024 manifesto. \r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to:\r\n1. Immediate cancel EU realignment plans\r\n2. Commit to a referendum on any future EU ties\r\n3. Call a general election to let the public decide on this major constitutional change.",
        "background": "The Government must reverse any steps toward rejoining the EU, its Single Market or Customs Union, and call a general election. These actions undermine the 2016 Brexit vote and were not part of Labour\u2019s election mandate.",
