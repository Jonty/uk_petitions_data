        "additional_details": "If 16-year-olds are old enough to vote, they should also take full responsibility for their actions. We can't grant adult rights in some areas while keeping child protections in others. This inconsistency undermines public trust in fairness and the law. Voting is a serious adult duty \u2014 and should come with matching legal consequences. Either 16-year-olds are adults, or they are not. The law must treat them consistently.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to review and align laws for 16- and 17-year-olds if the voting age is lowered. This includes criminal responsibility, sentencing, anonymity, and access to alcohol, tobacco, gambling, and other adult privileges. The legal framework must be consistent.",
