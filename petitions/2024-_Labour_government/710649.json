        "additional_details": "I recently had a full hysterectomy for stage 4 Endometriosis and although the choice i made was the right choice, after years of trying, i remain childless . My experience was made extremely traumatic by the fact that the ward i was staying on was a mixed women's surgical ward/antenatal ward. I think this is an issue in clinics as well. We often have to share the waiting room with mums and dads to be. I think there needs to be change and funding for separation of Gynaecology clinics from Maternity services.",
        "background": "Invest more money into Gynaecology services to make them separate from Maternity and stop 1000s of women who are struggling with infertility or miscarriage going through the heart ache of having to share clinic spaces or wards with pregnant women or parents to be.",
