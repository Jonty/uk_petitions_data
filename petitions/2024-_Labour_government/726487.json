        "action": "Ban the ownership of smartphones and camera phones for children under 16",
        "additional_details": "Smartphones and camera phones are having a devastating impact on young people in Britain. Children have access to huge amounts of material online, a lot of which is harmful to the child exposed to it. \r\nThere is an epidemic of issues related to internet usage and social media; cyber bullying, issues around sending and receiving sexualised images, unrealistic expectations around body image and appearance. \r\nSmartphones are damaging the mental and physical health of our children and adolescents.",
        "background": "I call for the government to ban the sale of, or provision of smartphones, or camera phones to under 16s. \r\nThis would be punishable by a \u00a32000 fine, to the adult who provided the child with the phone. \r\nI call for the government to make it illegal for under 16s to hold any social media accounts.",
