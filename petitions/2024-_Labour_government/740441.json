        "additional_details": "To be honest many are fed up with the whole pot and kettle debate about who has done what.  There have been reports about multiple members of both houses dodging taxes, purchasing multiple properties and having influence over bills and legislation that they have a vested interest in, or family members have a vested interest in.  Its time for allnof this to be made public, for every MP and Lord to be scrutinesed and if necessary removed from office.",
        "background": "After recent allegations it is clear that there are more MPs potentially fiddling taxes.  It is time for a complete and comprehensive review of all taxes, incomes, business interests and holdings.",
