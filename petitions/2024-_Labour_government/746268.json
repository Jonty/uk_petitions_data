        "additional_details": "Political parties often make election promises to win votes but face no consequences when they break them. Voters deserve a democratic mechanism to hold governments to account between elections. This would improve transparency, trust, and democratic integrity to a system that many feel is letting down the public.",
        "background": "Create an independent, legally recognised body to assess whether elected governments are delivering on their manifesto promises. If a government breaks significant promises without reasonable justification, this body should trigger public recourse, including potential re-elections.",
