However, the current budget plan poses substantial challenges that we believe will lead to closures and job losses. The increased costs associated combined with the ongoing financial strain from the pandemic, could very well close the doors of businesses, who may find themselves paying out more than their annual profit in taxes. To survive this challenging landscape, we urgently seek your support in reconsidering these budgetary measures.",
