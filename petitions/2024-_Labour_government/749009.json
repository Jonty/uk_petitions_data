        "additional_details": "Every day in the UK people are attacked with knives or sexually assaulted. In 2024, over 50,000 knife offences and 71,000 rapes were recorded. Law-abiding citizens currently have almost no legal way to protect themselves.\r\n\r\nThe UK is one of the few developed countries where civilians cannot carry non-lethal defensive sprays or gels.\r\n\r\nWe ask the Government to allow adults aged 18+ to legally possess and carry regulated defensive sprays and gels for self-defence. Products should meet safety standards, be sold via licensed retailers with age checks, and exclude stun guns and tasers. Misuse or sale to minors should remain a criminal offence.\r\n\r\nWhy this matters: Regulated sprays give law-abiding people a safe, non-lethal way to stop or escape attacks, helping protect those most at risk.",
