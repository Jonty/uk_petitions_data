We think the term Shared ownership is mis-selling because we think many consumers may be unaware the equity is a depreciated tenancy.\r\nWe think if the 80 year lease rules are not highlighted some consumers may have to pay thousands of pounds to extend a lease potentially with many pitfalls.\r\n\r\nWe think the disadvantages of Shared ownership outweigh any advantages; it is not a transparent or fair transaction ",
