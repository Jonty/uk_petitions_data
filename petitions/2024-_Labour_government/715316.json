But as a women we have to pay extra to deal with something we didn\u2019t choose to have. We belief it\u2019s unfair how we have no choice over these things and having to pay more than men have to is unjust. Also if a girl isn\u2019t comfortable financially to buy pads or tampons it\u2019s unfair that she should struggle for things that are out of her hands. No woman should have to ever go through that.",
