        "action": "Require NHS to start priority triage & discharge pathways for dementia patients",
        "additional_details": "People with dementia can deteriorate rapidly in hospital due to unfamiliar environments, delayed discharge due to fragmented processes and sequential signoffs. NHS England recognises that admission can trigger distress, delirium, and functional decline. The Parliamentary debate in March 2024 on inequalities in dementia services acknowledged that existing dementia initiatives can fall short and more must be done. We believe faster, dementia informed discharge pathways would reduce harm, distress, and unnecessary hospital stays, freeing up beds.",
        "background": "Make NHS hospitals implement priority triage and faster discharge pathways for people with dementia when the medical condition is treated & home or community care is available. Formally recognise that delay in discharge can cause rapid deterioration and should be treated as a clinical risk.",
