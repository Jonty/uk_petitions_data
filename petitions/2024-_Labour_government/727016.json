        "additional_details": "Many UK rivers are heavily altered from their natural state & can have difficulty handling our changing environment. This can have potentially disastrous consequences for people & nature. For rivers to provide us with essential benefits, we think they urgently need space to recover. Connected, natural areas of land along river corridors can offer this space, and could help to: restore rivers; improve water quality; offer flood/drought resilience; boost biodiversity and help safeguard food production.",

We call on government to commit to providing financial incentives to help farmers create & maintain connected land along all river corridors (with buffers, wetlands, riparian tree planting) at scale.",
