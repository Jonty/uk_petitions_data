        "additional_details": "Us, the general public feel gaslighted & manipulated every general election into voting in/giving power to which Manifesto that seems the most lucrative. And time and time again parties go back on their policies and break them once in office leaving millions of people feeling betrayed, divided and hopeless in their political beliefs. If you cannot lie under oath whilst in court, you should NOT be allowed to lie to millions without facing appropriate consequences for those actions.",
        "background": "Everyone should always be held accountable for their words & actions, that same principle should extend into the cabinet and be upheld in the highest standard possible. Any politician caught lying or breaking any promised manifesto policy should either be relieved of their duties or heavily fined.",
