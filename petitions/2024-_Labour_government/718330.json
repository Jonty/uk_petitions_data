        "additional_details": "We also want NHS bodies to fund legal parental representation in court cases and allow children\u2019s transfer to other hospitals in the UK and outside. We believe that parents can be side-lined, shut out of critical care decisions, or enter agonising legal battles. We feel that the NHS and Cafcass sometimes give little weight to parent\u2019s views. Instead of collaboration, families may face emotional & financial stress. We believe no parent should be excluded from their child\u2019s care and that the Government must ensure a system that respects parent\u2019s rights.",
        "background": "We urge the Government to review laws around critical care decisions to ensure parents are central in decision-making for critically ill children.  We want NHS bodies to be required to consult parents as equals, be required to get a second opinion from an agreed upon specialist and offer mediation.",
