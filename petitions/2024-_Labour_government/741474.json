        "additional_details": "As someone with a hearing impairment, I find myself constantly facing challenges in public spaces. Venues like cinemas, concert venues, theatres, and sports events are inherently reliant on audio, which poses a barrier for myself and the deaf and hard of hearing community. Without subtitles, the dialogue in films, announcements during sports events, and song lyrics at concerts become inaccessible, cutting us off from the full experience that everyone else enjoys.",
        "background": "Implement subtitles in public situations, such as cinemas & theatres who can use technologies like subtitling apps aimed towards  hearing-impaired individuals. Concerts and sporting events can have screens displaying live-captioned text alongside the program to ensure everyone is included.",
