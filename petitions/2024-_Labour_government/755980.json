        "additional_details": "It is now treatable, but treatment works best before symptoms appear. Currently, many babies are diagnosed too late, after irreversible damage has occurred. Screening for SMA does not require a new programme it simply adds one condition to the existing heel-prick test. Scotland has committed to screening. All babies across the UK deserve the same chance of an early diagnosis and the best possible start in life. \u201cNo child should suffer avoidable harm when early diagnosis can change outcomes.",

SMA is a rare genetic condition and a leading cause of infant mortality.",
