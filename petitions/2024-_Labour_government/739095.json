        "additional_details": "In an increasingly unpredictable world, safeguarding our children in school environments must be a top priority. While schools already have policies in place, additional support from trained security personnel could enhance safety and allow staff to focus on education, knowing that there is a rapid response plan for any serious threat.\r\n\r\nThis measure is not directed at any specific group but aims to prevent harm from any individual or incident that could endanger our young people.",
        "background": "To petition the UK Government and Department for Education to fund and implement professionally trained, non-lethal security personnel (e.g. officers equipped with tasers or other protective measures) in all UK schools, to deter and respond to potential threats and ensure the safety of our children.",
