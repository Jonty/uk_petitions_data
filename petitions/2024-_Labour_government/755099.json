        "additional_details": "Ghost and misused number plates undermine road safety and law enforcement by allowing drivers to evade detection for speeding, red-light offences and other crimes. This creates unfairness for compliant motorists and weakens public confidence in traffic enforcement. Stronger regulation, clear penalties and consistent enforcement are needed to deter misuse and protect all road users.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to strengthen regulation and enforcement against ghost and misused number plates, require clearer standards for number plate manufacture and display, introduce penalty points for serious or repeated offences, and ensure police forces have the powers and resources to act.",
