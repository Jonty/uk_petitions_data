I\u2019m also neurodiverse with living experience of childhood adversity and trauma, so I know how valuable therapeutic relationships are for healing, whereas use of restraint can add to stress and fear.",
        "background": "I want an end to the use of any punitive restraint used against children in residential care with histories of adversity and trauma. It risks retraumatising them, when therapeutic practise is available to support healing, development and achievement.",
