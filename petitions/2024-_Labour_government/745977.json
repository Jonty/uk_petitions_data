        "additional_details": "This bridge became redundant in 1967. It\u2019s ownership/management has been a long-standing point of delay/debate between Historic Railways Estate & Cheshire East Highways. Lack of maintenance/poor management has resulted in the road and embankments slumping excessively. For 20 years, traffic lights have reduced the structural loading. A recent 7.5T weight limit imposed on this arterial route is now causing significant issues with HGV\u2019s/businesses attempting to avoid the bridge. It is not \u201clisted\u201d",
        "background": "We consider this issue time critical, a quick resolution to permanently demolish the bridge and reinstate the road is required.  Given the decades of delays and ineffective management leading to this point it is considered that Government/House of Commons support is required to expedite a solution.",
