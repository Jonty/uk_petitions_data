        "action": "Offer the population an opportunity to hold a vote on rejoining the EU",
        "additional_details": "Brexit cut UK GDP by around 4%, increased inflation, and harmed trade / public services. Exports to the EU fell over 15%, investment declined, and key sectors face skill shortages. As global tensions rise, strong international alliances are vital.\r\n\r\nPolls now show a majority regret leaving. A whole generation was too young to vote but must live with the consequences.  The public deserves a fresh, informed choice that reflects today\u2019s economic reality, global challenges, and generational views.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to give the public a chance to vote on rejoining the EU. The economic impact of leaving is clear, with trade barriers, labour shortages, and rising costs. Over 60% of voters now believe leaving was a mistake, and an entire generation missed out. We believe a revote is essential",
