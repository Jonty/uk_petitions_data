        "additional_details": "Asthma is classed as a long-term and potentially life-threatening condition that affects thousands of people every day. Asthma attacks alone can cause people to go into respiratory distress and more. Without medication, people may be unable to control their symptoms, which may lead to hospitalisation and more stress on NHS staff. We believe having asthma medication free and available can help to prevent this as asthma medication can cost up to \u00a350 total each month.",
