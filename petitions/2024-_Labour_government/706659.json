        "additional_details": "Since 1665, scientific research with microscopes, has shown that all life (creatures and plants) consists of tiny cells which are the basic units of life. All cells are generated by existing cells and require large amounts of information and intelligence. We think these living cells demonstrate a designed plan for individual and corporate life in a \u2018just right\u2019 environment. Therefore we believe children should be taught that our world has been intelligently designed and created.",

In the opinion of many scientists, neo-darwinian evolutionism/abiogenesis is not supported by the evidence and should be re-evaluated.",
