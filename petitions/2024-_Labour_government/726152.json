        "additional_details": "The British people deserve a competent government which serves the best interests of all the British people. Presently we do not have that and 10s of millions of people have no confidence in this government. A debate for a public referendum for a vote of no confidence would be the  most democratic, decent & fairest thing to do, for the people. When there is such widespread doubt in the governments competence, let the people decide, that is true democracy.",
        "background": "I want parliament to debate calling a referendum for a vote of no confidence in this Labour government, on the grounds of its broken manifesto promises and mismanagement of so many issues, including the farmers, the winter fuel payments for our elderly, gender equality, geo-engineering & the economy",
