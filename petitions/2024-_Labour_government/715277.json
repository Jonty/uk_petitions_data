        "additional_details": "Following the action taken under government direction following the Southport tragedy, there is zero confidence to be had in the current Labour government.  They have let down our elderly, our farmers, our businesses, and our children.  Our borders are a free-for-all, and our tolerance is being abused and taken for weakness. \r\nWe are tired, and we have had enough.  We want a Government which we CAN trust.",
