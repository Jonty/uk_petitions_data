        "action": "Introduce compulsory third party insurance for electric mobility scooters",
        "additional_details": "In recent years mobility scooters have rapidly evolved into vehicles that have increased in, weight, manoeuvrability, and speed, to the point where they have the potential to be hazardous to pedestrians on public paths / highways and in other public spaces. To date there is no mandatory requirement for insurance, and as such we feel that the matter should be given consideration in the interest of innocent parties that find themselves unable to claim injury compensation.",
        "background": "There is currently no legal requirement for drivers of electric mobility scooters to obtain third party insurance cover; as such any person sustaining injuries through negligence of the driver can have a low chance of claiming compensation. We would like to see compulsory insurance introduced.",
