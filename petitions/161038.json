        "additional_details": "Every child should have access to sun cream, especially march-October, teachers, anybody in a position of care to a child should be allowed to apply sun cream where they see fit.\r\nSun damage ages the skin but also raises the risk of skin cancer, one of the most preventable cancer. I believe all school children should receive a 'sunstart' pack containing a sun hat, sun cream, and information sheet, a bottle of water , and an activity pack. FREE SUN CREAM FOR ALL SCHOOL CHILDREN.",
