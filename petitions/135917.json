        "additional_details": "For well over a generation, we have taken for granted the economic, political and travel benefits of EU - and EEC - membership. While there is now a popular mandate for a negotiated withdrawal from the EU, it is also essential that the interests be respected of over 48% of voters who wish to retain the benefits of being in the EU. The best way to do this is through membership of the European Economic Area (EEA).",
        "background": "On 23 June the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. The outcome of the referendum must now be respected. However, over 48% of voters expressed a desire to remain in the EU.",
