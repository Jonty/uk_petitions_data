        "additional_details": "The government should not be allowed to decide what types of porn people are allowed to watch. As long as its consenting, over-18 adults, and it does not go against current law then it should be perfectly fine to show online.\r\n\r\nImplementing age verification on to websites will be very risky if it uses personal information to check you are over-18. Lots of porn sites have been hacked recently so that is also a big concern. Parental controls can be easily setup so this is unneeded.",
        "background": "Age verification checks on porn websites will be hard to implement. ISPs already offer many ways to do this without having to risk personal information. If age verification is done using credit card then dodgy websites may take advantage of this.\r\n",
