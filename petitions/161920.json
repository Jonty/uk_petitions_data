It's no longer acceptable. I myself was issued a bill today 16/07/16 for two and a half thousand pounds dating back to 2013 even though I handed them all information requested. I'm on a minimum wage and just scrape by, where am I finding this repayment ? Due to someone's poor mathematical skills it's wrong and has to stop now.",
