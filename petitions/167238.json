        "action": "Make egg manufacturers legally obliged to display a method of male chick culling",
        "additional_details": "Chick culling is a common method of a male chick disposal as males don't lay eggs and are therefore unnecessary waste generating no financial or other profit for the egg industry.\r\n\r\nIt is morally unacceptable that egg manufacturers can accompany their products with images of happy hens whilst not revealing the information about this inhumane cruelty happening on a huge scale in their factory premises on a daily basis. That is effectively deceiving the consumers by a false advertisement.",
        "background": "UK legislation should provide an enforceable law that every egg pack produced in an egg factory must have a clearly visible and well readable statement what killing methods of male chicks are used in the given egg factory, for example:\r\n\r\n\"Method of male chick culling: Suffocation\"",
