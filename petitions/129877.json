        "additional_details": "It's my intention to gauge the levels of competence in a variety of disciplines of Ofsted inspectors and senior staff, relevant ministers, the education department and multinational education publishers such as Pearson. The tests would be set by a cross section of the UK public and be published nationally. The tests would be across all subjects and look at academic acumen as well as emotional intelligence so that we could asses the skills base responsible for educational provision.",
        "background": "With the testing of very young children I feel that it's important to ensure those responsible for the tests are adequately monitored so that we can better understand how they might improve. ",
