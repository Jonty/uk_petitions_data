Mike Walker had a van going for a while and it was brilliant, he tried so hard but unfortunately the council seemed more interested in shutting him down. We want a permanent chippy in place which we can walk to, ran by a local. ",
        "background": "Once upon a time there was a chippy in Woodside Telford, then during a revamp of the area it was knocked down. Since then there have been developments in the area but no much loved local chippy. A local man tried with a mobile van but the council did what they could to stop him, yet Madley has 2!!! ",
