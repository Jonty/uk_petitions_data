        "additional_details": "Would it not now be a good time with the announced closures of Redford Barracks in Edinburgh that one of the Barracks was gifted by the MOD for the Use of Veteran OAPs adopting the same lines and procedures as the Royal Hospital Chelsea but opened as a tri service arrangement so that old service personnel can retire to a home that meets not only their medical needs but also their needs of comradeship with the knowing that their families are within a short traveling distance for visiting ",
        "background": "A lot of veteran pensioners within the North of England and the whole of Scotland do not see the Royal Hospital Chelsea as a viable option to retire to due to the distances involved for family and friends to visit and the feelings of isolation that this can cause.\r\n\r\n",
