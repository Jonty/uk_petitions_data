        "additional_details": "In a time of significant financial strain public services are pushed to the limit and further penalised through stringent budget cuts. Yet, there is significant potential tax revenue to be collected from unscrupulous individuals and organisations that utilise tax havens. Is the PM, who had previously benefited from controversial personal financial dealings in one such tax haven the right person for this job? Can the PM claim the money that is rightly owed to the treasury and the British Public? ",
        "background": "Rt Hon. PM David Cameron has on numerous occasion advocated an end to tax havens and tougher penalties for tax evaders. His commitment to such claims are no longer clear in light of the recent revelations and the acknowledgement that he benefited from a deal(s) in a tax haven. Can we trust him?",
