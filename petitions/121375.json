        "additional_details": "On Monday 8th of February 2016 Channel 4 aired a documentary regarding overspending in 3 by-elections by the Conservatives.  I was compelled to make a complaint to the Electoral Commission who said it was a police matter.\r\n\r\nKent Police passed me on to Action Fraud and on and on it went.  Hours later I was back with the Electoral Commission who again said that it was a police matter.  Electoral Fraud obviously goes into \"the difficult box\" with the police and they should be relieved of this duty.",
        "background": "Police under the Representation of the People Act 1983, investigate alleged breaches of rules around candidate spending in Elections.  This calls for reform bringing it under the 2000 Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 and under the jurisdiction of the Electorial Commission.\r\n",
