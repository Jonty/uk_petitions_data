        "additional_details": "I know of at least 15 nursing and care homes that have had to close recently due to lack of funding and support from the goverment and local authorities. These places are home for some people and it's not a nice feeling for people to be moved from pillar to post. I can't imagine how horrible it is to be told the time has come you can no longer live at home and you have to go into a care home. then to settle in somewhere and possibly face the prospect a few years down the line of being moved on.",
