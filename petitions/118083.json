These were published June 2015 for first testing in June 2016 giving schools less than a year to prepare the children. Many well educated adults will struggle with some of the sample questions.",
        "background": "The government has recently changed the tests taken by 11 year old children (KS2 SATs) making them significantly harder than previous tests. We do not object to improved standards in education but we do feel that MPs should fully appreciate the level at which such tests are set.",
