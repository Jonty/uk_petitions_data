        "additional_details": "The loss of local A&E Services in Hartlepool in 2011, has already caused unnecessary hardship and inconvenience for patients who now travel to Stockton to access A&E.  The road infrastructure (A19 / A66) is inadequate; causing delays for ambulances and patients, potentially causing unnecessary deaths.  The remaining four A&E Departments serve Hartlepool, Stockton, Middlesbrough, Redcar & Cleveland and Darlington, with a total population of 662,800 (2011 Census).",
        "background": "Proposals would see A&E departments across Teesside, Durham and Darlington reduced from four to three; putting additional pressure on existing services.  Contradicting the Government\u2019s pledge to \u2018improve the health of the country\u2019 and 'making services easier for patients to access'.",
