        "additional_details": "All refugees in the current migrant crisis are so desperate to get into Western countries under the guise of fearing for their lives.\r\nIf this is the case then any country other than the one they are fleeing from must be a safe haven. Then why are they so desperate to enter the UK especially? Because they will feel even more safe? No it is because they know that we will provide for them a better life than they have ever known and the chance to become a UK Citizen.\r\nWe cannot Allow them Citizenship",

If the reason a refugee is fleeing a country is for fear of their lives then any other country must be safe not because they wish to better their lives in the UK",
