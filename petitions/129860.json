If the age was lowered to 18 this would help catch this dreadful illness sooner and help many more women avoid or even survive this type of cancer. Please sign and help protect women from finding out before it's too late! Thank you. ",

I've now been diagnosed with CIN3 (precancerous cells) which will be removed. This could've been changing for years & could've been picked up sooner if the age was 18",
