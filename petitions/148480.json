        "additional_details": "- Conditions of use restrict operating hours to 9am and 6pm, which is not realistic for a nursery.\r\n- 250 traffic movements per day is not sustainable for the road or neighbouring roads.  \r\n- The road has no pavement and no street lighting, which is not safe for children going to a nursery.\r\n- Commercial use is not suited to a residential area. It is disruptive and noisy, which is counter to the Woking Development plan which \u2018seeks to protect tranquil and quiet areas\u2019\r\n",
        "background": "Woodham House was residential but has been a cookery school since 1966. A day nursery now wants to use it. This would be a significant intensification for the property; a 10-fold increase in traffic; increased risk to drivers, pedestrians and birds in the neighbouring Special Protection Area. \r\n",
