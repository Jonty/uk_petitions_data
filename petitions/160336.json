        "action": "Driving - Impose a compulsory ability re-test every 10 years for all UK drivers.",
        "additional_details": "In industry it is normal practice and a lawful H&S requirement to retest workers for various different skills (i.e. first aid, electrical safety, handling of heavy machinery) so why does this not apply to drivers? This will ensure only competent and safe drivers take to the roads. It will weed out those individuals who are no longer capable of driving a vehicle for whatever reason.\r\nThose convicted of a serious motoring offence should also be ordered to take the test to re-gain their licence.",
        "background": "I propose that all drivers should be given an ability re-test every 10 years from the date of driving test pass. This is not a full test the same as the first driving test but an ability test to ensure all drivers are safe, aware, knowledgeable enough to handle the UK's roads safely. ",
