        "additional_details": "Refer to sensible views of Philippa Whitford in the NHS and Social Care funding in the House of Commons on Jan 11th 2017. She presents the impressive model as practised in Scotland.\r\nEveryone knows that A and E is not coping in many parts of the country. This is exacerbated by the lack of GP availability out of hours and at weekends. Demand has risen due to an ageing population and lack of alternative facilities. A and E is one of the few services that virtually everybody will use in their lives.",
        "background": "There is national alarm at the state of many A and E departments with excessive waiting times and some inappropriate use by people who should be treated elsewhere. Separate funding paid for fully by a broad based tax to which most if not all contribute is needed to provide sufficient urgent care. ",
