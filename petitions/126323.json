        "action": "Take into account the faith of Pakistani Christians when they claim asylum.",
        "additional_details": "This year's Easter Sunday bombing, targeted at Christians, is tragically just the latest in a long line of lynchings, church-bombings and house-burnings. In practice there is little or no protection of religious minorities by the authorities; perpetrators know they are more likely to be praised than prosecuted. See the list of atrocities on the Wikipedia page \"Christianity in Pakistan\". Search for Pakistan in the web pages of Barnabas Fund or Christian Solidarity Worldwide.",
        "background": "When considering Asylum applications from Pakistani Christians the Immigation Service should recognise that Pakistan is a dangerous place for Christians. To tell them simply to be Christian in secret is to misunderstand the Biblical command to gently and respectfully speak about Jesus Christ.",
