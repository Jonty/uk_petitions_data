        "additional_details": "(Sept 03) \u00a3900m in foreign aid budget on helping some of the four million refugees who have fled Syria since the war began. \u00a3900 million pounds could have been used to aid refugees that we already have, I'm talking about homeless we have, teachers, ex-servicemen, firemen, people who have contributed or who are capable of contributing but currently can't. If you ENABLE and HELP our own people first, then we will have more pairs of hands and minds of help others.",
        "background": "I, as i'm sure many of the public, are sick of your lack of prioritization. I'd like to see OUR money being spent on OUR people and problems, before we start fixing everybody else's. The majority of us work too hard and are taxed beyond belief, for it to be spent on improving outside interests.",
