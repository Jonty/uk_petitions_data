        "additional_details": "Many videos via the media or social networks have surfaced showing women discreetly feeding their baby whilst members of the public approach her calling her names, and making the mother fear for not only her safety but the safety of her child. Women should be made to feel safe and secure when they need to feed their baby, and to know that if someone does start abusing them that they have the law on their side. Discrimination is Discrimination!! This must stop now!! ",
        "background": "Breastfeeding is one of the most natural things in the world, and yet women are being discriminated and harassed in public by individuals for feeding their baby. This problem is on the rise and it's time for Mothers to take a stand. Women being called vicious names or even attacked needs to stop. ",
