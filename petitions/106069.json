        "action": "Restrict, by law, the number of strikes any Union can start in a given period.",
        "additional_details": "The recent strikes by underground and tube workers almost brought London to a standstill and created chaos, frustration and anger to hundreds of thousands of innocent people, not to mention financial hardship to many others as well as businesses of every size. \r\n\r\nAs unions are using these on an ever increasing basis, the government should consider a legal chance limit the use of the same (for example - a maximum of 2 strikes in any 12 month rolling period).",
        "background": "The current ability for unions to impose strike action is having a seriously detrimental effect on innocent individuals, businesses of all size and the UK economy as a whole. \r\n\r\nStrikes should be a last resort, but of late they appear to be a standard ransom action by unions and their members.",
