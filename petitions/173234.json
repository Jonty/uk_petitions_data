        "additional_details": "Using packaging for fruit and veg that have natural skin protection is creating waste for the sake of waste. The misuse of plastics can be seen in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Coop, etc. These companies need to take environmental responsibility and adopt sustainability as part of their corporate strategy.",
        "background": "Why wrap up avocados, cucumbers, bananas, potatoes, peppers, etc.? These can be easily displayed in supermarkets' shelves without the plastic as they have natural skin protection. This packaging will go straight to our bins which may end up in landfill or even in our rivers and oceans.",
