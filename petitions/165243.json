        "background": "We all know that the railway is a dangerous place, however people still do not understand this and are running across the tracks at stations, laying on the tracks or even playing chicken at level crossings.\r\n\r\nLast year 332 people died after trespassing onto the railway tracks in the UK. \r\n",
