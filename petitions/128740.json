        "additional_details": "If you live in Scotland, Ireland or Wales you are entitled to non repayable grants towards your university fees and living costs, in addition to your loans. On a 3 year degree, an English student will be charged \u00a39k study fees and 'may' be eligible for a loan of up to \u00a36905 for living expenses/year - all of which is repayable! \r\nIf you live elsewhere in the uk - you are eligible to receive non-repayable grants in excess of \u00a35000/yr. \r\nOver a 3yr course this reduces debt by over \u00a315000! Fair?\r\n",
        "background": "On checking the Student Finance England details for our daughter - it became apparent that, as we reside in England - we are disproportionately disadvantaged in terms of government support for further education. \r\nThere are no longer non repayable grants available to English residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
