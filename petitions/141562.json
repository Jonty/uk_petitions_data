        "additional_details": "If you purchased a TV based on false claims you would be able to get a refund under the Trade Descriptions Act. It should therefore follow that once a fact in the EU referendum is proven false that an apology and correction should be issued immediately but this didn't happen. The Leave bus kept this lie painted on it right till the final week of campaigning.\r\n\r\nAlso, the Leave campaign sent out a leaflet implying that Turkey, Syria and Iraq were about to join the EU when this was also false.",
        "background": "During the EU referendum campaign, Leave mistakenly stated that the UK sends \u00a3350 million to the EU each week. When they were made aware by the BBC and other impartial bodies that this figure was much lower, Leave refused to correct or apologise for their mistake, thus voters were mislead.",
