        "action": "Make the employment of teachers on the basis of their faith a criminal offence",
        "additional_details": "Sections 58 and 60 of the SSFA expressly allow for the non-recruitment of teachers on the basis of those teachers not following a school's stated faith. A number of groups including the National Secular Society and Accord have expressed, in more detail than can be posted here, how damaging this is to both our children's education and to teachers' career development. \r\n\r\nThe Equality Act 2010, whilst updating and outlawing many unfair practices, still falls short protecting teachers without faith.",
        "background": "Since the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, religious discrimination in teacher employment has been entrenched as standard practice in schools of a religious nature across the country. This discrimination is unfair, morally reprehensible, and should be banned without further delay.",
