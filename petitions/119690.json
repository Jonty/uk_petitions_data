        "action": "Introduce a minimum 10 year jail sentence for anyone carrying a knife",
        "additional_details": "Bringing in a minimum 10 year jail sentence for anyone caught carrying a knife will act as a tough deterrent and may make people think about the consequences.  Bringing in a minimum jail term for anyone involved in knife crime, even being with someone carrying a knife,  will be a deterrent for gangs to congregate together in groups and will be less likely to go through with any knife attack without a large gang egging people on.  \r\n\r\nMore needs to be done \r\n\r\nPlease sign my petition if you agree ",
        "background": "I believe there is a minimum sentence for people convicted of carrying a knife,  or being involved in knife crime,  but it seems this is not implemented strictly enough.  As a result we are hearing of stabbing on an almost daily basis.  More needs to be done. ",
