        "additional_details": "Time and time again fathers are being stopped from seeing their children. Even with a visitation order, the ex partner can stop them and have to be taken back to court at the expense of the father again. \r\n\r\nIt's a lengthy and costly process and the mother has automatic residency rights over the child. The current procedures don't do enough to stop a mother from blocking contact with their children. \r\n\r\nIf the mother blocks contact without a valid excuse, she should be made to pay future court fees",
        "background": "I want fathers to have equal rights in a family court and not just automatically given to the mother. Also a stronger penalty for breach of court order. With the person who is breachig the court order liable to pay costs towards a new court order. ",
