        "action": "Overseas military action to require super majority vote of two third of MP\u2019s",
        "additional_details": "A Parliamentary Motion for armed conflict is perhaps the most significant matter that our MPs\u2019 are ever required to vote upon and as in the case of Iraq and subsequent conflicts their vote has had enormous repercussions for the United Kingdom, not only in terms of  those killed and wounded but in the aftermath, as now seen in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.\r\n\r\nThe present majority government received less than 37% of the vote from just 24% of the electorate at the 2015 General Election. \r\n",
        "background": "The Petition's purpose is to ensure a higher percentage of the electorate\u2019s views are taken account of when Parliament considers military action and that only Parliament can authorize the deployment of UK military forces as non-combative advisers in overseas conflicts to which the UK is not party.\r\n",
