        "action": "Refuges for domestic violence victims MUST be exempt from housing benefit cap.",
        "additional_details": "As seen on BBC breakfast, these brave women and children will have nowhere else to go. Many don't have a secure location to escape to, and even in refuges can often be tracked down, and in extreme cases even killed. We must insure, not only that they stay open, but be better and more sustainably funded. We need many more refuges, not many less. Thousands of families of abusive partners owe their lives to these refuges, which give them a chance to change identity and live full and secure lives.",
        "background": "Refuges for domestic violence victims rely on getting their full rent per room so they can stay open, some local authorities are already refusing funding in the belief that many of these desperately needed refuges may close when the cap is brought in. It is unacceptable that they lose any funding.",
