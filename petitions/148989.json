        "additional_details": "Leaders on both sides were guilty of over-simplifying the arguments and providing inaccurate information. Now leaders of the \"Leave\" faction are denying or reneguing on claims they made during the campaign. Clear examples are the amount of money purportedly paid by the UK to the EU and that this sum would be available post-referendum to the NHS.  Permitting the acquisition of political power on the basis of misinformation undermines the credibility of this country and democracy itself.",
        "background": "The result of the EU referendum is unsafe, untenable and potentially a threat to democracy itself because so much of the debate was based on misinformation and untruths.",
