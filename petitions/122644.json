        "action": "Return Sex Education to UK schools and update it for the 21st Century",
        "additional_details": "achieving the extraordinary feat of uniting four parliamentary select committees, five teaching unions, the Children\u2019s commissioner, the Chief Medical Officer, the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, two royal societies and no less than six medical royal colleges. \r\n\r\nEducation Secretary Nicky Morgan ruled out making sex education compulsory for all schools. Strange, not just due so many wise and knowledgable people wanted mandatory sex education, but also because Mrs Morgan herself did",
        "background": "Due to the recent decision by the education secretary Ms Morgan to remove compulsory sex education from UK schools, we petition & campaign to have it returned to the curriculum & propose it be updated to a wonder view of sexual & relationship education in the 21st Century Age of Information.
