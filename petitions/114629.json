        "action": "Provide armed security for Synagogues and jewish institutions in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The threat level in Europe is getting worse and as evidenced, is turning from \"antisemitic assaults\" into terror attacks, with innocent people being murdered. According to the CST (Community Security Trust) Antisemitism in the UK is at its worst level since records began and the risk of an attack is increasing by the day. It is  impossible for a policeman or security guard without a weapon to protect synagogues, schools and other institutions  from terrorists who arm guns and knives.\r\n",
        "background": " European governments are providing armed security for synagogues and Jewish institutions following numerous fatal terror attacks. This is because where there is a serious risk of fatalities, the only feasible solution is to provide armed security for Jewish public places. The UK must do the same.",
