        "additional_details": "Because my situation and symptoms are 'atypical' I have spent the last few years being passed around in the system to different departments and teams, but never being taken on by their services as I do not meet the criteria or \"fit in their box\". This has been made worse by the funding crisis, as no one is prepared to take on the atypical cases.\r\n\r\nI propose the creation of specialist multi-disciplinary teams to take on the atypical cases, so that no one also falls through the gaps in the system.",
        "background": "I have spent my life living with complex illnesses, and this coupled with also having a rare illness, I have found myself falling through the gaps in the NHS.",
