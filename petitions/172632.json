It just shows that our warships are for the shop window\u00a0and not for fighting.\"\r\n\r\nLord West of Spithead, a former First Sea Lord, said:\u00a0\u201cThis is just another example of where the lack of money is squeezing and making the nation less safe. We will have this gap of several years without missiles. Well, that\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t have to fight anybody in the meantime.\u201d",
        "background": "The MoD has admitted that the Royal Navy's Harpoon anti-ship missile will go out of service in 2018 with no replacement specified. The shorter range Sea Skua missile also goes out of service, not to be replaced until 2020.\r\n\r\nThis means the Royal Navy will lack a ship-killing capability for sometime",
