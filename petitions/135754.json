        "additional_details": "This is my call for compulsory political education in secondary schools. The recent referendum has seen both sides of the fence calling the other uneducated. Let's educate the younger generation so they come into the political world with the skills and knowledge to make informed decisions with confidence. You never know, it may increase the numbers of under 25s voting as well.",
        "background": "As an under 25, I have always exercised my right to vote. Many of my peers do not. I must confess, I have very little knowledge about politics as I have NEVER been educated in it. Very few under 25s have been educated in politics, because it's not taught in schools. ",
