However she would now support it and she wished \"supporters of same-sex marriage had been more vocal about their position before vote in July last year\"'. This is utter rubbish as there is a lot of hypocrisy within her views and she doesn't seem capable of standing up for equality. This clearly shows she is not suitable for the job.",
