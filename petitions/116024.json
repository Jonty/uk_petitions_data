        "additional_details": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster#United_Kingdom\r\n\r\nThe use of filibustering has been used in the past to block certain bills being voted on. The most recent case involved MP Philip Davies prolonging a debate on a bill which would make the teaching of first aid in schools compulsory. Although proposed by Labour\u2019s Teresa Pearce, the Bill had much support from others as including backbench Conservatives and organisations such as the Red Cross and St. John Ambulance.  ",
        "background": "Filibustering is when one or more MP's prolong a debate in order to run it over the allotted time given to prevent a vote on the proposal. This is a highly undemocratic way of voting on certain pieces of legislature, so I therefore propose that measures are taken in to stop the use of filibustering",
