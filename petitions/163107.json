        "additional_details": "Recent examples, incl. the EU Referendum, show how the demographic distribution of those who turn up to vote is skewed towards the 45+ age group. One reason is that young voters (18-34) no longer find \"offline\" options engaging in the political and technological landscape of today.\r\n\r\nAdditional benefits:\r\n- Reduce costs by capturing, storing and processing electoral data with less paperwork\r\n- Strengthen the UK focus on becoming a world leader in the digital revolution (see 2016 Queen's Speech)",
        "background": "The electoral roll should be given the option to vote online via desktop PC, mobile or tablet on the day of the election, alongside the current \"offline\" voting options (polling station, vote by post, vote by proxy). \"Online\" options could increase voters' turn-out (esp. among 18-34) and save money",
