        "additional_details": " Ask yourself: Is it right that tea that is sold in the UK may be picked by people in bonded labour who have to live amongst their own sewage? Is it fair that the chocolate you buy as an after-school treat for your children contains cocoa picked by a farmer who can\u2019t afford to send her own children to school?\r\n\r\nI have dreamt for many years that Britain would one day act to end modern Slavery. Such a law will demonstrate that the UK is outward looking and compassionate, and truly define a new era!",
        "background": "Free of EU Trade Restrictions - this petition calls for legislation to end Slavery in the tea, coffee and cocoa farming industries. It calls upon the Government to pass a law requiring ALL tea and coffee and cocoa (chocolate) sold in the UK to be Fair Trade (or Rainforest Alliance) Certified.",
