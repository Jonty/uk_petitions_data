        "additional_details": "Having failed to qualify for the European championships in 2008 a root and branch review was allegedly carried out. This has clearly had no long lasting effect on the organisation and this  petition is to request that Tracey Crouch MP, Minister for Sport brings pressure upon the FA to carry out a full review of the circumstances surrounding the failings during this championship. This should include selection of inappropriate squad players. ",
        "background": "Following the dismal performances of the senior England football team in the European Championships it is time for an effective review of The FA and in particular the senior England set up. ",
