        "action": "Publish a green paper followed by 2nd referendum before triggering EU Article 50",
        "additional_details": "Before drafting significant new legislation, usual Government practice is to publish a green paper outlining with clarity the changes it is  proposing, and with some assessment of the outcome. Yet before a referendum which, if implemented, will commit us to fundamental change for years to come, we were fed unsubstantiated claims and counter-claims, leading to widespread confusion over the terms on which we were seeking to leave the EU and the likely consequences.",
        "background": "We ask that, before committing us to leave the EU, the Government publishes a green paper detailing its intended negotiating position, with an independent assessment of the likely consequences, and followed by a second referendum to confirm the electorate's wish to proceed.",
