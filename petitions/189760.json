        "additional_details": "Scotland backed remaining in the UK by 45%, yet voted to leave the EU by 62%.\r\nThe Welsh government are looking for assurances after Brexit.\r\n\r\nThe way to solve this is to create an English parliament and devolve powers from Westminster to England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nEach government is given a greater role in overseeing their nation/region's success.\r\n\r\nThe UK government would provide responsibility in the fields of defence, the overall economy, immigration and so on.",
        "background": "The way forward for the United Kingdom is to change the way we do our politics. With the UK government and Scottish government at an impass, along with Wales and regions around England calling for greater autonomy, the reasonable solution would be to create a federalised United Kingdom.",
