        "action": "Have all religious institutions in the UK declare their source of funding.",
        "additional_details": "After sources revealing the situation in Germany regarding approximately 200 mosques offered to be built by the Saudi Government (one I find deplorable in how it acts), I feel that it is time to see where mosques in Great Britain get their funding from and where their charity goes and whether it goes to funding extremism or not.\r\n\r\nThis petition also applies to religious institutions of other faiths as this is more than possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "In wake of the countless terror attacks occurring on European soil, the issue of radicalisation of people in the UK is an increasingly important issue. To help combat this issue all religious institutions should declare where they receive their funding and who the recipients of their charity are.",
