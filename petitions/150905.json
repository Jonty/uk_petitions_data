        "additional_details": "With hindsight: Young people across the whole of The UK are devastated with the vote.  We can now see evidence of sterling crashing, stock markets falling across The World, Scotland wanting to exit The UK, The UK's credit rating turning negative and businesses considering moving to mainland Europe - Its the perfect storm, but we still have time to have a re-think.",
        "background": "So many who voted LEAVE now feel the leave campaign mis-led us about immigration and the \u00a3350 million amount that would come back to The NHS. Wrongly assured us the economy would be fine. We still have time before the 'point of no return' when our government invokes Article 50 of The Lisbon Treaty.",
