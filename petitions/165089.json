        "additional_details": "We propose that legal aid should be provided to all families attending all inquests, with a fairer test on: \r\n\r\n\u2022\tWhether an individual is financially eligible, in terms of their disposable income & capital; \r\n\r\n\u2022\tWhether other interested persons attending the inquest have legal representation; \r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe circumstances of the deceased\u2019s death & complexity of the issues.\r\n\r\nWe submit that the proposed wider scope is fairer & recognises the real need for representation for all families at all inquests. \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The current system for providing legal representation for families at inquests is unfair and imbalanced. The current system allows public bodies legal representation, usually at public expense. Families are left without similar access & strict tests in exceptional cases for   obtaining legal aid.\r\n",
