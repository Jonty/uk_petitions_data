They will use the same violence against us as they have against each other. We are the most populated country in Europe, let the bigger countries take these criminals if they wish. But don't bring them here. We already pay through the nose for that abomination known as the Department of International Development. We must not pay even more taxes to keep these criminals.",

There are even more thousands coming from other countries heading towards us to join them. How else can we stop 60 70 or even 90 thousand criminals from forcing their way through the Tunnel? We need to flood it. ",
