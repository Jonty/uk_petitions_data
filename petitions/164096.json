        "additional_details": "Helmets worn also must conform too the standards of the Highway Code helmet regulations. \r\nThis means that all helmets worn whilst cycling must be:\r\n- Of correct size.\r\n- And Sercurley fasterned.\r\n\r\nIn 2014 113 people died whilst cycling on roads, 3401 were seriously injured and 17,773 were slightly injured. In my opinion this is a necessary step to safer transport for those on bicycles and this will help prevent hundreds from loosing their lives in cycling accidents every year. ",
        "background": "At the moment the Highway Code states that cyclists 'should' wear a helmet. However, I believe to reduce the risk of serious injury to cyclists on the pavement and roads it should be a legal requirement to wear a protective helmet.",
