        "additional_details": "My daughter signs to communicate. When we go out and she tries to communicate, everyone always asks me 'what is she saying'. Knowing just yes & no in sign & to understand children/adults with disabilities would make such a difference. Without better communication many people are trapped in their world. If we are accepting of people with disabilities why are we not teaching all children sign language to enable communication for all https://www.makaton.org/aboutMakaton/\r\n",
        "background": "I am mum to a child who cannot speak, we use makaton to communicate. My child was discriminated against at her primary school, who refused to teach makaton. Teaching Makaton would mean children/adults would be able to communicate throughout their life making society more inclusive & less frustrating",
