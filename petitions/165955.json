        "action": "Make the placing and/or using of all snare traps illegal.",
        "additional_details": "Snare trapping involves setting a stiff but flexible steel wire in the shape of a crude noose on an animal trail. The wire is staked in the ground or attached to fence posts. A (legal) free-running snare is supposed to slacken when the animal stops struggling, however a rusted, kinked or knotted snare effectively becomes self-locking.\r\n\r\nIf any snares remain legal, then it is harder to enforce the law against illegal snares or against illegal use of legal snares.",
        "background": "The frantic struggles of the trapped animal cause the snare wire to knot so that it tightens and the animal dies of strangulation. This barbaric practice not only traps & kills foxes, which it is designed for, it also kills other wildlife (badgers, otters) & peoples pets too.",
