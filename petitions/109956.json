        "additional_details": "I lost my daughter on 11th may 2015. It was very sudden, it's only then that you realise how little awareness there is for how often pregnancy and infant loss actually occurs. It got me thinking we mark different remembrance events throughout the year including race for life and November 11th, I'm not saying we shouldn't remember these we should but I'm also saying that my just because my daughter didn't get the chance to do many things doesn't mean she and all angels dont  deserve remembrance ",
        "background": "I feel all babies no matter how small leave and imprint on this world, we should remember and honour these little angels with a day of remembrance dedicated to their little lives and also a publicly well known about book of remembrance where parents can choose to record their babies life.",
