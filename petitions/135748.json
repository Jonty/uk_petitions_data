        "additional_details": "The success of the Leave campaign during the EU referendum has understandably led to uncertainty regarding the future of this country, its territory and its people. A major factor in this uncertainty is the wholesale lack of a concrete, policy-focused vision for a post-EU era to provide clarity to a concerned electorate.\r\nWe need a general election where the people of all our nations can elect a government with clear manifesto commitments for a post-EU era. A 'snap election' will not allow this.",
        "background": "Delaying Article 50 notification until May 2018 will allow for a considered general election. This in turn allows good time for policy to be developed, Scottish questions to be answered, the public to be consulted and informed and for them to once again engage in the democratic process.",
