        "additional_details": "In a move the government has justified with maintaining national security more weapons and officers with more of a will to use them are being placed in rural Scotland. This is supposedly to defend a military installation which many Scots do not want on their land and do not want so dangerously close to their population centres. ",
        "background": "The Rosneath peninsula in Scotland is home to a widely unpopular military installation. The MoD have, with little to no consultation with the local population, increased their presence in the region. This needs to be undone handing back Scottish policing to Police Scotland.",
