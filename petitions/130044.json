        "background": "By banning all advertising of infant formula in the UK, it will hopefully ensure that more mothers breastfeed their children. Which in the long run will save the NHS money too! \r\nNew mothers are bombarded with advertising of formula with damaging statements such as 'the closest ever to breastmilk'.",
