        "additional_details": "Since 2013 applicants are expected to approach their NHS trusts instead of applying directly to HMRC.Some trusts are failing to support these applications, meaning applicants are caught between the two bodies & not getting their money back. \r\nProfessionals are owed this money. It's not fair that there are so many inconsistencies, anomalies, lack of communication & no explaination for vast differences of amount paid back. \r\nHMRC are consistently changing their criteria & this needs to be clarified.",
        "background": "NHS staff who took part in the widening access training (WAT) scheme at any point since 1999 to broaden their knowledge are potentially due rebates due to them being taxed whilst training when they should have been exempted. \r\nStaff are finding the reclaiming process inconsistent, unfair and long.\r\n",
