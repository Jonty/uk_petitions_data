        "additional_details": "Sir Philip Green bought BHS in May 2000 for \u00a3200m.   At that time there was no pension deficit - in fact there was a surplus.  Over the ensuing 15 years he put the business into his wife Tina's name, a resident of Monaco and therefore not a UK tax payer, and took out more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans.  \r\nHe sold the business in 2015 for \u00a31 having stripped it and leaving a group in charge that squeezed out the last few \u00a3million in \"professional fees\".  It is now going to close leaving 11,000 employees  dependent on a Government pension scheme.\r\n",
        "background": "Sir Philip Green has behaved dishonourably in his purchase, ownership and subsequent sale of BHS.  He made money for his family from the business without any concern for the welfare of his employees.  He should be stripped of his Knighthood.\r\n",
