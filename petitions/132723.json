        "action": "Don't scrap A level/GCSE Electronics/Systems and control. Help future engineers.",
        "additional_details": "Gonernment changes to A levels and GCSEs are moving more towards pure academia and although physics and maths are critical in technology and electronics, to be successful in the industry you must still know how to design, how a circuit works, about microchips etc. The things you are not taught in physics. Without these subjects, less people will be inspired to make their own projects and those who are inspired will be ill equipped to do so and will struggle at degree level with no experience.",
        "background": "Scrapping these subjects will cause a fall in the amount of students leaving school with any design or electronics experience or knowledge. We should be encouraging students to become enginneers to continue advancements in technology for the future, instead this opportunity is being taken from them.",
