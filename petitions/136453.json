        "additional_details": "73% of 18-25 year olds voted to remain- a generation betrayed. \r\nBrexit has eliminated our opportunities to study, work and live in EU countries. We were proud to be British AND European. Now this referendum has turned Great Britain into Little England. Thanks Nigel, but I want to keep my EU passport. ",
        "background": "As a 14 year old student, together with all my friends, I strongly believe the Government has betrayed the young by robbing us of membership of the EU and dismantling the UK along with our futures. We were not allowed a voice despite having the most at stake. What happened to democracy?",
