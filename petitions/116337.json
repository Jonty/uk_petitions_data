        "additional_details": "Professional operators are having to compete with unregulated operators, who are not properly trained and who can not gain insurance due to not holding a CAA permission.\r\n\r\nAfter having invested a lot of time and money in doing the right thing, the law should help SUAS operators, by making it an offence to use an operator who does not hold such a permission.\r\n\r\nDetails of article 166 & 167 of the ANO:\r\nhttp://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Aircraft/Unmanned-aircraft/Small-unmanned-aircraft/",
        "background": "To carry out aerial work with a SUAS (drone) in the UK you need permission from the CAA.  Professional operators are trained and insured. There is currently no motivation to use properly trained and insured people and the law should be changed to make using non permission holders an offence.",
