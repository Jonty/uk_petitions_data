        "additional_details": "Giving notification under Article 50 would effectively reverse the European Communities Act 1972.  Under the established principle that legislation can only be reversed by Parliament, it is appropriate that Parliament should vote on this.  \r\n\r\nThe government of the day should only give this notification after that course of action is approved by Parliament. \r\n\r\nThis petition does not seek to change the result of the referendum - its purpose is to ensure that the result is properly endorsed.",
        "background": "The results of the referendum on 23 June are advisory and not directly binding on Parliament.   In order to give effect to the result, the government has to notify the EU under article 50 of the TEU (\"Lisbon Treaty\").  This is an irreversible action.",
