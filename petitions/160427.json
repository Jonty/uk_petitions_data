        "action": "Set up an independent commission to draft a new Representation of the People Act",
        "additional_details": "The old party models no longer correspond to the reality of 21st century society. We need a full reform of the electoral and parliamentary systems, possibly with some form of proportional or alternative voting system, and with a second house that could be selected across the whole of society by something akin to jury service. To decide what reforms are needed, an independent commission should be set up to propose a major overhaul of the system by means of a new Reform Act.",
        "background": "Increasingly we are being asked to choose between extreme positions defined by the grassroots of both parties. Eg, holding a referendum without any predefined implementation plans means that, at this critical time in our history, the UK's future will be decided by 150,000 Conservative Party members.",
