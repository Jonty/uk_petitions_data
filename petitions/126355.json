        "action": "Levy a 15% tax on shooting goods to fund moorland restoration and flood relief.",
        "additional_details": "Since the cause is specifically driven by the need to increase grouse numbers for shooting, it would seem appropriate that those causing the issue should bear the cost of reparation work. Therefore, I ask the government to impose an additional 15% charge on all shooting goods of all types, to fund restoration projects carried out by major conservation charities along with providing extra funding for those affected by the resulting flooding",
        "background": "Heather burning and draining for the purpose of increasing red grouse production destroys peat and moss causing it to retain less water. As a result, heavy rain which used to be held by the peat and moss wetlands now makes fast runoff from the uplands and causes flooding in the valleys. ",
