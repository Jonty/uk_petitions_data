        "action": "Call for legal representation for all children detained by the police at school",
        "additional_details": "Call for the government to debate that schools should be a place of learning not for children to be detained and questioned. The relationship between children, parents and the school should only relate to education and schools should be a place of opportunity for children to develop their personality and talents and prepare for responsibility in life. Schools should be neutral and not police detention centres.  The Rights of children must be protected at school and not to have their rights abused",
        "background": "Currently innocent children unaware of their legal rights can be secretly detained and questioned by the police and social workers at their school without parents. Any questioning by the police should be done at a police station in the presence of a legal representative for the child, not at school.",
