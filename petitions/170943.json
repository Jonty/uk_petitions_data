With the original Olympic design finalised and being built, the government had a change of heart and a bidding process for a multi-sport post-Olympic legacy was launched.",

The conversion costs  \u00a3272m, of which the football club will pay just \u00a315m plus annual rent of \u00a32.5m, bringing the final price tag to \u00a3702m. \r\n\r\nProblems with the seating will now cost the tax payer more millions to fix",
