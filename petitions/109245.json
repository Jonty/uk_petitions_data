        "action": "Re-Instate British Standard Time. I.E. DO NOT change the clocks in October.",
        "additional_details": "If we didn't change the clocks, by the time we got to work it would be light. It would be light when we got home. Fewer instances of SAD, less use of electricity and gas for heating and lighting at home and fewer accidents from travelling in the dark morning and evening according to ROSPA. The economic, health and energy benefits would be huge for the country.",
        "background": "Turning the clocks back is depressing, unnecessary, un-economical and unsafe.  We would save money and energy if we stayed on British Summer Time, not having to turn on lights and heating so early in the day. It would be safer for the evening return home from school or work.",
