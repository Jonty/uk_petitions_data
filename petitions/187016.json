        "action": "Ban the delivery of charity collection bags to households in the U.K.",
        "additional_details": "It is believed that 500,000 plastic charity collection bags are sent to landfill every year. Each bag is delivered inside yet another plastic bag envelope meaning some one million bags are disposed of in our landfill sites around the country every year, via doorstep delivery.\r\nMost local council recycling stations, as well as many towns and villages retain clothing bins and can be freely used to dispose of such unwanted goods easily and without the need for such large scale waste.\r\n",
        "background": "Large plastic charity bags, wrapped in plastic envelopes are delivered to thousands of households in the U.K. every week. Only a tiny percentage are filled for collection with the majority ending-up straight in the homeowners bin and off to landfill. This unnecessary use of plastic bags must stop.",
