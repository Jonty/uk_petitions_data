        "action": "Ban lorries from overtaking on dual carriageways, and motorways between 7am-7pm",
        "additional_details": "It clogs up road which are designed to be freely moving and can cause miles of tailbacks.\r\n\r\nEven more frustrating is when as soon as they have finished their overtake they take the exit off the road.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to ban lorries from overtaking on a dual carriageway at any time, and a ban on lorries overtaking between 7am and 7pm on motorways.\r\n\r\nIf you agree please sign.",
        "background": "We've all been stuck on a dual carriageway doing fifty behind a lorry driver who feel they need to overtake another lorry doing two or three miles per hour less than them.\r\n\r\nThe same happens on motorways and causes the same issues when a somebody tries to overtake both of those lorries at sixty.",
