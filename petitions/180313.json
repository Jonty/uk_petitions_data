The strain that puts on public services, local communities and British values being affected. \r\n\r\nMr Trump won on a stop immigration ticket. So agree with it or not, he is beginning to deliver on campaign promises that he believes will help protect the American people. If the Chinese leader and Martin McGuiness can meet the Queen why would we seek to deny the leader of our oldest friends?  \r\n",

Let\u2019s hear what he has to say to the UK, while in the UK! ",
