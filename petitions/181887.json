        "additional_details": "From data in the public domain it is evident that many patients fail to attend appointments with virtually no financial penalty. A \u00a35-\u00a310 per person per appointment (with some exceptions) is affordable by the majority of inhabitants.\r\nPrescriptions for low cost (normally over the counter) drugs incur significant \"handling\" charge. By permitting/instructing GP's to dispense such items the savings can be diverted/used to benefit more urgent demands on the Health Service.",
        "background": "A small charge for visit to GP would deter time wasters & release funds for deserving needs. \r\nGP's prescribe aspirin and similar drugs costing a few pence which incur standard \u00a310-\u00a312 \"Pharmacy handling\" charge to the Dept of Health. Curb this waste too and spend on more deserving needs",
