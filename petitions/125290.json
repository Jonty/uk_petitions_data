        "additional_details": "I myself a long with many others have been given quotes on e.g 1.0 cars upto \u00a310,000! Even paying \u00a32000 is alot in any case and I know people who have been paying that much with telemetry boxes fitted also. A Base price should be set.",
        "background": "For many young drivers (who are mainly students) cannot afford silly prices insurance companies ask for. We do not deserve to pay thousands after being profiled. A max price should of \u00a3700 be set on cars upto 130bhp in order to prove to insurers that not all young drivers deserve to pay thousands.",
