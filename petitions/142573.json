        "additional_details": "Many people expressed confusion over the issues around whether to stay in the EU, and dismay at the misinformation they perceived both campaigns as giving. \r\n\r\nSo the UK public were not equipped to make this complex decision, and it is the duty of MPs to make an informed vote based on their much greater knowledge of the issues.\r\n\r\nThe referendum result should therefore be treated as an indication of the opinion of the populace towards aspects of our membership of the EU and not a binding decision.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call on Parliament to treat the EU Referendum result as advisory rather than binding, as per UK law, and to allow a free vote in Parliament on whether to proceed with Brexit.",
