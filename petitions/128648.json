        "additional_details": "Too many people, including the courts, have forgotten that holding a Driving Licence is not a Right, its a Privilege. If you kill someone whilst being behind the wheel at the moment you may receive up to a 14 year prison sentence and a Two year driving ban. This is just Silly. Even if you received a Ten Year Ban, you can ask to get your licence back early. How is that Fair? Google Colin McGregor(Kirriemuir), Alistair Speed(Fife), John Radford, to name but a few let down by the system. ",
        "background": "Change the law so that anyone found guilty of Killing another Human being, where their actions were solely to blame for someones death, a Mandatory Lifetime Ban should be part of the Sentencing Process. ",
