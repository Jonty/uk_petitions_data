This is nearly 80% of the 81,000 children in care away from home on any one day in the UK. \r\n\r\nThe Government's DfE paper states: \u201cWhere birth parents cannot meet a child\u2019s basic needs it is one of the state\u2019s most important responsibilities to step in and ensure that children can have a childhood which keeps them safe and enables them to flourish.\" \r\n\r\nWith a UK shortage of foster carers this petition can help!\r\n",
