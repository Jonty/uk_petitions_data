        "additional_details": "My housemates and I feel we were not sufficiently warned or provided any clear statements to make us aware of this law and feel that either this approach must be changed, or that the demand for council tax over these outlying months, be removed completely. We want to help raise awareness for other students so that they don't get caught out too. As graduates we don't earn too much straight after University and to be suddenly hit with a bill that we were unaware of is quite stressful. ",
        "background": "The government demand that final year Uni students pay council tax for the period between the conclusion of final term right up until the end of your tenancy. This is regardless of the length of your contract (often demanded by landlords to be 11 months) and the fact that you signed it as a student.",
