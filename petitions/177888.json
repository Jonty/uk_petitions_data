        "additional_details": "The Yorkshire Bank in Todmorden is not the only one to be closing. Nearby branches such as Bradford, Leeds and Sheffield are also threatened by the closure which leaves customers with even less choice for local banking. \"Over 200 jobs are at risk\" quote ITV news which has an added strain on our society. Our community in Todmorden will not be the same without the Yorkshire Bank; the internet will overthrow face-to-face conversation and members of the town will have to travel to bank 'locally'. ",
        "background": "Yorkshire Bank has announced branch closures, one of them being in my home town; Todmorden. Todmorden is a thriving town with a huge community who all come together in times of unrest. The Yorkshire Bank is a stunning building in the centre of our town filled with friendly staff and many customers. ",
