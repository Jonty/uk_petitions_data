        "additional_details": "There are refugee camps in France close to the channel coast, particularly near the entrance to the Channel Tunnel rail link. If the UK shows that it will consider asylum applications from those who endanger their lives to enter the UK illegally, it will only encourage others to endanger their lives making the same journey.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/road-and-rail-transport/12083571/Channel-Tunnel-migrant-will-inspire-copycats-after-exploiting-legal-loophole-says-Eurotunnel.html",
        "background": "France is a safe country. It should not be permitted to wait in France for a chance to enter the UK clandestinely. If it were common knowledge that the UK would automatically deny such asylum claims, it would end the misery of those waiting in Calais and ensure they claim asylum in France.",
