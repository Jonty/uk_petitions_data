        "action": "Change from First Past the Post to the D'Hondt system for UK general elections",
        "additional_details": "The system currently used leaves the country with an unfair and unjust result as seen in the 2015 elections where the conservatives gained 36.8 % of the vote but won a landslide victory with over 330 seats which is 50% of the seat available. Labour gained 30.5% of the vote but only got 232 seats. The largest gap can be seen between the SNP who got only 4.7% of the vote but 56 seats and UKIP who got 12.7% of the vote but gained only 1 seat. Its time to make a change and make your vote count.",
        "background": "The system used for the current general elections is unproportional leaving the country with a government which the majority of its people did not vote for; changing to the D'Hondt system will ensure that every person has at least one representative in their region and make elections much fairer.",
