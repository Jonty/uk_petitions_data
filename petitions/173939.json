        "additional_details": "The parents of the children who have been underpaid had no way of knowing that the DWP and HMRC were not sharing information appropriately and, therefore, would not have known that they were being underpaid.\r\n\r\nThis is a despicable situation that may have led to disabled children not having access to the resources and equipment that are expensive and provided in their basic form by the NHS.  Had they been overpaid parents would have been forced to repay for the entire period.  \r\n",
        "background": "In the news today is a piece stating that due to an error relating to information sharing between the DWP and HMRC families with disabled children have been underpaid since 2011, however, the Government are refusing to pay the underpayment. Figures show that 1 in 12 families were underpaid up to \u00a34k",
