        "additional_details": "Despite an EU ban on selling arms to Saudi Arabia in response to their bombing campaigns in Yemen strongly condemned by the UN, David Cameron has increased arms exports to the country which executes people for \"crimes\" such as Homosexuality, Blasphemy and Adultery. \r\nThere are known links between the Saudi Government and Al Qaeda and other terrorist organisations. \r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned believe that it is undemocratic, immoral and dangerous for the UK to continue trade relations with Saudi Arabia.",
        "background": "It is shameful that the UK should benefit from unethical and immoral trade agreements with Saudi Arabia. It is well known that Saudi Arabia has links to terrorist organisations. By continuing to sell arms to this country, the UK are in tacit agreement with those who wish to harm us and others",
