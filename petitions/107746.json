        "action": "Ban height restrictions on open car parks.",
        "additional_details": "Most car parks I have recently tried to park in have had a maximum hight limit of 6' 6\", this meant that I was forced to park elsewhere away from town centres, it makes it particularly difficult in busy times as most of the car parks that allow taller vehicles are usually full whereas the restricted access car parks have spaces available, this results in having to park in higher risk areas where vehicles may be vulnerable to theft and vandalism.",
        "background": "Height restrictions on open car parks is discrimination against drivers of larger vehicles such as 4x4's, vans, motorhomes,  vehicles with roofracks or roof boxes fitted. There is no need to limit access to only shorter cars as it makes it very difficult to find parking in urban areas.",
