        "action": "Hold a public inquiry into the Prison System",
        "additional_details": "Our Prison System has no direction, funding, or vision for delivery. Prison staff are daily facing drugs, drones, suicides, self-harm, murders, escapes from closed conditions, and vicious physical assaults from drug-induced prisoners now running at 65 assaults a day, every day. Enough is enough. Independent HMI Prison inspection  reports deliver evidence weekly of decay and collapse. We need an independent inquiry into the future of the Prison  Service, it's mission, conditions and resources.",
        "background": "Our Prison System is in crisis - experts accurately describe it as in 'meltdown'. \r\nA plethora of independent HMI Prison inspection reports has consistently supported this view. \r\nYesterday prison officers raised anguished voices, outside our prisons in guttural cries of despair. \r\nEnough is enough.",
