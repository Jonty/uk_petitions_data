        "additional_details": "The cost of traveling to the midlands by train is so costly that it is cheaper to drive there and back. Driving is bad for the environment and road congestion. If London Midland can make the numbers work on a similar distance journey then why do Virgin and East Midlands trains charge 2-3 times more for the same journey? If people could get to London for \u00a326 return then the train would be cheaper than driving. There is no excuse for customers being ripped off like this. ",
        "background": "The Virgin / East Midlands train from London to Derby costs \u00a370.50 for a super off peak return ticket (\u00a3103 peak). London to Lichfield Trent Valley costs just \u00a326 for a super off peak return (\u00a338 peak) on London Midland Trains. They are equidistant and both take 1hr 30 mins. We are being ripped off.",
