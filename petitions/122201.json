        "additional_details": "Actually what inspired me may sound really cheesy, but it was Aerosmith's cover of Give Peace A Chance, with Sierra Leone's all-star refugees saying we shouldn't punish the kids for what they never did. Just like whether someone is black, or white, or Asian or whatever, they can't help it. And neither are kids who are born in prisons. Adults who go to prison KNOW why they're there and it's because they've done wrong (90% of the time), so I'm calling on David Cameron to create a law which means babies born in UK prisons are immediately taken out to live with other relatives in a stable loving home, or if needs be, adopted/fostered.",
