        "additional_details": "Many diseases that can be screened for can be cured or treated if caught before the symptoms appear (from asthma to the terminal disease of Krabbes), chances to combat a number of the diseases which can be screened for are only possible if they're detected early enough.\r\nI have spoken to parents who has lost their children, or are caring for their terminally ill children, who feel anger knowing something could have been done.\r\nWe are asking for the UK amount to be increased and include Krabbes.",
        "background": "The UK raised the amount of diseases screened for during the heel prick test from 5 to 9 in January 2015.\r\nPortugal currently screen for 27, Australia & New Zealand 28, Spain 29 and the USA 31 to 60.\r\nThe UK are seriously behind other countries and our children are suffering unnecessarily.",
