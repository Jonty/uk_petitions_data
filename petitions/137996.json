        "additional_details": "Whilst efforts to raise living standards in the elderly population is commendable, the disparity is now too great and ringfencing of pensioner benefits should be removed. This has become even more pressing in light out the EU referendum where the over 65 group voted strongly in favour of leaving the EU. Any negative economic effects of this decision should be shared across all who voted for it.\r\n\r\nFigures quoted from Machin 2015",
        "background": "Since the financial crisis and recession it's young and working age people who have born the brunt of budget cutbacks. Real wages have fallen 7% for working families and 16% for 18-24 year olds. Pensioners have seen a 4% increase in the incomes which is neither fair or sustainable going forward.",
