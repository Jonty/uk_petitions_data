        "additional_details": "As football fans and concerned residents in and around the area of Bramley Moore Docks, myself and people of the Anfield area have been are very concerned about traffic issues if the ground goes ahead on this heritage site.  BM is a special place as our kids normally like to play in and around the area, people walking their dogs as well as kite flying lessons. We have sent numerous letters to the FA asking them to support our concerns and hopefully have EFC docked points in the coming seasons.",
        "background": "We call on people of the UK to sign the petition and stop Everton Football Club building a new ground on a heritage site. This is absurd and people of LFC/Residents feel it unjustified. We hope the good people of the UK and the FA see sense and stop this before it happens. #YNWA\r\n\r\n",

This means that it will assess the planning application against certain criteria and decide if a full inquiry is needed.
