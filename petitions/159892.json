        "additional_details": "An inquiry was carried out by Lord Hutton, however an inquiry does not have the same kinds of legal powers as an inquest (no ability to subpoena witnesses or hold people under oath, etc).  \r\n\r\nA legal inquest should have been opened instead, as this is one of the only examples of a death of a single person of this kind where an inquest was NOT called.\r\n\r\nBased upon the body of evidence, particularly the lack of fingerprints (a physical impossibility) on the knife, the inquiry was inadequate.    ",
        "background": "To petition parliament to open a proper judicial inquest into the death of Dr. David Kelly, based upon the fact that there is a clear prima facie case for 3rd party involvement, partly due to factual evidence obtained in a 2007 FOIA request (no fingerprints on the pruning knife, full or partials).",

The High Court decides independently whether this should happen."
