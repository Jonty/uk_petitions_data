        "additional_details": "There is the possibility that following our present course we are in danger of creating a Europe of the past. Yes the current Europe is bureaucratic, wasteful and seemingly unaccountable. But changing it can only be done from inside. Leaving is the same as not using your vote and then complaining that politicians don't listen. The UK referendum was a case of giving the people their say. But less than three quarters bothered to vote. A new party of common purpose may result in a United Britain.",
        "background": "Following the UK referendum it is clear the country is deeply divided. The older generation have a duty to leave a better country to their children than they inherited. The young have a responsibility to use their vote to help create their future and their children's future. We are stronger together",
