We ask for the same right to timely access to evidence based treatment as those with physical health problems.\r\n\r\nWe accept, this will require additional investment in mental health services. But we are strongly persuaded that investment in mental health services will lead to significant returns by reducing the burden on the NHS through the improved wellbeing of our citizens.",
