Legalising Cannabis within the UK would take substantial power away from gangs and other such groups, and therefore defeats the idea of a gang controlled drug market)\r\n\r\nThe US has predicted a tax revenue of $6.7billion in 2016, and Colorado has made $10million already.\r\n\r\nIt also has untold medical uses, such as killing cancer cells.\r\n\r\nhttp://uk.businessinsider.com/health-benefits-of-medical-marijuana-2014-4?r=US&IR=T",
        "background": "Cannabis was made illegal in the United Kingdom on 28th September, 1928 as an addition to the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1920. The entire concept of considering cannabis \"a dangerous drug\" in this day and age is completely farce. The uses this plant has and the good it can to bring people is boundless.",
