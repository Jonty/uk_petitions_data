        "additional_details": "A simple Internet search for \"child puts mum in recovery position\" or similar scenarios and you will find many videos of young children performing various life saving skills.\r\nI feel that basic first aid, including CPR should become part of the national curriculum and should be taught to children from a young age. \r\nHaving a community with even a basic knowledge of CPR may oneday save a life,\r\nI hope this will gain support from organisations who currently promote the early bystander CPR campaigns.",
        "background": "It has been previously evidenced that children as young as 2/3 years old are capable of making genuine 999 emergency calls, and in many cases that call has saved the life of a family member. So why not make basic first aid part of the school curriculum.",
