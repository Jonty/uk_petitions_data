Leaving county residents wide open, not only terrorist attacks but to accidental leakage from the waste itself! The weapons grade nuclear material will be used to kill thousands, blood that will be on all our hands if we continue to allow this to happen! The waste itself is worth billions of dollars! highlanders are having their lives played with, it's a disaster waiting to happen! ",

All lives matter! Let's stop this now!",
