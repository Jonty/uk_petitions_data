How can these people, some working in the heart of core uk services such as the NHS, be left with such uncertainty. They have bought homes and contributed to our cultural diversity.

The U.K. Cannot afford to loose any key workers, and any brexit plan can be completed while we still allow our friends and colleagues to remain.",
