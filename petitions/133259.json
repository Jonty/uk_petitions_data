        "action": "Charge political campaigners who knowingly perpetuate misinformation",
        "additional_details": "During the EU referendum, campaigners resorted to exaggeration, distortion, misleading statistics and outright lies to sway the voters, often continuing to do so after it was shown that their information was wrong or misleading. It is not possible for the public to make an informed decision when campaigners are trying to subvert the democratic process by perpetuating lies. The government must ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to ensure that such behaviour is not tolerated.",
        "background": "We call upon the government to review the legislative framework to ensure that political campaigners and news organisations who attempt to sway voter opinions by knowingly perpetuating incorrect or misleading information can be, and are, charged under criminal law.",
