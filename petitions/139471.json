        "action": "Hold a general election in response to the EU referendum",
        "additional_details": "The present parliament was elected during a time of normalcy to deal with the kinds of issues that are expected during any 5-year term. In the election of 2015, it was clear who the two possible resulting prime ministers could be. Whoever the new Conservative leader is, nobody voted in 2015 under the expectation of that leadership.  It is wrong that a newly appointed prime minister with a dubious mandate to govern will make the most important decision in British politics this century.",
        "background": "We need a government that has a clear mandate to deliver an honestly expressed position on the UK's relationship with the EU. The present government has no mandate and its position is unknown. A general election would offer the chance of some national unity around a clearly agreed upon mandate.",
