        "additional_details": "As a mother of 2 Autistic children I have joined many groups online.  Reading stories of family's being told they can no longer have benefits with a diagnosis of Autism. We need change to make DWP and its contractors aware that Autism is a lifelong, developmental disability that affects how a person communicates with and relates to other people, and how they experience the world around them, Without these benefits they cannot have carers or support please STOP AUSTERITY WITH AUTISM ",
        "background": "Since the Conservative Govt have been in power and the treasury have stated that major changes will happen for AUSTERITY. Myself and many families looking after Autistic children/adults have been made to feel that AUTISM is not a disability. Many families are struggling with the loss of benefits.",
