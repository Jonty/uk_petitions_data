        "additional_details": "Extract from www.organdonation.nhs.uk dated 15th January 2016;\r\n\"More than 500 families in the UK have said no to organ donation taking place since 1 April 2010, despite knowing or being informed their relative was on the NHS Organ Donor Register and wanted to donate. These family refusals have resulted in an estimated 1200 people missing out on a potentially life-saving transplant.\"\r\n\r\nI think the above says it all. People are registering as they want to help but then next of kin refuse. ",
        "background": "At the moment a persons next of kin can refuse to donate your organs even if you have registered yourself as an organ donor. This is unfair, the whole point of registering yourself means you wish to donate and next of kin should not be able to go against this. ",
