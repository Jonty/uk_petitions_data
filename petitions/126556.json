        "additional_details": "If taxes paid were publicized, then this would do more than just shame tax evaders. Even in cases where people are legally exploiting the tax laws to their advantage, it would help to create a conversation about the tax code itself. For example, if we learn of some obscure tax credit allows wealthier individuals to consistently avoid paying a major portion of their income taxes, then we could debate whether or not it's good policy. \r\nTransparency is the best form of disinfectant on this issue.
