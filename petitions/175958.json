        "additional_details": "The Children's Act 1989 needs an update. The 2014 updates were not well thought through and based on poorly drafted studies (Norgrove report)\r\n\r\nOn family breakdown, research proves that children fare far better in a co parent environment\r\n\r\nThe model of family life is no longer confined to mother as homemaker and father as breadwinner\r\n\r\nChildren deserve to have an equal relationship with both parents in the event of family breakdown. This should be enshrined in law. Abolish the term \"primary carer\".",
        "background": "UK Family Law is in urgent need of reform. When proceedings involve children, Judges and parents are at the mercy of a horribly outdated piece of legislation (CA 1989). The needs of children are not met and parents are forced into an adversarial contest in which the children almost always lose out",
