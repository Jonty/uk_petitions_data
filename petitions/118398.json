        "additional_details": "Bow hunting is legal in other parts of the world where hunting is popular, hunters like myself feel discriminated against because we cannot bow hunt due to these laws all because hunting is not as popular in the UK. Todays bows far exceed necessary requirements for a good humane kill with adequate rules/regulation. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.britishbowhunterassociation.co.uk/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Legalize-Bow-Hunting-in-the-Uk-257491054275769/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.teamwild.tv/tag/british-bow-hunting-association",
        "background": "Legalise hunting with cross bows and compound bows in the UK. Larger game such as deer can be killed as humanely with a compound bow / cross bow as they can with a rifle or other fire arms. Hunting with a bow has been a tradition from the start of mankind.",
