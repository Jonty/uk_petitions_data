        "additional_details": "-Dr. Colin Holbrook, a research scientist at the UCLA Center for Behavior, Evolution, and Culture has recently done a study showing that names have an influence on job interviews and university places in terms of race and gender.\r\n-By making it law for organisations such as UCAS to require anonymous applications it will hopefully prevent discrimination against those with ethnic-sounding or just clear gender identifiable names, based on stereotypes.\r\n",
        "background": "Recent studies have shown that perfectly able candidates are not being offered the same opportunities due to 'name discrimination'. This can be in the form of prejudice surrounding names related to ethnic origin or even gender discrimination within big companies that would like more male employees.",
