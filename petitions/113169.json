        "additional_details": "Commencement should be from the date of purchase. \r\n\r\nFor example, if a person was to purchase their VED on 31st October 2015, expiry would be September 30th 2016. \r\n\r\nThis is an unfair system and leads to motorists losing up to 1 months VED on their vehicle.\r\n\r\nI would like the UK Department of Transport to change this unfair and unjust rule, to commencement when purchased.",
        "background": "The UK has had an abolition of tax discs in vehicles. Therefore, there is no reason for the date of expiry to be the end of the calendar month. \r\n",
