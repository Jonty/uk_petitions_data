        "additional_details": "As the EU referendum is not legally binding it is ultimately Parliament\u2019s decision whether the UK repeals the 1972 European Communities Act or not. MPs have a right and a duty to refuse to repeal the Act if they believe it is in the best interests for Britain to stay. With a minority of the electorate voting to Leave, we the undersigned argue that repealing the Act is not in the best interests of or representative of the position of the majority of the UK population.",
        "background": "62.5% of the UK electorate - all those entitled to vote - did not support a Leave vote, either by voting to Remain or not voting at all. Therefore, the Leave vote does not represent the majority of the UK electorate.",
