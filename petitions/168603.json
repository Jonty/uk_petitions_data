        "additional_details": "We will not accept that we should lose the right to start a business in Germany, study in Ireland, retire in Spain or work on pan-European scientific or cultural projects. A visa system is unacceptable, as this would lead to Britons going to the back of the queue for opportunities elsewhere in Europe, behind citizens of the 27 EU states and the 4 countries in the EFTA.\r\n\r\nThe Leave campaign did not specify what form of Brexit they wanted, so there is no mandate to take rights away from us.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "1.2 million British people live in other EU countries, enjoying the right to work, live, study or retire abroad. Many more divide their time between the UK and another EU country. \r\n\r\nWe demand that these rights not be restricted or taken away from future generations as part of any Brexit deal. ",
