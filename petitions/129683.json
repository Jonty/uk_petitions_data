        "additional_details": "At Cats Protection we chip all cats going out for adoption. Its the people who get cats from friends who dont think its nessesary, who then complain their cat is missing, and wonder why they dont get closure on their missing cat. Also the council need to be made to check for chips on cats being killed on the roads and report it to vets and shelters like us.",
        "background": "Many cats get in road traffic accidents, or get lost, not having a chip, its hard to get them reunited. Working with Cats Protection we get many cats brought into care. Many are dumped, not wanted, or get a medical problem, rather than ask for help. Cats Protection and other rescues pick up the tab.",
