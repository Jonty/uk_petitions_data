        "additional_details": "myself and my brother chad have gone through rejection and treated unfairly in the workplace and applying for jobs just because we are under 30, employers would rather give the job to an older person regardless of experience in case young people would rather go out instead of working which is not always the case, any age could do that why always presume young people will do it ?.\r\njobs also ask for a 5 / 10 year working background but how can a young person give it if no one gives them a chance.",
        "background": "Today young people under the age of 30 dont get given a fair chance at an interview because they are young,employers look at the age on the application and instantly reject. we should remove date of birth from the application to stop discrimination so we all get an equal chance based on experience.",
