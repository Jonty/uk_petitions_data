It is a message that the majority of British people wish to see Parliament\u2019s sovereignty strengthened. By the end of this process, when we have left the European Union, we will have put the supremacy and sovereignty of Parliament beyond doubt.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Exiting the European Union",
            "summary": "The issues that this correspondence exchange raises, around Parliamentary sovereignty in relation to the EU, have been debated in Parliament many times.",
