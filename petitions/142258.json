        "action": "Continue a pro immigration policy and recognise the value migrants bring the UK",
        "additional_details": "In addition the UK government should take steps to fully explain to the public the great benefits that migration brings to the UK.\r\n\r\nA large number of people who voted to leave in the recent referendum will have done so as a rejection of the federalist agenda of the EU and in favour of national sovereignty and democracy. They did not vote for a rejection of migrants or as a vote to close our borders. As such there is no mandate for a anti immigration policy",
        "background": "As part of the EU exit negotiations the UK government should seek a deal that will maintain the current rights of all EU citizens in the UK and that will keep the UK border open to economic migrants and refugees alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
