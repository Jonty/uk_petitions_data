Why do these employee's of the state have any right to subsidised food and drink at the expense of us the working taxpayer? \r\n\r\nThe money saved from cutting this subsidy would be better used in our schools & hospitals. \r\n",

These are bars are serving alcohol in a workplace in working hours at cut prices.\r\nWe want to see a ban of any MP undertaking any parliamentary task under the influence of alcohol. and an end to MP's subsidised bars.\r\n ",
