        "additional_details": "The recent referendum on an EU exit was not accompanied by the terms of an exit agreement. Under the circumstances it is undemocratic to commit the British public to an exit agreement they may not approve of. Since the last referendum demonstrated that many of the politicians are out of touch with the people\u2019s wishes, the public should be allowed to ratify or reject any proposed exit deal. ",
        "background": "We the undersigned call on Parliament to grant the people of the UK an Exit Ratification Referendum upon:  Whether or not to proceed with the proposed EU exit whenever the final terms of the deal have been agreed and before Article 50 is invoked. ",
