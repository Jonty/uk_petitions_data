        "action": "Decommission and remove Trident weapon systems from the UK.",
        "additional_details": "In 1968, the UK signed the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty, pledging their cooperation in stemming the spread of nuclear technology. In 1996, the International Court of Justice ruled that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be contrary to the rules of International Law. Thus, our possession of nuclear weapons contravenes moral, legal, economic and military principles and puts the population and environment at serious and unacceptable risk. ",
        "background": "We call on the Westminster government, in compliance with international law, to implement the complete decommissioning and removal of all nuclear weapon systems from UK soil and waters.",
