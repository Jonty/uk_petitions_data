        "additional_details": "I was vehemently for Remain, and now I am determined that Brexit is made to mean healthy collaboration with the EU on new terms (and terms that the Northern Ireland and Scotland can support as part of the UK) rather than a soapbox for nationalistic rhetoric!\r\n\r\nBritain may have voted out, but it clearly and emphatically does not want away. Most importantly, Brexit does not (and will not) mean embracing the Farage and Le Pen view of the world!\r\n\r\nIt is hope the EU will help us make this happen.\r\n",
        "background": "Sixteen million people voted to Remain. The views of these people and the weight of their opinion must be reflected in Brexit negotiations. The negotiation team must focus on forging a strong, collaborative and balanced working relationship with the EU, and be made up accordingly.",
