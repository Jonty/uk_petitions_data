        "additional_details": "During the EU referendum campaign the idea of spending our gross EU contribution on the NHS clearly resonated with the electorate and was a deciding factor in the decision to quit the EU.\r\nFollowing the vote the government seems temporarily paralysed and the electorate is becoming frustrated that its wishes are not being fulfilled in a timely fashion.\r\nThe government should immediately fund the NHS by an extra \u00a3350 million per week. This can be done now by borrowing, taxation or lower EU spending.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call on the government to immediately raise the level of NHS funding in the UK by an additional \u00a3350 million per week.\r\nThis can be funded  in the short term by extra borrowing or taxation and in the medium term by the cessation of our EU contributions.",
