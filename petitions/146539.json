        "action": "MP's should vote on the EU question as neither side gained 50% of the electorate",
        "additional_details": "In a democracy the majority will of the population should be sought. In a debate where there are only 2 answers, there should be a requirement that over 50% of those eligible to vote, have to vote for an outcome before it becomes legally binding. In this instance both sides received approximately a third of the votes with the final third not voting therefore the question should be returned to Parliament for our democratically elected representatives to take responsibility for the final decision.",
        "background": "The result of the referendum clearly showed that the British public could not decide what was best for the country. Therefore the people who are most qualiified to understand the pro's and cons of EU Membership should be charged with making this decision based on what is best for the UK",
