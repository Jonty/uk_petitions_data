        "action": "Child Maintenance should not be payable whilst a custody battle is ongoing",
        "additional_details": "Some resident parents use the child as a bargaining chip, robbing the child of a chance to know both parents. The courts can take many months to make a decision. Meanwhile, the non-resident parent pays thousands of pounds to perpetuate the injustice of not seeing the child. Where there is no evidence of abuse or evidence to support risk of abduction, the non-resident parent should not be paying thousands while not allowed contact with the child.",
        "background": "Where there is no evidence of domestic violence, child abduction, sexual, drug or alcohol abuse & the resident parent is withholding access from the other parent, Child Maintenance should not be awarded to the resident parent until the courts have ruled otherwise.",
