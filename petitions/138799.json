        "additional_details": "A key part of democracy is that people are able to freely vote for a choice which they believe in. To do this they must know what they are voting for. This was not the case in this referendum. Neither campaign group had any authority or accountability and so were able to make unrealistic claims and promises. The campaigns should have been run by organisations whom were responsible for implementing result of the vote, and clear action plans for both scenarios should have been presented. ",
