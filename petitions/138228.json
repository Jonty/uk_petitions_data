        "additional_details": "I voted LEAVE and proud of the fact.  Why do I want to stay in a corrupt state when my family fought in Wars to keep us free.\r\nIt's not about being racist as most of the stay campaigns lead you yo believe. ..its about taking control over our country...this green and pleasant land we live in. It about being able to set our own laws ...let us sell in pounds and ounces ...let's us measure in feet and inch....let us eat bent bananas and cucumber.  Stop other countries interfering in our country. Make Britain GREAT again",
        "background": "Why should we hold a second referendum on leaving the EU . Just because certain people voted to stay and didn't get their way is no reason to vote again . I didn't vote for a conservative government but that's what I got ....did I throw my dummy out of the cot and start asking to vote again.NO",
