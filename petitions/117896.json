        "action": "Change the law to require local councils to create official dogging sites",
        "additional_details": "Dogging is legal - an offense is committed only if the participants are seen by others who object. Many locations over the years have clamped down by locking their properties after dark, but determined doggers will find somewhere else, then communicate their moves through websites. One such site has nearly 1M UK members.\r\n \r\nThe positives (the safety of doggers, less police time wasted & safety of general public) of having official dogging spots would outweigh the negatives.",
        "background": "UK residents love to 'get together' in carparks, parks & public toilets. These sex acts are exhilarating for many, but upsetting & shocking for some. Hence, we must consider the introduction of official dogging sites for safety of the general public & reduced costs / time for the police force.",
