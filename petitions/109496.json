Despite these documented effects, individuals must be able to pay for the medication which keeps them safe and well, the cost of which can be extortionate and as a result they may stop taking this essentially life saving treatment. The medical exemption list of conditions (NHS choices, 2015) is severely outdated and wholly excludes medication for mental health conditions. ",

The financial cost to the tax payer of someone not taking their medication (Police, health professionals, hospital admissions) by far outweighs the cost of the prescription which keeps a person with a mental health condition safe.
