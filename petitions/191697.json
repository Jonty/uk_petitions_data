        "additional_details": "Its sensible to welcome MPs into the house of Parliament with outside interests. However once in the houses of parliament MPs should have only one goal, and that is to serve their constituents and the British people to the absolute maximum they can achieve. They should not be distracted with editing newspapers, running companies, being lawyers, farmers, GPs or Trade Union officials, etc... The undersigned demand that the challenging role of an MP gets the 100% commitment that it deserves.",

We want the Government to introduce legislation restricting additional employment for MPs.",
