Others become addicted to substances like alcohol in an attempt to medicate themselves to lighten their burden, others commit crimes due to their mental illness / addictions.... if only the help were given at the right time the outcomes could be so very different.\r\n\r\n",

Everyday people with mental health issues suffer and unless they try to kill themselves, kill others or commit crimes (hit rock bottom) they are left broken and no help is given.  This is inhumane.",
