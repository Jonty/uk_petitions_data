        "action": "When Brexit negotiations are complete, hold another EU membership referendum.",
        "additional_details": "Since many of the claims made during the EU referendum campaign were false, and some pledges made by the Leave campaign are already being dropped by its leaders (e.g hundreds of millions of pounds extra for the NHS), many Leave voters voted Leave thinking they were getting things that may not be in the final deal on post-EU relations between the EU and UK at all.\r\n\r\nThis petition asks the government to give all voters a referendum choosing between the actual post-EU deal and remaining in the EU.",
        "background": "When the negotiations on what the relations between the EU and UK would be outside the EU are completed, hold a referendum on whether to accept that deal and leave the EU, or remain in the EU after all.\r\n\r\nThings Leave voters were promised during he campaign may not be delivered in the final deal.",
