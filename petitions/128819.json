This \"newspaper\" wrote damning headlines and damaging reports of events, reports that were beyond hard hitting, verging on vendetta driven. The editor Calvin Mckenzie and other journalists took this action to lie and fabricate stories to increase their sales, stories which were completely unfounded were published and families of victims endured pointless pain.",
