        "additional_details": "Insurance companies are exploiting young drivers at rates which many can not afford. This behaviour goes completely against the whole notion of equality which Britain prides itself upon and discriminates heavily against the young and disabled preventing them from having equal opportunities in life as those who are older. ",
        "background": "Young drivers aged 18+ face extremely unfair and ridiculous insurance fees for car insurance. These vary from \u00a310,000 to well over \u00a350,000, often costing 4/5 times the price of a car itself. How is it i am mature enough to have two jobs whilst attending college, but not drive a car affordably.",
