        "action": "Make PTSD a recognised illness for fair claim and recognition of PIP at DWP.",
        "additional_details": "I tried claiming PIP on the encouragement of my social worker before medical discharg for PTSD. Following the interview for PIP, which was distresssing enough, I was given zero points, even though on the letter I received it stateded I obviously had some form of mental illness at this time. I could get nothing as it's not classed as a health condition or disability. I am well now but would have benefitted from the extra income, as I was unable to do many activitys of daily living due to my PTSD.",
        "background": "I would like the government to re-address the level of illness, disability and point scoring of PIP claims for PTSD. British people need fair claim for the illness that is debilitating and get the help in such times of need. There is apparent great need for this within the ex-services community.\r\n",
