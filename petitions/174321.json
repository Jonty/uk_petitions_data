        "action": "The NHS must never be privatised and remain a free, publicly funded UK service.",
        "additional_details": "Our number 1 priority in the UK must be the people and their health. Our doctors, nurses and the free service provided by them, are the envy of the rest of the world. The NHS is part of our national culture and has saved and cared for countless lives. It is currently being underfunded in favour of less worthy departments, such as the hundreds of billions being invested into Trident nuclear weapons and fighting wars in the middle east. The preservation and continuation of a free NHS is paramount.",
        "background": "The NHS is the bedrock of a fair and compassionate society, which is what any decent, caring person should be aspiring to be part of. The majority of our population have experienced the excellent work carried out by the NHS staff since it began treating people without asking how much money they had.",
