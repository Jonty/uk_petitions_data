        "additional_details": "I am issuing this petition in the hope we can change the view people have of Pancreatitis, and allow those who have a diagnosis the chance to apply for a Blue Badge.\r\n\r\nThe DWP need to be more consistent with their decision making, It's a fact that some sufferers recieve DLA/ PIP whilst others have theirs refused. It is unethical to award some and not others. Whilst we acknowledge sufferers may have differing severities and other conditions, this is not always the case when the decision is made.",
        "background": "Chronic Pancreatitis (CP) is a condition where the pancreas becomes permanently damaged from inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe most common symptom of Pancreatitis is repeated episodes of abdominal pain, which can be severe, Chronic Pancreatitis is a highly debilitating condition with many other complications.",
