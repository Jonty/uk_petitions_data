        "additional_details": "The results of the EU referendum are not legally binding, only advisory and do not show a clear will of the people to leave the EU. Taking into account the registered voters who did not vote the results are 37.4% to leave, 34.4% to stay and 28.2% non votes, meaning 62.6% of voters have not voted to leave the EU and there is no mandate to make such a significant and irreversible change. It should be put to MPs who's job it is to represent the best interests of their constituents.",
        "background": "Following the results of the EU referendum and the resignation of the Prime Minister I call on his successor to place the decision on whether or not to enact Article 50 on a House of Commons vote.",
