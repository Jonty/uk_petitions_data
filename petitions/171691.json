        "additional_details": "Here is a brief history of the hospital; this is one of the oldest hospitals in Britain, having been founded in 1078 by Gundulph, Bishop of Rochester, for the \"poor and leprous\". The current hospital building in New Road, Rochester was built in 1861.  The hospital relied on charity donations until 1948 when it was funded by the NHS.\r\n\r\nWe don't want this historic building to end up in the wrong hands because they may demolish this gothic style building and a piece of Medway history will be gone!",
        "background": "There is a lack of provisions in the Medway Towns as it is and we need this hospital. It was used as a rehab hospital for stroke patients and anyone else who needed a longer stay in the hospital. Medway Maritime Hospital will only allow people to stay short term as they need the beds.  \r\n\r\n",
