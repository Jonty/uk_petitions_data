        "action": "The massive increase in court fees needs to be reversed for access to justice",
        "additional_details": "Concern has been raised by practitioner groups, and senior judiciary, and the effect has been seen, most particularly in the employment sector where a 70% reduction in numbers of issued cases has occurred.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses, and those who have been caused damage and loss are now expected to pay massively hiked fees, ironically at a time when legal costs have been roundly criticised by the government. ",
        "background": "Court fees have increased in some cases by 600% in recent times in civil matters. Employment cases have seen fees introduced to very high levels, and divorce fees have also recently been hiked again. The high rise in fees is causing a barrier to justice, and debate is urgently required. ",
