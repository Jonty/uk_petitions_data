        "action": "Introduce learning about Learning disabilities in Secondary School curriculum.",
        "additional_details": "Because there is a lot of people who misunderstand the term learning disability and seem to think it just means that they are stupid or have a misunderstanding that their are different forms of the dyslexia and autism, they think everyone is the same. For example I told one of my friends who is also dyslexic, that I was and someone behind me immediately started asking me to spell out words; but I don't struggle in that area at all, I have a different form of dyslexia.",
        "background": "I my self have a learning disability called dyslexia and I'm a teen, I've realised not many people my age know about learning disabilities in detail such as dyslexia or autism etc.  I think it would help teenagers understand what people with learning disabilities have to go through on a daily basis.",
