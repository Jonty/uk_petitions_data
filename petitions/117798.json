        "additional_details": "One popular scheme, the Right to Buy has been amended by Government to the extent that it is now also discriminatory towards long term tenants as no qualifying tenant receives the full 70% discount due to Government capping. Such tenants are stuck in the rent trap, many of them being in their 50s and unable to secure a mortgage on normal terms in order to buy on the open market.\r\n\r\nWe urge the Government to rethink its stance and make the full 70% discount mean 70%.\r\n\r\nCheck out our Facebook page.
