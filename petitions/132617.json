        "action": "Stop closure of Lincoln Limb Clinic Services",
        "additional_details": "This planned action is quoted as 'being in the interest of providing a better service' but in reality, no-one who uses Lincoln Clinic have complained about the service they receive. This is just another money saving measure, removing a service NHS Management know that amputees need, thus forcing us to accept the changes....They have us over a barrel. Please sign this petition and help us to try and keep our service local for the benefit of patients, not the 'bean counters' Thankyou",
        "background": "From September 2016, Lincoln Limb Clinic will be closed and all appointments will be at Nottingham City Hospital. Patients are expected to travel up to a 161.4 mile round trip for an appointment. This is WRONG and will cause unnecessary toll on the young and older patients.",
