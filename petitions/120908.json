        "additional_details": "The 2015 General Election gave Britain the most unrepresentative results in recent memory. SNP and Lib Dems had a smaller percentage of the vote than UKIP but achieved 62 seats (combined). The Labour and the Tories had a 3% difference in the vote, but a near 100 seat difference. How is it fair that the Lib Dems get 4% less of the vote than UKIP but 7 more seats? Or that SNP get even less votes than the Lib Dems but eight times the seats? This is a broken system that needs to be fixed by STV.",
        "background": "Switch to the STV voting which sees voters rank their candidates in order of preference (e.g. 1-5). This voting system removes minority rule in constituencies and tactical voting and gives us a fairer representation for smaller parties instead of just Labour or the Tories. ",
