        "additional_details": "My son got placed in isolation for going into school with short hair a few months ago. I can understand their stance on no makeup or nail polish (not that this would apply to my child) due to it able to be changed before and after school. However, someone cannot change the length or colour of their hair. Whilst my child broke the school rules without good reason, a friend of his has a mum that was diagnosed with cancer. So, his friend shaved his head to support her but got punished.",
        "background": "I believe that all children in the UK should be allowed to have a hairstyle that they like, rather than being force to have hair that is considered 'decent' by the school. Children should not be punished for having a hair style that expresses their personality, but schools still have the right to.",
