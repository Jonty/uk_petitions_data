        "action": "Give students the choice to no longer continue their education or training at 16",
        "additional_details": "Currently the law states that at the age of 16 when students finish and receive their general certificate of secondary education they must continue their education to college or sixth form or work a part time job or apprenticeship until the age of 18. This trains students to work under authority and not for themselves. I would like students to be able to decide what they would like to do for the future and start as early as possible.",
        "background": "I would like for students who have finished their GCSE's to have the choice of continuing with education or further training or doing what they want to do for the future. I would personally like this because I do not want to work for somebody and would like the choice to be self employed after GCSE.",
