        "additional_details": "I myself have been a type 1 insulin-dependent diabetic for 16 years, and as part of my condition management I, like thousands of others, need to know the nutrition, particularly carbohydrate content of the foods I am eating in order to calculate my insulin requirements.\r\n\r\nDiabetes is a life-threatening chronic health condition and it is extremely surprising how many food establishments are only able to provide allergen information and not the full nutritional content of the items on their menus.",
        "background": "Since December 2014 it has been made a necessity that 14 indetified food allergens including nuts, fish, milk and eggs must be provided on food packaging and on menus where food packaging isn't readily available (Food Standards Agency, 2013). However this doesn't cover the full nutritional content.",
