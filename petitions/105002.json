        "additional_details": "Lenovo, HP and Dell are known to use this on most if not all models of laptop they currently sell with the claim it is required for FCC certification. Other manufacturers such as Acer and Asus do not which means the claim it is for FCC certification is not true as those manufacturers obtain FCC certification.",
