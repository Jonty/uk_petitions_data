        "additional_details": "You may have heard the saying: Breast is Best, but in the UK we have a considerably low number of breastfeeding mothers compared to other European countries. A lot of mothers turn to formula through lack of support or advice. So this petition is aimed at standardising the support and advice given. We need a better structure in place to help breastfeeding mothers to establish, maintain and continue breastfeeding for as long as they wish to nurse their baby/toddler.",
        "background": "Breastfeeding can be hard to establish without correct support or advice. Many mothers turn to formula and regret not being able to breastfeed. I found it incredibly confusing, being given conflicting advice from one midwife to the next, and found it daughting when I went home from hospital.",
