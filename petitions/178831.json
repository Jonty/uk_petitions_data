        "additional_details": "There are past precedents for individuals being totally banned from entering the United Kingdom for having promoted hatred and intolerance.  Such banned individuals have included American 'shock-jock' Michael Savage, homophobic Westboro Baptist Church leader Fred Phelps, anti-Islamic Dutch politician Geert Wilders and so forth.  By promoting hatred through their views, they are encouraging their supporters to violate British laws on equality and tolerance.",
        "background": "Whilst I appreciate the efforts of the current petition to prevent Trump from receiving an official State Visit to prevent \"embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen\", I would go further an insist that as a promoter of hatred and intolerance, Trump should not be allowed into the country whatsoever.",
