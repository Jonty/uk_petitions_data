        "action": "Improve education on homosexuality in schools in a bid to prevent homophobia.",
        "additional_details": "We are from NCS (national Citizenship Service), as a group of young people we feel that there's little or no education on homosexuality. Results of our survey show 71.43% homosexuals have had negative experiences because of their sexual orientation in school and 75% of people have said it's because of lack of education that homophobia is a problem in today's society. We feel that if the education towards this is improved so will people's views on not just homosexuality but in other things aswell",
        "background": "There's a distinct lack of education on homosexuality in the school curriculum. Having been through the education system public and private we have never been educated on homosexuality and acceptance of it. We strongly believe if people are educated towards this our society could be more inclusive.",
