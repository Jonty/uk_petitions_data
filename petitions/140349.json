        "action": "As the referendum was so close, Parliament should have the final say on EU exit.",
        "additional_details": "The leave campaign is now backing off claims that immigration would stop, that \u00a3350M per week would be available for the NHS, and so on. The remain campaigns assurances that article 50 would be triggered immediately and that David Cameron would not resign have both been broken. The predictions - dismissed as fear mongering - of a crash of sterling, a second Scottish referendum, and a stock market plunge have all been shown to be accurate. Parliament should act in the interests of the nation.",
        "background": "Because of the poor quality of the campaign on both sides, the number of false assurances and claims made, the exclusion of many affected citizens, and the massive regional variations, the outcome of the EU referendum cannot be seen as a reliable indicator of public opinion.",
