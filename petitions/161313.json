        "additional_details": "Why the resignation comes about is irrelevant - this is NOT to do with the current Brexit issue.\r\n\r\nThis is NOT a request for a GE based purely on the outcome of the referendum (and so is vastly different to petition 133548), but for a change in the law to cover scenarios whereby the PM chooses to resign during a fixed term parliament. \r\n\r\nThe public should get to choose the new Prime Minister, knowing who it is that's going to lead the country for the next 5 years, not just the members of a party.",
        "background": "When voting during a General Election, it is likely voters base their decision not only on who they want to represent them locally, but also who they would like to represent the country on the global stage. If the PM resigns, the public should get to vote again based on the new leadership.",
