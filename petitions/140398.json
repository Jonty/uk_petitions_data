        "action": "Allow teenagers aged 16-17 in the UK to vote if there is a second EU referendum.",
        "additional_details": "The results of Scottish referendum were greatly influenced by the permission of teenagers 16 and above to vote, and this would also affect a possible second EU referendum in the UK, and would have directly affected the result on Thursday June 23rd: teenagers aged 16-17 should be allowed to vote as their futures are directly affected. 75% of 18-25 year-olds voted to remain and if this view is shared by 16 & 17-year-olds then it is prudent that they should also have a voice.",
        "background": "16 and 17-year-olds should be allowed to vote in a second EU referendum if one occurs because ultimately it decides their futures and many are unhappy with the prospect of having their futures determined for them by adults who do not have to live as long with the consequences.",
