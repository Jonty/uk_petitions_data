        "additional_details": "People are waiting up to 12 hours to be seen in A&E, when the target is four hours. Old people spend weeks in hospital beds as there is no social care to treat them at home. People's lives are at risk and the conservative government are doing nothing about it. I hearby call that PM Theresa May and health secretary Jeremy Hunt provide the funding that is desperately needed. This demands action and it needs it now. We cannot put people's lives at risk, this is not acceptable. They must act now.",
        "background": "The NHS and social care under the conservatives has taken huge cuts. This has put huge strain on the NHS with the Red Cross deeming it a \"humanitarian crisis\". People are dying waiting on trolleys in hospital for beds that are not available. ",
