        "additional_details": "The recent EU referendum which took place in the UK was strong evidence that elderly people have made a huge decision for the country and may not even see the changes which they caused. According to the Huffington Post 18-24-year-olds were 75% remain while only 39% of 65+-year-olds voted to remain in the EU. This shows the huge impact that the 65+ had on the referendum and its outcome. Should they be given an opportunity to change the country to suit them while it affects the youth a lot more?",
        "background": "The thoughts and ideas of elderly people are often outdated, so why should they decide the future for younger generations? This petition raises the idea that an age-limit should be put on voting, to make sure that the people deciding the future of our country will actually live to see the change.",
