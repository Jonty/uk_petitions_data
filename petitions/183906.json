        "additional_details": "Most have to add the stamp duty tax to their mortgage. How can taking out a loan for 25-30 years to pay the government for the privilege of moving home be right. Stamp duty tax is damaging the property market, peoples lives & the economy. Many people that want to, or need to move cannot, simply because of the enormous cost of stamp duty. Stamp Duty tax needs to be abolished.",
        "background": "People need to move house for many reasons, job, health, family, personal circumstances change etc. they should be able to move easily, without a financial penalty being paid to the government. But they can't because of stamp duty. It locks people in unsuitable homes and restricts movement. ",
