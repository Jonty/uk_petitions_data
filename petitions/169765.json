        "additional_details": "Domestic abuse comes in many different forms, including physical, emotional and mental. Those who are affected by emotional and mental abuse are less likely to speak about it and may find it more difficult to know whether or not they're in an abusive family unit. These types of abuse can affect every member of the family, including children, women and men. Emotional and mental abuse can also have many more damaging effects on a person's health which are sometimes irreversible. ",
        "background": "Not all abuse within families is physical. Those in the family unit (men, women and children) can often be subjected to these types of abuse which can often be a lot more damaging to a person's health, than just physical abuse. From personal experiences, not enough is done for the justice of abuse.",
