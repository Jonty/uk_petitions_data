        "action": "Introduce an unconditional, Universal Basic Income",
        "additional_details": "Checkout staff, bank tellers, hospital porters, factory workers, receptionists and warehouse workers are already being displaced by technology. They are soon to be followed by lorry drivers, backroom legal teams, financial analysts, call centre staff, pharmacists, etc. All this is happening far faster than workers can retrain.\r\n\r\n(Read 'The Rise of The Robots' by Martin Ford for more.)\r\n\r\nA Universal Basic Income eliminates almost all bureaucratic costs of social welfare yet achieves the same aim.",
        "background": "Working people face unemployment or reduced hours/wages as their jobs are increasingly taken by machines, yet political austerity focusses on reducing welfare.\r\nPay a Basic Income to every citizen to reduce welfare bureaucracy, increase quality of life, and maintain consumer spending in the economy.",
