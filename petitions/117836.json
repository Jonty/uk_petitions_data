        "action": "Government to justify why Dartford Crossing charges still exist",
        "additional_details": "No other similar charge exists so the claim that it is to pay for upkeep is flawed. The Orwell bridge in Ipswich is the nearest comparable bridge, is longer than the Dartford bridge and is free to use.  Blackwall and Rotherhithe tunnels are free to use. All other bridges over the Thames are free to use.  So why are the people of (mainly) Kent & Essex discriminated against? To call it a \"congestion charge\" is a nonsense as there is no alternative route without a 28 mile detour.  This TAX must go!",
        "background": "A full justification is required from Government as to why drivers are charged for using the Dartford crossings. When the bridge was originally commissioned a commitment was given to abolish ALL charges once the bridge was paid for - which happened in 2003! Why do these unjust charges still apply?",
