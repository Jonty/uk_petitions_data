        "action": "Limit the amount private parking enforcement companies can charge.",
        "additional_details": "It is of course right to ensure people use carparks fairly and obey the rules. However it is totally unfair that a charge of \u00a3100 can be applied for say an overstay of just a few minutes.  For sites where people pay to park I think the limit should be \u00a350 or 5 times the amount of underpayment, whichever is the lower. ",
        "background": "Many carparks are monitored by private parking enforcement companies. It is logical to ensure people obey parking rules but they often apply massive fines of \u00a3100 for minor parking violations. For many people such high fines cause financial difficulties, this is too high  for minor infractions.",
