        "additional_details": "In 2012, Anxiety UK conducted a survey on social media use and its effects on emotions.\r\n\r\nThe survey found that 53% of participants said social media sites had changed their behaviour, while 51% of these said the change had been negative.\r\n\r\nAn organisation that aims for internet safety, called Enough is Enough, conducted a survey that found 95% of teenagers who use social media have witnessed cyberbullying, and 33% have been victims themselves.\r\n\r\nTime spent on social media has been linked to poor mental health in children according to a new report from the Office of National Statistics.\r\n\r\nThe study found that children aged 10-15 who spend three hours or more on social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram on a school night are twice as likely to suffer from poor mental health.",
        "background": "With studies showing that social media/technology is impacting upon mental health, the current therapies available need to be updated with this issue in order to treat modern day mental wellbeing. Therapy would include negative aspects of social media and how to use social media in a healthy manner.",
