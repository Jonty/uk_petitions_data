        "action": "Provide protection for closed railway track-beds to aid rural regeneration.",
        "additional_details": "The railways were mainly built under Act of Parliament. After closure Local Authorities have sold off railway land for development. Usage for footpaths and cycleways is fine. Building houses and industrial estates prevent regeneration of these railways. Scotrail have reopened part of the old Waverley route. Groups would like to reopen lines such as the Somerset, Dorset, Deeside line, Lynton & Barnstable and Matlock, Bakewell & Buxton and Cliffe Hill Mineral Railway. Local authorites should be required to aid projects and reject planning for developments.",
        "background": "In the mid -1960's Dr Beeching was employed to find ways of making the railways more profitable and his report resulted in the closure of a large part of our railway network. The report failed to take into account the growth in population and the necessity for rural transport.",
