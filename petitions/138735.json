        "additional_details": "Moreover, the result has proven to be extremely divisive; not just between generations but between different regions of the UK.\r\n\r\nScotland, London and Northern Ireland have voted by qualified majorities (>55%) to remain within the EU, possibly as a stronger preference to remaining part of a UK outside the EU. \r\n\r\nHM Government must be bound not to take the terminal decision of exercising Article 50 without absolute certainty when its unintended consequence might be the destruction of the UK.",
        "background": "The result of the referendum held on 23 June 2016, asking whether the United Kingdom should 'remain' as a member of the European Union or 'leave', was only marginally in favour of 'leave' (51.9% of the vote versus 48.1%).\r\n\r\nAn unqualified majority does not give HM Government a clear mandate to act.",
