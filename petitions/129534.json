        "additional_details": "A series of known tactics are possibly being used to distort the result beyond acceptable margins, e.g. Barnet registers omitting names, May 2016; East Devon registers contains names which should not have been there, May 2015; South Thanet General Election count delay for twelve hours being unexplained, May 2015; the Legality of a variety of Electoral procedures being ignored by parties 2014-2015.Etc. \r\nA team of three independent inspectors must be appointed by an MP's Committee for each counting centre.",
        "background": "Recent elections have demonstrated an alarming series of errors which may be, or have been, deliberately used to distort the result beyond acceptable limits. There is no confidence in the Electoral Commission UK in their own handling of the necessary oversights at each stage of the process.",
