In the two years that it is estimated to take to leave, those currently aged 16 will be 18, and working towards careers, further education and other things impacted by the EU. Ultimately, they will be around the longest to deal with a decision that they did not make.",
        "background": "People currently aged 16 in the UK have just finished life defining exams, and yet were not given a say in a vote that will impact them just as much as, and in fact for longer than, everyone else.",
