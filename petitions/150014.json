        "additional_details": "During the campaign statements were made which I believed to be untrue and deeply misleading. I tried to find an official body which might be relied upon to keep the participants to a basic level of honesty. I was unable to find one - not the electoral commission, not the ASA, not anyone. In a general election untruths are eventually exposed and the voters get a chance to remove those elected. Here there is no second chance - unless parliament creates one. ",
        "background": "The decision to leave the EU is too important to be made on the basis of incorrect or misleading information. If an independent body such as fullfact.org finds that this has happened then the referendum result should be declared null and void, the statements corrected  and the vote rerun. ",
