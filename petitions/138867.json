        "additional_details": "We have held months of long and hard campaigning on both sides of the debate, however democracy and the people have spoken and made their voices clear, we want out, no more do we want to be controlled and dictated to by an unelected elite sitting in a foreign land.\r\n\r\nNo more do we want to pay \u00a3350 million pound a week to the EU.\r\n\r\nMore importantly we want to control our own destiny and make our own laws, with our elected parliament making laws that are supreme and not to be overruled by the EU.",
        "background": "We have literally held a historic vote on our membership of the EU, yet bizarrely some wish to hold another referendum to get the remain choice they wanted by now stating that the turnout of voters was too low amongst other reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
