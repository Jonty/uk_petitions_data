        "action": "Lower the legal drinking age to 17",
        "additional_details": "There are multiple reasons for this action to be taken. One reason being that lowering the legal drinking age could prevent people binge drinking when they finally reach 18 years, for example, like a child who's only been allowed fruit & vegetables being let loose at a party full of sweets. In other countries such as France, Germany & Belgium, the legal drinking age is 16 - although a restriction is kept on spirits until 18. I feel that the UK should be keeping up with other countries.",
        "background": "Lowering the legal drinking age could reduce & tackle the problem of binge drinking in the UK - as well as help young people socially as young school leavers can find it difficult to find friends of a similar age in the workplace. ",
