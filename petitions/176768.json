If negotiations on free movement of non-UK workers - such as nurses, care workers, teachers, plumbers, fruit and vegetable pickers etc. - are reduced, or even curtailed, after Brexit, might this not also effect the number of non-UK football players able to take up posts on our football teams? This is very worrying. We need clarity on this matter.",
