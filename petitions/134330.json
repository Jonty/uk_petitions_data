        "additional_details": "Today, there has been a seismic shift in the political and economic landscape in our country. This has resulted in an entirely different situation to that which existed during the previous general election, when we were a member of the EU. We believe that the British people have a right to determine the direction that Britain takes in this new political environment. This is a key junction in our nation's history, one in which the people deserve their say.",
        "background": "It has been announced that the people have voted to leave the European Union. This petition respects that decision, but proposes that we hold a general election as soon as possible. The British people have a right to determine the direction that Britain takes now that we are outside of the EU.",
