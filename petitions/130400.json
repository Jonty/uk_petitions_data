        "action": "Make it illegal for a company to require only women to wear makeup at work",
        "additional_details": "Makeup is expensive (and cannot normally be claimed back as a work expense), time consuming (you won't normally get paid for that time) and can damage skin. Contrary to sexist stereotypes not all women have been wearing it daily since their teens, and some would actually be unable to do a professional-looking makeup job at all. This should not stop someone getting a job. Note that most schools actually ban children, including older teens, from wearing it.",
        "background": "Following Nicola Thorp's petition on high heels, it should also be illegal to require women to wear makeup at work, except in circumstances where it genuinely is required and a man would also be required to do so (e.g. theatrical productions, but there is no excuse for offices).",
