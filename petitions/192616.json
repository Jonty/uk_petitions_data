        "additional_details": "Schools are currently operating on a 'if you want to' basis. If the teacher wants to they will teach BSL, if they don't they won't. \r\n\r\nI think it should be compulsory in all schools. \r\n\r\nBeing deaf leads to isolation, even with right support deafness can be lonely and frightening. \r\n\r\nProblems such as banking, ordering food, asking for help in supermarkets or even getting a taxi could be easily avoided if everyone had a basic knowledge of BSL.\r\n\r\n#SignForFunSignForTheFuture ",
        "background": "I spent 5 years learning french throughout school and not once did I ever have to use it outside of school. I was never taught BSL growing up and quite frequently were greeted with the unforgiving BSL language  barrier.\r\n\r\nI want the next generation to speak freely to one another. Hearing AND DEAF.",
