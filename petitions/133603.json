        "additional_details": "48% of voters in the EU referendum chose to remain and a prominently cited reason was for access to freedom of movement and the ability to travel - made possible only because we are EU citizens. \r\n\r\nCurrently many UK nationals enjoy dual-nationality with many other European countries, usually because they have ties with or have lived in a country for a number of years. Since we all have ties to the EU and have lived there for many years we should be eligible for an EU dual-nationality status. ",
