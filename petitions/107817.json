        "action": "Make Winston Churchill's birthday, 30th November, a UK bank holiday.",
        "additional_details": "This would be an entirely apolitical holiday. Winston Churchill was a liberal and he was a conservative, both in terms of party and inclination. Ultimately though, he transcended party-politics and led a national government during our very darkest hours. Not everything he said during his long career would be deemed 'pc' today, but fundamentally he stood up for all Britons, regardless of background, and for the most noble of British traditions: freedom, justice, honour, duty, mercy, hope.",
        "background": "Widely considered to be the greatest ever Briton, Churchill laid the foundations for the welfare state, and led the nation's defence against the Nazis.\r\nThis holiday would not only recognise his immense contribution to our country, but also that of the millions of Britons who stood alongside him.",
