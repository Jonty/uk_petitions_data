        "additional_details": "Higher rate stamp duty is an unnecessary tax preventing developers updating and restoring homes. Can make the process unviable. We will end up having derelict properties dotted around our towns and cities which could be homes.",
        "background": "Currently buying and restoring an unihabitable Victorian house previously owned by elderly people who did not look after it. Will then sell it as an updated habitable property. Would pay stamp duty anyway as well as vat on costs of restoring and tax on completion. Higher rate sdlt too much.",
