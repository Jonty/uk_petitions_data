        "additional_details": "The Royal College of Physicians recently stated \"The health problems resulting from exposure to air pollution have a high cost to society and business, our health services, and people who suffer from illness and premature death. In the UK, these costs add up to more than \u00a320 billion every year.  Taking action will reduce pain, suffering and demands on the NHS, while getting people back to work, learning, and an active life. The value of these benefits far exceeds the cost of reducing emissions.\"",
        "background": "Public transport should not cause harm to public health. Diesel exhaust is one of the biggest causes of air pollution, which is linked to 40,000 early deaths every year, causing diseases including cancer, dementia, and heart disease. It is time for a healthy alternative energy for public transport.",
