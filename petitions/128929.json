        "action": "Remove VAT on investment silver coins and bars.",
        "additional_details": "Silver has been bought as a store of value for centuries. Most investments do not attract VAT for example stocks, shares, bonds, savings accounts, property and gold bullion.\r\n\r\n1 Kilogram silver bars and 1oz silver Britannia coins are the most commonly purchased silver investments in the UK.\r\n",
        "background": "Silver coins and bars are an accessible long term investment for many people. The application of VAT on silver is unfair. \r\n\r\nThere is no VAT on investment gold coins and bars which favours wealthier investors. Some EU states do not charge VAT on silver bullion which gives them an unfair advantage.",
