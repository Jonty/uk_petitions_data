        "additional_details": "Considering the hosting costs on servers is minimal, this seems little more than vandalism on the part of the BBC. Many people have contributed and participated in this recipe collection, and it provides a valuable public service for many people who use the recipes day to day. It seems typical of the 'imperial' concept of the BBC that George Osborne champions, that useful domestic content is to be scrapped. Cooking and meals are one of the joys and pleasures of life for millions of people.",
        "background": "As part of proposed cuts and savings, the BBC has announced that it will remove its collection of 11,000 recipes from their website. We petition the government to intervene and insist that these recipes remain accessible to the public.",
