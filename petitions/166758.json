        "additional_details": "Why do schools think it's ok to disrupt a child's education in this way? This denies children the education they are entitled to. The strict uniform policies are often discriminatory and unfair, if not petty.\r\nSchool uniforms are a part of school life, this is accepted, but why does the 'wrong colour' black shoe or wrong type of material matter?  A child's education should matter more than the cut of their clothing. Make schools relax their policies to ensure all children are treated fairly! ",
        "background": "Schools are turning pupils away due to uniform violations which disrupts a child's education. Schools should be made to relax these draconian policies. A parent is fined for taking their child out in term time, yet schools openly send children home. Clothing does not have a bearing on education! ",
