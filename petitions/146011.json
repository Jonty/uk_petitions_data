It is not in the interests of the UK for our membership of the EU and its future, to be placed on hold during the 3 month period likely to resolve party leaderships and to choose the next Prime Minister. Political parties may voluntarily suspend operations, and leave and remain candidates and campaigns can contest all constituencies. The current constitutional crisis crisis can be resolved by this means much sooner. ",
