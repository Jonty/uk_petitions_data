        "additional_details": "If we do not oppose Donald Trump then the world will see us as condoning his behaviour and he will continue to destroy our way of life. We are in a position to influence him. The special relationship that we have with the USA is not as important as standing up for the values we have to create a stable, tolerant society.",
        "background": "We ask that the UK government publicly condemns Donald Trump's racist immigration agenda which panders to racial stereotypes. Law abiding citizens are being unfairly discriminated against. Our British values call for us to stand against such behaviour. End the special relationship. Make a stand.",
