If they lost a second referendum would we keep voting until they eventually won? This is a form of Bullying! \r\nREMAIN would not petition for a re-vote if they had won, regardless of the numbers! We were bullied by REMAIN during the campaign, slandered and heckled as racist because we have a different opinion to them. Are our votes not worthy!",

REMAIN voters have raised a petition for a second referendum because they disagree with the democratically reached result. A second referendum would be undemocratic.",
