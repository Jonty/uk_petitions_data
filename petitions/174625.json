Last night she was given detention and came home really upset. she is now refusing to go school.\r\nMy friends son also was given a detention for 'coughing too many time' as the teacher thought he was messing around. however he just had a cold. he now never speaks to that teacher ever and hates her",
        "background": "Children are feeling more depressed and upset after having detention. What gives schools the right to keep our children behind after school. It teaches them absolutely nothing!.\r\nThis is going against our human rights. Holding us in a place of solitude and opression!",
