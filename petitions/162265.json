        "action": "Provide GCSE Physics and combined science students with a formula sheet in exams",
        "additional_details": "As teachers we think this unfairly disadvantages students of a lower attainment level, students who first language is not English and students who have special educational needs relating to memory. \r\nWe call on the government to require Ofqual to instruct the exam boards to change this and to provide students with a full formula sheet. ",
        "background": "From 2016 onward the changes to the GCSE specification means that students will have to recall a large number of equations, that were previously provided on formula sheet. We think this in unfair and is a test of recall and not a test of their scientific knowledge or understanding  .",
