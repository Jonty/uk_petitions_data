        "additional_details": "For more information there are video's on YouTube and many tabloid articles regarding the masceration of chickens. The brutal ways in which they are treated and the lack of care the egg industry has for these animals. The animals can be sexed whilst still in the egg! There is absolutely no reason to give chickens this kind of treatment. It's barbaric for 21st century Britain! Germany have already banned this practice, and we should follow suit! Please get this cruelty banned!",
        "background": "The egg industry will kill millions of chickens this year by throwing them into a meat grinder alive. The RSPCA currently says this is a humane way to kill these animals! It is not, it is barbaric and should be stopped immediately. There are kinder ways to do this to these animals!",
