        "action": "Reform the IR35 Tax Regulations introduced in 2000.",
        "additional_details": "Specific reforms sought are:\r\n\r\nAbsolute clarity for a contractor of his/her IR35 status prior to a contract being signed so that appropriate rates can be negotiated.\r\n\r\nWithin IR35 status calculations:\r\n\r\nHave sufficient allowances for expenses, particularly for travelling freelance contractors (rather than just 5% currently).\r\n\r\nExempt ENICs from the IR35 calculations, as regular employees do not pay ENICs.\r\n\r\nBuild sufficient allowances into the calculations to recognise a lack of employee benefits.",
        "background": "The IR35 Regulations, introduced in 2000 to address the differences in liabilities due to HMRC between an employee and a self-employed freelance contractor providing services under a limited company, is a highly subjective, unclear and disproportionate piece of legislation that should be amended.",
