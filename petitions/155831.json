        "additional_details": "The first incarnation of the European Union was formed in 1957 by 6 countries, previously in conflict, to show allegiance to each other and prevent the further outbreak of war within Europe. \r\n\r\nOn 23rd June 2016, the UK voted in a referendum to leave the EU and in the proceeding 5 days witnessed several disturbing acts of unrest and general tension as a result.",
        "background": "It is not mandatory to act in accordance with a referendum. In the interests of peace, humanity and national security the Government should disregard the recent result, NOT trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty but work with the 27 states to reform the EU in a way that is acceptable to all members",
