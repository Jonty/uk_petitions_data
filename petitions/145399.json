        "additional_details": "The EU referendum has failed to produce both significant majority outcome and high turnover of voters. The Leave campaign was dirty and deceitful while the Remain campaign entirely failed to meet fire. Soon after EU referendum, the Leave campaign has appeared to row back on key immigration and NHS pledges made during EU referendum campaign. The EU referendum results are skewed towards the older generation vs. younger generation while its consequences will be mostly on young people. ",
        "background": "The EU referendum took place on 23 June 2016. Leave won vs Remain with 51.9% vs 48.1%, respectively. The EU referendum result is not legally binding and carry only recommendation character. The referendum has no constitutional significance. Parliament still can vote to ratify the results. ",
