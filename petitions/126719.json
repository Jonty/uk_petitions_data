It is an offence to fail to comply with such a direction. Should trespassers refuse to adhere to a request to leave land, sections 61- 62 of Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 give the police discretionary powers to direct trespassers to leave and remove any property or vehicles they have with them. Failure to comply with the direction by leaving the land as soon as reasonably practicable is an offence.\r\n\r\nYou can read the full response to the petition here:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/105642\r\n\r\nIt's therefore not clear what extra powers you think the police need.
