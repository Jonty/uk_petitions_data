        "additional_details": "Having been a victim of bullying from a young age I know too well the issues that arise with constant bullying. This made me both suicidal as well as clinically ill. According to the NSPCC there were almost 26,000 counselling sessions with children about bullying last year with more than 16,000 young people absent from school due to bullying - making a massive impact upon their education. In Britain around half of suicide cases are due to bullying - this is murder. This isn't normal growing up. ",
        "background": "Bullying is a major issue for all age groups, not just children. In most cases bullying is seen as just a minor issue that one should \"shrug off\" but has shown to develop mental health issues in adults and children.  This should be classified as abuse instead of a part of life.",
