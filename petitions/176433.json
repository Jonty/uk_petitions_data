        "additional_details": "It would not take much for restaurants and cafes to develop a photo menu, as well as a menu in braille. There is huge focus on treating people equally in society these days, yet in so many establishments a large amount of the population are ignored. We now have wheelchair access in most places for physically disabled people so it's about time all disabled people were considered.",
        "background": "After a recent meal out with people with learning disabilities I found myself wondering why, with all the focus on rights and choice there was no easy read menu. One non-verbal service user had to just eat what was chosen for him, whereas if there were menus with photos he could choose for himself.",
