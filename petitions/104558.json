        "additional_details": "If you sign this and it reaches 100'000 it would have to get spoken about in Parliament. This would means they would have to vote on their own vote for no confidence. Obviously they will vote against this and because they have a majority they will win, obviously. But! If enough people sign then the government would be going against the people they are here to represent, which is Undemocratic. This means the government has to choose, either relinquish their power or be labelled a Dictatorship.",
