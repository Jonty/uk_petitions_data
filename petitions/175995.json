However, problems with enforcing this law have caused many to turn a blind eye to this. The result is many children are being exploited \u2013have no workers\u2019 rights, are deprived of pay and can end up doing work such as for-profit clinical testing that is unsafe for them, and so the law needs to be made clearer to ensure this does not happen.",
