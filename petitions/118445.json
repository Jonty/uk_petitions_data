        "additional_details": "The reason the UK has a housing crisis is simple, there are not enough properties!\r\n\r\nProperty prices and rents are so high because too many people are competing for too few properties. The wealthiest get the best, many are living in poor conditions and the homelessness problem is out of control.\r\n\r\nPrivate housing providers in the UK pay more tax than investors in almost all other countries. Comparisons are provided here >>> http://www.property118.com/?p=83569\r\n\r\nIncentives = Solutions.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Government obsession with home-ownership is unhealthy. \r\n\r\nProviding tax incentives to private housing providers (Buy-to-Let investors) on the same basis as other countries would attract investment into the creation of more homes, thus increasing choice and rebalancing supply and demand.",
