        "action": "Make it a legal requirement to wear a riding hat whilst riding on the roads.",
        "additional_details": "The impression it gives to other road users means they are less likely to pass you in a suitable manner. Riders struggle everyday to encourage drivers to slow down & pass them with care and attention. This legislation could save lives. A huge amount of riding accidents involve someone else coming to help the injured party.  The use of a riding hat has been proven to help prevent severe head injuries & it could mean a less traumatic experience for anyone involved with helping the injured rider.",
        "background": "There are some riders who choose not to wear a riding hat whilst riding on the roads. This choice could be a fatal one and if simple legislation can prevent more deaths on our roads to horse riders then it gets my vote!",
