        "additional_details": "This was evident at the recent EU Referendum where promises made in manifestos were then taken back as soon as the result was announced.\r\n\r\nHowever, this does not only relate to recent events. Politicians running in general elections now feel the need to get their manifesto pledges engraved in stone because a spoken promise is seen as so unreliable. What has driven us to this? \r\n\r\nThings need to change and politicians need to win back the trust of the British public to encourage more people to vote.",
        "background": "Politics has turned into a game of one-upmanship. How can people filter empty promises from the truth when both are presented in the same way as 'fact', either spoken or published in marketing material?\r\nAdvertising agencies are prosecuted for false advertising, how can politicians get away with it?",
