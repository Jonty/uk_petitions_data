        "action": "Bring back rent control (The Fair Rent Act)",
        "additional_details": "When linked together buy to let and Housing Benefit can be seen as the tax payer funding the purchase of property by private landlords. If the Fair rent Act was re-introduced landlords would no longer be able to pass on the full cost of purchasing properties to their tenants and in the case of those receiving Housing Benefit, the tax payer. This would make renting cheaper and lower the bill to the tax payer.",
        "background": "Our Government is concerned with the escalating cost of Housing Benefit. I believe that the spiralling cost is mainly due to the removal of any sort of rent control and the growth of the buy to let market.\r\n",
