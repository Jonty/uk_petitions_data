        "additional_details": "Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr was a vocal critic of the monarchies in both Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Popular amongst young Shi'ite Muslims, he called for religious freedoms for the Shia and encouraged democracy for which he was briefly detained in both 2004 and 2006. During the Arab Spring he encouraged peaceful protest against the Saudi authorities and condemned their crackdown on protest. He was shot and arrested in 2012. His detention was criticised by Amnesty International as a breech of free speech.",
        "background": "On 2nd January 2016 Saudi Arabia announced that it had executed 47 people in one day, among them the prominent Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr. This petition calls upon David Cameron and the UK Government to officially condemn this act of religious and political persecution. ",
