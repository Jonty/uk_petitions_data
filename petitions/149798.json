        "additional_details": "It is impossible to know who is right. If the vote had been the other way the leave party would have had every right to complain that their views were being ignored. Leaving the EU risks our very Union which was never part of the deal. We, the people, have spoken but have we made an informed choice? We do not know if we have been mis-sold. With the vote being so evenly split we charge the government to make an EVIDENCE BASED, OPEN and RATIONAL decision regarding our future in the EU.",
        "background": "The EU referendum has failed to give a clear mandate. The vote was split almost 50:50. Scotland and London are key parts of our UK and their views should be respected. It is clear that there was misinformation from both camps. Taking drastic action when half the population disagree is undemocratic. ",
