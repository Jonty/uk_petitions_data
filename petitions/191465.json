        "additional_details": "Excessive highly traumatic (for all my family) application process with HMPO. Now 15 months in process and unresolved. Complied fully with HMPO request to fulfil single identity by obtaining, and demonstrating, legalised overseas birth certificate match to the UK document. They insist she must update/apply for an old foreign passport prior to the UK passport application being approved because matching birth certificates are not sufficient. Requires more trauma, expense and time.",
        "background": "One of my daughters is adopted (full UK citizen) via a UK court of law with an appropriately issued birth certificate. After updating her records in the birth foreign country to create a single matching identity in both countries the HMPO say she still needs a foreign passport first before approval.",
