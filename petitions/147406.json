        "action": "Add political history and international relations to the school curriculum.",
        "additional_details": "I think evidence for the need for politics to be added is the large number of people asking for a second referendum because it didn't go their way. These people clearly do not know how a democracy works and they should. There also needs to be teaching into the benefits of international relations and the benefits each nation gives to the UK as well as how those relationships are formed and maintained.I propose they are added into PSHE lessons before the end of formal secondary education at 16. ",
        "background": "A small number of people knew about how a democracy works at the end of the EU referendum. Even fewer understood what benefits the eu gave and the cost of having it. By adding how Britain creates and maintains relationships and political ideologies to the curriculum we should increase that number.",
