        "background": "The results of the referendum should be taken into account, but the decision to invoke article 50 should not be made based upon a simple majority vote. Our representatives should also consider:\r\n- 2/4 countries in the UK & London voted, by majority, to remain\r\n- Post referendum events \r\n",
