        "additional_details": "The referendum of 23rd June 2016 has divided the people of the United Kingdom.  The people of England and Wales voted overwhelmingly to leave the EU.  The people of Scotland, Northern Ireland, Gibraltar, The Shetland Islands and The Orkney Islands voted to remain within the EU.  There have since been renewed calls for a second referendum on Scottish independence, Irish reunification and joint governance of Gibraltar.  We believe that the best way to restore harmony and fulfil the wishes of all British people is for England and Wales to leave the United Kingdom.",
        "background": "England and Wales will leave the UK to form a newly independent nation of Great Britain.  The UK and its remaining members will continue to exist as a member of the European Union.",
