Sheffield Hallam University is responsible for the quality of its teaching, and you should raise your concerns with the University's Law Faculty in the first instance. If this does not resolve the issue, you might consider raising your concerns with the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, an independent body responsible for monitoring, and advising on, standards and quality in UK higher education. You can find out how to raise a concern with the QAA here: http://www.qaa.ac.uk/concerns."
