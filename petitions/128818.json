Obama stated that Britain would be pushed to the \"Back of the Queue\" as far as trade was concerned if we voted to leave the EU. A hundred years of \"Special Friendship\" almost destroyed in just a few minutes.  \r\nWhile Obama was stabbing British Trade and the British people in the back, our P.M., was looking on very pleased with himself and then he applauded the damning speech. Shameful.\r\n",
        "background": "\r\nThe P.M. has gone into this Referendum debate to scare people into voting to remain in the EU.\r\nWe want the truth and we want honesty. All over the World people expect and demand that their elected leaders act in the best interests of their countries. The P.M. is not keeping to that agenda.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
