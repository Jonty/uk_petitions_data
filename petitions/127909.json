It says that the best results are achieved by spending 80 percent of effort on the top 20 percent of prospects by value. Using the same principle; HMRC should target large-sum avoidance by spending 80% of its resources on the top 20% of companies and individuals by the potential revenue that could be recovered.",
        "background": "The concern is that current direction at the HMRC is compromised; with its focus away from the 'privileged' inner-circle, and instead spread ineffectively elsewhere.",
