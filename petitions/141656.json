        "additional_details": "This petition is not intended to contest the outcome of the referendum. We also acknowledge and respect that there are many people who think the Remain campaign lied. 250 academics signed a letter in the Telegraph criticising misinformation on both sides of the campaign. In particular, we note that the Remain leaflet began by saying that \u201cover 3 million UK jobs are linked to our exports to the EU\u201d, when not all these jobs would necessarily go in the event of Brexit.",
        "background": "All of the British public, no matter which side we supported, have been betrayed by abuses of the democratic process in the campaign for the EU Referendum. Leave's winning campaign lied to the electorate with their \u00a3350 million for the NHS pledge. We are afraid for our democracy.",
