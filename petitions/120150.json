        "additional_details": "It seems that a petition that asks the government to answers a simple questions is not considered a valid petition as it is not asking the government to actually do something.\r\n\r\nThis is odd, as \"answer a question\" is, in my opinion, \"doing something\", so clearly this system is not good for questions. Asking you MP is hit and miss, so a system to allow this with say 1,000 supporting signatories, would be useful.\r\n\r\nPlease can we have such a system?",
        "background": "This petitions site provides a means to make petitions and has thresholds of support (sponsors and signatories) before bothering parliament with them.\r\n\r\nCan we have a system for asking questions directly to be asked at PM Questions in parliament, if the question has sufficient support?",
