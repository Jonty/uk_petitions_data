        "additional_details": "Many people didn't believe the Remain campaign's claims that the economy would suffer. We have lost in 48 hours the equivalent of 15 years' worth of EU contributions.\r\nLeave campaign pledged 350 million to the NHS. This has now been retracted and some are recommending people get private healthcare.\r\n\r\nMany Brexit voters were concerned about immigration, and were told that leaving would help. They are now being told that in fact immigration will probably go up. French politicians are already discussing the Le Touquet treaty, which if dismantled could mean refugee camps in Leave strongholds such as Kent.",
        "background": "Roughly only two thirds of the population voted, the win was very slim, and the younger vote was overwhelmingly to Remain. Many people voted Leave as a more generalised protest against \"an elite\", and believed many of the untruths put out to the public, which are now being hastily retracted. ",
