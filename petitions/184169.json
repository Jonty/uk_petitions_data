        "additional_details": "UNICEF has highlighted the risk of slavery and abuse for refugee children from this decision. The original expectation was that the scheme should take on 3000 children. We ask that the reinstatement of the Dubs scheme makes this a formal legal commitment.\r\n\r\nIt is vital not only that we get these children the urgent homes and care they need, but that Britain is seen to stand by its word on the international stage - this decision puts our reputation of trustworthiness as a country in jeopardy. ",
        "background": "There are 90,000 unaccompanied child refugees in Europe - alone, vulnerable, in need of care. The government's decision to stop the Dubs scheme, to take and care for some of those children, after taking just 350 children in need is wrong and we, the undersigned, believe that it must be reversed.",
