        "additional_details": "It's about time we get together and educate ourselves before it's too late. By providing resources like books based on black history,community centres to help black people get together,creating youth clubs to educate the young, this will make it easier for us to move forward and finally start to love ourselves as a race. We certainly do not want the same thing that's happening in America to happen in the UK. This will also reduce black on black crime. Thank you.",
        "background": "As a black person, I am realising that the Black community in the UK have a lack of knowledge when it comes to our history and our culture. I think we should get together,share ideas,help stop black on black crime. We need to start encouraging black people to get together. #BlackLivesMatter",
