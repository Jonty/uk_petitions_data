        "action": "Legalise the right to own and open/conceal carry a taser and/or pepper spray.",
        "additional_details": "Rape is on the rise across the UK. Woman in particular are quite often not able to defend themselves and should be allowed to carry such defensive weapons as a taser or pepper spray. \r\n\r\nIf a potential rapist, mugger etc saw a taser holstered to a persons hip they would be less inclined to carry out the crime. Same as if employees in shops had acess to one less robberies would take place. Common sense? Yes i think so.",
        "background": "Through the years it has become more off a reality that the public is threatened. Police are no longer able to adequitley protect us. Tasers and pepper spray are non leathal and we should be allowed to carry them. As a human i have the right to protect myself and should be allowed to use these.",
