        "additional_details": "Many are trying to prevent the formal leave of the U.K. From the EU, which is a direct attack on our democratic vote. Such people include Tony Blair, Richard Branson & Caroline Lucas. This was not a racist, ignorant vote to leave. It was to embrace the rest of the world, right to self rule & control of our own borders. ",
        "background": "The majority voted to leave the EU, we ask that this democratic vote be upheld & respected. We furthermore request we leave the EU single market, so we may embrace the rest of the world as a Global Britain. With opportunity to create trade deals with the rest of the world we will grow as a nation.",
