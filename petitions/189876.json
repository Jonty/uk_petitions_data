        "additional_details": "Zero-hours contracts are beneficial only to the employer who can hire and fire at will with limited legal or financial consequence.  Employees have to be available for work at all times, with little notice of when they will be required, or even what they will be expected to do.  The employee cannot expect promotion,  may not have enough hours to qualify for tax credits or too many to get housing benefit.  This degrading work practice affects 910, 000 people in the UK.  ",

They do not know if or when they have work, and are unable to make arrangements for childcare, family duties, holidays, make financial or study commitments.  Expected to be on-call they are in a state of low-lying stress at all times.    ",
