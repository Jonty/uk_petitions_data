        "additional_details": "My suggestion is that anything other than polite and controlled behaviour be met with a ban without pay and a fine. The ban needs to be served in the hoses of commons, just not actually in the debate. The fine is \u00a3500 for the first offence committed by a party and it is doubled each time. The ban starts at a day and then is doubled each time. So the 4th MP from that party would get a \u00a34000 fine and be banned for 8 days without pay.",
        "background": "MP's are supposed to be well paid professionals but their behaviour in the house of commons would not be acceptable in a classroom let alone a professional meeting. They are supposed to be there to run the country not have fun behaving badly. ",
