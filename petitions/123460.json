Just because people have a higher income doesn't exactly mean they can afford to pay for travelling long distances to college over a long period of time. One person for example is paying \u00a320 a day just to get to college and cant get a pass due to her parents earning too much.",
        "background": "If your income is less than 25,000 a year then you get a free travel pass at college. However, if you live a certain distance and your income is higher than 25,000 a year then you can't get a travel pass. This is deterring people from getting their education.",
