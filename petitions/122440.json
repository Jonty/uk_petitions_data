        "action": "Improve air quality & tackle climate change by promoting shale gas & renewables",
        "additional_details": "Coal-fired power generation in the United States has fallen to its lowest level since 1949 as a result of a shale gas and renewables boom. It's helped to reduce climate changing CO2 emissions by a massive 32%\r\n\r\nThe UK Government can create the conditions for us to repeat this success by designating wind, solar, shale gas, biogas and waste-to-energy as Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects, helping to cut planning red-tape, improve investor certainty and get more capacity built.",
        "background": "Around 30% of UK electricity is still generated by burning coal, releasing large quantities of climate changing CO2 emissions and air pollutants. Government can change this by promoting a shale gas and renewables boom, avoiding 'technology tribalism' and helping secure our clean energy future.",
