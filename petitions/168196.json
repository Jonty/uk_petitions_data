That is roughly \u00a340 a day they're not getting. Would you be ok losing out on \u00a340 a day?\r\nThe government and local councils should do more for carers and provide sufficient funding to keep CARERS!",

They are being exploited and nobody seems to CARE about CARERS!",

However from the text of your petition I think your petition relates to care workers rather than recipients of Carer's Allowance.\r\n\r\nYou might want to consider starting a new petition, which make its clearer which group of individual you want covered by your request.
