        "action": "Improve the treatment of asylum seekers and immigrants coming to the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Over the years the Government and the UK's attitudes towards asylum seekers and refugees have increasingly become more negative. The rhetoric that is pushed is one that pushes the idea of foreigners being somehow less valuable than those native to this country. We call on the Government to revisit and improve current policy. ",
        "background": "We believe that with help and support provided by the state asylum seekers and refugees can become just as much of as an asset to the UK. However, the treatment of these vulnerable individuals can only be changed through a shift in the Government's rhetoric and a change in British attitudes.",
