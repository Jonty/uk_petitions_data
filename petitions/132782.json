        "additional_details": "Living in England is a great privilege and we should celebrate this. The transition from Bank Holiday Monday to England Day, couldn\u2019t be simpler or more convenient, coming in late summer it would be part of the three-day holiday. This proposal is not competing with St George\u2019s Day. This proposal seeks to promote a public holiday that already exists, by giving it status and relevance. If this idea appeals to you, please add your name to the petition.",
        "background": "Given the rich and illustrious history of England, I propose that this day be given a new name and purpose and call it 'England Day?\u2019 By a stroke of good fortune, historical evidence suggests that this time of year coincides with the emergence of England as single sovereign state, 1091 years ago.
