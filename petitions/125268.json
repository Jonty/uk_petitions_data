        "additional_details": "A graduate earning \u00a328k p.a. with the same level of debt would (under Plan 2) pay \u00a3630 a year but in that year the interest on the loan would total \u00a31810.\r\n\r\nBy all means the Government can make it easier for graduates by reducing the (Plan 2) 3.9% interest rate but they should not otherwise make the terms of the loan more arduous (as in the 2015 Autumn Statement which froze the \u00a321k salary threshold for 5 years, thereby increasing the annual repayments of many graduates over the next 5 years).",
        "background": "I graduated in 2015 with \u00a346,429 of debt. This is subject to an interest rate of 3.9%.\r\n\r\nPaying back 9% of my salary over \u00a321k p.a., only if I earn \u00a341k am I actually reducing my total debt.\r\n\r\nI ask the Government to reduce the 3.9% interest rate which is out of line with current interest rates.",
