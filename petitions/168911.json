        "action": "The Legalization of all forms of cannabis for recreational and medicinal use.",
        "additional_details": "Tourism will be boosted, which in turn will boost local economies creating even more employment. The benefits to the NHS in terms of prescribing medicinal cannabis instead of expensive drugs will give a significant reduction in the drugs bill of \u00a315 billion. There is a lot of misinformation which fuels concerns but having cannabis illegal causes a lot of problems we see today. It's time we take a logical approach rather than an ideological approach.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Legalization would prove far more beneficial to society, if regulated and taxed. The revenue generated from taxation can be funneled into the NHS and education. The criminal justice system which is already under pressure from cuts will save money. Thousands of jobs created increasing tax revenue.",
