        "additional_details": "The opt-out system does not work: there is no confirmation of a successful application to opt-out; the opt-out only lasts for two years; there is no notification of the end date; and there is no invitation to renew the opt-out at the end of the two year period. In spite of all the hurdles put in place by Royal Mail, junk mail still gets delivered. The system in place does not work, so it needs to be changed.",
        "background": "Royal Mail earns over \u00a31.3 bn each year from junk mail deliveries. (It calls it \"unaddressed mail\"). It offers an opt-out service, but this does not work. An opt-in system would ensure that only those who wish to receive junk mail receive it.",
