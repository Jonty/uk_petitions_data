        "action": "Dedicate more funds to the development of the city of Birmingham.",
        "additional_details": "The city of San Francisco in the U.S is a major tourist attraction and financial hub, yet it is smaller than Birmingham. If the government was too attract more buisnesses to the area, build more attractions and increase the amount of tall buildings to make it appear more of a global city, then I believe we would see a similar effect. Expanding the airport to fly directly to more cities would also bolster this effect. This would generate far more revenue and give Britain a substantial 2nd city.",
        "background": "Too much of the British economy is centered around London. To counter this I suggest dedicating funds to the improvement and expansion of the city of Birmingham as it already has a substantial population, and has the potential to become a new economic and financial hub, strengthening the economy.",
