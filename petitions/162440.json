        "action": "End exclusions on high school students because of their hair/appearance",
        "additional_details": "Students are being excluded all the time due to their hair colour or certain piercings they may have, I find this an outrage considering its not about what other people outside the school think of a few students, its about going there to get a good education , so it should not be a case of what the child looks like. Collages who are more lenient don't get affected by hair colours so I don't see how schools would be affected by a students appearance. ",
        "background": "We have high standards for education & bring our children up to believe they should take pride in their own choices and what they look like. So why should we damage their education simply because of their hair colour.School is about the student not personal reputation prior to what others may think",
