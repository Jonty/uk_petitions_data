        "additional_details": "Due to the fact the country does not stop needing to be run during a weekend parliament should have to sit 7 days a week. All MP's should have to be in attendance each day and be available from 7am to 10pm for drop in surgeries for members of the public as most people work during normal office hours. As MP's are paid large salaries, they should be more accessible to the public and as Junior Doctors are now being expected to work longer hours MP's should have to do the same.",
