In GCSE Physics, a sheet consisting of all mathematical equations is also given. It would be a gross disadvantage for Reformed GCSE students to not be given said information; especially considering that the reformed qualifications are more challenging for individuals taking the examinations in Year 11 and without such sheets, comparison between Legacy and Incumbent qualifications is difficult.
