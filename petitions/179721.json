        "additional_details": "In 2011 former president Obama put restrictions on travel from Iraq including Iraqi personal who helped coalition forces. no petition was made to denie president Obama a state visit, the decision to restrict travel has little influence on British interests, unlike Angela Merkel's open doors policy. Other countries border policy's should not be the concern of a state visit.",
        "background": "The counter Petition to denie president Donald Trump a state visit is not a true reflection of the British People.\r\nUSA's willingness to trade is good for UK interests. We should follow his warm gesture welcome him. Lets support the special relationship.",
