        "action": "Set up an independent, apolitical body to manage the NHS",
        "additional_details": "The government's response to the petition to call a vote of no confidence in Jeremy Hunt, whereby the re-iterate his misleading '16%' statistic, shows they cannot be relied upon to manage the NHS.  They should therefore set up an independent body, staffed by personnel with at least 5 years\u2019 experience of working as part of the NHS, to manage this precious institution in place of the government.",
        "background": "The politicisation of the NHS has jeopardised a hallowed institution that provides exceptional value for money and quality of service.  Westminster and Whitehall should recuse themselves from its management allowing it to focus on its primary role: providing medical care to the UK.",
