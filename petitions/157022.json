        "additional_details": "Whilst William Healy's petition calling for a second referendum is admirable, despite gaining over 4M signatures, there appears to be no legal basis for going down this route and only a general election could lead to a proper mandate to ignore the referendum result. We call on Tory, Labour, Lib Dem and the SNP parliamentarians to support a pro European stance.",
        "background": "The result of the EU referendum exposes the UK to financial risks that will impact every citizen. It may also lead to a greatly destabalized Europe with the prospect of a rise in far right and left politics that could put an end to the peace that Europe has enjoyed for many decades.",
