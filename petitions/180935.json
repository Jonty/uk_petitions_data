        "additional_details": "Brexit happened in June when no one thought Donald Trump would be elected. He was elected and Theresa May, our PM, rushed to promise the UK's hand in a \"special relationship.\" The next day, the US attracted global condemnation for its \"Muslim Ban.\" The special relationship under Blair led us to war. MPs have a duty to represent the interests of this country and not the baying of populism. Postpone triggering Article 50 in the name of national security until it is clear what Trump's agenda is. ",
        "background": "Regardless of the way you voted, Brexit was delivered to the British public as a way of British voters having control over our future. In the light of recent global developments it is clear that rushing through a split from the EU would further contribute to global unrest and harm British people. ",
