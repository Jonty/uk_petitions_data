        "additional_details": "If zayn was to have a fit at school, it can be fatal. He needs teachers who would know what to do whilst an ambulance is on its way, rather than just one first aider who could be on the other side of the school! \r\nI want to petition this to keep every child safe, no one knows what accidents can occour in the class room and I think all teachers should be able to immediately deal with it until help arrives.\r\nPlease help me keep every child safe in the classroom! ",
        "background": "This petition is to bring in a new law to ensure all teachers are first aid trained. People who know my family will know that zayn is a sever epileptic and is due to start primary school September 2017. Not all the teachers are first aid trained and this could be vital in saving his life.",
