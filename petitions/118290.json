        "additional_details": "Every year, the Falklands Islands marks January 10 as Margaret Thatcher Day.\r\nWe believe that Britain should follow their example by making June 14 ( the day the conflict ended) Falklands Liberation Day in the Calendar of our country.\r\n\r\nMany brave servicemen fought to secure the freedom of the Falklands Islanders & their right to self determination.\r\nWithout their bravery and sacrifice,it is likely that the Falklands Islands would now be under Argentinian rule.\r\nIt is time to recognise this properly",
        "background": "This year marks 34 years since the Falklands War.\r\nThe invasion of the Falkland Islands occurred April 2 1982.\r\nThe Falklands War lasted 10 weeks.\r\nThe conflict ended June 14 1982.\r\nWe believe that to mark our Armed Forces bravery and sacrifice, this date should be known as Falklands Liberation Day.",
