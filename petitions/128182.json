        "action": "Give legal protection to the professional title 'Sports Therapist'.",
        "additional_details": "Currently the sports therapy profession has National Occupational Standards that all training providers should adhere to, there is also voluntary regulation in place, through the CNHC, which was established using government funding. The public are also further protected by an Accredited Register, however, as these are voluntary, it is still up to the individual to choose to be registered. We believe that by protecting the title, this will further protect the public from untrained individuals.",
        "background": "Currently the title 'sports therapist' is not protected in law, and anyone, even if they lack qualifications and training, can call themselves a sports therapist and undertake work on the public. We believe that this situation should be remedied by protecting the title 'sports therapist'.\r\n\r\n",
