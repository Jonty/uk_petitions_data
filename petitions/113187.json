        "additional_details": "Society has paid vast sums to keep in a state of semi luxury some of the most despicable terrorists, child killers & murderers that ever walked the earth.\r\n\r\nMoney if saved that can be used to save the lives of people worth while eg military, healthcare, and education etc.\r\n\r\nStatistics were kept for the first five years that Capitol Punishment was suspended in Britain and there showed a 125% rise in murders that would have attracted a death sentence.",
        "background": "In 1964 Capital Punishment was abolished. Since then advances in scientific & forensic technologies have made it possible to prove guilt in a crime far beyond what was previously possible.\r\n\r\nThis punishment should be upheld for\r\nterrorists, child killers & murderers all of which are on the rise. \r\n",
