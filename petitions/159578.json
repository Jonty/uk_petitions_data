        "additional_details": "Bromley Council was contacted by a father to ask what is happening with he's daughter, as court cafcass reports stated problems with the health and education of he's child.  Social services said he must apply for freedom of information by form on their website. The letter he recieved back stated he needs to pay \u00a310 fee plus obtain documents such as birth certificate for he's child. The mother has this so he also has to buy he's own at a cost. This info should be free once ID or rights proven",
        "background": "When couples separate, it's very difficult to iron out the terms when it comes to children and many end up in court. For a non residential parent, they must apply for information from social services and then pay a fee to get written information. None can be given by phone",
