        "action": "Hold a referendum on abolishing the British Monarchy",
        "additional_details": " The Queen has to pass every law made and has the power to veto them. This is not democracy, this is proof that Britain is stuck in the past and desperately needs modernisation. After Britain voted to leave the EU, it is clear that we no longer want people who are unelected ruling over us. A referendum, whatever result is produced, will give the Queen a mandate to leave or lead; it is time to take back democracy.",
        "background": "Currently, Britain has an unelected Head of State who is unelected and unaccountable. The Queen has rule over all laws that are made in the UK, but doesn't even help make them in the first place. She has consistently shown a lack of any leadership; recently in regards to Donald Trump's state visit.",
