        "additional_details": "This will allow both Leave and Remain supporters a say in how our country is run outside of the EU and also give the new leader of the Conservative party and the leaders of the other parties the chance to show us why they are the best person to lead our country in the new era. Having Cameron's unelected replacement run our country would contradict our leave. We need a fresh start with our independence, whether it was wanted or not. ",
        "background": "Following the results of the EU referendum Cameron announced his resignation. One large reason many people voted to leave the EU was because they were unhappy with unelected officials having a say in what our country does, we need a say in who takes Cameron's position in leading this country.",
