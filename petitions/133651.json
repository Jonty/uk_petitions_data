We can spend our money on our priorities like the NHS'.\r\n\r\nThe Leave camp should be bound by the arguments of their campaign else democracy has malfunctioned in this referendum.",
        "background": "Throughout the 'Brexit' referendum in the UK, the Leave campaign persistently argued that the UK sent \u00a3350million a week into the EU, and that that money should instead be sent to the NHS. Following the vote to leave the EU, this argument should be put into practice.",
