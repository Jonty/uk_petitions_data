        "additional_details": "During the campaign we have seen false figures, messages of hope, promises to regain our sovereignty, promises to keep funding to areas that receive EU money, fear mongering that has told us that even after Brexit we still will have limited control on immigration and which EU laws we enact etc. \r\nSterling and the FTSE have now fallen, Cameron has neglected to enact Article 50 as promised and the opposition is in turmoil. Let us show the world a calm Britain that considers its decisions carefully.",
        "background": "We believe that the EU referendum has proved that the majority of the voting public wish to leave the EU however we have made that decision with no clear exit strategy. Allow us to make an informed decision based on facts and a plan.",
