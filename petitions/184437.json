        "additional_details": "Over the past yr, the price of LED light bulbs, with high lumens and up to 90% energy savings over the incandesent light bulbs are now at a cost, which allows every supermarket across the UK and Europe to stop selling outdated energy wastefull halogens and mercury CFL bulbs. \r\nOver the past 6 months visiting 4 EU countries i found the priceing of 10 watt LED bulbs priced 70% higher than 46W halogens and 40% higher than 15W CFL.\r\nI am selling 5-10W quality LED GLS bulbs on E bay from \u00a32.00 inc vat",
        "background": "In 2011 the EU banned Incandesent light bulbs, sold to the public in 40, 60 and 100W outputs to encourage the take up of CFL energy saving bulbs. \r\nBut the BIG 3 light bulb manufactures (Osram, Phillips and GE) wanted to continue with energy wastefull bulbs, while LED bulbs are priced 50% higher\r\n",
