        "additional_details": "John Lewis and Fenwick's are companies setting high standards.  I have visited worse including M&S stores who combine baby facilities with a disabled toilet (no chair/poor hygiene) and Tesco (no toilet), whilst several Costa branches don't have anywhere private to sit so feeding has to be done standing up in the toilet.\r\nAs a father I see my wife feeding our baby in conditions that are poor and unhygienic for both parent/child, whilst I experience the lack of toilet facilities in changing areas.",
        "background": "Having seen my wife breastfeed our 3-month old daughter in numerous baby/parent facilities of varying hygiene and quality, I believe there should be a government-set minimum standard for dedicated rooms including all the following - baby change table, toilet, sink, paper towels and a feeding chair.",
