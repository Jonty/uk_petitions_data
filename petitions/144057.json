        "action": "Make parliament vote to remain in the European Union.",
        "additional_details": "The 'leave' result of the EU referendum is not legally binding - worse, it is a terrible decision. Leaving the EU would affect the young and future generations in irrevocably devastating ways, isolate Britain from one of the most powerful blocs in the world, make us economically worse off for decades to come, and threaten the UK union. Parliament must carry out its duty to represent the best interests of the whole country based on facts and vote to remain a member of the European Union. ",
        "background": "The EU referendum result is not legally binding. The UK Parliament can therefore vote to remain. Since the leave result was won by a very narrow majority and based on lies, our elected and sovereign parliament must ensure a genuinely democratic decision to remain - for the good of our country.",
