        "additional_details": "I also have a number of friends who are in a similar predicament. If we contribute for 10 years to the scheme, we can get it when we are 65. But any less than that and we receive nothing. For me to receive any money at retirement, I would need to work in a private institute for 3 more years possibly, which for me is undesirable. ",
        "background": "I have been working in Korea for nearly 10 years, and for nearly 8 of those years, I contributed over GBP10,000 to the nation pension scheme in South Korea. However, because there is no treaty for pensions between South Korea and the UK, I am unable to receive that money back in any way. ",
