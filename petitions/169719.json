        "action": "Require manufacturers & suppliers to label reduction in size/volume of a product",
        "additional_details": "Often the reductions are so subtle, that a consumer is unaware that anything has changed. This practice is misleading & unfair & it is time that manufacturers & suppliers are required to clearly mark a reduction in size or volume. This practice has made the weekly shop much more expensive & by labelling the reduction in size, consumers will be better informed to look at alternative products that may offer better value for money. See examples in this Daily Mail article: https://goo.gl/0aUpQF",
        "background": "Since the economic downturn in 2009, manufacturers & suppliers of food & other consumer goods such as washing liquids have been reducing the size or volume of products whilst maintaining the same selling price or increasing it. This results in the consumer paying more money for less goods.",
