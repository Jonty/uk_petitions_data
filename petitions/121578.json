        "additional_details": "According to the government people under the age of 25 are too unproductive to receive the national minimum living wage. However thousands of young people graduate from University every year to enter the life of independence. I fail to see the difference between the age brackets in terms of living costs and expenditure. I feel that that national minimum living wage should reflect that. ",
        "background": "As of the 1st of April 2016 the national living wage will increase to at least \u00a37.20 for workers aged 25 years and Above. However the national minimum wage (\u00a36.70) will continue for those aged 21-24. This will have an impact on those aged 21-24 with the increase in living costs.",
