I would hate to be the British Prime Minister that allows the UK to become a wasteland as a result of nuclear attack on their watch!",

Yet in the increasingly likely event of a World War 3 - which is likely to be started as a result of President Trump's antagonistic approach to Foreign Policy - the UK will be amongst the first enemy targets!",
