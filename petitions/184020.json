        "action": "Change the law that states you have to do 3 sciences for GCSE.",
        "additional_details": "The law currently states that GCSE students have to do all 3 sciences and the reasoning for this is that there needs to be more women in scientific jobs. This law does not help those who do not want to have a career in science. I think that the law should be changed so that GCSE students do 2 sciences and then chose either 1 more science or a different subject. This means you are not losing a GCSE or a qualification, just possibly a science.",
        "background": "I am a 12 year old girl. have just chosen my GCSE's and I think it is wrong that I have to do 3 sciences. I think we should change the law so it is that we have to do 2 sciences and then have the choice to do 1 more science or a different subject. ",
