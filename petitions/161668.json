        "additional_details": "Ticket and travel regularly costs over \u00a3100 for an away match and this has priced many fans out of travelling to away matches. To quote the Premier League, \"Away fans are essential for match atmosphere\" so pricing them out is detrimental to the league.\r\n Coventry City have promised to charge away fans visiting the Ricoh Arena no more than \u00a320. If a League One club can do that, why not the Championship?",
        "background": "Premier League clubs have agreed plans to cap away tickets at \u00a330 for the next 3 seasons. The Championship is a lower tier with a lower standard of play and so should cost less. Several Championship clubs are charging more than the Premier League's \u00a330 cap and this is unaffordable to most fans. ",
