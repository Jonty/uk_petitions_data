        "additional_details": "Every nine days a child in the UK is diagnosed with DIPG. This is the MOST FATAL form of childhood brain cancer which grows in the PONS area of the brainstem making surgery impossible. 'Terminal at diagnosis' currently there are NO treatments or CURE available. Less than 2% of Cancer budget goes towards brain tumour research.So it is woefully underfunded. Families encountering DIPG brain tumours all over this country are subjecting their loved ones to hideous treatments that do not offer a cure.",
        "background": "My daughter saira was six & half year old. Our world had turned upside down when she was diagnosed with DIPG this year January with no cure & survived only five months.No children should go through such unimaginable pain & suffering.So our children needed to be save from this vicious monster DIPG.",
