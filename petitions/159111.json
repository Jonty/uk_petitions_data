        "action": "Following the Resignation of David Cameron, we need a General Election",
        "additional_details": "UK voters turned out in force to make their choice heard regarding the continued membership of the EU. The choice to exit the EU, although considered controversial by some, was arrived at democratically, and will be honoured. A General Election is needed to ensure that the exit deal will be negotiated by someone who will fight for the best deal for the UK, without compromise to those issues about which many voters feel passionately about. We must be given the opportunity to vote for that person.",
        "background": "A General Election would allow voters to select who they feel is the right leader to carry the UK forward through both the negotiations with the EU following the vote to leave the EU on 23rd June 2016, and beyond. Not choosing the right leader means running the risk of a bad deal for the UK.",
