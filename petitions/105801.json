        "additional_details": "The animals are held and killed in crowded, cruel, torturous conditions from the minute they are born until their lives are cut short in the most heinous way so that people can eat them is not acceptable any more for a planet that's struggling with the population boom. Factory farms produce unsafe, cheap foods that result from terrible cruelty and pollution. This is a discussing process for the future of agriculture, the environment, food safety, and on human good conscience toward animals.\r\n",
        "background": "Please ban all factory farms immediately. These farms are contributing to disease in both animals and humans, and polluting lakes, rivers, soils and raising CO2 levels more than transportation itself. You can help reduce this right away by simply becoming a Vegan.\r\n ",
