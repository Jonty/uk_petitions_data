        "action": "Reduce Animal testing and put harsher rules in place when testing on animals",
        "additional_details": "A little more information... Some of the rules that I believe should be put in place:\r\n\r\n-Any animal that is tested on should immediately be released and   \r\ngiven the best quality of life possible or be put down. They should also be given freedom while being tested on.\r\n-Any company that tests on animals should be forced to make a \r\nminimum donation to charities that support any animal wellbeing. \r\n-Any company or brand that tests on animals must display this on their packaging in the UK.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "I have never been a fan of animal testing but I believe without it we wouldn't have the scientific knowledge that we have now. I would like the government to put harsher rules on animal testing and also for companies to have to display that they test on animals on the labels of their products.",
