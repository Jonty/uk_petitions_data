        "additional_details": "2015 attacks France 13/11, 26/06, 19/04, 03/02 and 07-09/01. In the UK we have the murder of Lee Rigby and many foiled plots. Lets not hinder our ability to deal with this very real threat. As the IRA put it. 'We only have to get lucky once, you have to get lucky every time'.",
        "background": "France 13/11 has shown us that we live in a free society with dangerous people. We need strong defence and law enforcement. It makes no sense in todays fragmented and sometimes evil society to cut spending to these vital services that protect us. Budget increases like international aid fixed by law.",
