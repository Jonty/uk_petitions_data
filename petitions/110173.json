        "additional_details": "When chocolate is offered verbally at a reduced price during the checkout process in their stores, it seriously undermines the resolve of those that are trying to reduce their intake of sugary foods and makes it difficult for parents who have to refuse such items to their children.\r\n\r\nAn example report on obesity projections in the UK: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/news/2014/01January/Pages/Report-warns-of-a-looming-UK-obesity-crisis.aspx\r\n",
        "background": "Despite regular warnings of an obesity epidemic in the press, retailers routinely promote confectionery during the checkout process in their stores.
