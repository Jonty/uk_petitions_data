        "additional_details": "Passengers with autism are being forced to sit on the carpet between carriages, challenge other passengers, to get distressed, go into meltdown or experience anxiety, simply because train operators won't cater for their needs. Complaints are dismissed and excuses such as availability, company policy are trotted out by train companies. The Equality Act is not being enforced for those with hidden disabilities and sensory impairments. We demand a new statutory duty for compliance and adjustments.",
        "background": "People with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) experience sensory difficulties. Train operators are failing to provide or enforce, quiet carriages, or other areas free of noise, distraction or bright lights. Passengers with hidden disabilities deserve adjustments too. We demand a statory requirement.",
