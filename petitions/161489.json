People could not leave their homes, homes and buildings were flooded out and many citizens suffered. Without proper care and protection, many more will follow. ",
        "background": "With climate change being placed under the new 'Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy', it shows us that the PM does not take the issue seriously, although its effects are already showing. Protecting the planet is a huge job, that deserves it's own department.",
