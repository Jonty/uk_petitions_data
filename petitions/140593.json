        "action": "All political parties to have equal say in negotiating terms of exit from the EU",
        "additional_details": "We are told that exit negotiations could take up to two years. Mr Cameron says it should be left until his successor is appointed after October 2016. This could mean that the earliest date for implementation would be October 2018; only 15 months before the next general election which may provide a change of government. Therefore the crucial first years after implementation should involve all parties.\r\n",
        "background": "The future of Britain after the Referendum is the single most important issue facing us today. Our prosperity, security and well-being, as well as that of the rest of Europe and beyond is too big a responsibility for one group of politicians and cannot be left solely to the current government.",
