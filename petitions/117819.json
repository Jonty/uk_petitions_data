        "action": "Make all laws passed in Westminster subject to an optional referendum.",
        "additional_details": "How this would work in practice: \r\n\r\nAn optional referendum can be launched by any British citizen with the right to vote. They will form a referendum committee and inform Westminster of the exact title of the contested law and the date it was adopted. \r\n\r\nSignatures can start to be collected once the disputed law has been published in newspapers/online. From this date the committee has 100 days in which to collect the 100 000 signatures required.\r\n\r\nA referendum can take place once at least 100 000 valid signatures have been handed in to Westminster. The electorate can then vote on the disputed law. A simple majority is required to repeal the disputed law.\r\n",
        "background": "Mechanisms of direct democracy are used in Switzerland and the United States to increase citizen participation and aid in reducing the democratic deficit so common in modern day representative democracies whose legislative processes have been corrupted by wealthy special interests.",
