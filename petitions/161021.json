        "additional_details": "As found by the American Psychological Association, people that have gone through conversion therapy are 3 times more likely to use illegal drugs, be 8.9 times more likely to be subject to suicidal thoughts and face depression at 5.9 times the rate of their peers. As discovered by  Stonewall, out of 1300 mental health professionals, more than 200 had offered some form of this therapy, with 40% of treatments happening within the NHS. Some patients are even subjected to electroconvulsive therapy.",
        "background": "Conversion or Reparative Therapy is the belief that through psychological intervention a person may be able to reject their own same sex attraction and become 'heterosexual'.This destructive and prejudiced rhetoric must be condemned as it's consequences for patients are detrimental to say the least.",
