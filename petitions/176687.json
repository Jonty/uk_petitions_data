        "action": "Delay triggering Article 50 until after voters vote on the UK EU Exit Package.",
        "additional_details": "Triggering Article 50 on 31/3 hands back the UK's EU membership giving the remaining 27 EU member 2 years to decide a UK Exit Package which suits them & discourages others leaving. The UK only has power to negotiate before Article 50 is triggered. The EU incentive to negotiate before a UK vote on the Exit Package is that if it were rejected the UK stays in the EU. Hence, UK should negotiate the deal terms & let the people vote to accept the deal or to stay in the EU before triggering Article 50",
        "background": "The UK shouldn't be forced to leave the EU on terms nobody voted for. Therefore, Article 50 should be delayed until after the people have had the final say by voting on whether to accept the terms of the deal or to stay in the EU on current terms.\r\n",
