        "additional_details": "UNISON at Liverpool John Moores University successfully campaigned for the removal of the honorary fellowship of Norman Betterson for his part in Hillsborough. They are currently campaigning for the removal of Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe\u2019s honourary fellowship. We believe that this should go further afield to all named participants in the cover up of Hillsborough and include all State and Academia bestowed honours being revoked. This is only one more step in getting justice for the 96.",
        "background": "The Hillsborough disaster was a human crush at Hillsborough football stadium in Sheffield, on 15 April 1989 which left 96 dead and 766 injured. It is the worst disaster in British sporting history. A new inquest in 2016 exonerated fans of any blame and recorded a verdict of unlawful killing.",
