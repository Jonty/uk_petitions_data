        "background": "At school I struggled with maths. I asked to be tested at school for dyscalculia but they said they didn't have funding, I wasn't tested until college. I was also tested for dyslexia and I have both. Schools should fund assessments for dyscalculia and dyslexia so children have more help with exams.",
