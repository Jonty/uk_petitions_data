        "additional_details": "I know and have read so many parents stories of how their child/children don't like the taste of water and we can't change our children's taste buds can we? Yes water and milk is a far healthier option no one disagrees but is dehydrating the students risking more damage to their growing bodies. Why can the teachers drink as much tea and coffee fizzy and whatever they fancy whilst the children must only have water, as their parents should it not be our choice to prevent illness and dehydration. ",
        "background": "My son, 9 years old is autistic and also suffers from OCD and Tourettes, he has always disliked anything without a strong taste, you can imagine the task of getting him to drink water or milk, he has suffered through so many bouts of dehydration at school and many headaches. I want to change this.",
