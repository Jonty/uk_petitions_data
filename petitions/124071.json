        "additional_details": "I'm an ex-smoker and believe that smokers have rights. However, children have a right to not be subjected to cigarette smoke right outside a centre for education.\r\n\r\nEvery day when I take my son to school, there are groups of parents in a haze of cigarette smoke, and it's unavoidable. If parents cannot show restraint for the health of their children, then the Government should intervene and make it a criminal offence.",
        "background": "As a parent, I find it disgusting that when taking my child to school, I have to take my child though clouds of cigarette smoke.\r\n\r\nI am not anti-smoking, but I do believe that it should not be forced on children. When parents stand outside a school and are smoking, the kids suffer as a result. ",
