        "additional_details": "The tolls are unfair and will penalise workers, residents, businesses and visitors as well as create a new \"North - South Divide\". It will also be an unwanted \"City Tax\" on Liverpool for visitors and tourists.\r\n\r\nBusinesses who operate vehicles (like taxi's, minibuses, PSV, LGV and HGV operators) who need to cross the Mersey for their normal course of duty (often many times per day) will be financially discriminated against and secure an unfair competitive advantage to others through no fault of their own.\r\n\r\nWE MUST STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT AND FAIR TO ALL AND FIGHT AGAINST THESE TOLLS!",
        "background": "In autumn 2017 a new six-lane bridge over the Mersey between Runcorn and Widnes will open to assist the neighbouring Silver Jubilee Bridge.\r\n\r\nBoth the new Mersey Gateway Bridge and the historically free existing Jubilee Bridge will be heavily tolled.",
