He was in an awful state, ungroomed & so hyper & stressed out.\r\n\r\nI have also seen these adds on my Facebook groups.  I know my boy was in France.  But you see these adds on Gumtree, so many times.  I have seen folk post the original add, then another of the same dog being sold on for much more money!!!.",
        "background": "Please stop animals being sold on Gumtree, it is an open door for folk that shouldn't own then.  I have come across instances, where the dogs have been sold on for a much higher price.  Also sadly with Dog fighting, whose to say they are not being used as bait dog's :(.  \r\n\r\nPlease put a stop to it.",
