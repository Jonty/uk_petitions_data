        "additional_details": "We have done research and spoke to many families. This heart condition can be picked up in pregnancy as can many other conditions, but have found out if you want a heart scan you currently have to pay.. I have had 3 children before and no problems so I didn't think I would have to this time round. Our son fought hard for 4 weeks, a stroke, infections and then we had to say goodnight. More training needs to be given to those doing the scans.. no one should have to go through this.",
        "background": "We recently lost our son at 4 weeks old due to an undiagnosed heart condition, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. This wasn't picked up until he was 2 weeks old. Nothing was picked up through pregnancy and he was rushed into intensive care on his 1 day check up.. more needs to be done! ",
