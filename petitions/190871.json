        "additional_details": "Internet packages are often sold as 'Up To' speeds. A package 'Up to 100MBps' may in fact regularly provide 8MBps (8% of the expected speed). The Government should either:\r\nA) Require the speed received to be no less than 80% of the speed advertised, (example \"100MBps\", min acceptable 80MBps)\r\nOr\r\nB) Force companies to sell at the minimal acceptable speed, (example \"From 80MBps\").\r\nIf the speed paid for is not met for more than 1 hour the customer should not have to pay for that days costs.",
        "background": "'Up To' internet speed packages plague the UK market and are used as an instant 'get out of jail free card' if the companies oversell or over promise on what customers are expecting. Customers are not able to accurately compare speeds and often receive much lower than is stated. ",
