        "action": "Councils should fund garden waste collection from council tax, no extra charge",
        "additional_details": "The argument that people who live in flats shouldn't be subsidising garden waste collection for households is often put forward. But many people do not have children, but their council tax goes towards schools and other local services. It is a collective local tax to cover local services. Collection of rubbish (household and garden) is clearly a local service that most people need, so should be covered by council tax.\r\n\r\nThey are exploiting a loophole charging separately for this, and it must end.",
        "background": "Councils across the UK are beginning to charge householders additional money on top of council tax to collect garden waste. Garden waste is generated by the majority of households and has always been collected alongside household waste and more recently recycling. Council tax should fund this.",
