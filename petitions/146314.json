        "additional_details": "Hundreds of thousands of UK citizens made the decision to move to other countries within the EU. Since the result of the referendum their future is unclear. The majority of these citizens paid UK taxes and National Insurance prior to their move they now rely on the UK government to negotiate terms with the EU and individual countries not to remove existing rights. Failure to do this will result in severe consequences for them. If you voted to leave or remain we call on your support, thank you.",

To do its utmost to protect the existing rights of all UK citizens living in all countries within the European Union.
