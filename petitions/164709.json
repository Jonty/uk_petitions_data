        "additional_details": "There have been major improvements in our understanding of canine behaviour over the past 25 years. BSL lacks any logic and has no scientific basis. Thousands of rescue and stray dogs are being killed when deemed of banned \u2018type\u2019. Family pets are persecuted and destroyed. A dog\u2019s physical appearance does not determine its behaviour. BSL continues to cost millions of pounds to enforce, has not reduced and does not prevent dog bite incidents, neither does it promote responsible dog ownership.",
        "background": "\u00a0\r\nMany organisations, charities and individuals believe that BSL should be repealed; the Act continues to be widely criticised. Dogs are deemed dangerous based largely on their physical appearance \u2013 it is unscientific, cruel and causes the needless deaths of countless dogs.\u00a0\r\n\r\n",
