        "additional_details": "1 in 5 over 75 year olds in the UK are suffering with vision loss; and from research I have found there are approximately 4 Million drivers over the age of 70 on UK roads.\r\n\r\nThe current system in place allows the individual to self-assess and to alert the DVLA if they are not fit to drive. In many cases if the individual needs the car for transport they will be reluctant to inform of any changes in health, vision etc. Completing a fast assessment will eliminate any possibility of this. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n",
