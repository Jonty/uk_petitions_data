        "additional_details": "If we let in those 5,000 extra people, we assume they get benefits and pay taxes at the same rates as everyone else, we'd turn a profit. They'd cost us about \u00a317m, but make us at the current rate of GDP \u00a3100m extra.\r\nEven if they didn't work, that \u00a317m divided by all the taxpayers is an extra 57p each.\u2028\r\nThese people are running from war, rape and oppression, coming to England in the hopes of finding democracy and compassion.\r\nRight now we are paying tax money to treat these people with cruelty. \r\nIf you think this is wrong sign the petition.",
        "background": "There are about 5000 stateless people in Calais, and 64.1million people in the UK. That means if we let in every single person who\u2019d currently like us to, the population would explode by 0.000078%.\u2028 Not much. \r\n If they lived by the same standards as us, the UK would turn a profit of \u00a3100m.
