        "additional_details": "It is unfair to charge a disabled person more for the same journey because they are disabled. \r\nHaving a disability is already expensive, adding another cost to someone purely because they require a wheelchair (or other mobility aides) is discriminatory. \r\nThe Equality Act 2010 Section 15 states that a person cannot be treated unfavourably because of their disability. \r\nTherefore I call on the government to change legislation so that disabled people aren't charged more due to their disability. ",
