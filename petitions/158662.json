        "additional_details": "The only requirement to renew a licence at 70 is the completion of a self-assessment form. No-one questions your box-ticking answers. Those who are frail with questionable co-ordination and concentration will undoubtedly deteriorate. There are 4.5 million drivers over 70 including 240 aged over 100. In 2013 the DVLA received 127,000 notifications of dangerous elderly drivers. It is time the over 70's were assessed for their fitness to drive.",
        "background": "My husband, Colin Moxley, was killed by a driver who mounted the pavement and hit him. She was 81, frail, easily confused, and had mistaken the accelerator for the brake. Despite thousands of calls for elderly drivers to be assessed, including the backing of Judge Aubrey, Parliament refuse to act. ",
