        "action": "Ban Diesel Vehicles from City Centers",
        "additional_details": "The ban should be implemented by 2018 as part of the government plan to fight pollution due in April.\r\n\r\nThe fine should be 10x the current value of the car tax for that vehicle class plus interest. Considerations should be made for the age of the vehicle and the level of pollution so that dirtier cars are more heavily penalised.\r\n\r\n Buses should be mandated to be petrol hybrid or electric and trucks may have an exemption during off-peak hours but companies should be forced to pay an emissions tax.",
        "background": "This Monday pollution levels in areas of the UK were higher than in parts of Beijing, China.\r\n\r\nDiesel vehicles produce 80% of this pollution and cars produce 10x the same pollution from trucks and busses.\r\n\r\nI call upon the government to introduce a ban on these vehicles from city centers.",
