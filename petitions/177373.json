        "action": "Make it a law for both parents to pay equal childcare costs.",
        "additional_details": "Where parents are separated, but both work, why is it that only one of those parents has to carry the cost for childcare? The child is both parents responsibility, both parents are at work so not available to look after that child, but only one parent pays? Maintenance agreements only calculate for a child's living expenses however childcare cost are excluded but a necessity in today's society. In many ways this could be seen as a hindrance for those parents who wish to return to work.       ",
        "background": "This petition is designed to address the re-balance required to right the injustice of one parent dis-proportionally bearing the costs of childcare in situations where parents are separated. These costs are usually excluded from maintenance agreements and unfairly burden one parent financially.",
