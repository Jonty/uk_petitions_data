        "action": "Make solar renewable energy a government-led initiative",
        "additional_details": "It is our goal, as it should be the goal of every person both of and on these islands and elsewhere on this planet, to protect it for future generations. There is no doubt in the minds of scientists that a future including humans must be a future of renewable and clean energy. We therefore recommend that the government require all of its properties, and those owned by its representatives of the people of both the upper and lower chambers, to, within a period of five years, possess solar panels.",
        "background": "While it has been often argued that the United Kingdom is a leader in the field of renewable energy, this has primarily been accomplished by the actions of private British businesses and not the actions of the government. It is most certainly time for the government to take its place in the sun.",
