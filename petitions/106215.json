        "additional_details": "It is widely known and proven that the regular consumption of fast food is a contributory factor to poor health, chronic illness and in some cases untimely death.\r\n\r\nAs the government is trying to create a healthier population, then we think it would be the responsible thing for them to do to put health warnings on fast food packaging. By displaying them in this way it will ensure that people think twice and are more mindful of what they are choosing to consume.",
        "background": "We would like the government to force fast food outlets to label their packaging with graphic images of the diseases that regular consumption of their food causes, such as obesity, heart disease, etc - as tobacco companies were forced to label their packaging.",
