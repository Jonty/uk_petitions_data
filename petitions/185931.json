        "additional_details": "At present, a female can 'trap' a man into fatherhood. A relationship is built on trust and a man is 'expected' to trust their partner. When that trust is broken to a man who is not yet ready to be a father, it is the man who pays the ultimate price, both financially and socially. If they don't wish to be a father they are declared a 'deadbeat dad' and forced to pay child support for something they did not want. This is plain and simple entrapment.",
        "background": "Any woman in the UK has the right to relinquish themselves of all responsibility arising from unintentional pregnancy, whether that be by termination or giving a child up for adoption. Currently they have a 100% say in whether they become a mother. A man ultimately has 0% say in being a father.",
