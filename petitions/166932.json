At present we have no balance, both houses are full of individuals with privileged backgrounds.To restore balance we need a house to represent the not so fortunate of the UK i.e low paid workers, people who live in poorer areas, people without the chance to change their lives. I propose we dissolve the House of Lords and replace it with annual conscripts selected from the masses thus restoring the balance.",
