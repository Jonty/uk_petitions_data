        "additional_details": "This system encourages our well educated students to leave the country.  This is at a time where we need to be encouraging further education in order to support this country\u2019s infrastructure.\r\n\r\nIt has been brought in without consultation and many aren\u2019t aware of the implications of this debt - for the Students Loan company it is a huge profit on students who don\u2019t have any other choice. \r\n \r\nWe want this above inflation interest stopped and we want this referred to the Monopolies Commission.\r\n",
        "background": "This year the government changed the system for student loans so that whilst students are studying they are already being charged interest at inflation plus 3%.  This is an unfair cost on top of the student loan debt which most students have no choice but to take on.",
