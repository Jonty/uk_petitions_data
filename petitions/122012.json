        "action": "Amend the Science Museum Group's mission, to promote its museums in the regions",
        "additional_details": "I was prompted to begin this petition by the decision of the SMG to remove 400,000 photographs to London from the National Media Museum in Bradford, to scrap the Bradford Film Festival and to rename - and effectively downgrade - the NMM.  It is unacceptable that London, which is only 13% of the UK's population, is sucking the cultural life from the rest of the country. The regions deserve better; indeed, the regions deserve parity with London.",
        "background": "It should be an obligation of the SMG to enable access to understanding about science, the media and the other themes of the Group to as wide a population as possible.  In particular, it should be required to maintain its regional museums to the same standard as any within London.",
