        "additional_details": "Sporting pitches experience usage from a variety of different people - the problem of dog walkers allowing their dogs to be off their lead is that they are free to excrement wherever, the majority of the time, without the owner knowing.\r\nThe danger of this on sporting pitches is that it increases the risk of a child or adult getting the faeces in their eyes leading to several physical and health risks such as going blind.\r\n\r\nPlease help stop this and provide some respect for our sportsman. ",
        "background": "On ongoing issue in our society is dog walkers allowing their dogs to run freely over sporting pitches, i.e rugby, football, cricket...\r\nAt times these dogs will release on the pitches and owners will ignore the excrement and not pick it up, thus providing a huge risk to those who play on them\r\n",
