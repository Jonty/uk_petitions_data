Could a woman CEO or MP ask for a meeting to be adjourned for carer commitments? At a job interview, men often have more work experience. Women who take maternity leave need opportunities to catch up. This public enquiry should invite contributions from all sections of society and report recommendations as specific plans to Parliament.",

Women taking maternity leave do not necessarily have the opportunity by right to be brought up to speed in the work place experiences they have missed.",
