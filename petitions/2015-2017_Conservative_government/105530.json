        "additional_details": "As someone with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) I have struggled with extreme emotions and negative ways of thinking and behaving all my life. According to the NHS website approximately 60%-70% of those with BPD will attempt suicide in their life. If those statistics are not a cry for help, I don't know what is. Personality disorders (PD) are treatable but the lack of appropriate services mean we have to suffer. I am begging for more awareness and support to be available for all 10 PD's!!!",
        "background": "Most people have no idea what personality disorders are or how they actually affect people. I would like more information and education to be available to reduce the stigma that so many people have to endure. The NHS do not offer enough support or have the understanding to treat these conditions.",
