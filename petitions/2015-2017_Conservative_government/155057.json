        "action": "Call for a Public Enquiry into TTIP, CETA & all future Free Trade Agreements.",
        "additional_details": "Included within CETA are the controversial investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism and Regulatory Cooperation, which brings international trade harmonisation and greater corporate profits at the expense of public safety. It is said that CETA leaves the back door open for TTIP.\r\n\r\nWe ask this Enquiry to investigate CETA & TTIP, recommend safeguards for the publics interest in all future UK trade agreements and for legislation to outlaw the practice of secret free trade negotiations.",
        "background": "The EU and Canada have concluded secret negotiations in the proposed trade agreement CETA, which is now in the process of ratification.\r\n\r\nMost commentators believe this constitutes the beginning of the 'race to the bottom' in standards and regulations for food, the environment and public services.",
