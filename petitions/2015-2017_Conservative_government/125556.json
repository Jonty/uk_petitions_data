        "additional_details": "The bill would cause significant losses in income for over 200,000 homes. It also pushes tenants to buy their homes, through Right-to-Buy, but this is unaffordable for most. \r\n\r\nThe new bill proposes that a combined household income of \u00a330,000+ (\u00a340,000 in London) should have to pay average market-rate rent to stay in their property. Tenants in London could see a loss of \u00a312k a year. This would force many out of their homes, and destroy the principles of social housing.",
        "background": "The Housing and Planning Bill is currently being debated in parliament, and primarily affects those in social housing. It could lead to social cleansing in larger cities. ",
