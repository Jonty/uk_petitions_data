        "additional_details": "Tickets for events are selling out instantly, yet straight away resale sites are showing up with hundreds of available tickets for twice the price. For example, Green Day tickets went on sale for between \u00a355 and \u00a373 per ticket on Ticketmaster at 9am yet a minute later hundreds of tickets became available for \u00a3120+ per ticket on Ticketmaster's Sister Site, Get Me In. I propose a cap to be placed on resale prices and/or a cap on the number of tickets sites are allowed to buy themselves",
        "background": "Ticket selling sites are able to buy tickets as they go on sale, to place them on sister sites, doubling in price. Thus not allowing the public to fairly purchase tickets to events. I propose stricter rules, namely a cap on resale prices be put in place to prevent this from happening. ",
