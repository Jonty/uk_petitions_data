        "additional_details": "I have personally been involved in 2 non-fault claims. The first happened while I was sat in traffic, not moving, in the left lane of a dual carriageway. A police car was on a blue light run and clipped my wing mirror as it drove between the two lanes. \r\nThe second incident I was involved in was when I was sat at a junction waiting to turn left, not moving, when the vehicle behind me was rammed into the back of me by a drunk driver. \r\nIn no way can I see how this should increase my premium by \u00a3500",
        "background": "Their justification is that if you're involved in a non-fault claim, you are more likely to be involved in a fault-claim. Using this logic, if you were parked at traffic lights and someone hits you from behind; you're more likely to cause an accident then the person parked next to you? I think not. ",
