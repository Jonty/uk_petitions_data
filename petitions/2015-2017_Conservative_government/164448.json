        "additional_details": "Majid Malik the driver of the car had 39 previous convictions and numerous aliases. At the time of killing James, Malik was awaiting trial for another incident where he failed to stop and report an accident (James' killing was not an accident). Had tougher sentences been applied to Malik previously, James would be alive today. Consistently awarding lenient sentences to serial offenders like Malik puts us all at risk. Time to get tough with sentencing to protect us all from the likes of Malik.",
        "background": "Our son James was killed in a hit & run on a pelican crossing. His killers were racing at over 90mph in a 40mph zone. After leaving James they disposed of the car & burned there clothes. Sentenced to 8yrs to serve 4 they will continue their lives, James cannot. Sentences must be aligned to the crime",
