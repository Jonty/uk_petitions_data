        "additional_details": "In a developed nation, you would expect all kinds of discrimination to have been abolished. Only decades ago it was both legally and socially acceptable to mock and discriminate someone due to their sexual orientation. It is only recently that society and the government have start to come to it's senses and understand discrimination's devastating consequences. This must be applicable to all, so everyone can feel accepted and valued without having to battle unnecessary judgement and insecurity.  ",
        "background": "Today's society and cultural norms are swarmed by double standards. It is a criminal offence to discriminate somebody due to their ethnic origin, sex etc, but it is socially acceptable to discriminate somebody because of their hair colour, height and other genetic traits. In 2017, this has to stop.",
