        "additional_details": "This age cap should be opened up to at least 30 years old as is unfair to anyone over the age of 24 trying to get an entry level position within creative industries. This policy is ageist and due to it's popularity with employers able to get funding to support the job position there are many jobs that cannot be obtained by people over 24 purely because of their age.\r\n\r\nThe position should go to the person that best fits the job role and not to how old they are.",
        "background": "The Creative Employment Programme is a \u00a315m fund to support the creation of traineeships, formal apprenticeship and paid internship opportunities in England for young unemployed people aged 16-24 wishing to pursue a career in the arts and cultural sector.",
