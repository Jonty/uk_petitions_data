        "background": "48.11% of the UK population voted to remain within the EU. Please give those wishing to, the opportunity to live and work in EU member states. This should only be an \"opt in\" for those wanting to keep the benefits of living within the EU family and would not affect those who do not want to do so.\r\n",
