        "action": "restore the definition of fuel poverty to spending 10% of income",
        "additional_details": "Prof David Gordon of the university of Bristol states that estimates suggest that 20% of the population are now fuel poor and that by the original definition of needing to spend more than 10% of income the numbers of fuel poor have been steadily rising.Rather than being eradicated by 2016 it appears that fuel poverty as debated and voted in parliament has doubled. BBC broadcast their research on \"Panorama; too poor to be warm\" on 21st March 2016.",
        "background": "When parliament voted to end fuel poverty by 2016 the definition of fuel poverty was needing to spend more than 10% of your income. Since then the definition has been changed; this omits people at risk  being included in the figures & makes it unclear whether the target agreed in 2000 is being met. ",
