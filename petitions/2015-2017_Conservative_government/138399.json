        "action": "Immediately introduce legislation to abolish the 15 year voting limit for expats",
        "additional_details": "The Rt Hon David Cameron recently stated that there was an intention to repeal this limit but no time was available before the Referendum. Since the \"Leave\" vote will compel a new programme of legislation when Parliament returns after Recess an opportunity exists to progress this. \r\nA Bill was introduced by Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP (Bill 129 1st \u00efReading 2/12/2014) but failed for lack of time despite strong Conservative support). This should be reintroduced in Government time as a High Priority.",
        "background": "In the recent Referendum vote, many British subjects were prevented from voting on a matter which could potentially affect their lives because they have lived and worked abroad for more than 15 years. This is undemocratic and violates the spirit of the Treaty of Rome. Repeal the 15 year limit now.",
