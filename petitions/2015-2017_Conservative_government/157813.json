        "background": "We call on parliament to block formal notification to the EU of the UK's intention to exit, until the such time as the UK has agreed in principle, through informal negotiation, mutually beneficial trade deals with three other major economies, for implementation immediately on exit from the EU.\r\n\r\n",
