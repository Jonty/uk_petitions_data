        "action": "Revoke the decision to instate Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary",
        "additional_details": "\r\nFirstly, Johnson played a pivotal role in driving home the success of the Leave Campaign, based largely on entirely false claims. Once the results were in, it was evident that he had developed no strategy for a post-EU Britain. Secondly, he is known internationally as a clumsy, uninformed and on occasion offensive diplomat. Given the crucial role that the Foreign Secretary will play over the coming years, we argue that Theresa May should replace Boris Johnson with immediate effect.",
        "background": "We believe that Boris Johnson is unfit to stand as Foreign Secretary at a time when the need for skilled and well-planned diplomacy on behalf of the UK has never been greater.\r\n",
