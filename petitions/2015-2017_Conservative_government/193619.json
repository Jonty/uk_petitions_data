        "additional_details": "Nurses have already been left with a cap on pay rises at 1% which has left nurses with a pay cut of 14% if based on real terms with the cost of living. \r\nMany nurses are going to be faced with sticking to low pay bank rates or leaving the jobs the security of working for a trust and becoming full time agency. \r\nThe RCN has stated that nurses \u201cshould not work bank hours for pay less than their substantive grade\u201d. Some nurses are seeing a \u00a37.50/hour cut when working bank hours. \r\n",
        "background": "This week, the nurses were greeted with news that there would be a restriction on trusts employing agency nurses whose main employment is in their own trust or another NHS trust. \r\nThis was done without consultation and restricts nurses from being able to work in a way that suits them.",
