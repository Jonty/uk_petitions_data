This is OK for decisions for General Elections, for which outcomes and subsequent events can be revisited and reassessed every 4-5 years.  For the referendum on Remain or Leave the European Union, the outcome is irreversible and therefore a MAJORITY of the Electorate should vote for one of the 2 choices.      \r\n\r\nThis petition does not prevent further referendum on this issue in which each side is aiming to get a MAJORITY number of votes for one of the 2 options.  However, once the MAJORITY is achieved then the issue is settled on the option that has achieved the majority.\r\n",
