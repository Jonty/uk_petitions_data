        "additional_details": "CAMHS are already inundated with referrals and are having to turn people away. Yet with the closure of brookside they are going to be under more pressure and local hospitals and crisis teams are going to be stretched out with the lack of hospital beds. There is no beds in the country whilst brookside is open how can this mental health system afford to loose 18 inpatient and 16 day patient beds.\r\nPlease do not let another child be a statistic because there was no safe place.",
        "background": "As you may or not know brookside is temporary closing down and for so many young children and families that is devastation. The unit covers four boroughs and takes referrals from all over the country. There is a waiting list of kids in crisis for this unit and many who need help being discharged.",
