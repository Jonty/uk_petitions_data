        "action": "Stop budget cuts that will put the children of Barnsley in danger.",
        "additional_details": "We are facing huge budget cuts again. The current provider will not provide a service at the greatly reduced budget because they can not provide a safe service but the council will with a huge reduction in health visitors and school nurses. We already know how much pressure our health visitors are under with the number of visits reduced and missed. Do we really want stressed out, rushed and over worked health visitors or worse under underqualified staff assessing our children? Is this fair?",
        "background": "Hundreds of children's life's will be put at risk with the proposed budget cut to Barnsley's health service. It is likely that these cuts will lead to an unsafe service for the children of Barnsley as well as an increase of vulnerable children 'slipping through the the net'. We want it reviewed.",
