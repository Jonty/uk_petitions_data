        "additional_details": "Many young people find school a difficult learning experience, some have the disadvantage of a learning disability, ASD, mental health issues  and or EHC plans which are not fit for purpose, as some young people's progression is slower and requires additional support. Some just have talents that are more vocational. Not everybody is naturally gifted at Maths, English and Sciences.\r\nHowever, the system works to add to their disadvantages by favouring those who are more academic. It is very difficult for these young people to gain access to an apprenticeship because these require a level 1 grade,on completeion, in numeracy and literacy.",
        "background": "We would like to initiate a scheme that allows access to entry level apprenticeships for those who may not achieve a level one qualification, Entry level apprenticeships would give these young people a future within well paid , skilled vocational jobs. \r\n",
