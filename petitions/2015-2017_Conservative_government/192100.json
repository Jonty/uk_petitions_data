        "additional_details": "Mr Blair took UK to war when our country was not fully prepared our troops were sent far too quickly without the proper equipment this has come up time and time again, the British people were not told the full facts of the situation and no matter how enquiries you have we as a nation will never know the truth,  no chemical weapons were found so many lives on both sides were lost needlessly and we are still trying to sort out the mess in both countries today, I am a mother of 2 serving solidiers.",
        "background": "Mr Blair does not have the respect from any serving or past members of the Armed Forces, simple question why does he attend the Cenotaph? is this to ease his conscience for all the heartache he has caused so many families, you ask any of our Forces Families answer : they do not want him there.",
