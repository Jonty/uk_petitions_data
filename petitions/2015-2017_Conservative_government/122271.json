        "action": "Ban publicly accountable bodies from buying through 'middlemen' companies.",
        "additional_details": "The North East Procurement Organisation (NEPO) representing twelve local authorities and others such as Sanctuary Housing group has appointed a single private company called NEPRO which small business must trade through. This outsources responsibility to a private company, prices will rise to pay the middlemen, public money will not be saved. It is another barrier to small business trading with government. It is also bad practice as the middlemen can control trade and who gets opportunities. ",
        "background": "public sector buying organisations should not be able to outsource to larger private companies/buying platforms when dealing with small business. This only enriches the middlemen, prevents barriers to small business and will not produce public savings or improve quality of services. ",
