        "additional_details": "In Britain we pride ourselves living in a growing, equal society. Other countries: Spain, Italy, Australia and New Zealand have changed their policies to allow healthy MSM to donate blood. We should follow in their footsteps as the technology is available to screen MSM beforehand, it would eliminate the risk and open a new donation pool, covering the shortfall of blood donations we need to meet demand. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.healthylives.stonewall.org.uk/for-patients/your-health/blood-donation.aspx",
        "background": "Legislation that was introduced in the UK four decades ago still remains, preventing MSM who have had sex in 12 months to donate blood to the NHS. Currently there is a shortage of 100,000 donors and healthy STI/HIV free men within the LGBTI community could make a huge difference to this number. ",
