        "additional_details": "A 1\u2105 pay increase does not reflect the cost of living. The cheapest food available to a single soldier is rising by 17\u2105 alone with accommodation also increasing. The extra duties placed on the Armed Forces (floods, Olympics, fuel strikes, fire strikes, prison strikes etc) deserve more than the 1\u2105 forced upon us when we are available 24/7. Compare this to MP's pay rises against the amount of time they spend actually working it is unfair and morally wrong.",
        "background": "The Armed Forces have been on a 1\u2105 payrise for the last few years. Although the Government made around 20,000 servicemen redundant they task the Forces more frequently to backfill they're short falls (floods, Olympics etc) while they enjoyed a 11\u2105 pay rise last year and a 1.4\u2105 rise this year.",
