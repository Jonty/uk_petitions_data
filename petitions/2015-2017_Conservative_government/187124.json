        "additional_details": "To be fair foreign address history should be considered or the address history requirement be limited to only the last UK address. If a person is not registered on the Electoral Roll can experience delays when applying for credit, and firms may turn down the application flatly if they can\u2019t confirm where the person lives. An alternative, open register should be available to legal residents of the UK, in order for credit scoring companies and other financial institutions can confirm addresses.",
        "background": "With a large number of migrants currently living in the UK whom are unable to register in the Electoral Roll. I consider is discriminatory to have a negative impact in the credit report due to this factor. Many financial institutions will deny services without 3 years of UK address history. ",
