        "additional_details": "Without access to changing tables, parents often use other surfaces to change diapers -- including restroom floors or counters. These unsanitary conditions can pose health risks. \r\nNo mom or dad should ever have to worry about finding a safe, sanitary place to change their baby. \r\n\r\nRequiring public building, shopping centres, cinemas to have a changing facility accessible to both men and women, promotes health and gender equality.

        "background": "Baby changing facilities in public buildings, cinemas, supermarkets, restarants, shopping centres are traditionally designed in the female's toilets. This tradition does not correpond to the role which fathers play today. ",
