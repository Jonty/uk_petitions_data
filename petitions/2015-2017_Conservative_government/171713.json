        "additional_details": "Agencies don't have to register with the CQC if where they work is already registered. Staff are drawn to agency work as they employ immediately, often without DBS checks & let them work excessive hours in different homes. If we challenge them then they are just moved to another home. We as managers have to use them to fill gaps in our staffing but we wouldn't need to if they played by the same rules and staff were not drawn to quick unregulated employment. Charles G Sadler - Registered Manager",
        "background": "Recruitment in care is becoming a huge issue, every provider now has a problem with agency use. There are enough staff out there but they are working for agencies rather than the regulated Care Homes and Hospitals. It is not a level playing field and staff are drawn to agencies that break the rules.",
