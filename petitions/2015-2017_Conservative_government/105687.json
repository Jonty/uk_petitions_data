        "additional_details": "We have many clean alternatives such as wind power, solar energy etc... and we need to start moving in that direction by restricting production of fossil fuel machines and to invest in faster charging technology and stations. People who do not want to burn fossil fuels are almost forced to do so as public transport isn't efficient enough to meed our working life demands which to me is unacceptable with our capabilities as human beings. Profit is before life on earth and this needs to change.",
        "background": "Fossil fuels are causing so much damage to our eco-system which is now highly threatened with oil companies looking to drill in the Arctic to meet fossil fuel demands which results in extinction of species and rising sea levels that will cause devastation to life on earth as we know it.",
