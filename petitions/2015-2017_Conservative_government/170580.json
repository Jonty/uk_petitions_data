        "action": "Allow a public referendum in Northern Ireland on same sex marriage",
        "additional_details": "The Belfast Telegraph have conducted a survey showing that 83% of people surveyed support same sex marriage. The majority of NI political parties support same sex marriage and a majority vote has ruled in it's favour at Stormont, but as the DUP hold the majority of seats, the conscious clause has stopped this from proceeding. NI is the only area of the British Isles that does not allow same sex marriage and homosexuals are therefore not able to enjoy the same rights as straight married couples",
        "background": "First Minister Arlene Foster has declared she will block campaigns for same sex marriage for the next five years by invoking the conscious clause which is abusing it's original intention. To overcome this, a referendum should take place in Northern Ireland to allow the public to determine this.",
