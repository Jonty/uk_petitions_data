        "additional_details": "University tuition fees in England will rise to \u00a39,250 per year from 2017 and the increase could apply to students who have already started courses. \r\n\r\nAccording to the Offa (Office for Fair Access), 36 universities have been approved to charge the higher fee \u00a39,250 for all subjects, while 121 out of 123 universities with full-time undergraduates plan to charge \u00a39,250 for some of their courses.",
        "background": "Most universities currently hold the right to increase university fees; leaving students who began their degrees expecting to pay one price with the possibility of paying more.\r\n \r\nThe National Union of Students  said institutions thinking of raising fees would be breaking consumer protection laws.
