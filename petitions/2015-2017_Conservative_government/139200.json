        "additional_details": "We have seen Nigel Farage freely admitting \u00a3350m NHS promise 'a mistake', Boris Johnson does not want to turn his back on Europe and states 'no need for haste' to start EU exit negotiations. \r\nSome MPs will say anything to gain a foothold, mislead a population and ruin lives with lies.\r\n\r\nControl measures are required. \r\n\r\nA body such as the Advertising Standards Authority does not allow false claims in adverts, yet MPs can freely say anything without being subject to independent scrutiny.",
        "background": "We have seen a tyranny of lies perpetuated by politicians with little conviction for the causes they are campaigning for. Their sole purpose is to gain political traction to advance their own careers. \r\nBrexit has been foisted upon the UK by MP's with little consideration beyond their own ego.\r\n",
