We\u2019re therefore not sure what you would like the Government or Parliament to change. \r\n\r\nThe Government does provide some help to people with disabilities caused by vaccines. The Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme (VDPS) provides financial help for people whose severe disability was caused by vaccination administered by the National Health Service. The VDPS does not prevent people who have been injured by vaccines from making a claim for compensation against the manufacturer of the vaccine.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. You'll need to give your full name to start a petition.\r\n\r\n"
