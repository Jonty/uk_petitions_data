        "additional_details": "Major reasoning is Misrepresentational Error of the FPTP.\r\n\r\nIn the 2015 UK General Election, the parties gained as follows:\r\nPolitical Party - Votes - Seats\r\n> Conservatives - 37% - 51%\r\n> Labour - 30% - 36%\r\n> Lib Dems - 8% - 1%\r\n> SNP - 5% - 9%\r\n> Greens - % - %\r\n> UKIP - 13% - 0.2%\r\n\r\nThat's a whole 47% misrepresentation error. Not only this but there's no Spoiler Effect, which allows for vote splitting not to happen and smaller parties get to obtain more power in Parliament fairly.",
        "background": "Whilst the AV is still just as susceptible to misrepresentation error, it doesn't obtain 'The Spoiler Effect', meaning bigger parties have to work harder and can't just be complacent anymore.\r\n\r\nThis does however allow better options for third party voters and cuts down overly lazy larger parties.",
