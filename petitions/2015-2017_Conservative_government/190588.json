        "action": "Permanently move both Houses of Parliament out of the 'Westminster Village'.",
        "additional_details": "Valuation Office Agency figures suggest that the average rateable value of office space in Manchester and Birmingham is 128 per metre^2, compared to 462 in Westminster. Many departments are already responding to this challenge by relocating offices out of London. Parliament should follow suit, acquiring better equipped modern premises in provincial cities, which, beside the savings to the taxpayer, would help to remove MPs and Peers from the isolated \"village\" in which they work at present.",
        "background": "In view of modern communications technology, there is no reason for   Parliament and the bulk of the civil service to be concentrated in a small area which is both immensely expensive and isolated from the bulk of the electorate. Let both houses move to more suitable accommodation in other cities.",
