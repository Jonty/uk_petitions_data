        "additional_details": "After the recent EU referendum, it has come to light that key statements made by the leave campaign were false and deliberately misled a portion of the public into voting 'leave', particularly, the \u00a3350m that would be saved if we vote leave.\r\n\r\nAs consumers, we are protected by the trade descriptions act 1968 which prevents companies from making false claims in their advertising. Political voting is an important right, and parties should be held to account for knowingly making false claims. \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Political campaigns that make statements and promises in order to encourage the public in electing a political party to power, or to vote in referendums, should be subject to the same strict oversight as product advertising campaigns are. We should no longer accept 'spin' as an excuse for deception.",
