The government want us to stay in work, but where is the help we all need. I work 24hours a week and my other half is self employed. I cannot afford to work more. Yet I still struggle as over half my wages pay for childcare.",
        "background": "When working parents maternity leave is up many mothers go back to work but have to pay for all childcare costs. Not everyone has family who can help them to reduce the cost. The government want us to work but how can we afford to.",
