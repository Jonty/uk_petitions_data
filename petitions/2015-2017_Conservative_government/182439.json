        "action": "Stop GM wheat planting in the UK!",
        "additional_details": "The Soil Association, GM Freeze (an association of over 30 organisations) and most UK farmers are totally against GM crops. There is no way to confine this to the planting area, as has been proved in the US and most US farmers have stopped planting this as consumers didn't want it.",
        "background": "The Government has given permission for GM wheat crops to be tested again in the UK.  The last time they tried this, it did not work and cost the public \u00a33m.  Birds will pick ears and drop them in non-GM fields, which will make normal wheat infertile and will seriously affect organic farms.",
