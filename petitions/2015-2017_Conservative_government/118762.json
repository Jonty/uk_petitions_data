Clearly intended to be discriminatory,  this MUST NOT be permitted unless EQUAL funding is also provided to the 'LEAVE CAMPAIGN'.",

It is not therefore clear what action your petition would like the Government or Parliament to take. \r\n\r\nThere is more information about this in this briefing prepared by the Electoral Commission, which is responsible for supervising and implementing the regulatory framework for the electoral system:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/190398/EU-Referendum-Bill-HoC-Committee-Stage-Day1-Briefing-2015-06-15.pdf\r\n\r\nYou'll see from this briefing that the existing law \"already provides that referendum campaigners are only able to accept donations over \u00a3500 from certain \u2018permissible\u2019 sources. In general, the permissibility rules provide that funding can only be accepted by referendum campaigners from certain UK-based sources.\" The Electoral Commission also says that \"that the European Commission does not fall within the list of bodies that can register as a campaigner or donate to other referendum campaigners.\"\r\n\r\nThis answer to a parliamentary questions gives more detail about what EU institutions can and cannot do during the campaign:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.parliament.uk/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/commons/2016-01-18/22958\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
