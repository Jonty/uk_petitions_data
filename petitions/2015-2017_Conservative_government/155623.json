No inside activities to help stimulate their minds.\r\nNo supportive conversations to put them at ease. \r\nIf the patients get upset, they just get sedated so they do not have to deal with them.\r\nBeing released before they are even stable, just so they can have the beds. My list and everybody else's is endless. \r\n",
