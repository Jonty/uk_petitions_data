        "additional_details": "My child was severy bullied for a few years I could never get to speak to anyone at schools they was always busy my son was suicidal and he got no support. The problem is never tried to be fixed schools hope it will blow over and go away. Teachers aren't fully trained to look out for signals of a bullied child. I believe a person appointed to solely deal with all aspects of bullying within schools will massively reduce bullying statistics!and give teachers the time to teach! ",
        "background": "I want to try to achieve to get implemented in schools a anti bullying officer/mediator appointed solely for that role in every school... they don't need a teaching degree it would help the children the school and the burden on other teachers. ",
