        "background": "The Cabinet Office has announced that a new 'anti-lobbying' clause will be included in all Government grants from May 2016. This is an attack on academic freedom as it would stop grants for university research being used to influence policy-makers. It is bad for the public interest and democracy.",

The Government will take a decision on the form and wording of the whole clause following this review.\r\n\r\nOur world-class research base is a source of great pride and an engine of growth for this country.  It is not the Government\u2019s intention for the seven Research Councils (1), the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) or the National Academies to be covered by the clause. \r\n\r\nThis, along with the protection of the science budget, further demonstrates the Government\u2019s commitment to sustaining a world-class research base and evidence-based policy making.\r\n\r\nA link to the Cabinet Office update can be found here\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/update-on-a-new-clause-to-be-inserted-into-grant-agreements\r\n\r\n(1) The seven Research Councils include: Arts and Humanities (AHRC), Biotechnology and Biological Sciences (BBSRC), Engineering and Physical Sciences (EPSRC), Economic and Social Research (ESRC), Medical Research (MRC), Natural Environment (NERC), and Science and Technology Facilities (STFC).\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Innovation and Skills",
