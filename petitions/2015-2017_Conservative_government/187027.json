            "details": "The Department of Health\u2019s focus has been on reducing the stillbirth rate.  In November 2015, the Secretary of State for Health announced an ambition to reduce the rates of stillbirths, neonatal deaths, maternal deaths and brain injuries that occur during or soon after birth by 50% by 2030.  To support the NHS in achieving this stretching ambition, the Government also invested:\r\n\u2022\tOver \u00a38 million to roll out training programmes to make sure staff have the skills and confidence they need to deliver world-leading safe care. \r\n\u2022\t\u00a32.24 million fund to support trusts to buy monitoring or training equipment to improve safety. \r\n\u2022\t\u00a3500,000 to develop a new system to be used consistently across the NHS so staff can review and learn from every stillbirth and neonatal death.\r\n\r\nRegarding the registration of stillbirths, the definition of stillbirth is based on the age at which a baby is considered viable.  The Government has no plans to change the definition of stillbirth to include babies born before 24 weeks of gestation.\r\n \r\nWe are guided on this issue by the clinical evidence which shows that, whilst there have been medical advances in caring for premature babies, only a small number of babies born at under 24 weeks gestation survive.\r\n\r\nThere are no plans to change the law so that every woman who has given birth to a stillborn baby has a right to a separate birth certificate and death certificate.  Parents of babies who are stillborn after 24 weeks\u2019 gestation receive a medical certificate certifying the stillbirth and, upon registration, can register the baby's name and receive a certificate of registration of stillbirth.  When a baby is born dead before 24 weeks\u2019 gestation, hospitals may issue a local certificate to commemorate the baby's birth.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Health is aware that some parents find it very distressing that they may not register the birth of a baby born before 24 weeks.  However, it is important to recognise there would also be parents distressed at the possibility of having to do so.  \r\n\r\nHome Office",
