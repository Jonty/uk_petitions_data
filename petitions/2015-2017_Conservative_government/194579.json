Ms Sturgeon must be made to give us a say in our countries future. Not just 16 year olds and people who have only moved there in the last 6 months.",
        "background": "It is unfair that the future of my nation of birth is being decided and i have no input into it. All people born in scotland should have a say. It is unfair and loaded that immigrants and 16 year olds should be the only ones with the right to vote. It should be along the same rules as Brexit.",
