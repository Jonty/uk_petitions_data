        "action": "Keep the UK in the EU. The referendum result was not decisive enough.",
        "additional_details": "We expect parliament to make a carefully considered decision taking all relevant factors into account. The referendum result itself is an important factor, but it's not the only one. Others are: only about 37.4% of the registered electorate voted to leave; a substantial majority of voters aged under 50 voted to remain.\r\n\r\nWhen union members are voting for a public sector strike, the government does not consider a majority vote valid if it is less than 40% of eligible voters.",
        "background": "Parliament called the referendum - therefore the result is the electorate expressing their opinion to parliament. It is not a final decision to leave the EU. It is for parliament to decide whether that result is sufficient to take the momentous step of starting the process of the UK leaving the EU.",
