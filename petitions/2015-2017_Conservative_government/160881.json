        "additional_details": "This government was voted in on David Camerons mandate, now we have voted to leave the EU all this has changed, we now have a PM not voted for by anybody who is now charged with securing our future outside the EU, one of the main reasons for people voting to leave was that unelected officials were deciding our future and imposing their laws,  this must stop and the people should decide",
        "background": "since we voted to leave the EU, we now have PM with her government and new mandate for leaving the EU, we should now have a general election so the people get to decide the way we leave the EU, this will ensure we have in place officials who have been voted in by the British public ",
