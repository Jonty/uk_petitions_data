        "additional_details": "A few apprenticeships to offer up to \u00a3400 a week, although they are a select few that are only open to those with University degrees. Some apprenticeships pay as little as \u00a3125 a week, which is not enough to live on - especially for 40 hours of work a p/w. Furthermore, parents with a child under 18 lose child benefit if their child works more than 24 hours per week. Raising the wage would protect apprentices and ensure that they are financially secure.",
        "background": "Many apprentices earn far less than \u00a34 an hour. I believe this is unfair as they are still in full -time work, yet do not earn enough to live comfortably. Raising the minimum wage for apprentices will create a higher standard for apprenticeships and encourage more people to take part in them.",
