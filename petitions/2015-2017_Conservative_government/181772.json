        "action": "Set a goal of landing a person on the Moon by 2050.",
        "additional_details": "Only a few countries in the world are capable of launching humans into space and sadly neither the UK nor any member states of the European Space Agency have this capability. By setting this goal we will send a clear message to the world that we are still looking to be at the for front of technical innovation and achievement. It will also raise public awareness of the UK's satellite industry and encourage more people to get involved in science and technology.",
        "background": "A lot of people feel that the United Kingdom no longer has a sense of unity or direction in the wake of the EU referendum. Setting this goal would bring it back, as well as boosting industry and encouraging skilled workers to remain in the UK. It would also help our position as part of ESA.",
