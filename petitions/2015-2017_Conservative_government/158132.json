        "additional_details": "The TTIP trade agreement contains one such ISDS clause. The Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Trade In Services Agreement (TISA) have one also. \r\nSecretly negotiated, they ensure foreign corps are able to sue 2/3 of the world's governments and block trade with the emerging economies of China, Brazil, Russia, India and S. Africa. \r\nExamples:\r\nVattenfall vs Germany for phasing out nuclear energy ($3.7bn)\r\nVeolia vs Egypt (introducing a minimum wage)\r\nB.A.T. vs Australia (tobacco advertising laws)\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Investor-State Dispute Settlement clauses in trade deals provide a means for foreign investors to sue governments for policies which harm their profits. If successful, taxpayer money is used to pay damages to them. A government can thus be more beholden to corporations than the public they serve.",
