        "additional_details": "This is democracy, deal with it. There's also a lot of expenses to re opening the vote and campaigns that at the moment we really don't need. I will elaborate the fact again that I couldn't make my mind up because I agreed with both sides. I just feel that once we've voted it's a vote we should stick with it not get upset because we didn't get our own way. ",
        "background": "I feel that the petition against the vote is ridiculous. Everyone that could and wanted to vote voted, it is as simple as that. This won't change much and people are just being sour because they didn't get what they wanted. I didn't mind how the vote turned out, but I will back the countries vote.",
