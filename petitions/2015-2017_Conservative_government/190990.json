        "additional_details": "I am a transgender male student at Caldicot School, South Wales.  Today, after using the male toilets for many months, I was told I HAVE to use the female toilets or go offsite to use the facilities in the local supermarket/leisure centre. \r\n\r\nIf anyone were to be persecuted for being transgender, surely the school should be targeting the transphobia and not the trans individual.\r\n\r\nNot being allowed in their preferred toilet leads to feelings of fear and being uncomfortable; not just for the individual but for all in the facility.  Thus, adding to the plethora of problems and persecution these young people face.",
        "background": "Looking like a male and walking into a female toilet is sure to get some stares.  For transgender pupils up and down the United Kingdom, and around the world, it is one of the most uncomfortable experiences they face on a daily basis.",
