        "action": "Establish a National Museum of Film and Photography in Bradford",
        "additional_details": "The recent decision by the SMG to pass photographic collections to the V&A highlights the absence of a focus by any National Museum on  Photography and Film, and the way in which these disciplines and their roles span across arts and science in documenting society, industry, technology, biography as well as being areas of technological advancement and artistic endeavour.",
        "background": "Film and Photography span the sciences and the arts in the breadth of their contribution to society. A National Museum is needed to document  this from its start in 19th century to its continuing powerful role in the visual age of the 21st century.",
