        "additional_details": "George Osborne has planned \u00a312 billion of welfare cuts, with a large % being cut from Tax Credits. Equating to around \u00a3500 - \u00a31,000 per year, per claim.\r\n\r\nTax Credit cuts will leave many families below the poverty line. Many parents will be left to choose between paying the rent and feeding their family. No parent or family should have to make these decisions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Cuts to Working Tax Credits and Child Tax Credits will leave thousands of families worrying how they will afford basic essentials. \r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to stand against the Tax Credit cuts.",
