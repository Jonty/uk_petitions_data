Obviously once airborne balloons/lanterns aren't bound by local govt areas. \r\nThe issue needs national law in order to protect the whole of the UK environment from this needless & extremely harmful litter.\r\n\r\nInfo:\r\nwww.balloonsblow.org\r\nwww.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/litter",

Once released balloons/lanterns return to earth (or sea); where they endanger wildlife & livestock, either by entanglement or being mistaken as a food source.",
