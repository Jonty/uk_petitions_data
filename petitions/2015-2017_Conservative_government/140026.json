        "additional_details": "Democracy is not rock paper scissors or best of 3's, we have spoken and wish to leave the EU. Remainers have gone as far as saying old people don't have a right to vote and that leave voters based their votes on lies.  This is not the case and we cannot assume the first 24 hours is a fair outline for what the future holds for Britain. We must be vigilant and stand together more now than ever, but if their petition is heard without argument we stand a good chance of an unfair undemocratic revote!",
        "background": "Just a day after the Eu#ref a good percentage of the EU#remain voters have spat the dummy out and created a petition to revote claiming that the leave voters were lied too.  With over a 100,000 signatures their petition must be looked at by our government. Lets make sure that we are still heard!!!",
