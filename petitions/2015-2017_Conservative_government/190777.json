        "action": "Abolish Stamp Duty Land Tax in England and Wales",
        "additional_details": "(a)SDLT creates distortions in the Labour Market as it creates a disincentive for household mobility and job relocation, and as a result people may be in a job that is not best suited to their skill set. (b) SDLT effectively is a 'barrier to entry' into the housing market, which creates inequality in home ownership between the 'haves' and 'have-nots'. (c) SDLT does not have any theoretical basis and it is an outdated pragmatic tax that is not in line with the modern real world economy.",
        "background": "After undergoing a lot of research into the origins, purpose, effectiveness, economic merits and downfalls of SDLT, the overall conclusion is that this is an outdated tax system that does not serve the Labour and Housing Markets any merit and needs to be abolished for a variety of reasons below.",
