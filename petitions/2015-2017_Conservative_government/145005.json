        "action": "Hold a General Election and elect a new PM prior to Article 50 being triggered",
        "additional_details": "Electing a new government prior to Article 50 being triggered would give people the ability to vote for a party who would stop Article 50 being triggered without another referendum being held. Many people voted to leave the EU on lies and false information and without fully understanding the impact on our economy. This petition could allow the people to stop the United Kingdom from being removed from the EU with stronger referendum rules.",
        "background": "The UK economy has now officially destabilised. With the PM's resignation and the amount of cabinet members who have resigned, the government that was elected in the General Election in 2015 has materially changed. The people should therefore have the ability to select a new government.",
