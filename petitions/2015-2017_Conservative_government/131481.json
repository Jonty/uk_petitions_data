The Government has no intention of making it a criminal offence to wear face coverings.\r\n\r\nWhere face coverings are used for the purpose of concealing identity, section 60AA of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 provides police officers with the power to remove them.  The police may also remove face coverings during a stop and search or following an arrest.  The Government considers these powers to be both proportionate to citizens\u2019 civil liberties and sufficient to allow the police to protect the public from harm.\r\n\r\nHome Office",
