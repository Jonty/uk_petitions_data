        "additional_details": "The BBC is envied and admired worldwide as the most independent, impartial broadcaster and innovative programme maker so let's prevent this precious organisation from becoming fragmented and sponsor driven, where the only reason for producing any programme is financial return. How much of their history, drama, ballet, opera, dance and astronomy have reached our screens if that were the only criteria.  Yes, there's rubbish, but overall their output is amazing, surely that's worth fighting for. ",
        "background": "The Tories hate the BBC, they want to change, weaken and eventually flog it off, piecemeal. They can't control or manipulate it to their own political uses so they'll slowly dismantle it bit by bit, like the NHS and hope we don't notice. It's not perfect, but it's the best there is, and it's ours. ",
