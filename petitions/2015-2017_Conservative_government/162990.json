        "additional_details": "Charities, voluntary organisations and social enterprises desperately need Tier 2 skilled workers, especially in IT etc, but can't match  private or civil sector salaries to entice the best workers.\r\nIt is impossible for a Tier 2 worker to switch to a Tier 5 route, which forbids a permanent job.\r\nThe Home Office must ask the Migration Advisory Committee to research the possibility of including third sector workers on the SOL.\r\nFind out moreat stop35k.org",
        "background": "Tier 2 skilled workers must meet a \u00a335k p/a salary threshold to remain in the UK. This makes it impossible for them to work in 3rd sector roles.\r\nThe Shortage Occupation List has been used to prevent nurses being removed from the UK. It must now be used to save charity workers, and charities.",
