        "background": "The UK's Veterans are faced with difficult housing solutions on discharge, if they are able to find work they shouldn't have the worry of finding the suitable housing they DESERVE.\r\nI am petitioning for ex forces personnel who have served on operations to have access to a 100% Govt Backed mortgage.",
