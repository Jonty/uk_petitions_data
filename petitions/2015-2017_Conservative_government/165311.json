        "additional_details": "British Waters are one of only a few that don\u2019t require a license to operate leisure craft on the water, nor is there any regulation on being under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Most European countries, Australia and the USA all require a license to operate a vessel on the water. The US Coastguard name alcohol in their top five contributing factors of accidents. \r\nLives at sea matter. We have legislation for our roads, why not our waters. \r\nFor more info: www.facebook.com/makeourwaterssafe",
        "background": "The Railways & Transportation Safety Act of 2003 in Section 80 already starts to cover the control of being under the influence, all it needs is to be signed by the Minister of Shipping (Robert Goodwill MP) for it to be enforced. This can then also be expanded into licensing watercraft.",
