        "action": "Legalise the pharmaceutical production of THC for medicinal purposes.",
        "additional_details": "The argument against this is the fear of drug abuse - which is already unregulated and rife. Unlike alcohol and tobacco; there is no evidence of overdose, violence or suicide under the influence of THC. It's neuropathic relaxants enhance endorphins.\r\nIn legalising the pharmaceutical production, companies can create a medicated and prescribable form of THC which can be monitored and managed by clinicians.\r\nPresently, there are no controls and those in medical need suffer in desperation.",
        "background": "Across the world THC has been proven to benefit a massive range of medical issues, from Anxiety disorders to Parkinson's disease. It is a neuropathic relaxant and can give those in need more control therefore enhancing their wellbeing, independence and reduces the use of other treatments.\r\n",
