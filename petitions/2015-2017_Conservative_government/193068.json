The infection from the back was very severe and he has spent 3 weeks recovering including one full week in the vets where they have had to flush out the wound every day. There isn't much legally we can do to get the owners of the cat to ensure that their cat doesn't attack our cats again in our own home. But we want to change this!",

But there is nothing legally we can do to ensure the owners stop the cat from enterting our home or attacking our cats! We want to raise awareness that this can happen! ",
