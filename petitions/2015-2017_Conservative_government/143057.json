        "additional_details": "Both the Leave and Remain campaigns have reneged on numerous promises made before the 2016 EU Referendum. It is evident that the entire structure of the country from health to commerce will be adversely affected by the ignorance of the government and Prime Minister. The generation affected the most should be allowed a vote in any referendum. I should add that in proposing this petition I was informed that a similar petition already exists; however, it doesn't. This is, therefore, a new petition.",
        "background": "General Public were purposefully misguided before 2016 EU Referendum.The lies that both Leave and Remain campaigns told have now been widely acknowledged as such, and it is only reasonable that the public should be allowed to vote with full knowledge of the consequences of a vote to leave the EU\r\n",
