        "additional_details": "We believe that dishonest claimants need removing from the benefit system however dishonest assessments don't solve this problem. \r\nIf as many claim there is no dishonesty from the medical assessors then getting the organisations to pay for the cost of sucessful appeals should not affect them (DWP still covering the cost of unsucessful ones).\r\nIf we are right and false medical assessments are causing a rise in appeals then they should be paid for by those causing them instead of the taxpayer. ",
        "background": "There are serious concerns about the honesty of medical assessments completed for the purposes of PIP & ESA benefits. \r\nDishonest medical assessments have serious negative health consequences for many sick and disabled people, some who decide death/suicide is a better option than the appeal system.",
