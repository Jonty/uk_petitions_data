        "action": "Reverse Philip Hammond's decision to abolish Class 2 NICs",
        "additional_details": "These measures unfairly target self employed people under the small earnings threshold who make less than \u00a36,000 a year. People who are forced to work part-time due to caring responsibilities, children, old age or disability, or in low paying sectors such as the arts, will need to find an extra \u00a3600 a year, or else lose entitlement to their state pension. These workers have no access to employer subsidised work pensions and any provision for retirement they make already costs twice as much. ",
        "background": "Philip Hammond proposes to abolish Class 2 National Insurance Credits, a move which targets the lowest self-employed earners - many of whom make only a few thousand pounds a year - and will force them to increase NIC payments by 400-500% in order to preserve their State Pension. This is unfair.",
