        "additional_details": "Diseases such as HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis B & C are by no means confined to the gay male community, and therefore an equal policy for everyone should be adopted, one that makes a case-by-case decision based on sexual behaviour, rather than sexuality. \r\n\r\nUnder this policy, any person who has had protected or monogamous sex would be allowed to donate. Scientific advancements also dictate that the deferral period for 'risky' sexual behaviour should be reviewed and reduced, and not confined to gay men.",
        "background": "The discriminatory ban on homosexual men giving blood has no place in an equal society.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, call on the Government to end the 12 month deferral ban on gay men donating blood, and replace it with an equal and individual risk assessment based process for all blood donors.",
