        "action": "Re-hold the EU referendum allowing 16 and 17 year olds to vote.",
        "additional_details": "According to a survey by ICM, 75% of 16 and 17 year olds voted in the Scottish Independence referendum - in comparison to 54% of 18 - 24 year olds. At the age of 16 a person can legally marry, enlist in the UK armed forces and pay National Insurance. It is therefore abhorrent that 16 and 17 year olds were disallowed from having their say in what is irrefutably one of the most important referenda in their lifetimes.",
        "background": "16 and 17 year olds are one of the groups which the outcome of the referendum will affect the most, as they will have to live with the consequences for the longest. It is therefore objectionable that they were deprived of the right to vote in the first EU referendum.",
