        "background": "BSL is a law that bans OR restricts certain types of dogs based on their appearance, usually because they are perceived as \"dangerous\" dogs.\r\n\r\nBSL does not take into account how the owner has raised, trained or managed the dog. It does not take in to account the dogs actual behaviour. ",
