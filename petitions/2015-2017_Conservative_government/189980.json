        "additional_details": "It would appear to be impossible to continue to expect our public services to continually increase the level of service required in Education, Health and Social Care and changing the aim and culture of Police and the Prison service whilst continuing to expect to pay less tax to fund them .\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is time to understand what services are required and the true cost of supplying them  ",
        "background": "We want our public services to be effective and available, constant  tinkering by  political parties and \"spin\" when answering questions have not helped. If we all knew the real size of the problem and the actions required to correct it then it would be easier to have the necessary public debate.",
