        "additional_details": "My personal experience with my local CFS service has been extremely poor, I was 16 when diagnosed and until I was 18 I was seen 3 times be a children's OT. All that my local CFS service offers is an initial information session (the information was mostly wrong), an initial assessment and a 6 week managing life styles group, this is completely contradictory to the NICE guideline. And they do not offer CBT or GET, 2 of the 3 treatments recommended by NICE. This is not the only service like this!",
