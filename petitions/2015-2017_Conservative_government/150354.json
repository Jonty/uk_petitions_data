        "additional_details": "It's clear now looking back on all the propaganda sent out by the Leave campaign that they were scaremongering and we can now see that the \u00a3's value is plummeting and businesses are pulling out of the UK just as the Remain campaign predicted. \r\nIt is also clear that promises that were made on the Leave side will not be fulfilled as politicians u-turn.  \r\nWe want to change our vote to Remain or hold another referendum before it's too late to change this decision that was made on bad information.  \r\n",
        "background": "We the undersigned believe that we were mislead by a power struggle within Government for the place of Prime Minister. This clouded the debate and we the people were not provided with a TRUE representation of what leaving the EU would mean. We demand the opportunity to change our vote. ",
