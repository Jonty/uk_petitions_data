        "additional_details": "Following a report found here http://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/eu-sub-com-d/food-waste-prevention/154.pdf the UK wastes a shocking amount of food per year. Let us make it a criminal offence for supermarkets to dispose of food just because it is not cosmetically perfect.\r\n\r\nInstead of disposing of it, they should look to donate it to food banks and charities who will help feed the homeless and hungry.",
        "background": "The House of Lords conducted an inquiry into the amount of food wasted in EU and from that inquiry, it emerged that a staggering 200m tonnes of food is wasted by Asda, Co-operative Food, M&S, Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Waitrose.\r\n\r\nLet us make it a criminal offence to waste food.",
