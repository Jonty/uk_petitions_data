        "additional_details": "Rental allowances from benefit are capped and often fall short of the required amount- which then has to be topped up from benefits- often leaving individuals with less than \u00a360 a week for all their needs (food, toiletries, transport, household goods etc) This is inhuman treatment of the most vulnerable in our society who need our help and support.The allowances should be kept and increased yearly in line with the cost of living index.",
        "background": "The present efforts by the government to attack the poorest and most vulnerable in our society must stop.I work with both the disabled and the homeless who do not have a voice. Help me and sign this petition to be their voice.",
