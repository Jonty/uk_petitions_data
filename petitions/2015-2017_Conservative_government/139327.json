        "additional_details": "Leaving the European Union will change British rights, politics, law and society. But these changes will be determined by which political parties guide the UK through this historic period.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, less than 1 in 4 eligible voters gave the Conservative Party the mandate to govern all. With the resignation of David Cameron, the face of the Conservatives and our government will change.The people need the opportunity to elect representatives to make Brexit their own.",
        "background": "The people of the UK, not the Conservative Party, should decide what Brexit means for the future of our economy and society. It is not democratic that the 143,000 members of the Tory Party will decide the fate of the 64 million Britons. They will decide what Brexit means for 21st century Britain.",
