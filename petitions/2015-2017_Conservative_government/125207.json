        "action": "Scrap handwriting requirement for highest writing grade at primary school",
        "additional_details": "Pupils cannot be graded as writing above the expected standard at 11 yrs old unless they meet handwriting requirements of 'producing legible joined handwriting' and 'maintaining legibility, fluency and speed in handwriting through choosing whether or not to join specific letters.' The handwriting requirement is being placed above all mention of creativity and it's only the highest grade that has this handwriting veto. There are similar handwriting restrictions for talented writers at 7 as well.\r\n",
        "background": "Talented, creative writers in primary school are being denied the opportunity to be acknowledged as such by their handwriting. Their flair and ability to engage and entertain a reader is considered of less worth than their ability to join up their handwriting. Sign now to stop this travesty.",
