        "additional_details": "Broadcasting a range of geopolitical opinion from multiple sources, without favouritism, is in the best interests of the British people, to make rational decisions not based on fear, but on facts. Instead of delivering the news, it has become a pandering to the nation's popular opinion, or based upon the self interests of those in power and this is completely undemocratic. We the signed wish to see a return to impartial broadcasting where ever possible.",
        "background": "The news in this country has lost its sense of impartiality in news broadcasting. No longer does it provide a range of views, but instead broadcasting has begun to tell the people what to think. A prime example of this has been within the referendum itself.",
