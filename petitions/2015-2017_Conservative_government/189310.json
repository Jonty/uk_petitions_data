        "additional_details": "The House of Lords has just voted 2 amendments onto the Article 50 Bill. It looks like the Government and their tiny majority are now likely to be defeated in the Commons and the prime minister's hands will then be tied during negotiations.\r\nI am NOT prepared to see ourselves enter 2 years of negotiation, knowing that the other side has an incentive to offer us the worst deal possible for it to be rejected by parliament.\r\nTheresa May - let's put off Article 50 by 6-8 weeks and go to the country.",
        "background": "In order to stop the divisive arguing over what kind of form Brexit should take, the PM needs to call an election (by repealing the FTP Act). As polls suggest, Theresa May would be swept back to No. 10 with a hugely increased majority, and this time with a mandate for her Brexit plans.\r\n",
