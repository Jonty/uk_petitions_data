A weighted voting system would ensure that people with more in-depth knowledge would have more say in the country's future.",
        "background": "Politically free information leaflets should be sent out to people before referendums. Voters would be tested for their knowledge of the actual referendum before registering their votes. Their vote would be weighted depending on their referendum-knowledge.",
