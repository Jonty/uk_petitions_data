        "additional_details": "It is estimated that an increase in breastfeeding could save the UK upwards of \u00a340 million per year just in the treatment of 5 illnesses, illnesses that would be less prevalent with an increase in breastfeeding.  Breastfeeding reduces the risks of gastroenteritis, inner ear infections, respiratory infections, asthma, allergies, diabetes and obesity for children.  It also reduces the risk of breast and ovarian cancers for the breastfeeding woman.  Health benefits that cannot be ignored.",
        "background": "There is a robust International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes, however the UK chose to only implement parts of this code, not the full code. This has left loopholes in the law enabling formula companies to continue marketing to parents with infants aged 6 months and under.",
