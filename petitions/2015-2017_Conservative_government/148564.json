        "additional_details": "I believe the resignation of Cameron was the correct decision on his behalf. I, however, do not believe that this means we must accept the leader chosen to replace him by the Conservative Party\r\n\r\nThis referendum has engaged many more people in politics and political discussions. I think we should now seriously consider how we want these negotiations to unfold and who we want representing us when this occurs",
        "background": "With the Brexit result I am concerned about the negotiations that we will have to face. I think the party who go into these negotiations should be chosen by the people. We have decided on this vote and to have a leader chosen for us by the Conservative Party, without our input, is unacceptable",
