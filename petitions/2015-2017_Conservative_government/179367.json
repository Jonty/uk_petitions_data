        "additional_details": "The recent ban on immigration from certain countries, the president's historical and contemporary contempt for women and minorities and the administration's approach to international affairs risks creating a world of intolerance, injustice and political instability. To be associated with such a country and to seek to increase our ties with such a country will inevitably lead to condemnation of the UK and as such denigrates us in the eyes of our neighbours. As such, it should not be tolerated.",
        "background": "The incumbent administration in the United States represents views and policies which are directly at odds with the values of the British people. Until such concerns are alleviated, the United Kingdom should avoid closer trading ties for fear of being labelled as complicit.",
