        "additional_details": "I was born with one eye and head neck and facial disfigurement I had driven for 30 years I was legal to drive until DVLA changed their policies in 2013. The condition is congenital and is a non degenerative condition. Therefore the only change is DVLA policies. The machine (esterman vision test) that DVLA use to assess people's vision for driving was not designed to assess people's ability to drive it was to detect glaucoma. Due to my disfigurement the machine isn't fit for purpose.",
        "background": "DVLA legislations states that people who are monocular are exempt from exceptional circumstances in their medical section. ",
