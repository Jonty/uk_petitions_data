        "additional_details": "The data shows that in the recent EU referendum, the decision to leave had most support from the 60+ age group, and least support from the 18-24 age group. Given that the younger generation will have to live with the consequences of such decisions for many more years than pensioners, and that the number of UK pensioners is predicted to go on growing in future, something must be done to control the size of the 'silver vote' in relation to the working population as a whole.",
        "background": "The UK population is ageing and there is a danger that the outcome of referenda and elections will become increasingly skewed, to the detriment of the younger working population as a whole, unless an upper age limit to vote is introduced.",
