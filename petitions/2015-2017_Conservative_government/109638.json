        "additional_details": "Example: I bought a van end of June 2015 and paid direct debit,( I had to pay for the whole of june tax) on 1st July it was written off and insurance took the van and documents. on 3rd July DVLA took a double payment for June & July. a week later I bought another van and had to pay for whole of July again, asked for a refund on old van, they said NO.\r\nSo in total over a 2 week period, I had to pay 3 months ROAD TAX.\r\nThen for fun they cancel your direct debit on the new van and don't tell you !!!",
        "background": "If you buy a vehicle on the first of the month, then you must pay for the whole month road tax.\r\nIf you sell a vehicle on the first of the month, then you still must pay for the whole month road tax and you will not receive a refund.\r\nThe new owner also has to pay road tax for that month !",
