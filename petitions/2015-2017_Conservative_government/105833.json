        "action": "Make telematics insurance policies compulsory for all drivers.",
        "additional_details": "One last point, word has it that on dual carriage ways, motorways etc, by switching lanes the average speed cameras are ineffective as each is only focused on that particular lane. \r\nSo the cameras effectiveness in that regard needs to be reviewed. \r\nI'm also a believer that it's unfair we should all be penalised and paying for the uninsured drivers on the road. Sign my petition to make it law for every insurance policy to have plug and drive telematics and receive a discount for good driving",
        "background": "We're all guilty of it.. We slow down when we see a cash generating speed camera, then the mph creeps back up again. Our roads would be made much more safer by installing more average speed cameras across the country, ensuring everyone keeps to the limit, not just for 100 yards.",
