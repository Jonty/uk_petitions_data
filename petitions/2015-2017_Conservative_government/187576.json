        "additional_details": "All the people i have spoken to ,just tell me how the money is spent.but that is not my argument .\r\nA privately owned fishery ,covers all the cost ,stocking ,upkeep etc.and the people I have spoken to tell me they get no help at all from the Environmental Agency.\r\nTo me i see this as just another tax on the Angler .and a tax we should not have to pay.\r\nIt's easier to send a couple of guys in a van to a fishery ,then have them patrol England's coast line looking for anglers .\r\n ",
        "background": "After 20+ years of sea fishing ,I moved into fly fishing approx 3 years ago. And for the first time I required a fishing licence. Why ? I never needed one for sea fishing ,I started to ask questions and sent my local MP a letter asking for the reasons why I needed one.\r\n",
