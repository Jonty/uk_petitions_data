        "action": "Have a second referendum along Scottish rules allowing all UK residents to vote",
        "additional_details": "It is unconscionable to hold a referendum that disenfranchised so many people who are legally resident in the UK long-term or who hold British nationality, but live abroad, often in the European Union. As our lives (and the legal status of our British children's citizenship) will be altered by triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, we demand a new referendum with an appropriate franchise and rules requiring a supermajority to pass.",
        "background": "The recent Brexit referendum had a very skewed and badly reasoned franchised. This disenfranchised European nationals living in Britain, British nationals living abroad for longer periods of time, and extra-European nationals who are legal resident in the UK to vote. Many of us have minor children. ",
