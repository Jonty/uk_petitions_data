        "additional_details": "In 2015 British Summer Time ends on 25 October - 58 days before the solstice. However it doesn't begin again until 27 March 2016 -  96 days after the solstice.\r\n\r\nI propose we make the change symmetrical - meaning that clocks would go forward around Sun 21 February.\r\n\r\nTypical BST sunrise/sunset times would then be 0812 and 1828. \r\n\r\nThis gives us a sunrise which is not unreasonably late and a sunset which is pleasantly late as early as 21 February - boosting morale and improving public safety.\r\n",
        "background": "There is evidence that Daylight Saving Time  has beneficial effects, but also that keeping it in place all year round would cause adverse effects in the extreme North of Britain.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to put the clocks forward in February instead of March - giving us late sunsets 5 weeks sooner.",
