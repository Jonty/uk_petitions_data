        "action": "Create a framework for PSHE in KS4",
        "additional_details": "The Governments guidance to delivering PSHE instructs teachers to tailor lessons to 'suit the needs of pupils', which seems to ignore the diversity of students and that once they have left school they may face different types of problems. The diversity of sexual orientations in sexual education is often ignored, what to do in an area with high crime rates, how to get a loan or mortgage or how to be a parent should you become a young parent. These are just a few things that need to be improved. ",
        "background": "Presently, PSHE is a compulsory but non-statutory subject, meaning that although  it has to be taught, it is fully flexible with the content of which is taught. Having now left school, and be in an environment that is completely different I feel very unprepared for a variety of situations. ",
