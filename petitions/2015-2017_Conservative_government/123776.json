        "additional_details": "We thank our City Council and central Government for recognising that there should be Fairer Funding from 2016/17 onward. But sadly it is not enough. We are making a reasonable demand. We are asking Central Government to apply the Fairer Funding formula for the previous 2 years and include the social care precept. If they do so Birmingham will be \u00a398m better off in 2017/18.",
        "background": "We are people who live and work in Birmingham. We believe that austerity is a political choice, not an economic necessity. Our Council services must be better funded. Wealthier areas than Birmingham face fewer cuts. Oxfordshire is cut by 10%. Devon is increased by 8%. Birmingham is cut by 32%. ",
