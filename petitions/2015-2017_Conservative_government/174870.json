        "additional_details": "I lost one of my twin girls to TTTS at 19 weeks and although I will never forget my girl, she will never be truly recognised as a baby by law because she died before 24 weeks. It hurts me daily knowing I will never have that certificate to prove her existence to her twin sister, I would do anything to be able to see my little girl recognised. Just 1 little piece of paper might seem like nothing but for someone who has lost their beautiful baby it could mean the world. 1 signature costs nothing.",
        "background": "I'm starting this petition to try make it so all babies can be registered from 16 weeks and death certificates can be given even if the baby never took a breath. \r\nPlease help me to make this happen, it would mean so much to so many people who have been in the same situation as myself. Thank you. ",
