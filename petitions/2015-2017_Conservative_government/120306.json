In order to minimise the chances of Moonlight spoiling the effect (or of cloud), this could be done on Easter Monday or May Day (or possibly both), with a degree of \"fluidity\" as to which is chosen, dependent on the position of the Moon that year.",
        "background": "In the UK, few people get to see the true beauty of the night sky. I propose that, on a night when it is safe to do so, the country should turn off as many street lights at midnight as possible in an effort to eliminate \"light pollution\"",
