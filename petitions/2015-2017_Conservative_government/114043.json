        "additional_details": "To obtain the licence I feel a mental and physical analysis should be carried out in order to show a persons capability of caring for their pet, depending on the recommended needs and lifestyle of the animal.\r\n\r\nAlso a CRB check should be mandatory that prevents anyone with a history of violence or drug/alcohol abuse from obtaining a licence.\r\n\r\nThe licence should be reviewed quarterly and the owner to be reassessed.",
        "background": "Animal abuse is a serious problem that needs to be dealt with immediately.\r\n\r\nAs a solution, I propose that it be a legal requirement to obtain a licence for the purchase, owning and/or housing of any type of animal.",
