        "additional_details": "We propose that time should be allocated on a weekly or fortnightly basis for pupils to volunteer for a cause in their local community. \r\n\r\nWhilst it is of benefit to the people that they are helping, volunteering can also be highly beneficial to those who participate in doing it. \r\n\r\nWe are petitioning the government and Nicky Morgan MP, the education secretary to allocate time in the school timetable for children to experience the benefits of volunteering on a regular basis.",
        "background": "School subjects are important. However, volunteering can teach children skills that they can't learn in the classroom. \r\n\r\nIf kids start volunteering when they are young, they are much more likely to continue doing so as an adult.",
