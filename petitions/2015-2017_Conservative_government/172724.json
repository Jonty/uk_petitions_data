        "additional_details": "With Brexit, the development of HS2, the northern powerhouse and other regional investments, a massive project like re-locating the seat of our democracy to the regions would create huge opportunities. Business and industry often follow politics and one would hope that the same could be said if the Houses of Parliament were to re-locate to any of the regions.",
        "background": "Government is considering a multi billion pound refurbishment of the Houses of Parliament. It would seem that now would be an ideal opportunity to relocate from this outdated building and move to a more central location within the UK, near Manchester for example.\r\n",
