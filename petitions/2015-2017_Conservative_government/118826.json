        "action": "Offer Government finance to first time buyers who don't qualify for a mortgage.",
        "additional_details": "Banks make it incredibly difficult for first time buyers to purchase a home, even if they have a deposit.\r\nSelf-employment, minor blemishes on a credit report, or the lack of a parent to guarantee a mortgage makes things extremely difficult for first time buyers.\r\nIt would also 'Balance the books' for the government/treasury, as the property would be owned by the government until the final payment was made. Only then would ownership be transferred to the buyer.",
        "background": "I propose for the government to offer direct financing to first-time buyers to enable them to purchase a home.\r\nThe loan is then to be paid back to the government monthly, \r\njust as a mortgage would.\r\nA deposit would still be required, so that the buyer has a vested interest in the property.",
