        "action": "To introduce driverless trains onto the London Underground network.",
        "additional_details": "The newer stock of tube trains are able to stop and start by themselves so the infrastructure for driverless trains on the London Underground is there. Platform safety isn't a problem as the safety doors that are currently on the Jubilee line extension could be fitted on the rest of the network. Also the money saved from having to pay drivers wages and the effect that this strike action causes on the London economy makes this more than economically viable it makes it essential.",
        "background": "Due to the London Undergound unions constantly holding the city to ransom we believe that they haven't shown the commitment necessary to keep London moving. Many cities inc Tokyo have driverless trains operating quite safely, and the DLR shows this is more than possible in London.",
