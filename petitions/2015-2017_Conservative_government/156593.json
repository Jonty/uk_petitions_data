        "action": "Reject Article 50 Withdrawal from the EU and Implement FULL BREXIT",
        "additional_details": "The only sure way for Britain to leave the EU is for Parliament to repeal the European Communities Act 1972. This immediately returns supremacy of law to Parliament, and frees us from EU control. Chaos would not ensue because all EU Directives, which have been transposed into Acts of Parliament, would remain. These can be repealed gradually, leaving laws we might need to interact with the EU. Article 50 keeps the EU in control. Repeal of the European Communities Act puts Parliament in control.",
        "background": "On the 23rd June 2016 17.4 million people voted for Brexit. It is clear the campaign was fought on taking back control of sovereignty, democracy, finances and borders. Article 50 is designed to make the UK accept EU terms of exit. This is not what the electorate had in mind when they voted.\r\n",
