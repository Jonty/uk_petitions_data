        "additional_details": "Mental health patients should not be ignored and this is something I am very passionate about. This is an illness that is not often visible and can often be neglected. I am starting this petition to guarantee all mental health patients receive the on going care they require and deserve. Neglecting a MH patient will only cause their illness to deteriorate. ",
        "background": "I am a MH patient and received great support when living in Corby. Fantastic Drs who were always hands on and regularly seeing a psychiatrist. I moved to London November 2016 and trying to find support has been horrendous. Support should never stop unless your psychiatrist signs you off. ",
