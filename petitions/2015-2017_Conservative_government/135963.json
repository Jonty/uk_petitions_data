        "additional_details": "The Yulin dog meat festival & the Asian dog meat trade focuses on farming dogs for consumption. Many dogs are rammed into tiny cages, distorted & left to weaken. Dogs are happy animals & it is believed that their happiness & good health is passed onto those who eat them. The perpetrators think that torturing the dogs by blow torching them whilst still alive then battering their heads, also makes the meat more tender. Videos & live Facebook appearances notably by Ricky Gervais are ref points. ",
        "background": "I was physically sick when I saw a video on Facebook depicting the torturing to death of dogs for human consumption. The dogs are kept in horrific conditions, frightened & unaware of the barbaric fate that awaits them. There is absolutely nothing humane in the way they are treated. It is abhorrent. ",
