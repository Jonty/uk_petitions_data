It is unacceptable that the country should be run by an unelected politician. \r\n\r\nThe Fixed Term Parliament Act does not allow for a general election before 2020 unless there is a majority vote of no confidence in the government.\r\n\r\nThe current government, led by the Prime Minster, clearly has no ability to effectively run the country following the EU referendum.\r\n\r\nEven when a new leader of the Conservative Party is appointed, they would not have the mandate of the British electorate. A fresh general election is needed.",
