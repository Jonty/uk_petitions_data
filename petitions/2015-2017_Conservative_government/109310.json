        "additional_details": "Our N.H.S is on its knees,yet you are bringing in Refugees who are going to deplete it even further. Education,local councils and many others are in the same position yet we read daily of how much more you are giving away. People on housing waiting lists are told there are no homes,yet we have plenty for non British. Why are you sending aid when these people are coming here daily and getting assistance here when they arrive, we,the British public pay twice. Why did so many grandfathers fight\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "British people are told we are in austerity measures yet you keep upping the amount we give away to foreign countries. You spend like it is coming out of your own pocket and ignore pleas off British people who desperately need help first,all the while making cuts left right and centre to the British",
