        "additional_details": "Some belief systems may help people but assessing whether the beliefs themselves achieve benefit is subjective.  Public money through gift aid should not be available for this. Religious organisations should have to show other public benefit to qualify as charity and should only be allowed to use public money for that other purpose. ",
        "background": "The law recognises the advancement of religion as a charitable purpose. Religion includes all faiths and none  it includes a religion that does not have a belief in God. Advancing any belief system alone should not be considered charitable activity. ",
