        "additional_details": "The result of the referendum was not a reflection of the facts surrounding EU membership. The people have spoken on something based on emotive misinterpretation, exaggeration and understatement on both sides of the argument.\r\n \r\nIt would be irresponsible of government to invoke article 50 and hence commence withdrawal from the European Union until a more considered education is complete.\r\n\r\nThat could only come through a second, measured and educational campaign, followed by a second referendum.\r\n",
        "background": "The purpose of the referendum on 23rd June 2016 was to allow government to gauge the opinion of the people on membership of the European Union. \r\n\r\nThis petition asserts that the referendum campaign has failed to educate the British people sufficiently for them to offer a learned opinion.  \r\n",
