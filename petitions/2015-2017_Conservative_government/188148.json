Large numbers of permanent residency applications are currently rejected. If your application is rejected you get a letter from the home office telling you to prepare to leave. No EU country is doing this to British citizens living there.\r\n",

Please do so immediately.\r\n\r\nThose living here are people - parents, partners, friends, colleagues - who contribute hugely to our society. Don't treat them as bargaining chips. It is unnecessary and unfair to do so.",
