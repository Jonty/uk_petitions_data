        "additional_details": "The Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland cannot be considered impartial. He and his family are deeply embedded with Sinn Fein/IRA. That fact alone should be enough to expose these prosecutions to be malicious, political attacks on behalf of the gangsters that maintained a thirty-year campaign against the laws of all the peoples of the United Kingdom. That campaign is ongoing, and these persecutions are just another form of attack.\r\n",
        "background": "The recent arrests directed against former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland are not an attempt at bringing criminals to account for their crimes. These arrests are political in their intent with the purpose of undermining the confidence of the UK Government and its armed forces. \r\n\r\n",
