        "additional_details": "This is completely disproportionate to the amount of time the father gets off work. It is an important time for both parents as they bond with their child, and indeed a difficult time as they both learn to be parents. It is against every idea of fairness and equality, British values, that fathers do not automatically qualify for at least 1 week for paternity. The length of time they have to have worked there simply must be reduced, and for that matter they should be able to apply for more.",
        "background": "I hadn't realised until recently how poor paternity rights in this country are. It is unfair and ridiculous that a man needs to have worked 26 weeks, 15 weeks before the due date, at a company in order to simply qualify for 1 week off work to spend time with his child and the mother.
