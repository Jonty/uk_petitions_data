        "additional_details": "The quality of campaigning would be raised to focus on issues and policies as opposed to personalities, engendering fear and canvassing to get out the vote.  Civic responsibility would become an important part of the educational curriculum, encouraging young people to understand issues which affect them and to participate in civic society. ",
        "background": "Voting would be a civic responsibility similar to education and paying taxes. It would ensure that elected Parliaments and referendum decisions reflect the decision of all the electorate. Declining turnouts in elections and referendums would not be contentious in terms of constituting consent.",
