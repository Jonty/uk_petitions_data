        "additional_details": "A study by the Royal College of Physicians said drink-related health problems could account for up to 12% of total NHS spending on hospitals, about \u00a33 billion. But due to absenteeism, unemployment, premature deaths and alcohol-related crimes/accidents, the total cost of excessive drinking is \u00a36 billion.\r\nAlcohol can unquestionably cause harm to individuals and society.\r\nDespite the revenue through taxation, there are costs in relation to administrative, compliance and law enforcement activities.",
        "background": "According to the recent petition responded to by the government (https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/104349), it was noted that Cannabis use was harmful to human health, ruins families, etc. But, there's another minor substance which, by some strange loophole, is still widely legal: alcohol.",
