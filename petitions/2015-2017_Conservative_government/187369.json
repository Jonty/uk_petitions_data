        "action": "A new referendum on: Should the UK remain a member of the EEA or leave the EEA?",
        "additional_details": "There may be many people who voted \"Leave the EU\", but never thought the UK should leave the EEA as well. A referendum to clarify this would cost much less than what a \"Hard Brexit\" could cost the country. The bare existence of the UK itself as we know it is at stake with another Scottish referendum looming.  ",
        "background": "The UK should leave the EU. This is what the people voted for. However if only 1 in 10 people who voted \u201cLeave the EU\" meant \u201cLeave the EU but not the EEA\u201d, the UK government is making a grave mistake. Hence a new referendum is needed with exactly the same rules as the previous one.",
