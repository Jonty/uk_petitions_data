        "additional_details": "My suggestion is as such. Allow some time for the political parties to sort themselves out, and then call a General Election. Each party in the election must make it very clear in their manifesto whether they are for or against triggering Article 50. Whoever is in power after the General Election must stick to their manifesto regarding Article 50. \r\nThis saves having a 2nd referendum, but with the same effect, allowing people who feel lied to and cheated to have a more informed say on the matter. ",
        "background": "As some of you may have noticed, there has been a very popular petition lately asking for a second EU referendum. Clearly this won't work, as it is asking for rules to be applied retroactively to the referendum. ",
