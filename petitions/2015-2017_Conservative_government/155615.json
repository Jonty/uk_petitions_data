There is no plan, the new PM will not be appointed for weeks, Labour are too bus falling out with their leader.   We need unity from all parties to get the Europe matter settled.  No matter which side of the debate you are on they work for us and need to take action immediately in full view of the public.",

We need all MPs to work together on resolving the BREXIT situation not to leave the country in free fall for 4 months. Put aside party politics and sort the country out.",
