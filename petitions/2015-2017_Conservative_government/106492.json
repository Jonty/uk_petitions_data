        "additional_details": "This practice for the conveniance of management has a detrimental and devastating effect on our vulnerable elderly suffering this already very cruel illness  and their loving families. This is going on in Private Dementia Nursing homes now and they are not protected.   We need to make it law that private nursing homes can not serve eviction notices because dementia care patients show challenging behaviours.  All dementia care /nursing homes should be trained fully in challenging behaviours",
        "background": "My lovely 80 year old mother who suffers vascular dementia with challenging behaviours during personal care has been given an eviction notice due to the fact that the 'nursing' care home can not deliver her care needs any more.  However her family can. This is not an isolated case.  ",
