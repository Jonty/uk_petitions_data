        "additional_details": "The leave campaign leaders including the likes of Farage, Boris and so on have all deserted the country post winning the Referendum on 23rd June 2016. With the Prime minister resigning, the lack of strong leadership to navigate the United Kingdom through tough negotiations with the EU puts the UK at risk of not achieving results in the best interest of the country. In order to avoid this, we should give the public the option to chose their next leader instead of Parliament choosing one for us.",
        "background": "With David Cameron resigning, a new democratically elected Prime Minister should be elected to lead the UK in Brexit negotiations. Candidates running for the post should be free to run on their own mandate regarding Brexit - ie those wishing to remain can run on ignoring the referendum results.",
