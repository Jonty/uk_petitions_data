U18s could not vote in the EU Referendum, so their voice missed in one-off irreversible decision affecting them greatly. Younger people voted overwhelmingly to Remain, inc. 75% aged 18-24. 16-17 yr olds voted in Scottish Referendum, a similar children's vote may have changed the result (with almost 2m aged 16-17 in UK).",

The process was therefore unrepresentative, contravening UNCRC, a 2nd Referendum should be held.",
