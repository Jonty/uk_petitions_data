        "action": "Increase government spending on mental health issues",
        "additional_details": "This petition aims to increase the amount of money the government spends on solving mental health problems and treating individuals like they actually matter. When a person with mental health issues is not prioritised it puts further strain on them and the economy (and further strain on them leads back to square 1 making it a vicious circle). If we could cut out the middle section by spending money then we would save money.",
        "background": "1 in 4 people in the UK will suffer from a mental health problem at some time in their lives. Studies show that it costs the government 1000s of pounds every year as people need to take days off and many illnesses lead to physical problems. These issues need to be prioritised.",
