        "action": "Stop spraying our skies with chemicals - Chemtrailing.",
        "additional_details": "The skies above the UK are regularly covered by unnatural criss crossing patterns of white filmy aircraft emissions - known as Chemtrails.  These are not the regular aircraft emissions known as contrails which disappear within minutes. Chemtrails actually spread out getting bigger with the trails covering the whole sky with a filmy silvery cloud film blocking out natural light.  There is much speculation about what chemicals are contained in these sprays ranging from Aluminium, Barium, Viruses.",
        "background": "The british public demand that the practice of deliberate chemical spraying from aircraft (Chemtrailing) over the british isles to be stopped immediately & that the government finally admit that this widespread practice exists & explains why it's existence has been denied for so long.",
