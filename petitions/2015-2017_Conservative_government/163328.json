Imagine that even half of those people grab a coffee on the go, and you begin to understand the cause of the mountain of coffee cups we are creating as a nation.\r\n\r\nCoffee shops have offered half-hearted solutions in the form of selling expensive re-usable flasks which does not offer much incentive to many. It is time for the coffee giants to take responsibility and switch to recyclable cups. \r\n\r\n",
