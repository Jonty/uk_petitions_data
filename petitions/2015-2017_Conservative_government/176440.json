        "additional_details": "Mrs May does not represent the best interests of her constituents, nor of the country at large, especially as more and more polls are showing a swing back to Remain, as they see the damage that will be caused by leaving the EU. Mrs May has so far shown herself as inadequate in her previous role as Home Secretary where she had the ability to wield great influence on immigration policy, and her contempt for proper democratic process and the need to have thorough debate in Parliament is disturbing.",
        "background": "Teresa May was a Pro Remain MP whose constituents voted in favour of Remain. Mrs May as Prime Minister now insists that although there was by no means an overwhelming majority on an 'advisory only' referendum she has the obligation to 'enforce' Britain leave the EU. ",
