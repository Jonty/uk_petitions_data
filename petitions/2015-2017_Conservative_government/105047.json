        "additional_details": "The Leaders Special is available on You Tube, search for 'Question Time: Election Leaders Special'. David Cameron deliberately misled the British public over the Conservative Party's intension to cut child tax credits if elected. As he made such a deliberate misrepresentation on a critical issue, he is not fit to be Prime Minister.",
        "background": "On 30 April 2015, in the Leaders Special, David Dimbleby asked David Cameron to confirm that 'absolutely... as a guarantee... child tax credit will not fall'. Cameron responded: 'we've increased child tax credit by \u00a3450' and 'child tax credit is NOT going to fall'. This was a blatant lie to mislead.",
