        "additional_details": "Without evidence of someone coming forward with info or from CCTV I had to go through 12 weeks worth of weekly visits which added extra stress and emotions to us as a family.\r\nI have also lost all trust in all care providers so therefore I had to give up my career which has a knock on effect on many things in life.\r\nI would hate for any parent/family to go through what my husband and I have and believe CCTV would prevent all the obstacles we were faced with and will allow parents peace of mind too",
        "background": "My daughter who was 14 months at the time came home from her 5th session at nursery with grip mark bruises on both arms. We reported these to all local authorities but unfortunately no one came forward as to knowing/seeing anything. I believe if there was CCTV I would know exactly what happened.",
