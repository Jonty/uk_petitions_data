        "additional_details": "We demand that our govt. oversees the lifting of the blockades in Palestine & sends aid to the worst affected areas. We cannot allow this cycle of violence to continue. As Israel's disregard for international law & humanitarian needs intensify, the radicalisation of rebels will only continue to rise alongside it. Until Israel begins treating the Palestinian's like human beings this cycle will rage on. It is simply not possible for us to stand by & do nothing.",
        "background": "We demand our government: immediately impose sanctions on Israel, e.g. not giving the billions of \u00a3's of aid the UK sends each year, in light of their military attacks on Gaza; that our govt. holds Israel to account for the war crimes being done in the occupied parts of Palestine.",
