        "action": "The government should reintroduce the dog licence which was abolished in 1987.",
        "additional_details": "The Dog Licence was abolished in 1987. It was deemed difficult to enforce with only 50% of owners having a licence. This was pre the internet. A small charge of say \u00a335 per dog or say \u00a370 for a group of dogs paid online would be easy to administer. An online \"ownership test\" to get the licence might allow for education and enforcement of the act. It would allow the location of dangerous breeds to be known and for animal welfare and conflict with human to be reduced. It would not be onerous. ",
        "background": "Dogs are sometimes treated by owners as controllable children. They are often not. An incredible amount of children and adults are attacked by breeds of dogs which are recognised as being so dangerous that even sizeable humans do not have the skills to tackle them. Even a lap dog can maul a baby.",
