For the purposes of the Act, this means that the organisation:\r\n\u2022\tcommits or participates in acts of terrorism; \r\n\u2022\tprepares for terrorism; \r\n\u2022\tpromotes or encourages terrorism (including the unlawful glorification of terrorism); or \r\n\u2022\tis otherwise concerned in terrorism.\r\n\r\n\u201cTerrorism\u201d as defined in the Act, means the use or threat which: involves serious violence against a person; involves serious damage to property; endangers a person\u2019s life (other than that of the person committing the act); creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or section of the public; or is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system.  The use or threat of such action must be designed to influence the government or an international governmental organisation or to intimidate the public or a section of the public and be undertaken for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause.\r\n\r\nThe Government\u2019s \u2018Prevent\u2019 strategy is committed to tackling all forms of extremist beliefs that could lead to terrorism, including far right extremism.\r\n\r\nThe Government condemns those who seek to spread hate by demonising British Muslims.  Those who seek to divide us damage our country by stoking anti-Muslim hatred and deliberately raise community fears and tensions by bringing disorder and violence to our towns and cities.  \r\n\r\nThe Government\u2019s Counter-Extremism Strategy sets out comprehensive measures to defeat all forms of extremism \u2013 violent or non-violent, Islamist or Neo-Nazi, by countering extremist ideology, building partnerships against extremism, disrupting extremists, and building cohesive communities.\r\n\r\nHome Office",
