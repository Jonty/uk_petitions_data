        "additional_details": "The BBC has been forced to take on the funding of free TV licences to the over 75's which will mean a cut of 700 million.\r\n\r\nThe BBC charter is up for renewal and there are indications from culture secretary John Whittingdale that he would like to see a smaller  BBC and that considerable funding cuts are being considered.  A green paper is being drafted and an advisory committee has been appointed which is solely made up of people who would gain if the BBC were to be diminished in size and scope.\r\n",
