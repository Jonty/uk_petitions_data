        "action": "Introduce a bill to block the privatisation of the NHS, permanently.",
        "additional_details": "In 2014, \u00a39.63bn worth of NHS private contracts were signed and the Health and Social Care Act of 2012 opened up the NHS to increased marketization, according to King's Fund. The National Health Service should remain exactly that - national. Not private. Not exclusive. Healthcare isn't a commodity to be exploited by corporations. A cross party committee can introduce a bill that would outlaw any privatisation of the NHS and keep it for the public forever. ",
        "background": "Under the Tory government, we have seen an unprecedented level of privatisation of the NHS. The NHS was established in 1947 to provide healthcare universally, whether you were rich or poor. It is one of our greatest institutions and is currently under threat from TTIP and the government.",
