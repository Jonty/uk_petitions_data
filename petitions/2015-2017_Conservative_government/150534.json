        "additional_details": "The need for a well thought out exit plan is required and living as the beacon of democracy for Europe and the world our own Parliment needs to deliver legislation that provides a roadmap for exit. The behavior of individuals and institutions of the European Union to hasten our exit shows the contempt that some of these institutions show to an alternative view to their own. The democratic will of our nation has been shown and now we need the leadership of the U.K. Parliment to enact this will.",
        "background": "With the need for the UK to get a favourable deal from the European Union in regard to the overwhelming decision of the British people to leave the EU we must not be forced to invoke Article 50 before we are ready to do so. This is to ensure that we minimise the shock of leaving the EU economically",
