        "additional_details": "Cameron lost his EU campaign. he is approaching the EU from a humble stance. He asked them for changes before the referendum. Countries arrogantly sent him home with nothing. They recognise that they had a part to play in the events that have followed. \r\n\r\nCameron can approach them from the same side. He did not want this but he will see it through and he has the most experience and strongest relationships with our European political partners. Now is not the time for him to resign. ",
        "background": "After the Brexit result David Cameron announced he would resign. \r\n\r\nThis is a travesty. He is by far the best person in parliament to lead the upcoming negotiations with other EU countries. He is a good and strong prime minister. He should stay and fight until the next election.",
