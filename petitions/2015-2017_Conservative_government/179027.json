        "action": "Allow the President of the United States to visit the UK to create trade options",
        "additional_details": "The EU will soon enter into negotiations with the U.K.  To make sure that a competitive deal is reached that can benefit both sides, there needs to be viable alternatives. The United States is the largest economy in the world. To limit trade ties would be a waste just because the President has ideological differences. One day Donald Trump will leave office and it would have been a waste to sideline the President, Donald Trump has already expressed interest in UK trade. ",
        "background": "Banning Donald Trump from entering the UK would diminish the chances of creating a competitive trade deal with the EU. Put differences aside and try and boost the UK's negotiation position at this crucial time. Donald Trump will leave office one day. ",
