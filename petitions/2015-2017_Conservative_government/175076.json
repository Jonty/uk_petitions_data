        "additional_details": "Since Brexit, the countries division has been deep routed... And many people feel like their voices are not being heard. The government has been acting unilaterally ignoring a significant number of the population.\r\n\r\nThis has left very little confidence in the government's ability to fairly treat it's citizens. \r\n\r\nAnd the only way our voices will be heard is by holding a general election, to lead us in a positive direction and change. ",
        "background": "Brexit has had huge impact not only on the economy, but has been divisive to the nation/s... for many people both brexiteers and remainers many have lost a lot of faith in the government ability and do not feel the government can take us forward to unite us and recover the economy.
