The referendum is open to a legal challenge as the campaigners obviously presented distortions, untruths and even lies. The existing referendum result must be null and void as the British people were misled and Article 50 Lisbon Treaty not applied for under the circumstances.\r\nThe immediacy and gravitas of this request is self evident",
