        "additional_details": "- Women should not qualify for combat roles with lower physical capabilities, for example they might have to carry a heavy male, with full armour to save his life.\r\n\r\n- It would cloud judgement of male counterparts, who would instinctively choose to save a woman if two people's lives were in danger, despite not always being the right decision to take.\r\n\r\n- Women, in the main, cannot carry 110lb on their back (as soldiers in Afghanistan did).\r\n\r\n- There are already many combat roles open to women.",
        "background": "- If a woman wants to serve on the frontline, they need to meet the same physical criteria as men, otherwise lives will be put at risk.\r\n- It would cause discontent among serving members of the armed forces, with many threatening to leave if this becomes policy.",
