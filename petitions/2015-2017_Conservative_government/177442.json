It's not natural to any parent to part with them.\r\nTo go in to labour anxious and excited to meet ur tiny baby, to then have to leave the hospital empty handed. \r\nYour then told you don't get a birth certificate. Your baby isn't registered a child. \r\nAll babies, no matter how long they have been here for, deserve to be recognised as a person. \r\nIt's time this became the norm! \r\nHelp all us grieving parents out there to make a simple change that would make the world of difference to a horrendous situation.

We never expected to be told there was no heartbeat.\r\nHe was perfect in every way yet we left the hospital a day later with a box and a death certifate. No birth certificate just a death certificate. As if our little boy was never here...",
