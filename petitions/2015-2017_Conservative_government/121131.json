        "additional_details": "Young drivers are facing premiums nearly 4x more higher than the average driver, there's been an 8.2% annual rise in premiums for under 20s, seen on Confused.com. The Commons Transport Committee was told youngsters believe they are being priced off the road. The average price of a premium for a 17-20 year old in the 3rd quarter of the year was \u00a33,878 when insured as the only driver. The average older driver is priced at \u00a31,006, not only is this unfair but stopping youngsters from aspiring.",
        "background": "Under 25s are facing high prices for car insurance. If the government want equality, they should be given the same price and advantages compared to a 30 year old. \u00a31000s difference and it's unfair as littler pay is being offered to under 18s also living and educational costs are on the increase.",
