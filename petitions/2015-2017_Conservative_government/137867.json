        "additional_details": "ONS data shows there are more than 8 million foreign-born residents in the UK, 2/3 from outside the EU and 1/3 from within. According to UCL's migration research unit, these people made a net contribution of more than \u00a325 billion to public finances since 2000 & are 45% less likely than people native to the UK to receive state benefits, tax credits & social housing.  UCL also reveals that Britain is uniquely successful in attracting the most highly skilled & highly educated migrants in Europe. ",
        "background": "The call for a 2nd EU referendum has over 1 million signatures. We should also allow foreign-born permanent residents/those with indefinite leave to remain, that have lived in the UK for at least 5 years, and have homes, work, study and bring up their families here, to influence their futures also\r\n",
