        "additional_details": "The Government states that it will have accepted 350 children under this scheme. The organisation Help Refugees, which works with these children, estimates that there are \"700 are children, 78% of whom are unaccompanied\". To accept more of these children is humane and decent. Furthermore, these children are vulnerable to exploitation by traffickers, terrorist groups and other criminals. Furthermore, local authorities accepted responsibility to take and care for these children.",
        "background": "As the BBC explains, ministers accepted the Dubs amendment last year after pressure from campaigners and members of the public to take children from the \"Jungle\" migrant camp in Calais. Today the Home Office in a written statement has said it will stop receiving these children. This is shameful.",
