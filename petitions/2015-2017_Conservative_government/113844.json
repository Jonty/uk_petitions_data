        "additional_details": "By signing this petition, you are asking this country to grant animals the full protection of the law against their malicious and purposeful abuse, torture, and murder. You are asking to replace meaningless bans for violence towards animals, as well as the malicious neglect of animals, with compulsory prison sentences comparable to similar sentencing in protection of humans against the same abuse.\r\n\r\nDon't turn a blind eye. End the cruelty. Sign the petition. Make Parliament change the law.\r\n",
        "background": "For years, I have been increasingly sickened by a rising tide of abuse inflicted on defenceless and innocent animals. I recently learned that a small puppy called Chunky was kidnapped by teenagers. He was fed drugs, had his neck and leg broken, was tortured, beaten, and they set his eyes on fire.",
