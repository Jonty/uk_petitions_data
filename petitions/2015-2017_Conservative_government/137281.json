        "additional_details": "We have a principal in the UK that we are not allowed to gain advantage by knowingly lying. Yet that is what has happened with the EU referendum. Both campaigns made statements that were not true.\r\n\r\nThe Leave campaign has achieved a narrow victory and we are now told that their main campaign promise \u201cWe send the EU \u00a3350 million a week let\u2019s fund the NHS instead\u201d is not possible.\r\n\r\nWe need an enquiry into the legitimacy of the result that is based on lies  by both campaigns to acquire support.",
        "background": "The EU Referendum vote to leave the EU will make an irreversible change to the UK\u2019s relationship to the rest of world. Remain and Leave campaigns, and unofficial campaigns, mislead the public on key factual information about our current and future relationship with the EU and the rest of the world.",
