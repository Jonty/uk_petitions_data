        "additional_details": "In the wake of the EU referendum, the risk that racism and bigotry will show itself as an accepted part of our society is higher than ever. By signing this petition, you are calling on our Government to take official steps to show that we are not a racist, bigoted nation and will punish those who seek to do harm to another person because of their culture, religion, country of origin or ethnicity and those who seek to alienate  people along these lines during this political upheaval.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call upon HM Govt. to increase punitive measures in response to public acts of aggressive, racial and xenophobic discrimination by 50% for a period of 1 year following the EU Referendum. We believe this will send the clear message that the People of Britain do not tolerate racism.",
