        "additional_details": "Individuals and companies avoid tax (while we're paying it) by using tax havens, they say until the countries that provide those havens stop, we can't stop it. \r\n\r\nThen put sanctions on those countries! \r\n\r\nThe money they help hide takes the care away from our people who need it, stops the potholes being filled in AND means we all pay more tax. If we can put sanctions on countries for hurting their population and enemies, then we can do do for countries allowing practices that hurt Britons.",
        "background": "Tax avoidance through use of 'Tax Havens' is a huge issue, costing our country Billions of pounds. \r\n\r\nThe excuse we hear for it is that a lot of it 'complies with the rules' or isn't illegal, because other countries have different laws or practices.\r\n\r\nWe should take action to encourage they change",
