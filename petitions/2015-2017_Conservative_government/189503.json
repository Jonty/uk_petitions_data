Currently, people can apply for legal aid if they have evidence that they, or their children, have been victims of domestic abuse or violence and they can't afford to pay legal costs. If they are given legal aid, the domestic abuse then has to be proven in a court of law. \r\n\r\nYou can find out about the current process for legal aid claims for victims of domestic abuse here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/legal-aid/domestic-abuse-or-violence\r\n\r\nIf you'd like a specific change to how this process works, you could start a new petition asking for that change."
