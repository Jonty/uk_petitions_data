        "additional_details": "Conversion Therapy is counselling or training which attempts to 'reverse' a person's non-heterosexual identity. This therapy often includes electric shocks, counselors encouraging suicide, and damaging ideology linking LGBT+ identities to sexual abuse from family members in early years.\r\n\r\nIt is scientifically proven that this therapy does not work\r\n",
        "background": "After events around the world such as the Orlando shootings and Trump's election, many members of the LGBT+ community no longer feel safe in the UK. \r\nThis legislation would help these people feel safer and more able to be open about their true identity.\r\n\r\n",

It is sometimes known as \u2018reparative\u2019 or \u2018gay cure\u2019 therapy. The Government fully recognise the importance of this issue and the adverse impact this treatment could have on lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that this sort of treatment is beneficial, and indeed it may well cause significant harm to some patients.  It is incumbent on professionals working in the National Health Service to ensure that treatment and care, including therapy, is provided to every patient without any form of discrimination.\r\n\r\nThis Government is committed to tackling discrimination towards LGB people. \r\n\r\nThat is why we have already worked with the main registration and accreditation bodies for psychotherapy and counselling practitioners, including the UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP), to develop first a consensus statement and then a Memorandum of Understanding committing signatory organisations to a range of activities including training and awareness raising amongst their members in relation to this issue. This Government has already taken the necessary steps to prevent the practice of gay conversion therapy in the UK.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health",
