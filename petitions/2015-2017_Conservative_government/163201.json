HMG must stand up for those struggling against injustice everywhere.  ",
        "background": "The Department for International Trade, led by Dr Liam Fox who has the worst LGBT+ voting record of any cabinet member, intends to open a UK trade hub in Raleigh, North Carolina. This is despite the fact that the state's HB2 permits businesses to directly discriminate against the LGBT+ community. ",
