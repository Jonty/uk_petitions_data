        "additional_details": "Due to the fact that bad people breed and train pitbulls to fight then the gentle and well brought up pitbulls that often make the most wonderful family pets are being euthinased simply for being within the breed of a pitbull. Any dog can be brought up to be agressive, for example golden retrievers are naturally very soft and gentle animals with fantastic temperament but if they are not brought up correctly they can be extremely vicious and cause serious issues to family networks.\r\n",
        "background": "Pitbulls have been used for fighting for a long time and can be agressive the same as any other breed depending on the individual dog's upbringing. Pitbulls that are brought up in families are often looked after correctly are usually great with children and other dogs..why should they be euthinased?",
