        "action": "Keep all Four Freedoms (including Freedom of Movement) when the UK leaves the EU",
        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson himself said that he did not believe the majority of Leave voters were driven by anxieties about immigration, so why sacrifice freedom of movement?\r\n\r\nThis isn't just about making things easy - I believe in these freedoms, and I believe that allowing people within the EU to freely live and work in our country is incredibly valuable, as is the freedom for anyone in the UK to live and work in other European countries. If you believe this too, then please sign this petition.",
        "background": "Leaving the EU has a great many challenges to overcome. One of those challenges is attempting to negotiate a deal whereby we keep free trade within the EU but limit the freedom of movement. It has been stated by many EU representatives that we cannot have free trade without freedom of movement.",
