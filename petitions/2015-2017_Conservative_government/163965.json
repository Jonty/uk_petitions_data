        "additional_details": "If you are familiar with the traffic and parking chaos created at Langley Crematorium every time they have a service (they have up to 20 services a day = 400 per month!!), you will want this abomination of a proposal stopped immediately.\r\n\r\nThe council will say residents want a crematorium in the village. The real reason is just to generate more money for the council. Did you know Wealden council has more money than any other council in East Sussex? They hold nearly \u00a320 million in reserves!!!",
        "background": "Wealden District Council have brought Flat Farm in Chiddingly Road Horam and want to destroy village life by turning our homes into a car and fumed filled hell hole.\r\n\r\nThey are planning on building a large crematorium with parking for 200 cars plus 21 social housing properties on the site.",
