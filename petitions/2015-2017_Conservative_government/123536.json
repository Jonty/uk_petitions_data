        "action": "Give the Meningitis B vaccine to all UK children by cutting overseas aid budget",
        "additional_details": "We cannot continue to see pictures of young children suffering in the UK on the grounds of cost, while sending money overseas with dubious controls over how it's being spent that would not be acceptable in a commercial environment.\r\n\r\nThis proposal would be cost neutral to taxpayers and gives signatories the opportunity to provide guidance to the government on how they would like their taxes to be spent.",
        "background": "The government's recent response to the Meningitis B vaccine petition was unacceptable.\r\n\r\nAs it was clear the main issue was cost, this petition addresses that concern by proposing that the cost of vaccinating all UK children be deducted from the overseas aid budget, rather than the NHS budget.",
