        "additional_details": "This topic has allready been debated in parliament and was agreed upon to be taxed and regulated for sale to people over the age of 18 or for medical reasons but was never put into place I think now is the time for us to make changes and keep Great Britain  in our possession, whilst legalising cannabis could bring millions to Spair and help chronic sufferers over Great Britain \r\n\r\nAfter the recent e.u referendum I think making cannabis legal for tax sales would be the best thing for us. The estimates of earnings each year could carry us above the recession and keep our country great",
        "background": "An estimated 1.1 million British people use cannabis illegally for chronic diseases and other medical issues when simple it can be legalised and in the long run helping millions and keeping the economy strong by bringing in extra money wich could fund the nhs or go to education.
