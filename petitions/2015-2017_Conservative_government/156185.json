        "additional_details": "The Scottish referendum had a 670-page plan. This one had none.\r\n\r\nNow that the preference of the people is known, we need a say in what actually happens next, and how. This could be the biggest single change in our country for hundreds of years and the people have never been asked how it should be done, and what outcome we should be negotiating for.\r\n\r\nWe absolutely need to elect the next government based on their manifesto for handling the Leave result. It cannot be left to just 330 MPs to decide.",
        "background": "When/if we invoke Article 50 and trigger the 2-year deadline to leave the EU, we absolutely need a strong government with a clear mandate from the people. With a manifesto based on what the government will actually be doing next.\r\n\r\nWe can't petition for a general election but we can ask this much.",
