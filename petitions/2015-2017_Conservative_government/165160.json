        "action": "Introduce a job test for all prospective MPs.",
        "additional_details": "As an initial idea for discussion, I propose 100 questions around 10 subjects including history, maths, logic/IQ, economics, general knowledge, culture, the world, and so on. Like most tests, this test would be changed frequently, marking would be anonymous, and scores would not be published. A candidate would only know they had passed or failed, with a pass mark being perhaps 80%. A candidate would be entitled to a second attempt, but only after the current election had ended.",
        "background": "It is necessary to complete a test for most jobs, yet currently there is no testing of candidates for membership of parliament. There is a suspicion amongst many of the public that some MPs are \"out of touch\" or \"not fit for purpose\". A test would improve public confidence.\r\n",
