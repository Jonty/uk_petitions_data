        "additional_details": "The Department of Education doesn\u2019t obtain records when parents/students make a complaint against a school/governing body or other authorities if involved. It is vital for complaints where the school/governing body are not providing records/evidence that the DfE must obtain and forward them to the complainant to contribute. Student\u2019s education is put at risk & their records contaminated with misleading information. The DfE complaints system must be overhauled & those responsible held accountable",
        "background": "Since Justine Greening was appointed as Secretary of State for Education and Minister for Women and Equalities she has neglected to fulfil her responsibilities and to ensure that the DfE obtain all records/evidence in complaints against schools/governing bodies. Currently the DfE does not do this",
