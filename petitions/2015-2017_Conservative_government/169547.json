        "action": "Debate Mark Carney's behaviour on putting the British economy down  after Brexit",
        "additional_details": "He predicted a technical recession along with his buddies the previous chancellor and the IMF etc and this contributed to a slowing of growth rather than anything in the economy itself which is healthy. He continues to give negative outlooks instead of a balanced view and gives remoaners the opportunity to talk the economy down further and fulfil their prophesy and go for a soft Brexit which isn't a Brexit at all and is against the democratic will of the people. He should consider his position. ",
        "background": "Mark Carney's behaviour is appalling. His constant negativity about the economy is very damaging and bringing interest rates down is having a detrimental effect on our economy especially for savers. The weak pound is making unscrupulous companies like Unilever try to profiteer from it. Is he a mole?",
