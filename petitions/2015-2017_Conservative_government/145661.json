        "additional_details": "The EU referendum has been a farce and the result is a disaster for the UK. The Leave campaign was built on lies and they've already admitted it. \r\n\r\nThe Conservative Party and Labour are imploding. Scotland and Northern Ireland's future in the union is in question. \r\n\r\nThe nation is divided as never before in the last half century. Open racism has become part of our national conversation.",
        "background": "To restore public faith in Westminister, parliament should vote to dissolve itself and hold a general election in 2016. \r\n\r\nThe non-binding results of the referendum should be thrown out. People should be able to elect a new government on policies they put forward in a general election campaign.",
