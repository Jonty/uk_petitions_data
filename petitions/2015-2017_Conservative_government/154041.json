        "additional_details": "A Brexit cannot legally be triggered without Parliament repealing the 1972 European Communities Act. Leave voters,many of whom had legitimate grievances about real life issues,have been disgracefully misled by the media&leave MP's who deceived them with outright lies &promises of outcomes that were never remotely possible.The referendum was,by definition,an outrage to democracy as the public were deliberately misled by politicians who were purposefully lying. MP's must act now to save the UK",
        "background": "Already our country's position on the world stage has been irrevocably damaged, the country is in turmoil with no coherent government, no valid opposition, no plan for what happens next, the pound at it's lowest value for decades. MP's have a sworn duty to halt this madness before the UK collapses.",
