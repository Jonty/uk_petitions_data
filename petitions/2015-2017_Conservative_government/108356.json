        "additional_details": "I am an ordinary woman. Help me protect vulnerable. \r\n\r\nI am horrified to learn Telecoms falls outside the scope of Consumer Law, Sale of Goods Act etc \r\n\r\nI want Govt to debate:\r\n1. Transparent Telecoms & Data Contracts (#TTDC) clear, explicit contracts (more to follow).\r\n2. Guide To Mobile Charges (pin codes on SIMs/handsets just like ATM cash cards).\r\n3. Opt in boxes on contracts for service features such as international calls, data roaming.  \r\n4. Warning on Telecoms contracts of unlimited charges.\r\n",
        "background": "In 2012 I bought a 02 mobile phone contract for a minor to use in UK for school journeys.  No mention on the contract I was sold a walking bank card which secretly included international calls, data roaming WITHOUT my permission. The Telecoms Ombudsman & its CEO advised me 02 are correct to do this.",
