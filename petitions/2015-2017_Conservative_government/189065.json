        "additional_details": "There have been a number of high profile examples of companies, and celebrities, that have managed to pay very little tax despite having incomes that few of us could realistically hope to achieve. Even though this is currently legal, the last Prime Minister described this as \"morally wrong\". \r\n\r\nIt should be the case that anyone holding the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer publicly shows that they possess high moral standards when it comes to their own tax affairs. \r\n\r\nThank you.",
        "background": "The Chancellor of the Exchequer is the government\u2019s chief financial minister and as such is responsible for raising revenue through taxation. As a sign of openness, and accountability to the tax payer, the current and future Chancellors must publicly prove the integrity of their own tax affairs. ",
