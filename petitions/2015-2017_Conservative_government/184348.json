        "additional_details": "Those who in the caring professions work selflessly in the community in schools, hospitals, prisons and in the armed forces. As they are not working for their own benefit and cannot, in the majority of cases, enhance their own pay packet by working any harder, they deserve special status in the tax system. They also deserve an entitlement to extended breaks in their working lives for rest and professional development so that they do not get 'burnt out' but enjoy long and fruitful careers.",
        "background": "Doctors, nurses, teachers, the military, social workers and prison officers work, primarily, to provide and care for others and are not driven by financial rewards. This should be recognized by designating certain jobs as a 'Public Service Vocation' with enhanced benefits.",
