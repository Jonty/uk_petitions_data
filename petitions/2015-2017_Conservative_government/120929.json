        "action": "Allow non VAT registered businesses reliant on a vehicle to claim VAT back on it",
        "additional_details": "Vans are expensive and we need reliable ones. VAT is additional money that we can't claim back unlike VAT registered companies. This gives an advantage to those in the commercial sector as VAT amongst companies is welcomed but VAT in the domestic sector is crippling when it comes to competing with other tradesmen. We need to be able to claim the VAT back, not necessarily all of it but please at least reconsider the effect it has on the sole traders in the UK",
        "background": "I'm a self employed Tradesman trying to make a living. Going VAT registered isn't an option as that makes me 20% more expensive than other Tradesmen. I rely on my van to do my job, but I cannot claim the VAT on my main asset,(\u00a34-5k in VAT). We are unable to trade without a van, please reconsider VAT",
