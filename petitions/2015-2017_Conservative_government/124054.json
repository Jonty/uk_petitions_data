        "action": "Make telesales cold calling and door to door cold calling illegal.",
        "additional_details": "If you are cold calling then you have no idea who you are speaking to or their situation. You have no idea of their mental health or financial status. Being involved with caring for my Mum who has Alzheimers and having dealt with many of these calls, I have seen and experienced the stress and upset cold calling can cause. I am sure I am not alone in this experience. Mum is lucky I am there to do this, many others won't be that lucky which is why the Goverment need to make cold calling illegal.",
        "background": "I have had to deal with so many cold callers. They range from the apologetic and helpful to the rude and arogant. Cold callers have no idea who they are calling. Some are able to just say 'no' and hang up or shut the door but others aren't and are left vulnerable to scams and unnecessary purchases.",
