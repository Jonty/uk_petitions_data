        "action": "Make it law to carry a breakdown warning triangle in every motor vehicle.",
        "additional_details": "It is already mandatory in France to carry a warning triangle.\r\n\r\nIt alerts other road users to a breakdown so they have enough time to react.\r\n\r\nIt is very effective on motorways where there is no hard shoulder.\r\n\r\nIt is known to reduce the amount of accidents involving broken down vehicles.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "If a warning triangle is displayed 100 metres behind a broken down vehicle, it will decrease the chances of someone else crashing into it. What if you had broken down somewhere awkward like a roundabout or a bridge without a hard shoulder?",
