        "action": "End the unfair funding by government for North-Eastern councils, like Gateshead.",
        "additional_details": "Gateshead has poorer health, lower life expectancy and more disability and unemployment than elsewhere. Yet government has cut \u00a3130m from Gateshead Council in the last 5 years, will cut a further \u00a392m over the next 3 years and will end its main grant altogether in 2020, as elsewhere.",
        "background": "Gateshead cannot now deliver proper support for health and social care. People live longer into old age now and need help when they become frail. The current deal, and the cuts that are required, critically undermine Gateshead Council\u2019s ability to fulfil its commitments to local people. ",
