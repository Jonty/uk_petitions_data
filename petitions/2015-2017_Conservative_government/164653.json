        "additional_details": "Road safety is becoming harder to tackle across the UK, if we lead the way in Europe on how to maintain road safety by ensuring all drivers who drive for hire & reward take the steps as bus & lorry drivers have then we are one step closer to ensuring safety of passengers in any Taxi/PH vehicle & other road users for social, domestic, pleasure, commercial & business use too. Where the public are concerned this is vital for road safety and passenger reassurance that drivers are trained correctly.",
        "background": "At present it is optional if licensing authorities make new hackney/ph drivers take a dvsa test. I call for all drivers present and new of any licensing borough to ensure all drivers complete a dvsa practical, hazard perception & cpc. All other professional drivers have to and only equal they do to.",
