        "additional_details": "The referendum is not legally binding. David Cameron can put the question of leaving the EU to MPs. Parliament is designed to deal with incredibly complex topics on our behalf. Despite faults in our political system, MPs are there to stop us making mistakes based on snappy slogans and fear mongering campaigns. Calm rational informed choice is required.",
        "background": "In a historic vote the UK public voted to leave the EU. This was based on a misinformed, bitter campaign, not rational arguments. It jeapordises Britain's security and economic prosperity in both the short and long term. Parliament has a duty to guide the country away from a tragic mistake.",
