        "action": "Review continuous lawful period ruling for ILR applicants on long secondments",
        "additional_details": "There have been several cases of non-EU migrants that have been deported because of this ruling (e.g. Dr Miwa Hirono). This ruling mostly affects professionals (e.g. engineers, accountants, academic professionals) working for British companies with overseas businesses as they may undertake long secondments out of UK as part of their employment. If this ruling is not revised, the UK risks losing these talented skilled professionals and the socioeconomic contributions they offer the UK.",
        "background": "The existing ILR ruling specifies that migrants (non-EU) must not be absent from UK for more than 180 days/year during the 5 year continuous period in order to qualify for ILR. However, this disregards absences related to long secondments outside of UK as part of employment requirements",
