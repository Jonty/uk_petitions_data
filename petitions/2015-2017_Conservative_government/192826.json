        "additional_details": "Currently terrorist are given lengthy sentences but sadly they use that time to radicalise people behind bars. If they are ever release they would be more radicalised and more incline to carry out these terror attacks. \r\n\r\nThey don't want to a happy life in the first place which is why they want to go out to carry out terror attacks. \r\n\r\nI strongly believe they should not be jail indefinitely because they will continue to radicalise the prison population and cost the tax payers more money.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "There is clearly a rise in radicalisation in the Uk which leads to terror acts happening right on the streets in the UK. \r\n\r\nI think the public would largely support  to have anyone convicted of terrorism to face the death penalty. ",
