        "additional_details": "The current Government was not given a mandate to negotiate with the EU as the leadership was pro EU and supporting the Remain campaign.  The next potential Conservative leader will not be put in power democratically and therefore does not have a mandate from the British public to negotiate and shape this country going forward.  A general election must be called to allow the public to decide who has the support to lead us through these uncertain times. ",
        "background": "Due to the referendum result and the resignation of David Cameron the Government should call a general election so the nation can decide who should lead the UK through these important negotiations with the EU and shape our country for the decades ahead.",
