        "additional_details": "When I was a child every year I went on holiday with my family and now at  29 I have a level 1-3 in childcare level 3 in teaching assistance plus I had days off when I was ill it's got nothing to do with affecting their education if they have time off, it all boils down to money, where they can save and where they can bleed more out of people who don't have much as it is. It's such a horriable situation for low income family's. First bedroom tax now this it's despicable.",
        "background": "children should be able to go on holiday during school time so long as they have 95 100% attendance. The government dont know what's best for our children parents should not be prosecuted because they can't afford out of term time, the lower class people are the ones being penalised yet again",
