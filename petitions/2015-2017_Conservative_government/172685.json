        "additional_details": "Open centres across the country. While keeping the sale and use of Heroin illegal elsewhere, in the Centres Heroin and other highly addictive class A drugs would be given to addicts that register and seek treatment. Over night drug dealers would be out of business, muggings, robbery\u2019s, burglary\u2019s and shop lifting would decrease dramatically as addicts no longer need to commit crime. Lastly, drug dealers wouldn\u2019t be pushing drugs onto young na\u00efve people in order to profit from their misery.",
        "background": "If there were Centers that provided class A drugs for free and a safe place to take them. Users Registered, agreed to treatment. Then Drug dealers would have no business, muggings, robberies and shoplifting would drop dramatically and few young people would start using.  ",
