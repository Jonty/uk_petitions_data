        "additional_details": "The Fixed-term Parliament Act 2011 states that a general election can only be held every five years unless the House of Commons resolves that there is a vote of no confidence in HM government or if two-thirds of the seats in the House of Commons call for a general election. If you sign this petition, please contact your local MP, inform them that you have no confidence in HM government and request that they call for a vote of no confidence and a general election.",
