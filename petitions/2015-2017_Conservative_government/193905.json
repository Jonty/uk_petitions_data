        "additional_details": "Umbrella is governed by agreement and agencies have been able to show that the workers had agreed to work under their umbrella scheme. This is because the agencies advertise a job and when the workers contact them they are told that agency only pays umbrella, reason being they are supervised so HMRC won't allow them to work under other schemes, this is false,\r\nHowever unless they to agree to go umbrella they won't get the job. This is a wide spread practice that is crippling these workers.",
        "background": "Younger, semi and unskilled workers are being force to agree to pay Employers National insurance if they want  a job. \r\nIn their bid to avoid paying employers national insurance and holiday pay; temporary agencies have come up with the umbrella  scheme where workers  are paying  both side of the NI.",
