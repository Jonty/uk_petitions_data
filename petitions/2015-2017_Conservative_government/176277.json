It is therefore not clear what action you would like the Government or Parliament to take.\r\n\r\nIn any case, we couldn't accept your petition because the UK Government and Parliament aren't responsible for the issue you raise. Control of the fox population is the responsibility of local councils. \r\n\r\nIf you are concerned about the treatment of foxes in your area, you could raise your issue with a local councillor, who represents you. You can use this page to find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them: https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors \r\n\r\nYou can also petition your local council - you can find out more here on your council's website. \r\n\r\nIf you want the culling of foxes to be made illegal, we could accept a petition about that.
