        "additional_details": "The recent referendum campaign was an example of the how toxic the UK press have become and how well they are misinforming the UK public for ulterior motives. The fact that Rupert Murdoch can use the UK press to the to fulfill his own anti-EU agenda and at the same time maintain a friendship with our prime minister shows just how corrupt the whole system is.  To abide with IPSO is not even mandatory, and the more impartial press outlets refuse to be part of it out of protest of its uselessness. ",
        "background": "We petition to replace IPSO with a regulator that actually holds the UK press to account (similar to ofcom), and take measures such as not allowing a complete bias, active investigation of misleading headlines and apologies on the same scale as the original article. Regulation should be mandatory.  ",
