        "action": "Call a Second Referendum on Britain Staying in or Leaving the European Union",
        "additional_details": "The referendum did not reflect an accurate view of the British people's views, the facts presented were misleading and therefore materially affected the way people voted. I propose that a second referendum is called for Early 2017 with significantly increased regulation of the facts presented by both sides of the debate so that the UK public can make an informed decision. Young people who would be most affected by an exit must be given their say, I propose a lower voting age of 16 be introduced.",
        "background": "The referendum result about the UK staying in or exiting the EU held on 23rd June 2016 was affected by poor presentation of the facts. Promises about EU membership savings funding the NHS made by the exit side were untrue, the Implications of exit to Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland weren't debated",
