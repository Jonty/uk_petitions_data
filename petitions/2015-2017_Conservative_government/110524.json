        "additional_details": "Britain is a sovereign state which does produce money as needed. We know we simply create money on demand from the First Quarterly Review of the Bank of England for 2014. We must simply create money & instead of it going to the rich friends of corrupt politicians, it must support a nationalised steel industry & a nationalised industry employing the many who need work to create future of energy security.  A future which doesn't require us to ignore our values because we rely on middle eastern oil",
        "background": "Saudi Arabia cruelly execute 2 people every week, they behead then crucify children & they involve themselves in destabilising other countries because of the power they possess from reliance on their oil. We must not condone this any longer. Our energy needs can be met with Solar & Wind technologies",
