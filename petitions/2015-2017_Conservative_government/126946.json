        "additional_details": "My doctor and I have continually requested a consultation with the NHS for an assessment with a psychiatrist for a duration of three years.  \r\nThe government is committed to mental health care mainly targeting dementia and teenagers.  What I propose covers everyone, all genders, races and financial backgrounds.  \r\nThe treatment I have received had really upset me and frustrated my GP, friends and family who are also affected by the condition I have. Everyone should have the right to a proper diagnosis and so the required treatment can be undertaken.  \r\n",
        "background": "How is someone able to get better without a proper diagnosis? I believe if I had been diagnosed earlier then I would be now employed and become a productive member of society. ",
