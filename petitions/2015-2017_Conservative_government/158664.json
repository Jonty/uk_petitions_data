You can find more information about that here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identifying-british-citizens-and-others-exempt-from-deportation\r\n\r\nThe Government already has the power to deport people when the Home Secretary has decided that their removal from the country is 'conducive to the public good'.\r\n\r\nA court can also recommend deportation if someone is convicted of a criminal offence with a prison term."
