        "additional_details": "My name is Callum Hale, I'm a bog standard White British Male from a working class family, I'm a Welder/Fabricator on approx \u00a323K a year, with living costs of approx \u00a322K. I have a Wife and 2 young children both 1 and a half years, and 3 months old. I personally believe that young people have it way too tough in the housing department, and that in 50~ years time it will be a massive problem when people my age retire and depend on the state to house them, causing a burden to our next generation.",
        "background": "People such as myself get themselves trapped in a renting situation where they have no hope in saving for the deposit on a mortgage, but can afford payments on a rented property, the 5 year rent to mortgage idea is designed to make it less risky for banks to give out mortgages to young people.",
