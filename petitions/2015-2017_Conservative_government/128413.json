        "additional_details": "Previous governments have used policies designed to encourage rising prices to benefit existing owners, seriously hurting younger people.\r\n\r\nThis can be stopped and reversed by new policies such as:\r\n-Restrictions on large scale and foreign investor landlords\r\n-Protect remaining council houses and housing associations\r\n-End low rates for buy-to-let\r\n-Progressively tax multiple properties.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to consider any and all of these options.\r\n\r\nHomes are more important than investments.",
        "background": "Since 2000, UK house prices have increased by over 140%, far outstripping wages and inflation. The average new home-owner is now 35. We call on the government to adopt the following policies designed to bring down housing market prices and stabilise them at an affordable level.",
