        "action": "Introduce a mandatory life sentence for throwing acid causing a person harm.",
        "additional_details": "At Ipswich Crown Court today four Lowestoft men were sentenced to a total of almost 40 years for an acid attack on a 22 year old woman.\r\nThe attack left her with life changing injuries.\r\nsuch attacks are becoming more common.\r\nThese attacks warrant a mandatory life sentence, as big a deterrent as our laws allow.",
        "background": "As our country becomes more multi cultural, there has been an upsurge in acid attacks on women by men. Some cultures are more accepting of this than others. The danger is it normalises such actions by it's prevalence. We need to send a very clear message that we regard this as very serious indeed.",
