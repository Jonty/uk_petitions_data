        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom is strong; the argument that the majority of Scots did not vote for Brexit is irrelevant in a democracy.  It is the final total that counts.  Votes cannot be broken up into constituent parts; that way lies chaos.  As it is, the three devolved nations have representation on the UK parliament and vote in a partisan and vindictive way sometimes on issues that would not affect their citizens.  Yet England has no such independent voice.  ",
        "background": "As any vote on an independent Scotland would result in the break up of the Union, it is essential that all citizens of the UK are given the right to vote on this significant historic event.  It is not appropriate for one nation to decide on something that affects 3 other nations. ",
