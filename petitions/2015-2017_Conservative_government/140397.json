Our country is stronger out of the EU and voters have agreed that. It makes our Britain a less democratic country if a revote is put in place and means that over half of voters have not been listened to when they have voted!! ",
        "background": "There has been a petition with over 2M signatures to have another vote on the EU referendum. No matter how many more voters voted to leave, the decision has been made therefore that is the decision that the country should stand by! ",
