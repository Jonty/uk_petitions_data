        "additional_details": "Many families have loved ones in hospital anything from an hour to 5 hours from home. For successful recovery, regular family therapy is vital. People are unable to travel these distances 2-3 times a week. Patients are having increased stays in hospital as a result or simply not recovering. We need more local facilities to aid patient recovery and family intervention & support. Our future generations need and deserve this chance to live.",
        "background": "Adolescent ED numbers are increasing. EDs are evolving, facilities & provisions are not. Patients are often located hours from home as no local specialised units exist. Given the proven success of family based therapy, this needs to be more accessible to families. More small, local units are needed.",
