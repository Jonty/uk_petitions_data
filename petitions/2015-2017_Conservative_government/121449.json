        "action": "Make the production and sale of marijuana legal in UK",
        "additional_details": "Legal Marijuana sale/use is on the cusp of becoming a reality in the US. This petition may not lead to decriminalisation of marijuana, but we all know it's going to happen within the next 5 - 10 years. So why imprison these innocent people for a longer period of time, just decriminalise it now! Crime will go down statistically. And the amount of revenue the government would make on tax is such an untapped market just waiting for the right structure to be put in place. Make it happen. 2016 Legal",
        "background": "Prohibition on marijuana in the UK has gone on for too long. For 88 years innocent civilians have had to break the law if they wanted to partake in a statistically less harmful substance than cigarettes or alcohol which kill over 100,000 people yearly. England has a chance to get ahead of the curve.",
