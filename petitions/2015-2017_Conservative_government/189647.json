        "action": "Provide funding for external wall insulation for homes",
        "additional_details": "Live in a concrete house myself which is unsuitable for cavity wall funding. During winter we find it too unbearable with no heating on, for example waking up with frozen finger tips, toes and noses. Due to central heating costing too much as heat is lost through the walls and takes too long to heat the house up, we can't afford to have the heating on very long.\r\n\r\nExternal wall insulation is too expensive for home owners to fund themselves, having been quoted around \u00a315k for a 3 bed semi myself",
        "background": "Similar to recent schemes for funding of cavity wall insulation, we'd like funding for external wall insulation for homes that aren't suitable for cavity wall insulation, such as solid wall, Stone and concrete homes.",
