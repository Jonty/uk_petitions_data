        "additional_details": "David Cameron insists that Britain\u2019s main focus should continue to be on providing aid for camps in Syria\u2019s neighbouring countries. He has agreed to take in limited numbers of extra refugees from these camps in response to the refugee crisis now and to offer extra aid. The aid and commitment are welcome but more must be done. We need to admit those refugees currently struggling in Europe.",
        "background": "The numbers of refugees David Cameron proposes to admit to Britain are too little and a token gesture given the scale of the problem and the desire of the British public to help. We should admit greater numbers and include those currently in desperate straits in Europe.",
