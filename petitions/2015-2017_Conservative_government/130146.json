        "additional_details": "We support the Government\u2019s plans to tackle criminal rogue agents (and landlords) in the current Housing Bill, but we think that much more should be done. And can easily be done! \r\n\r\nThis petition aims to influence national legislation, based on our Ethical Lettings Pledge (www.theethicallettingspledge.co.uk). This will benefit landlords, tenants, and local communities. It\u2019s time for change! Please sign-up to the Pledge, and this petition, and you'll be helping millions of people! Thank-you. ",
        "background": "The lettings industry is letting people down! Over 12 million people now rent their home privately, with over 2 million landlords, so agents impact many people's lives. Extortionate and hidden fees are one big example, but there are many other unethical practices that we think should be eliminated. ",
