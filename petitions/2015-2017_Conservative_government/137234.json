        "action": "Hold a second referendum on our EU status when the terms of our exit are known",
        "additional_details": "Nobody knows exactly what they voted for on June 23rd, because we don't know the terms of our exit, whether EU citizens here and British citizens abroad can stay, whether we can keep access to the single market, and if so what conditions will be placed on that. Once those details have been agreed over the next two years, the British people should be able to vote on any deal negotiated between the UK government and the EU, and to make a final decision on membership of the EU and/or single market.",
        "background": "During the referendum campaign both sides made a lot of claims about what would happen in the case of Brexit and the kind of deal we could get from Europe after leaving. We believe we should get a final vote on whether to leave the EU and/or the single market AFTER exit negotiations are completed.",
