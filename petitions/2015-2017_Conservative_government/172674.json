        "additional_details": "The RSPCA is paid for by public donations (animal lovers) and not through taxes therefore has nothing to do with MP's. With over 200 years of experience the RSPCA does a fantastic job at protecting the welfare of animals including prosecuting those who are cruel to them. Don't let MP's take this power away so that animals become a lesser priority. Who else do they have? ",
