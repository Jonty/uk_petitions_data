        "additional_details": "Given the significance of the vote, 16 and 17 year olds were allowed, by the UK Parliament, to vote in the recent Scottish Referendum. It is therefore totally unacceptable that this section of the population should be excluded from a decision of similar, if not greater, importance to their futures in the UK as a whole. Given the two year time frame for negotiations to be completed, it is relevant that all current 16 and 17 year olds will be of \u201cvoting age\u201d by the time this process is completed.",
        "background": "The potential for a Brexit, after the 2016 EU Referendum, will have a far greater impact on the life chances and opportunities of young people than those of the elderly. It is very unfair that this section of the \u201cadult\u201d population should be excluded from having their say on such a major decision.",
