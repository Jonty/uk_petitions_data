        "action": "Enable Young Couples to Rent by Regulating HMO Licenses",
        "additional_details": "Many councils have implemented regulations that prevent more than THREE people residing in a dwelling. Even if TWO of those are a renting couple.\r\n\r\nWhile HMOs may have increased the number of rooms to rent, it is equally removing the amount of available properties for young professionals. Our government should be aware and improve these HMO regulations to ensure more availability.\r\nI strongly believe this will help stabilise housing and help hundreds of individuals who are a value to our cities.\r\n",
        "background": "Young professionals are being forced out of Cities such as Oxford and Cambridge to move back in with their parents due to lack of housing caused by HMO regulations.\r\nWe need to have the regulations changed so councils cannot go as low as 2 households / 3 people to require an HMO license.",
