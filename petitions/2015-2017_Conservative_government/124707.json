        "additional_details": "Scotland is getting control from April 2017 of certain parts of the benefit system including disability benefits.   Therefore, the UK government is wrong to assess people based on a system that will be changing in one year.  The system is not working due to the number of appeals being heard and won by the claimant meaning the administration and decision making is not fit for purpose.   ",
        "background": "It is only fair that sick or disabled citizens in Scotland should have a moratorium on benefit reviews until April 2017 when the Scottish government take over administration of these benefits. ",
