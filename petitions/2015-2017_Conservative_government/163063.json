        "additional_details": "If deemed to be of \"type\" a dog must pose no danger to be exempted. The courts assess the owner and/or keeper to ensure they are a fit and proper person. They ensure premises are secure. Defra brought in SI 138 stating  a dog that cannot live with its registered owner/keeper must be destroyed unless that owner/keeper dies or is seriously ill. This means friendly dogs who have people who are suitable to care for them  must die. This is not protecting the public. Reopen Keepership and repeal SI 138",
        "background": "Repeal SI 138 and allow courts to add a suitable keeper at any point for any reason.  SI 138 does not protect the public - it kills dogs for the sake of killing dogs.",
