        "additional_details": "Osborne is already paid \u00a3650,000 a year for one day\u2019s work a week for fund manager BlackRock. He has earned \u00a3800,000 for 15 speaking engagements in the last year, collects a \u00a3120,000 a year stipend from a US thinktank and has a book deal on top of his \u00a375,000 MP\u2019s salary. He will take up his editorship in mid-May.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, it is a massive conflict of interest to allow a sitting MP to edit a newspaper.  The government should question how this has happened and why it has happened.",
        "background": "George Osborne should step down as Conservative MP for Tatton in Cheshire after his appointment as editor of the London Evening Standard.\r\n\r\nThe British people should question whether he can represent his constituents effectively while editing a daily paper on top of a string of lucrative jobs.
