        "action": "The Government to pay for the funerals of all military veterans.",
        "additional_details": "This policy would cost relatively little as our armed forces generally have not been large. The cost would be a small price to pay as all service personnel put their lives in danger to protect this country. It would also be a final recognition of their contribution to our society and to say a lasting thank you to them and their families and friends. \r\nIf you agree with the above please sign this petition.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "For the benefit of all military veterans who have served in HM Armed Forces for over two years irrespective of their personal finances. Proposed is a \u00a35000 limit per funeral to be claimed from the Ministry of Defence by the family or representatives of the deceased within two months of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
