Surely it cannot be good for the wider public to support people using the benefits system just because they have been unable to turn their lives around after making a concerted effert! This is madness",

Surely its not right people should pay for cautions of a minor nature for up to 6 years after the date of the offence. Reduce the time in which filtering starts",
