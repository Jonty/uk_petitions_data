        "additional_details": "Oil is now around $30 a barrel (at time of writing) down from over $100 dollars a barrel. \r\nThis has meant that fuel in the UK has gone from around \u00a31.40 per litre to 99p. This is the current price we pay as individual consumers.\r\n\r\nBus companies won't tell us how much they pay for their fuel, only they buy it in advance.  \r\nEnough time has passed that they will be making massive savings from the lower price of fuel.\r\nHowever my local bus company increased ticket prices by up to 9.4%.",
        "background": "Countrywide - bus companies are increasing their ticket prices, yet the price of oil and therefore fuel prices at the pump has dropped dramatically over the last few years. None of these savings have been passed onto customers and oil prices are predicted to drop even further in 2016.",

However, local transport authorities (usually local councils) have the power to set maximum fares in some circumstances.\r\n\r\nIf you would like bus fares in your local area to be lower, you could raise this with your local council. You can find out who your local councillor is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\r\nIn order for the UK Government to be able to take action on bus fares directly, Parliament would first need to change the law to give it the power to do this. For example, you could start a petition asking for bus services to be nationalised and fares set at a lower level than they are at the moment, or set with reference to the price of oil."
