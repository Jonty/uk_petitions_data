        "additional_details": "John Bercow has been publically rebuked by the Lord Speaker who has said that Bercow over stepped his mark prematurely. While opposition parties have expressed their concern about President Trump, they have largely been ignored and brushed off as pandering to populism. The government are confusing populism with the majority opinion of the British public and a rise in public political activism. Bercow should NOT face a vote of no confidence. ",
        "background": "On Thursday 9th Feb Tory MP James Duddridge tabled a motion expressing no confidence in John Bercow after his speech in the House of Commons expressing his professional opinion on the subject of the President of the United States Donald Trump and the possibility of his speaking in Parliament.",
