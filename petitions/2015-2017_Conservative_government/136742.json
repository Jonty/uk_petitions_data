        "additional_details": "In 2015, \u00a3150bn was spent of taxpayer money on pensioners who voted to leave the EU. This looks certain to mean another recession and another round of austerity. The NHS can't take any more cuts, we were told during the referendum, so let's protect healthcare spending and cut pensions for those who clearly think we can afford a recession.\r\nhttp://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/budget_pie_ukgs.php",
        "background": "Over 70% of pensioners backed the Leave vote to force Britain out of the EU and likely into a recession. The taxpayer pays more for pensions, than for healthcare, but unlike health the 'triple lock' on pensions guarantees increases of at least 2.5%, inflation or average earnings, whichever is higher",
