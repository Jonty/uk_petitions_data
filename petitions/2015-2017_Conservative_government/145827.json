Negotiations have yet to commence but let's make it clear that we support and value the contributions made to the UK by EU citizens and vice versa. They must be allowed to remain, penalty free in their chosen home countries. Many have made valuable contributions to these countries (including the UK) for many years; give them the opportunity to stay.",
        "background": "Democracy has spoken, and Britain is to leave the EU. Whether you were in favour of remain or exit, we now need to show solidarity. We have to unite and show our support for EU citizens residing in the UK, and similarly, our UK citizens residing in the EU. We want them to feel welcome in our country",
