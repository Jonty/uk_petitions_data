        "action": "Protect our Public parks in England under threat from spending cuts.",
        "additional_details": "The impact of the cuts includes reduced opening hours, an increase in litter, the removal of play equipment, public toilets being shut, a rise in vandalism and an increase in the number of rats.\r\n\r\nThe report says that despite the benefit of public parks, most councils have cut budgets in recent years and further reductions are expected.",
        "background": "The future of many public parks has reached a \"tipping point\" with budgets to maintain them being cut by up to 97%.\r\nA report by the Communities and Local Government Committee warns that the squeeze will mean that some parks face a return to the neglect they suffered in the 1980s and 1990s.",
