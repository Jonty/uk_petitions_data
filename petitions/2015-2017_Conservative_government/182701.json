        "additional_details": "Companies that employ staff also exploit Employment Agencies as they pay agencies less money than they would pay their staff to get work done. Companies don't have to employ agency workers as staff, even when the workers do a fantastic job.\r\n\r\nSome agency workers even come from different countries, and are happy to work for pittance as their foreign value of money is less than ours in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis is extremely unfair and unethical for for British Nationals in their own country.",
        "background": "Employment Agencies exploit workers by acting as middle men to real jobs, they take cuts from already terrible wages, and have ruined chances for secure employment for British Nationals.\r\n\r\nThis drives down the UK living standards, work life balance, and makes it tougher to get real employment.",
