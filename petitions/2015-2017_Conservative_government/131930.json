        "additional_details": "The Act should include:\r\n\u2022\tCriteria for the subjects of referendums \u2013 e.g., in questions of national sovereignty; also specific exclusions e.g., questions of conscience such as abortion and assisted suicide\r\n\u2022\tMandatory intervals between referendums on the same subject (e.g., 30 years)\r\n\u2022\tA specified required level of support in the Commons for referendums (e.g.,  two-thirds of MPs)\r\n\u2022\tA codified assumption that if a referendum fails, the status quo is endorsed \r\n\u2022\tProvisions to ensure that referendum outcomes are endorsed by a majority in the electorate (e.g., by \u201cdouble majorities\u201d or two-thirds support as for constitutional questions in the USA.)\r\n\u2022\tA ban on simplistic questions which can be answered with Yes or No.\r\n",
        "background": "We believe that the use of referendums should be avoided, as they undermine the process of representative government on which our parliamentary system depends.\r\n\r\nWe therefore call upon the Government to introduce to Parliament legislation to create a UK Referendums Act  to regulate their use. \r\n\r\n",
