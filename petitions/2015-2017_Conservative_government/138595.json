The UK Government has no plans to change the voting age.\"\r\n\r\nWe contest the logic behind this decree. How should it be that a 16 year old is fit to join the army and fight and die overseas but not to have a stake in their country's future?",
        "background": "16 year olds can die for their country. They are not allowed to vote in the UK, even though the Scottish Referendum proved they can responsibly vote.\r\nGiven the call for a re-vote, and the importance to their future, in any future referendum on the EU, 16 and 17 year olds should be allowed to vote.",
