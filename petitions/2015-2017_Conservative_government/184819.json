As you rise up the pay ranges, you could earn as much as \u00a3115,582 as a head...' However on the same web page it states an unqualified teacher can receive a minimum of \u00a316,461.

Therefore rights for starting pay should be the same, and the professionalism of the early years should be further recognised. ",
