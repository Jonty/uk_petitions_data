        "additional_details": "Animal Aid investigated nine randomly chosen UK slaughterhouses and found breaches of welfare laws in eight. Animals were shown being kicked, slapped, stamped on, beaten, punched, burned with cigarettes, and picked up by their fleeces and ears and thrown into pens. It showed inadequate, botched and multiple stunning, and the sadistic use of stunning equipment to \u2018punish\u2019 animals.\r\n\r\nNeither the government-appointed on-site vets nor the slaughterhouse operators detected a single illegal act that we filmed.",
        "background": "Properly monitored CCTV would deter abuse, encourage best practice, help with staff training, and provide evidence for prosecutions.",
