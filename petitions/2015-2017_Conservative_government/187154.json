        "action": "Urge the government to extend Help to Buy to include old properties.",
        "additional_details": "The help to buy scheme could be really useful if it were extended to include older properties. The government should also charge a percentage identical to the bank of England base rate after the 5yr free period. If the UK government is serious about helping Londoners get on the ladder they should revise the Help to Buy scheme immediately to include older properties as house builders have pushed up the cost of new builds at an alarming rate. Not everyone wants a new build.",
        "background": "The Government has dragged it's heels dealing with the housing crisis in London so as a result we need to urge them to do more regarding affordable housing. One of the things the government can and should do is extend the Help to Buy scheme to include older properties.",
