        "action": "Admit historic errors in the middle east, call for international de-escalation.",
        "additional_details": "In recent history, foreign interference in the middle east reads like a catalogue of blunders (for e.g. the clearly vested interests in the events leading to the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the 2003 invasion of Iraq under false pretences). Picking a random side and providing any kind of military support always results in a more extreme and radical group emerging in the aftermath. We should certainly continue to render humanitarian aid and take on refugees, but not continue to worsen the siutation.",
        "background": "The only long-term solution to the terrorism we now face is to withdraw all foreign military presence from the middle east. Britain should set an example by admitting it is part of the problem, beginning the de-escalation, and using existing international relationships to encourage other nations.",
