        "additional_details": "It's visible for all to see that the political landscape is shaped by donations. Rich company owners tend to donate to the Conservatives knowing that taxbreaks and sway can be brought. The Labour party, the unions in the hope of sway to the working classes. There is often controversy that surrounds them, and what they may have \"brought\" is often pondered.End donations and you end up with people who serve the people. And politicians should be drugs tested to make sure they are abiding by the Law.",
        "background": "Stop big Business from running the country. End political \"donations\" and have MP's solely funded by the state so that they cannot be swayed into voting for something that is outside of the common good. This should include transparency of claims. I also call for random drugs testing of ministers.",
