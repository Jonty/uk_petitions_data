        "additional_details": "The disabled wait patiently and also anxiously for the DWP to write to them regarding applying for Personal Independence Payment, stating that Disability Living Allowance is to end.   The DWP\u2019s decision is obviously to measure the degree of disability and whether that warrants financial support from the government \u2013 this is logical.  But people who are disabled feel, and quite rightly so, that the Government if not championing their rights but choosing to source out the assessment to a Target Driven Private Company Assessor and, because the individual\u2019s disability is open to interpretation, on a very stressful occasion of the consultation with the DWP Contractor Assessor this can give rise to an incorrect assessment being recorded.",
        "background": "The Government appears not to support the disabled because they are not making sure DWP assessments are water-tight.",
