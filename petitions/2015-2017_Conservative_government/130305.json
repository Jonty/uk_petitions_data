They need to ban this. Nowadays there are greenery found wherever you live and if not it can be played in the front or rear of gardens. Whom will pay for the damages to property, vehicles",

You can use this page to find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\r\nIf you would like Parliament to make a law to ban ball games in any residential area across the country, you could start a new petition asking for that.
