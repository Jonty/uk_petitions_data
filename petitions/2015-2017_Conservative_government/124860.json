        "additional_details": "It is estimated 1 in 4 people in Britain suffer from, or have suffered from some form of Mental illness. There is a lot of Stigma attached to this distressing condition, many do not seek help because of the risk of verbal or physical abuse, and live a life of seclusion, often resulting in suicide. Those who seek help, cannot find it as there is nowhere to go, GP's are not trained in this field, and cannot make a diagnosis or know what to prescribe. Mental Health resources must be increased. ",
        "background": "Mental illness is an illness like any other. Yet cuts to resources are continuously being made, and those who need help, cannot always find it, living a life of seclusion and loneliness. You can see a broken arm or leg, but you cannot see a broken mind, often leading to despair.   ",
