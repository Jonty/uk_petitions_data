        "additional_details": "Evidence from America in 2013 showed that gambling was just as addictive as drugs and alcohol.\r\nWe believe the Government should act to ban the scourge of FOBTs from our high streets.\r\nReducing the stake from \u00a3100 down to \u00a32 will not solve the problem.\r\nOnly by making FOBTs illegal will help in tackling the very real problem of gambling addiction.\r\nWhilstever the Government pursues a policy of \"Responsible gambling\", the issue of gambling addiction will continue.\r\nA more robust approach is needed\r\n",
        "background": "Following the Gambling Act of 2005, Fixed Odds Betting Terminals have become a feature in Bookmakers shops on our high streets.\r\nFOBTs are highly addictive and users can lose up to \u00a3100 in under 30 seconds.\r\nWe believe the Government should act and give Local Councils powers to ban FOBTs.",
