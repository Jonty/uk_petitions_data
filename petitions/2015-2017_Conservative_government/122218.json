        "additional_details": "Apprentices working full time (40hrs p/w) are required to pay for various medical tests/items such as eyetests, prescriptions etc. \r\nAs a young person, training to offer support and education to the children of Britain, why am I not supported by our government? I propose the government either highers the national minimum wage for apprentices, or offers financial help to our familes whome we still live with and therefore have to carry on supporting us (as if we are still in full time education).",
        "background": "Apprenticeships are becoming an increasingly popular way for young people to begin their working life. I believe that it is completely unreasonable to pay 16-18 year olds only \u00a33.30p/h. Please could this wage be reviewed or more help/financial support offered to familes of apprentices. ",
