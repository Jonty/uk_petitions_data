        "action": "Remove all of the violent verses from the Islamic Quran",
        "additional_details": "Unlike the Christian Bible the Quran has never been reformed and acts of violence in the name of Christ have rarely happened since the 16th Century yet extreme violence in the name of Islam today is a common everyday occurence.\r\nThis has to be changed. All existing Qurans containing extreme violence to anyone who does not agree with it should be banned and a new revised Quran issued.\r\nWithout the Quran being reformed extreme Islam will persist and be taught daily in the UK \r\n",
        "background": "There are at least 100 graphic verses in the Quran which calls for extreme violence and death against non-believers and people with alternative lifestyles.\r\nThese verses are responsible for countless deaths and if any other book was published that incited such violence it would be banned immediately",
