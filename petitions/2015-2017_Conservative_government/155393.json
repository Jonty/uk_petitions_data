        "additional_details": "Brexiters pointed to an undemocratic EU so let's exercise our democratic right and get him out. \r\n \r\nThis video of Farage addressing the European Parliament shows clearly why he should not represent Britain. \r\n \r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/28/meps-boo-nigel-farage-insults-in-european-parliament \r\n \r\nFarage tells MEPs we need to be grown up and shows clearly he can't be. More than ever we need diplomacy and calm. We need a voice that represents all our views.",
        "background": "Mr Farage is not helping the process of negotiating UK's exit from the EU. His performance infront of MEPs today (28 June) makes it clear that he is antagonistic and frankly rude. This isn't about Remain or Brexit. It is about finding a new way of working with Europe now Britain has voted to leave.",
