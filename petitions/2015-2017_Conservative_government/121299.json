        "additional_details": "Mr Hunt has consistently misused statistics and evidence to support his claims. He has consistently used these statistics to push through his plans for a 7-day NHS.\r\nHe has also treated doctors as though they have been misled by their union. Doctors are intelligent enough to see through his spin and political lies that he has told. \r\nThe public now expect more strikes, resignations and moves abroad. Future doctors will either go elsewhere or not pursue a career in Medicine.",
        "background": "The current Secretary of State, Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt MP has mismanaged the NHS and has placed its future at further risk. He has treated junior doctors as idiots (when they are more intelligent than he is) and he has now set the wheels in motion for resignations and moves abroad.",
