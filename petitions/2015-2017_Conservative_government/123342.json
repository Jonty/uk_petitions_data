        "additional_details": "Yet on many if not all legal certificates and documents only space is there for one mother or one father and then an additional space for parent. If or when a child decides to marry they too will be faced with who to name, as there is space for only one of their mothers or fathers, by changing the wording to parents this will avoid the confusion and recognise the make up of their family. ",
        "background": "In 2014 a bill was won to include mothers names on marriage certificates, this still doesn't reflect the way we live, as some families will be made up of two mothers or two fathers and legal guardians who are ALL the parents of the children.",
