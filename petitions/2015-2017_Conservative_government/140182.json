        "action": "Allow ALL resident EU citizens a vote in any future referendum on EU membership",
        "additional_details": "We believe that the recent referendum on membership of the European union was unfair and biased in that it did not allow a vote to European Union citizens resident in the UK, a group with considerable interest in the outcome of the referendum, which is allowed to vote in most elections. Yet a large number of British passport holders living overseas WERE allowed to vote. Therefore we call upon the government to address this matter in any future referendum. ",
        "background": "In light of the fact that a second referendum will be necessary before article 50 can be invoked, we call on the government to ensure that in any future referendum on the subject of Britain's membership of the European Union, voting should be open to ALL EU citizens resident in the UK.",
