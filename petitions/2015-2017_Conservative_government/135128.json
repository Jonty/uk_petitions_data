        "action": "Secure the UK's membership of the European Single Market as soon as possible.",
        "additional_details": "Recent turmoil in the financial markets and the precipitous decline in the value of sterling have demonstrated the importance of economic certainty and the UK's membership of the Single Market. The EU is the UK's most important trading partner. Securing tariff-free access to imports and exports of goods and services is critical to UK economic growth, jobs and public services.  ",
        "background": "Following the result of the referendum on the UK's membership of the EU this petition calls on the new government to do everything within its means to secure the UK's membership of the Single Market as soon as possible. This will save jobs, economic growth and indirectly funding for public services.",
