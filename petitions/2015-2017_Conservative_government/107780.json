        "additional_details": "I have passed my test this year with flying colours. My insurance cost me \u00a32000 for this year. \r\n\r\nI drive everyday and see at least 10 percent of older people not looking at junctions, roundabouts and even when driving in general. Yet they pay less than 10 percent of my insurance for theirs. How is this fair. \r\n\r\nThe strike system will work as such \r\nNo strikes - cheap insurance \r\nOne strike - \"normal\" rates \r\n\r\nA strike is - one point or more, any motoring offence that was the policy holders fault. ",
        "background": "I would like to make action because young drivers all over Great Britain are struggling to afford to drive, the government gives young drivers the chance to drive but insurers do not . Insurance prices are usually more than the car cost it's self. ",
