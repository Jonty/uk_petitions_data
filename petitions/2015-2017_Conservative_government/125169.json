        "additional_details": "When you are a European citizen who has been working and living in the UK for 18 years - had I been born here I could vote in General Elections. Someone whose home is in Britain - whose family & friends are British. Someone who works hard and looks after her 'home': her street, her neighbourhood, her village, her town, her city, her region, her country. However, your 'country' does not allow you to look after it. You cannot choose a Prime Minister because you are not allowed full suffrage. ",
        "background": "Many of us have lived & worked in the UK for most of our adult lives. Some of us have studied here too. We feel British: our families, our friends are British. This is our nation and we form the British society.\r\nBritish-borns earn full suffrage at 18. Commonwealth citizenships can vote straightaway",
