        "additional_details": "Employers use current salary as a baseline to make an offer to a successful candidate, leading to a situation where two candidates can be paid vastly different amounts for the same role \u2013 this discourages social mobility and gender equality by ensuring that employees who are paid less than their colleagues are unable to catch up even when moving jobs.   Candidates can also fail to be considered for a role if their current salary is not in the same range as the role they are applying for.   \r\n",
        "background": "Candidates are often dismissed as unsuitable if their current salary is more than 10% removed from the salary of the role they are applying for.  This discourages career advancement as well as job mobility between industries with different pay grades.  Candidates should be assessed on merit alone.\r\n",
