        "additional_details": "According to polling company Ipsos MORI prior to the referendum:\r\n(i) 47% believed the UK sends \u00a3350 million a week to the EU\r\n(ii) 11% cited \"Impact on public services\" as the main reason for their decision\r\n17,410,742 voted to leave. 11% and then 47% is 900,135. If only 3/4 voted to remain after learning the \u00a3350 million figure was incorrect, this would have resulted in a majority remain vote. It is likely higher, this would have been a significant consideration for all 1.7 million NHS employees.",
        "background": "At least 900,135 persons voted to leave due to Vote Leave implying that \u00a3350m/week sent to the EU would be reallocated to the NHS. This has been branded \"misleading\" by the UK Statistics Authority. As this number of votes decided the outcome of the referendum, the result must be declared invalid.",
