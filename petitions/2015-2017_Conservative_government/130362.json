        "additional_details": "With the varied holiday times, the holiday companies will have no focus on raising prices in school holidays and it will be levelled out throughout the year- making it fair for everyone. ",
        "background": "Since the recent court case allowing a Father to let his daughter have three weeks off on holiday to avoid paying ridiculous holiday fees, this spurred me on with this debate. I think that there should be an allowance for both students and staff for a two weeks in the year during the school term.",
