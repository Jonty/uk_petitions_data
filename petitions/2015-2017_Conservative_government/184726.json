        "additional_details": "This is not the 19th century where our Victorian forbears really were innovative and had great reasons to build. They were investing in the great Industrial revolution for it to work then and there. The HS2 project will come to \"fruition\" in 30 years time and by that time, it is very possible it will be out of date. Businessmen can work on trains and often this journey is beneficial to a meeting. Cutting the journey time by 20 minutes is a false economy, whilst so many other projects need funds.",
        "background": "The previous Labour Gov't and subsequent administrations are grandstanding to create a new railway, which will make the journey between London and Birmingham 20 minutes shorter. This will destroy so many pretty villages and people's homes & at present is estimated to cost between \u00a350 & \u00a380 billion.",
