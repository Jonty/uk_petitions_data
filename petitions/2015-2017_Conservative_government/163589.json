        "additional_details": "President Obama's 2013 bill allowed adrenaline auto-injector use and training in schools for acute asthma and anaphylaxis with a Good Samaritan proviso. National Review of Asthma Deaths NRAD 2014 said \"consider auto injectors if a patient had a previous life-threat attack or near fatal episode\", which is no help in first time attacks. EpiPen, Jext, and Emerade needles pass through clothing injecting drug into thigh muscle; 2 or 3 injections may be needed. Ref. doi:10.1136/thoraxjnl-2015-207207",
        "background": "Out of hospital asthma attacks kill 800 per year. News reports attest to the helplessness of parents and bystanders. At autopsy lungs are blocked with mucus plugs. Intramuscular adrenaline opens airways, reduces mucus, allows cough, and on arrival paramedics give it as part of severe asthma guidance",
