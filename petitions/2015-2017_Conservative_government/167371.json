The same ability to put forward opinions for consideration is available to all elected leaders, many of whom do so.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is the residents of London who fund the services provided by the Greater London Authority via precepts and therefore up to them to hold the Mayor to account at the ballot box.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Communities and Local Government",
