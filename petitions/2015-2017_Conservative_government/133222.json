More needs to be done to make it law that if there is a road accident involving a cat it should be reported and the animal taken to the nearest vet so that the owner can be notified properly and the owners and their families are spared the heartache of not knowing what happened to their cat. Cats are just as important as dogs",
        "background": "I've lost two of my precious cats to the road when they were hit by a car and the driver drove off. One in 2013 on my street she was taken to the vet by a passers-by. On Monday another cat of mine was hit and the driver drove off and left him. A pedestrian saw my cat and reported it to the RSPCA.",
