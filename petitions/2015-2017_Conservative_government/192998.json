        "additional_details": "On Monday 27th March, it looks likely the cross party talks to restore Stormont are going to fail.\r\n\r\nWe have had enough, they take us as a bunch of mugs who dont care what they do, well its time to stop!  We want their pay stopped until they get back to work, dealing with the proper political elements of Northern Ireland - Health, education, jobs, inward investment not tribal politics.\r\n\r\nWhile this may be a devolved issue, we feel the UK government should debate it as its the UK who pay the wages.",
        "background": "The people of N. Ireland are sick of its elected representatives not doing their job and we want their pay stopped until they go back to work.\r\nMartin McGuinness resigning to force an election in January, not even a year after the previous election is fair enough, but its time to get back to it!",
