        "action": "Impeach Mandelson for treason but at the  very least, revoke his ennoblement.",
        "additional_details": "Britain is leaving the EU.  It is in a very delicate situation with regard to negotiations for a post Brexit agreement.  Mandelson has deliberately and knowingly given succour to the 'enemy' in a very adversarial situation.  His actions are a deliberate attempt to negate what is a crucial negotiation for the UK and is akin to that of William Joyce who was prosecuted under the 1351 Treason Act.  There can be no other interpretation of his intents and as such, he should be impeached.",
        "background": "Mandelson has stated in a foreign newspaper unambiguously that the EU should ignore British wishes and do what is best for the EU.  This is to the detriment of the prosperity of Britain.   He has uttered what could be recognised as treason and he should be investigated and stripped of ennoblement.",
