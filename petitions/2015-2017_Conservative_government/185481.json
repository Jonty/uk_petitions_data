        "additional_details": "Home to car racing since 1962, Wimbledon Stadium is mostly unknown to people outside of the motorsport community. Yet every Sunday upwards of 2,000 spectators pay \u00a315 to watch five hours of stock car and banger racing across wildly different formulae.\r\nThe future of this community is under threat as the local council has approved plans for a developer to build 602 new homes on the site as well as a 20,000-seater stadium for the AFC Wimbledon football team.",
        "background": "I have gone to see the racing every Sunday for as long as I can remember with my family. I love this stadium, it is one of my favorite places. It has been home to car racing since 1962 and is the last oval racing stadium in London. It is to become a football stadium for AFC Wimbledon and flats.  ",
