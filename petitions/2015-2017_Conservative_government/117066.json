        "additional_details": "Over the last 5 years we have seen serious flooding with danger for lives in several areas in the UK. Somerset, Cumbria, Lancashire, the cities of York and Leeds and Greater Manchester have all been subject to serious flooding. Other parts of the U.K. are also constantly at risk.\r\nThe damage is severe, emotional and financial and it all can be prevented if the government would be willing to allocate the funding to it. It will require a lot of money over many years, it needs to be done.",
        "background": "Over the last decade we have experienced serious flooding in several parts of the country. This could all be prevented by setting up the UK version of the Dutch Delta Plan to manage water levels in the UK. It works for the Dutch, so it should work for the People of The United Kingdom.",
