The reason as to why the U.K shouldn't follow in the steps of the US is also made apparent. ",
        "background": "The USA dropped the MOAB on Afghanistan today. Of course this was done to destroy 'ISIS' tunnels, but a bomb of this scale is clearly unproportionate to the threat. This act almost made Afghanistan seem like a testing ground to the US. I urge the UK government to condemn such action and not follow.",
