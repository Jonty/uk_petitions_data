        "additional_details": "TFL offers just 1/3 off of tube, overground and bus fares for student's, often amounting to just 50 pence off final costs. Having to commute to and from university daily is a financial struggle for most. Student's who are required to travel in London as part of their course feel the force of expensive travel, and would benefit greatly from free travel cards. Tuition fees are already set to increase to \u00a39,250 from 2017, furthering the already despairing financial situation that students are in.  ",
        "background": "Living as a student in London is extremely expensive. The majority, if not all of a student's loan is taken away due to the high cost of rent. Adding to this, many student's have to travel to, and from university via public transport, struggling to find money for travel they simply do not have.",
