        "action": "Make the HPV vaccine programme aimed towards both sexes instead of only females.",
        "additional_details": "Males are not encouraged to receive this vaccine before sexual activity based on the logic that if females don't have the HPV infections then males won't receive them through sexual contact. This leaves males who have sex with males vulnerable to the infections as well as ignoring the benefits the injection has to prevent multiple cancers. The NHS has been encouraging this change for years yet no action has been taken, leaving males uneducated in the matter and at risk of major health hazards.",
        "background": "The HPV vaccine (the 'jab' females are highly recommended to get before sexual activity) is not only necessary for females but males as well to help prevent anal, throat and penile cancers, as well as over 100 types of HPV diseases.",
