        "additional_details": "There is an option for carers to pay the money that takes them over in to a pension, but many carers need every penny, living week to week so they can ensure bills for them and the person they care for are paid. Carers should be able to work with out the stress of having to drop hours or give up work because the government fails to provide adequate support to a group of people that help save the NHS \u00a3130 billion.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.carersuk.org",
        "background": "Over 40,000 full time carers also work part time. The recent rise in minimum wage took 16 hour workers to \u00a3120 a week. the carers allowance threshold is \u00a3116 per week. Carers now face losing \u00a362.70 themselves, plus a \u00a330 carers premium paid to the cared for if they cant drop work hours",
