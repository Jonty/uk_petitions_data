        "additional_details": "By consorting with Donald Trump, Theresa May is acting as an ambassador for all British citizens, and by proxy, we are endorsing his behaviour and not condemning it. \r\n\r\nA vote of no confidence would bring about a general election, and we would have a PM that actually speaks for the majority of the UK, as opposed to an unelected \"voice of the people\". ",
        "background": "Theresa May, the unelected Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is intent on a 'Special Relationship\" with a facist, misogynistic President and has shown little regard for public opinion. \r\n\r\nWe call for a vote of no confidence and a general election, to bring in an elected PM who speaks for us.
