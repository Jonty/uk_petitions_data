        "additional_details": "There is no logical reason for delaying the invoking of Article 50, the decision to leave the EU has been decided through democratic process. Why these delay tactics are being used is anyone's guess but it is certainly putting this country in a precarious financial position it has not need to be in. David Cameron do the right thing by Britain! Invoke Article 50 now!",
        "background": "June 23rd 2016 the people of Britain democratically voted in favour of leaving the European Union. There can be no delay in Invoking Article 50 because our leaving increases the risk of a eurozone collapse, which could leave Britain liable for massive bailout costs if we haven't invoked Article 50.
