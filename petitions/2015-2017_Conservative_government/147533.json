        "action": "Consider over turning the decision by the Lords on minimum referendum voting age",
        "additional_details": "The rules governing voting age relates to general elections which are far from final as they have a short tenure. The referendum is a final decision that in principle will not be revisited, hence the general election rules should not apply.\r\n\r\nAdditionally there is an inequity and a double standard if we do not allow the young to make an informed and measured decision on there future. A poor lesson that cannot be sanctioned by a fair government that wishes to hear the voice of all it's people.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Consider the injustice to those currently aged 16 & 17 unable to vote on an issue which affects them as much as anybody else (if not more). Indeed as there is a minimum 2 year delay in actioning the results of the referendum using simple maths suggests they deserve a right to vote for equities sake.",
