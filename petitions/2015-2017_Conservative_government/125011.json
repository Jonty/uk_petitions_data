        "action": "Stop using schools as polling stations",
        "additional_details": "Every year schools are closed to be used as polling stations during local elections, general elections and referendums, causing disruption to education and cost to parents. Given that the government has placed such high importance on school attendance (fining parents \u00a360 for a day missed) it is hypocritical closing schools to save money during elections, particularly when the cost falls on parents. Schools cannot remain open with the general public on the premises so alternatives should be found",
        "background": "Thousands of schools close during elections for use as polling stations.  This is extremely disruptive to children's education and costs parents in terms of lost earnings, annual leave or childcare.  Schools are seen as the easy option, when alternative facilities could be made available.",
