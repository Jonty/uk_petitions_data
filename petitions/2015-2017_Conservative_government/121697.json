        "action": "We demand that the government seek to bring the railways into public ownership.",
        "additional_details": "(a) The demand for public ownership: \r\n\r\n- Cross party support in the House of Commons for the Railways Bill since 2013. \r\n- 66% of voters support. (YouGov 2013)\r\n- FOUR major transport unions back it. (TSSA, ASLEF, UNITE and RMT)\r\n\r\n(b) The dire need for it:\r\n\r\n-Rail fares have risen THREE times faster than wages in the last 5 years.\r\n\r\n- Rail fares gobble up at least 13% of the average monthly pay packet.\r\n\r\n- Fares rise year upon year. 25% since 2010.\r\n\r\n- If nationalised, you could cut fares by 62p per \u00a31",
        "background": "The UK's rail network is state owned... but not by the British state. It belongs to no fewer than two other European governments! The rest of it is owned and ran by private companies.\r\nFares are rising year upon year. Quality isn't... \r\n\r\nWe want a people's rail. A rail ran in people's interests",
