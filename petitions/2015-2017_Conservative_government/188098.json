        "additional_details": "Planned obsolescence is an immoral practice common among manufacturers.  \r\n\r\nThe law should force manufacturers to tell consumers how long their products will last as well as informing consumers for how long spare parts for the product will be available. \r\n\r\nThis could save consumers thousands of pounds, prevent environmental waste and potentially reinvigorate the repair industry. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Planned obsolescence is a policy of intentionally designing a product so it will become obsolete after a certain period of time. The practice is immoral to the consumer, wastes resources and is harmful to the environment. Manufacturers should be legally required to state how long a product will last",
