        "additional_details": "Lord Dubs said: \"Britain has a proud history of welcoming refugees. At a time when Donald Trump is banning refugees from America, it would be shameful if the UK followed suit by closing down this route to sanctuary for unaccompanied children just months after it was opened.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Croydon, the Rt Revd Jonathan Clark, who has been involved with the church's efforts to welcome child migrants, said the government was \"in effect helping the trafficking industry\". - BBC News (8/02/2017)",
        "background": "The Home Office has decided to end the Dubs amendment which proposed a commitment to take in 3000 of the most vulnerable child refugees at the end of March.
