        "additional_details": "If Remain gets \u00a39.3m to spend on a leaflet and a big army of taxpayer funded civil servants to pump out pro-EU propaganda, then the Leave side should be given the same advantages. Nothing else would be fair.\r\n\r\n\"It is vital that the Government allows this debate to be conducted in a free and fair manner \u2013 or the British people will never forgive them",
        "background": "The public were promised by the Government they would play fair in the referendum, but it is becoming increasingly evident they will do anything to stitch up this vote in their favour.\r\nThe Government is ripping up the rule book because it knows Remain is losing all the key arguments.",
