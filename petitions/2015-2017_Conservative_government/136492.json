Therefore the result will be more representative because at the moment having 28% of the population not voting isn't a true representation. Even though there is a number of 17 year olds who are uneducated on the matter. There is also a load of 18-65+ year olds who also are. ",
        "background": "The % of 18-25 year olds who voted to leave the EU was 24% and then 64% voted to remain. Where as people 65+ voted to remain in a percentage of 33% and the percentage to leave was 58%. Therefore, it's clear that the people this decision effects most aren't being listened to. It isn't representative.",
