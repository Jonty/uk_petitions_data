        "additional_details": "Popular media channels are awash with the public pleading with so called subject matter experts to present objective facts to add credibility to the either the 'in' or 'out' campaigns. \r\n\r\nWe propose that the referendum be delayed until such time that both cases can be presented fairly and properly to the public.",
        "background": "Leaving,  or remaining within, the EU is a huge decision with far reaching implications. As yet, a satisfactory, objective method of educating the decisions makers (the public) on the facts has yet to be discovered.  More time is needed to lay out the case, so the public can decide, based on facts.",
