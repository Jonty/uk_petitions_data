        "additional_details": "I do realise that by releasing some political prisoners, Venezuela won't just suddenly recuperate. However, all of those political prisoners should be released as they were just expressing their thoughts. Has Maduro's regime sunk so low that it won't even allow its opponents to express themselves?",
        "background": "The first time I heard that Leopoldo Lopez was arrested and convicted, I knew that it was a political move against the opposition. He never incited any violence, some protesters clashed with police because of the simple fact they are tired. Tired of corruption, crime and a failing economy.",
