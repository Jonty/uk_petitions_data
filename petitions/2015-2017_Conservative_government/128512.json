There is no way to replace these with brand new ditches never mind maintain the integrity of the drainage system that ultimately prevents many villages and towns on the Levels from flooding. Gwent Wildlife Trust is running a drop-in session where they will speak about the impacts of the proposed Relief Road on the environment.",
