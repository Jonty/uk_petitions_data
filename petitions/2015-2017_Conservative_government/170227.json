The last Governments have pursued austerity policies, and have not invested this additional income to fund health, education, and housing systems. Instead, foreigners are have been blamed to put pressure on these systems.\r\nThe Government is not accountable to foreigners because they have no right to vote. This is against the spirit of John Hampden, English great patriot, who first claimed \"no taxation without representation\"",

There are millions of people living, working, and paying taxes in the UK, but with no right to participate to national politics with their vote. Parliament and Government do not represent them, and should not dispose of the tax revenues raised through their work.",
