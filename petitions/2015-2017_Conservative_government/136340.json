        "additional_details": "Given a great deal of the Brexit campaign was highlighting how wrong it is that leaders of the EU are unelected - how on Earth could we allow our next Prime Minister to be exactly that. \r\nYou have good reason to demand this as it is this exact kind of warped democracy that the UK has voted against! \r\n\r\nSign the petition and DEMAND that YOU CHOOSE who takes our nation into the post-Brexit future. ",
        "background": "It would be entirely hypocritical and an insult to the UK population for the Conservation Party to put in post an unelected Prime Minister. For this reason it is surely mandatory for a General Election to take place in order for the nation to elect it's Prime Minister. ",
