        "additional_details": "Misrepresentation of the facts and consequences  has led to an invalid result.\r\n\r\nThe promise to give extra funds to the NHS was false, house values are falling in the UK, Sterling has fallen by 10%, industry are already discussing moving to other labour markets and  the major political parties are in turmoil.\r\n\r\nAlso, Scotland may have another referendum and there is the possibility of trouble in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe role of the EU in creating UK law has been greatly exaggerated in the press.",
        "background": "We believe that the result of the EU referendum does not, in fact, represent the true wishes of the majority of the British people and the implementation of Article 50 will have negative consequences for British society and the economy.",
