        "additional_details": "MPs have a responsibility to reflect the views of the people who voted them into power. People vote based on the political climate, the parties\u2019 manifestos, and the parties\u2019 leadership structures. The EU referendum has caused major upheaval to the political climate and the main political parties. We believe the UK public deserve a chance to re-elect based on transparent plans for the future and the new structures of the main parties following the referendum. ",
        "background": "The priorities of all the main Parliamentary parties have changed significantly after the EU referendum. To ensure that the Government reflects the wishes of the electorate, we call for a motion of no confidence in the hope of triggering a General Election as soon as possible.",
