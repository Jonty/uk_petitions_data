        "additional_details": "Teachers have stated it to be totally unfair, and it shouldn't be this way. Students in the past would've studied knowing that it wouldn't be too hard but now that the matter has gone towards being so unfair and A level difficultly, students won't bother revising or even studying at all. My question to you is, will this even help us students get better grades or is it making the matter worse for everyone else?",
        "background": "Personally, the new GCSEs are way harder which is unfair and puts more stress into our minds which is not helpful in any way. If the examination board want to make it harder for us, then why not set more strict limits to the marking rather than bringing down A level topics into the GCSE curriculm?",
