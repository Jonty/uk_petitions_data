        "additional_details": "Small schools cannot provide the free school meals for the costs allocated because they cannot buy in stock in the large quantities required to get the biggest discounts. The government has been giving them extra funding to allow for this.\r\n\r\nThe Conservatives are now talking about removing this extra allocation to small schools, who will be unable to provide free school meals to pupils without it, so children will go hungry.",
        "background": "If parents are in receipt of means tested benefits, their children of school age qualify for free school meals, giving them a hot meal during the school day. \r\n\r\nFor some children, this is their only hot meal of the day and, for an increasing number of children, it is their only meal they will get.",
