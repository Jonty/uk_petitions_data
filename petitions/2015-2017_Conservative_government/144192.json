        "additional_details": "Tabloid headlines on clear view in every supermarket, filling station and corner shop carried partisan messages and misleading photographs that no politician would dare to utter. They even pretended to put words into the mouth of HM the Queen. Meanwhile, a poster campaign took the debate away from reasoned debate by showing pictures designed to please the xenophobic voters. In short, there was never a reasoned political debate, it was a campaign of who tells the biggest whoppers, wins. ",

If I arrived at my decision based on lies told by people who knew full well they were lying, I have been cheated.",
