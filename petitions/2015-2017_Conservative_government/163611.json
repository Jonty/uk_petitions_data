        "additional_details": "How are we supposed to defend ourselves in modern day Britain from threats that didn't exist at the time these outdated laws were passed? Well under the current law we simply cannot. I believe everybody has the right to protect themselves and in this day and age it is all the more crucial that we can. So I propose a change in the law to allow at least pepper spray and mini stun devices legal to carry and use in public for self defence.",
        "background": "In the ever increasing threat we face today in Britain from terrorism and rising crime rates I want to make simple but effective self defence items legal to use in public. For example Pepper spray and mini stun devices. (Please read more)",
