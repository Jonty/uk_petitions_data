        "additional_details": "The leaders of the winning vote immediately backtracked,  retracting statements that they had used to secure votes. For example:\r\n\r\n- \u00a3350 million EU membership fee is not being rerouted to the NHS. \r\n\r\nMembers of the public have been researching 'what is the EU' after the event, indicating that they are clearly not informed. Examples:\r\n\r\n- Admitting they only voted to even the win/lose percentage.\r\n\r\n- Admitting they voted based on issues that aren't affected by EU membership.",
        "background": "After an election that will, and has already, monumentally affected the UK it has become clear that the majority vote was attained with lies. Many voters clearly don't know what they voted for. Democracy based on lies is not democracy and should not be treated as such.",
