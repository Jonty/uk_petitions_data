        "additional_details": "So, a new law has come into force for drivers using/holding mobile devices whilst operating a motor vehicle on a public highway.\r\nA \u00a3200 fine and six points is not enough. Even though the new law has been well publicised people still carry on doing it. Also impose an immediate 2 year driving ban for all not just new drivers. Drivers using mobile phones whilst driving are more dangerous than uninsured drivers. Vehicles and mobile devices should be destroyed just like an uninsured vehicle. ",
        "background": "On average reaction times for drink drivers are actually less than those using a mobile device behind the wheel, yet drink drive penalties are tougher. The only way to really stop people using a device whilst driving is to destroy the vehicle/device and inforce an immediate 2 year driving ban.",
