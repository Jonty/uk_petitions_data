A total of 346 written responses were received through the online and paper survey. The CCG advises that the response to the prescribing proposals was predominantly positive, with over 70% of respondents agreeing that the CCG should stop providing self-care medications. \r\n\r\nCroydon CCG recognises the concerns of those people who currently receive these products on prescription and has advised it will work closely with local communities, Croydon pharmacists and GPs to support people to find affordable alternatives. \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health",
