        "action": "Repeal the Arbitration Act 1996 and outlaw Sharia Courts across the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Over 28,000 terror attacks have occurred since 9/11, nearly 200 in the last month. After the attack in Nice, these people are willing to use all means necessary to destroy the liberal way of life. Why does the UK remain complicit in allowing religious bodies of law to exert powers within our criminal justice system? Sharia Law takes direct orders from the Quran: a book that instructs its subjects to murder non-believers and other forms of 'blasphemy'. This should be considered extrajudicial.",
        "background": "Our secular, democratic and liberal institutions should remain completely non-partisan with religious affairs. It is completely unlawful and illiberal to allow specific religions be given preferential treatment and create methods of dispute outside of the criminal justice system.",
