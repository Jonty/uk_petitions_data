        "action": "Restoration of Right of Appeal on Immigration Applications of Elderly Parents",
        "additional_details": "Before current Immigration Rules and Policy Guidance an automatic right of appeal existed for refusal of immigration cases. The Home Office\u2019s refusal decision could further be challenged in a Court of Law (Tribunal) and an immigrant could put his/her case forward to an Immigration judge. But not any more! The Government has replaced it with something called an \u2018Administrative Review\u2019 \u2013 which basically means you have no right of appeal before an independent judge. ",
        "background": "\r\n\r\nThat right of Appeal has been taken away from all immigrants including children, elderly people and the infirm. We demand that appeal rights be restored in order for the fair, open and democratic Legal system in this country. Elderly parents are the most adversely affected category. ",
