        "additional_details": "As a carer I am expected to start my shift at say 7am and be available until 2pm but I will only get paid for the minutes I am in with a client plus minimum travel time. Not only are carers on zero hours contracts they are also paid minimum wage and do not get paid for a full shift even though they are available to work. Would we expect a fireman to only get paid when he is putting a fire out or a receptionist to only be paid when they type a letter? Carers need to know what they will earn.",
        "background": "As a carer I could start my shift at 7am and finish at 2pm but may only be paid for 4 hours work because the Councils pay care companies for the minutes they are in with a client. If a client cancels their call I won't get paid. I love care work but no one can be expected to work for free.",
