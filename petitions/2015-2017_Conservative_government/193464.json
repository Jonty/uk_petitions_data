        "action": "Clarify if deal on EU/UK nationals is subject to final Brexit deal vote",
        "additional_details": "By not clarifying this, there is no guaranteed certainty for EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals abroad until the final vote, which means ongoing insecurity or a false sense of security for the next 2 years.\r\n\r\nClarification would help individuals and businesses plan next steps if this impacts them (relocation, resourcing, housing, etc).",
        "background": "While UK gov has stated an early deal is desired about EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals abroad with the EU, UK parliament failed to specify if an early deal is subject to a final vote on the Brexit deal in 2 years time, meaning an early deal can be overturned by UK during the final vote.
