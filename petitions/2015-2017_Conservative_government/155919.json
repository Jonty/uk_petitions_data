        "additional_details": "Throughout the campaign Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Nigel Farage repeatedly made a number of dishonest claims. \r\nOne very clear example was that the UK paid \u00a3350m a week to the EU and this would be freed to use on the NHS if we left.  \r\nNet of an immediate rebate (which never leaves the UK) the figure was \u00a3247m per week and net of payments to UK entities (which they said would continue to be paid) the figure was \u00a3136m per week.  \r\n",
        "background": "In the Brexit debate there was dishonesty which one leading law professor described \"on an industrial scale\". \r\nPeople made the most important decision of a generation on the basis of misinformation which was cynically presented as fact. Messrs Johnson, Gove and Farage were at the core. ",
