        "action": "Stop freedom of movement when we leave the EU & significantly reduce immigration",
        "additional_details": "Most Leave voters in the EU Referendum wanted to significantly reduce Immigration and most Leave campaigners advocated this.  When we leave the EU, free movement must end immediately and an early priority in negotiations must be to agree that any EU citizens who migrated here after Article 50 was triggered will not have their rights protected in the same way as those who were here before.  We accept the same should apply to UK citizens moving to the EU after Article 50 was triggered.",
        "background": "Leave voters are deeply concerned by reports that free movement will continue after we leave the EU.  This is NOT what we voted for.  Brexit means free movement must END on the day we leave the EU and we MUST have full control and knowledge of who comes into the UK.",
