        "additional_details": "I feel the government and its opposing opposition parties should start an investigation to determine if Syrian air strikes are due to the same reason as Blair's to just steal more riches from an innocent country.  \r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\nP.s I want peace just like the many that do, no more wars it takes many of innocence of lives away think of the families with children that die. If it was us british that die we get a memorial sentence from the PM but not for those who they bombed. ",
        "background": "Step back in time and remember the times Tony Blair claimed there was weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and Iran. How ever searches were carried out in Iraq and Iran but they didn't find the weapons. As to my knowledge it was to steal oil no potential threat to the UK.",
