        "additional_details": "Last week when leaving Felixstowe docks on the A14 I followed a heavy goods vehicle for 15 miles in the outside lane while they attempted to overtake another HGV which was in the inside lane. A huge queue of cars had built up behind me as the trucks rolled on side by side at virtually identical speed. Very frustrating for other motorists and also dangerous. These heavy vehicles with restricted speed limit should stay in the inside lane at all times ",
        "background": "Heavy goods vehicles in the outside lane are a danger to other road users as well as causing huge backlogs of traffic while they attempt overtaking moves at little more than the speed of the vehicle in the inside lane.Cars only in the outside lane please",
