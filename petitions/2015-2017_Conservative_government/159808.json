        "additional_details": "In addition, NHS England recently chose Bicester as a Healthy Town, ie more health services are supposed to available to residents, not closures. Bure Park is a large residential area that warrants its own surgery. 4,300 patients states that. Other residents of Bicester need to be aware as the overflow will increase the already ridiculous waiting times for appointments. It is in the interest of all Bicester residents to appeal against this closure",
        "background": "North Bicester Surgery is due to close in October/November. 4,300 patients will need to find an alternative doctors' surgery, burdening the existing four surgeries available. Bicester is an ever growing town with the Eco-town, garden town and Kingsmere Estate still in progress. ",
