        "additional_details": "At any reputable piercing place, with any reputable piercer, they would point blank refuse to pierce a baby's ears. Which in itself speaks volumes. This has no benefit towards the baby at all, and is solely for the parents. Babies are small people, with rights. They are not accessories, and to force this on a baby would not be acceptable in any other circumstance. ",
        "background": "It is time to put an age limit on piercings. Babies are frequently pierced at the request of their parents. In any other circumstance this would be considered GBH, and completely ignores the rights of the baby. The main issue being the legalities of such a trend, but also the dangers it presents.",
