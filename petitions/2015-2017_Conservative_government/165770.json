        "additional_details": "There are hundreds of new build estates across the UK that are burdened with extra charges to resident for the maintenance of the open shared spaces on their estates. The residents have no choice in which company carries out the work. The charges are over inflated, the quality of work is substandard and companies bully residents into continued payments with threats of legal action. \r\nThere seems to be no clear way of complaint, and no independent way of arbitration or enforcement of standards.",
        "background": "New estates are burdened with extra maintenance charges from private companies. The industry is unregulated, uncontrolled and monopolised in such a manner that unfairly disadvantages residents",
