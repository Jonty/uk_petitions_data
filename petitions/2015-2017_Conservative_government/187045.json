        "additional_details": "My grandmother was fully compos mentis and active. The injures she sustained where bruising to her face, severe lacerations to her legs and two breaks to her pelvis. These series of falls within such a short space of time made my grandmother bedridden and eventually passed away.  We believe that if a CCTV system is in place this would alert staff to the need of the people in there care and help prevent incidents of neglect like this happening to other people.",
        "background": "My grandmother was in a nursing home for 3 weeks, within that 3 weeks she had 6 falls and the staff were unaware of her situation. We believe that if a CCTV monitoring system was in place this would have helped to prevent this from happening by making the staff aware of my grandmother's needs.",
