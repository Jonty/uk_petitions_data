        "additional_details": "these boards are not any danger to anyone because as soon as you step off they stop. All the time it looks like the police target young people,the law is from the 1800s very out dated,yes stop these things in very busy places but parks is a bit bad as there is much more that can harm you even a child could run into you on a bike,but its what children do.",
        "background": "a lot of young people want to go with the latest craze also they are quite good for exercise and much cheaper then cars to get around and go no faster then a mobility scooter. also it gives younger people independence and the law is very dated.  ",
