At this moment, no public information has been released on the future of the Brixton Street Gym and whether or not it has been formally included in the Council\u2019s development plans. On Friday 14 April, 2017, members of the gym had their access to the premises denied without due warning and large chains were put on the gym\u2019s gates.",

Closing this gym will have unimaginable effects on the community. Brixton Street Gym must be included in the redevelopment plans.\r\n\r\n",
