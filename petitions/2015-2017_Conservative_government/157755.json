        "additional_details": "EEA Treaty Rights state that any EU citizen can live and move to any of the 28 member states in the EU. The uncertainty created by the Brexit vote has put the lives of 3 million EU citizens in the UK uncertain. Many are now victims of hate crimes as ignorant people think they can be deported back after 23 June 2016. It is the responsibility now for the MP to formalise the residency of these 3 million EU and provide a bridging period waiver to ensure these citizens are not impacted.",
        "background": "The UK voted to leave the EU on 23 June 2016. There are 3 million EU citizens lawfully living in the UK under exercising EU Treaty Rights. The lives and status of EU citizens living in the UK is now unclear so its imperative that a law is passed that protects these citizens.",
