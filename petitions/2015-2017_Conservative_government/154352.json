        "additional_details": "The results of the EU referendum has shown that there is a clear divide within the country between remaining or leaving. Both sides have made outlandish claims as to what their retrospective votes would lead to. As the public were given the task of deciding whether to remain or leave they should also be given the task to decide whether the terms are acceptable. The vote should take place after negotiations have concluded with the European Union and prior to HM government signing an agreement.\r\n",
        "background": "We the undersigned call upon HM Government to implement a rule in order to unify the Remain and the Leave referendum voters, by allowing them to vote again in a referendum on the final agreed term of exit with the European Union.",
