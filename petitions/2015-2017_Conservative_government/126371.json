        "additional_details": "UK students can receive as little as \u00a34,087 per academic year, despite the average cost for accommodation in the uk being \u00a34672.87. Added living costs such as food and toiletries, makes it almost impossible for many students to stay out of their overdrafts. Many students are forced to work part time, giving them far less time to study and achieve the best grade that they can. \r\nRef - NUS accommodation cost survey http://www.nus.org.uk/Global/Campaigns/Accommodation%20Costs%20Survey%20V6%20WEB.pdf",
        "background": "Many university students face the issue of their maintenance loan not even covering the cost for their accommodation, and their parents can't afford to contribute. No student should have to start each term in their overdraft, so I believe that university accommodation prices should be capped.",
