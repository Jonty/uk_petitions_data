        "action": "Not new grammar schools, put the funding into high achieving comprehensives.",
        "additional_details": "The Government want these schools to be allowed to be created once again. This was not what was voted for in the 2015 Conservative manifesto, David Cameron was highly against grammar schools. The money should go to the success that is comprehensive schools. Studies have shown that comprehensive students have fared better at university and they achieve, even with non selection, competitive grades, why should the government try to separate students rather than fund comprehensive schooling more?",
        "background": "In September, PM Theresa May announced the government's plans to reintroduce selective state education in the form of grammar schools. Students are selected by 11+ exams, not the age to be determining the schooling for the next 7 years. The government should prioritise existing comprehensives.",
