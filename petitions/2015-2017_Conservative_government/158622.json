        "additional_details": "The way media reports these events creates a perception in the readers and viewers minds worldwide that Islam the religion and Muslims are behind these attacks. This is distressing for all Muslims as we are being blamed and humiliated for something we haven't done neither do we believe in. In the UK itself you see these countless racist attacks and wonder what could have caused them. Muslims being stabbed, hijab ripped off and verbal abuse has now become a norm for Muslims. This needs to end.",
        "background": "The terrorist attacks worldwide from the organisation Daesh are nearly always referred to by the media as \"ISIS\" and \"Islamic State\". At a time when people worldwide need to come together in unity, we have become divided. \r\n\r\nI call upon the UK government to ban media from fueling this perception.",
