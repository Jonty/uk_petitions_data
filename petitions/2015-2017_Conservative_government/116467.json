This policy discriminates against homosexuals who take great joy in donating and saving lives, it also unnecessarily reduces donations. During 2015 the NHS has seen a 40% reduction in new blood donors in comparison to a decade before (1).\r\n\r\n1. http://www.banglamirrornews.com/2015/06/new-blood-donors-in-decline-40-fewer-new-blood-donors-in-20145-than-20045/",
