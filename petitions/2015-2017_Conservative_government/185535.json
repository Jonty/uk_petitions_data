        "additional_details": "Enforcing companies to employ a ratio of term time contracts dependant on staff numbers will allow parents to return to work and still take care of their children. This will get many people off of benefits and back into work. Many lone parents such as myself want to work but also want to be at home while our children are young to raise them and spend quality time with them. Students could be placed on temporary contracts during school holidays to fill the term time contractors. ",
