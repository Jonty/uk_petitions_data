        "action": "Change mandatory jail sentence for rape, rather than community service.",
        "additional_details": "Two women under 16 were raped by a man aged 17 (now 18) and he got off with 18 months community service. He put these two girls and their families through hell and he basically got away with it. What is community service going to do to help these two girls go about their lives without having to keep looking over there shoulders. How does having an unstable mind allow this man to not get jail time.",
        "background": "This petition is to change the jail sentence length and to rule out community service. The victims of these charges deserve to be able to go about their lives as they wish, without having the fear of running into their offenders. ",
