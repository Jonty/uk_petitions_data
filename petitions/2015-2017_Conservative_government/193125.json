        "additional_details": "In my eyes, there is no reasonable justification to this practice:\r\n- Airlines are well aware an aircraft has a finite number of seats.\r\n- Costumers have paid for their tickets in advance.\r\n- If a costumer decides to cancel a booking, the cost of the ticket is not refunded.\r\n\r\nTherefore, airlines are not covering losses, but rather increasing their profits, while costumers bare the stress, loss of income, extra costs and/or ruined holidays.\r\n\r\nEU Legislation is in place, but clearly not enough.",
        "background": "Overbooking a flight is legal and, regardless of current EU Law Compensation Schemes, airlines are still taking advantage of this practice and it is their costumers who end up facing the consequences. ",
