        "additional_details": "Also don't get me wrong I'm not saying have sex that should remain illegal till there 16, but kissing/cuddling etc is considered sexual contact and I think the law should be changed to prevent innocent people being prosecuted for that.\r\n\r\nNo 16-year old should be given a trial for dating someone 1-year younger when we have a older generation some with 20-year age gaps and then be quick to judge a small age gap\r\n\r\nWe need to protect children and focus on what the law was made for. Predatory Old men.",
        "background": "Many teenagers today are tried and parents try to prosecute other kids for simply dating there child even if there 1/2-years younger. We should adapt to the same laws Canada has in this field by making it so you can date anyone within a 3-year age gap if one is over 16 and one is under 16.",
