As it originates in the midlands it makes sense to spread it to the outer reaches of the UK where the use such stupid words as Barms, Baps, Breadcakes all of which are incorrect. \r\nIt is a COB. This should be enshrined in law. ",

This is confusing and quite obviously wrong. \r\n I propose that the correct word \"COB\" be made the standard word and made legally enforceable word across the UK and EU. ",
