        "additional_details": "Sovereignty in the United Kingdom rests with Parliament. \r\n\r\nThe UK Government recently invoked a referendum in relation to the UK's continued membership of the European Union.\r\n\r\nA majority voted to leave the European Union.\r\n\r\nAct 50 of the Treaty on European Union states :\r\n\r\n(1.) Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.\r\n\r\nIn holding a referendum, the UK government has not met this constitutional requirement to withdraw.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The process of the EU Referendum directly bypassed the sovereignty of Parliament and is therefore fundamentally unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nIt follows that for the UK Government to now act on the EU referendum result would bypass due constitutional process.",
