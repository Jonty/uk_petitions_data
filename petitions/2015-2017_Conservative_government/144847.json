Effectively now, we don't have to pay into the EU and therefore have a fresh influx of money into our own economy where we can better utilise more effectively than the said EU.\r\n\r\nLets make a change for the better!",
        "background": "At time of writing this petition, over 2 million people have polled to have a second referendum regarding membership in the EU. There is no point to having this discussion because had we remained, the 'brexiters' would likely have dealt with it anyway - being a bad loser is not going to help us!",
