        "action": "Do not hold a second EU referendum and acknowledge the MAJORITY vote",
        "additional_details": "This petition has been started in opposition of the Remain voters believing that a second referendum should be held as they lost the first one. The majority of voters, however small people think this majority was, agreed that the UK should leave the EU and this is a fair and democratic result. \r\n\r\nIt is a waste of taxpayers money, as well as time and effort, to force a second referendum and if there is a second one, then do the Leave voters have to petition for a third if they lose? ",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, believe that the results of the referendum held on Thursday, 23rd June 2016 should stand and a second referendum on the same, or similar, matter should not be held. \r\n\r\nThe majority of UK voters agreed that the UK should leave the EU and this should be the final decision.
