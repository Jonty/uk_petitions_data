        "action": "Ensure that the Brexit EU deal maintains free trade, research, and movement.",
        "additional_details": "Such a deal would likely be similar to that between the EU and Norway; whilst this may involve the UK continuing to pay some EU budget contributions, we accept the views of most economists that single market access is valuable enough to make this worthwhile. This deal will likely involve accepting free movement into Britain, too, and we welcome this; EU migrants are at the heart of British life, playing a vital role in many economic sectors but more importantly being our neighbours and friends.",
        "background": "After the Leave vote, we must ensure that the rights and prosperity of UK citizens are protected. We believe that this means any deal should ensure our rights as UK citizens to live and work around the EU, maintain single market access to protect British jobs, and continue academic collaboration.",
