        "additional_details": "It's not illegal for the super-rich to put these assets into trusts but it deprives the Treasury of significant income.   The 7th Duke's unpaid contribution could have built 40 hospitals (at \u00a390 million per hospital, including equipment and infrastructure) and would have represented almost 80% of the total inheritance tax paid to HMRC in 2015-16.  The \u00a340 million cap is based on the BBC's figure (January 2015) that to join the super-rich you need to be worth $50-$100 million.",
        "background": "The super-rich can put limitless assets into trusts so that their beneficiaries pay only a fraction of the taxes they would otherwise owe.  We've seen this recently with the 7th Duke of Westminster, who will avoid paying \u00a33.6 billion inheritance tax.  A \u00a340 million cap would stop this.",
