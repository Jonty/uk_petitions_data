However, often, products that contain egg as an ingredient will just state egg. However, if I buy a cake or a sauce for instance and it contains egg it should say: egg (free-range, barn, cage, organic) whatever the production method is of the egg, it should say. I've noticed that products will state whether the egg is free-range etc, but they won't state the production method if it is something else. ",
