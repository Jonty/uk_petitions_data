        "additional_details": "Even on the opening day of sale of tickets on sites like Stereoboard, Axn, ticketmaster  it's virtually impossible to find tickets at face value. Instead tickets are immediately sold out, but on the same opening day resell prices are always immediately available at x2, x3 and more than face value. This is outrageous and should be illegal. Only honest fans should be able to buy tickets and the resale should be strictly controlled to face value plus reasonable postage, like standard 1st class.",
        "background": "Too many websites and companies exist or promote the resale of event tickets for vastly more than the original face value. No entity should be allowed to purchase by any means any number of tickets if their sole intent is to profit by reselling at inflated prices. The law should protect face values.",
