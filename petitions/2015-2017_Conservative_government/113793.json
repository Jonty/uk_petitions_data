I think its absolutely crazy that people can get away with tying up their horses so close to the road,\" she said. \"If it\u2019s illegal then why aren\u2019t the authorities putting a stop to it?",
        "background": "Essex CC took responsibility.They would now be contacting owners to seek the safe removal of the horses. It is illegal to tether horses here.A horse was killed. If we are unable to establish ownership we will have no other option but to arrange for formal enforcement action to remove the horses",
