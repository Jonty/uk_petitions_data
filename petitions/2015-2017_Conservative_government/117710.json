The Palestinians didn\u2019t want to give their land to Israel. They wanted all of Palestine to be one country for people of all faiths and religons. Israel had a war in 1967 and invaded and occupied all of Palestine. The Palestinians want their land back.Israel is guilty of numerous war crimes and human rights violations. Palestinians regularly face excessive force and violence at the hands of the occupying Israeli soldiers. Many Jews do not like the fact that a Jewish state is acting in such a cruel and un-Jewish way Palestinians regularly face excessive force and violence at the hands of the occupying Israeli soldiers. Free Palestine today",
