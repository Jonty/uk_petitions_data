        "additional_details": "The police, although busy, were wonderful in regards to the situation. After a Nissan Juke hitting a little car into a lamppost, the car was a write off. The man drove off, before we were even out of the car and the police, afterwards, informed us that there were no CCTV on the round-a-bout or on any of the roads in the direction he went.\r\n\r\nI'm aware of multiple others having similar experiences, and feel that it would be both beneficial to the victims and the police to have CCTV on major roads.",
