        "additional_details": "The UK is proud to have a culturally diverse population, and will not tolerate Trumps racist, xenophobic, and prejudice policies. Neither will the U.K. Tolerate a Prime Minister who doesn't oppose such behaviour, nor condemns it at the earliest opportunity. \r\n\r\nWe, the British Public, require a leader who upholds our values and principles, regardless of the outcome.\r\n\r\nTeresa Mays appointment is not in the best interest of the UK and is quite frankly an embarrassment Teresa May must resign.",
        "background": "Not only is Teresa May incapable of delivering a transparent Brexit, she is failing in her duties to the British public. \r\n\r\nRecently, Teresa May visited Donald Trump, and rather than make the UK's position clear against his extreme policies, she pandered to him like a quivering dog. \r\n",
