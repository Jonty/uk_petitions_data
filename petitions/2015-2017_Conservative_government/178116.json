        "additional_details": "VAT is the goverments third largest source of income. VAT has been reduced before in 2008 to 15% amd then increased to 17.5% in 2009. This benefited both low income families and business to develop and spread money a lot easier. \r\n\r\n\"VAT is regressive in nature: It hits poorer households harder because consumption makes up a much larger share of their disposable income,\" said Michael Martins of the Institute of Directors (IoD).\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "1/5 of the total price of product is VAT charges. Obviously this only applies to certain products. But by reducing VAT on those products would help thousands if not millions of people on low incomes and benefit small business that our communities relay on so much.",
