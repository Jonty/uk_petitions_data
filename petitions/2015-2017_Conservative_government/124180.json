Instead, they promote aggressive bullying tactics that are designed to throw those speaking off their train of thought, no matter how valuable the issue being discussed is. This is not the type of democracy that I want guiding this country, making key decisions about my day to day life. There must be another way, agree to disagree, but work together!",

Leaders should set an example for younger generations, but currently they'd be on the red traffic light in my classroom.",
