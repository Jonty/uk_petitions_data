        "additional_details": "Today a child was attacked by a dog in a playground, 2 days ago 5 dogs went on a ramapage attacking people in the street. On both occasions,police had to shoot the dogs dead. I read many articles on dogs attacking other dogs too, mauling much loved family pets causing terrible injuries. The dog license, I believe, would help eliminate some of these attacks. Responsible owners would not mind having to pay a small fee and going to dog training classes. Help stamp out irresponsible dog ownership.",
        "background": "There are to many irresponsible dog owners, who allow their dog to be a menace on the streets. Dog attacks are on the rise as is animal cruelty. Dog obedience training would be manadatory to the license.",
