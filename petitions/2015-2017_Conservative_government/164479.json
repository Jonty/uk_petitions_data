        "additional_details": "Some holidays go up by over \u00a31000 by simply flying a couple of days later because the holiday is then in school holidays for children. The travel operator knows parents do not want to take children out of school for holidays so hike their prices to make people pay more for the same holiday.",
        "background": "Travel companies increase prices of their holidays during school holidays because they know parents will be forced to pay the increase in price. This is wrong and unjust as it prices some parents out of taking their children overseas just so the travel operator makes more profit.",
