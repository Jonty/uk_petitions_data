        "action": "Negotiate a bespoke reciprocal visa agreement between the UK and the EU",
        "additional_details": "This \u00a350 charge is quite expensive for a holiday visa and will deter people going abroad. The only option could be a reciprocal visa agreement between the UK and the EU/EEA. This could mean that UK citizens can travel to the EU, for 180 days, for free. This however, is only possible if we allow all EU nationals coming to the UK the same agreements. We could also include reciprocal emergency healthcare in this visa agreement. This will make it easier for full single market access.",
        "background": "Now the UK voted to leave the EU we will lose the freedom of movement right. This will cease once we leave and will mean we have to apply for a visa to go to the EU on holiday as we are third country nationals. The EU has plans to introduce a \u00a350 holiday visa for citizens of third countries.",
