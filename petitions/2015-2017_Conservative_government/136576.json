Overnight they have had the opportunity to live, work and study in 26 other European nations taken away from them. \r\n\r\nThis should not be something we repeat. \r\n\r\nIt is time to stop disenfranchising our young people and give 16 and 17 year olds a say in the future of the country that they must now live, work and study in, in a mess they had no part in making. ",
        "background": "Yesterday we as a nation voted to leave the European Union. A vote in which more than 75% of 16-25 year olds voted to 'Remain', yet this vote will have the biggest impact on young people who had no say in this referendum. At 16 you can die for your country but you cannot vote to decide its' future. ",
