        "additional_details": "Almost daily, major bus routes, the only bus routes I can take to work in fact, are late. This brings my job security into scrutiny. Feedback and complaints over the past 4 years have fell on deaf ears. The reason for this I believe is the fact that Go North East is the only bus operator operating in this area, giving them the belief they can treat customers like this and get away with it. Action is needed. I spend a great deal of my wages on public transport and expect a better service.",
        "background": "Go North East is the only bus operator linking Washington and surrounding areas such as Gateshead, Newcastle and Sunderland. This creates a Monopoly, giving Go North East the right to drive up prices and deliver a very poor level of customer service, the main problem being punctuality of buses.",
