        "additional_details": "Its hard to believe that you can be expected to pay upto 3 times more for a family holiday during school holidays. We all agree there is nothing different you get by paying this over inflated price apart from making the holiday companies and their shareholders more money. My question is WHY are we and WHY should we pay more if anything the prices should be a lot less as travel companies no this is going to be a BUSY period anyway instead they hike it up knowing full well parents have no choice!",
        "background": "There is nothing more important than a well deserved family holiday but us parents no this is becoming more and more expensive and unrealistic given the prices the travel companies charge during the school holidays. I am asking MPs to consider this petition and to use COMMON SENSE around the issue.",
