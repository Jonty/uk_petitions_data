        "additional_details": "\"Since privatisation, the average price of a train journey has increased by 22% and walk-on tickets on some routes have been hiked by 245%. The TUC looked at the cost of UK rail commutes against similar European journeys in France, Germany and Spain. It found that we\u2019re paying 3x more of our salary just to get to work and back.\" - (The Independent) \r\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/travel/uk/why-are-uk-rail-fares-so-expensive-9678640.html",
        "background": "Train fares are just too costly for the average commuter/traveller. 35 minutes away from a main city can cost a yearly total of \u00a33,320.00 which accounts for 12.7% of the average national salary. This figure is too high and continues to increase. Hence, we are calling on a cap or further subsidy.",
