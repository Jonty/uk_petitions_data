        "additional_details": "Raising children with errant fathers is hard. Csa often can't track them and mothers left to do it alone. Not always low paid work so the government's argument about raising hourly rate is irrelevant - mothers simply cannot do it all - work and raise children to be good hard working citizens with a positive work ethic. Would the government rather we all sat around on our bottoms knowing this brings in more money? Why is the government not taxing the large corporations to pay honest tax. ",
        "background": "Working tax credits allow many people to look after children as single parents and work at the same time. It can also include high paid hourly work Which has to fit around child care and therefore can only be part time. If cuts go ahead then unemployment benefit will be more. Good message for kids?",
