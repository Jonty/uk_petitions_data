        "additional_details": "According to recent news articles, many thousands of people have failed to renew their Vehicle Road Tax.  Sadly I am one of the individuals who after 33 years of regularly paying the VRT when the V11 is received, have now fallen victim to the 'Penalty Charge'.  I did not receive a V11 and with no VRT disc on display, the first I knew my VRT was overdue was the receipt of the \u00a380 Penalty Charge. Reinstate the requirement for a VRT and Make V11 issue a Statutory requirement.  Calls to DVLA 12p/min",
        "background": "The lack of requirement to display a Vehicle Road Tax Disc means that vehicles are being driven with no visible reminder of when the road tax is due.  It is not a Statutory requirement for the DVLA to issue the V11 reminder.  Failure to pay the VRT results in a Penalty Charge from the DVLA of \u00a380",
