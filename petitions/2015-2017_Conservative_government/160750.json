        "action": "Change the driving license rules for up to 7.5 tonne vehicles.",
        "additional_details": "As it stands today, anyone who has passed their driving test prior to 1996 can drive any vehicle up to 7.5 tonnes. In 1998 this meant that a few thousand 18 and 19 year-olds were left out of the equation but by 2016, not only everybody from 18 to 37 (roughly 16.8 million people) can't drive a large van or small lorry but your 75 year-old granny can. This leaves many responsible grown-ups finding it very difficult when needing to drive, hire or purchase any vehicle between 3.5 and 7.5 tonnes. ",
        "background": "The Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations 1996 needs to be adapted to include C1 and C1E category after provisional on a background check-points basis so that all the people who were born from 1979 onwards get the same driving possibilities as those who passed their driving test before 1996.",
