        "additional_details": "Shops are selling legal highs under all different names and they call them things like incense and say 'not for human consumption' yet say on the homepage of their website 'OUR RANGE OF LEGAL HIGHS PROVIDES EVERYTHING YOU COULD POSSIBLY NEED FOR A GREAT NIGHT OUT, A GREAT NIGHT IN AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN, WITHOUT BREAKING THE LAW' All these people care about is making a quick buck, not the lives of the victims and their families that are being ruined! PLEASE PLEASE HELP TO GET THEM BANNED!!",
        "background": "Legal highs should be banned in the whole world not just the UK, but if we can get them banned from being sold in the UK alone that will help! It's hard seeing someone close to you have their life torn apart by these awful drugs that can be bought in local shops for less than a packet of cigarettes!",
