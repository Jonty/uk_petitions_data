        "action": "Legalize euthanasia for anyone above the age of 18 and given by prescription UK",
        "additional_details": "If US charges \u00a320,000 for nembutal then it would be expensive. The NHS could substitute for a different drug with the same outcome, but euthanasia should be legal and available to anyone who wants that option. Regardless of the drug, it should be made available like any other drug prescribed by a doctor, with the age restriction of 18. This petition focuses on the legalization of euthanasia, but a follow on from legalization is making a suicide drug available to anyone over 18 or over.",
        "background": "Someone can go through the process of purchasing nembutal from upwards of $20,000 in the US. Furthermore it is currently illegal for euthanasia within the UK and is why you would must travel. This petition is to both, legalize euthanasia and make nembutal or similar drug available from doctors.",
