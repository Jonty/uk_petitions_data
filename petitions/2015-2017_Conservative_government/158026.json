        "additional_details": "Unscrupulous tenants deliberately fail to pay their rent knowing that the legal processes of eviction are long and tedious,They take advantage of this often causing serious damage to a property while the landlord is waiting for legal processes to take effect. These types often cause conflict with neighbours and no-one can take them to task over it. When they are eventually evicted they repeat the process elsewhere  without paying a penny towards their debt or being held accountable for damage.",
        "background": "Landlords need protection from unscrupulous people who refuse to pay their rent knowing the law is in favour of the tenant. Not only will they  continue to live rent free sometimes for up to a year but they will often trash the property rendering it uninhabitable and then move doing the same again.",
