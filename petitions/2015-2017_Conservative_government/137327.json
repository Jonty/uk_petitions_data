        "additional_details": "The British public deserve more than to be pawns in the games of ambitious politicians. We deserve for our politicians to make choices for the good of the people, not for their own careers.\r\n\r\nFor Boris Johnson, his campaign to leave the EU was a nothing more than a move to advance his own political career. For the rest of us, our futures, jobs, education and relationships are now on the line. Boris Johnson should be held accountable for playing with our futures for his own gain.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson has endorsed Britain's membership of the EU for most of his career. His switch to Leave was for political gain, not for conviction. Now that the Leave campaign has won, Johnson is backtracking, saying there's 'no need for haste' to start EU exit negotiations. ",
