He has snubbed the queen, the privy council and in doing so has snubbed the traditional values that MPs are supposed to abide by.\r\n\r\nThis man needs to be removed from office before he causes more damage to the UK people and its economy.",
        "background": "Jeremy Corbyn was elected as labour leader by an overwhelming majority. 85% of these votes were from members of the public, some of which, I know joined the labour party specifically to vote for Jeremy Corbyn to bring down the labour party and ensure they were not re-elected in the future.
