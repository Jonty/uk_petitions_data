        "additional_details": "West Berks Council & Thatcham Council are not interested in building a bridge because of cost. The traffic queues are bad at all times of the day & this is affecting the air quality in the area. State Highways funding is sought to help relieve the misery to thousands of motorists who have to use & cross this crossing everyday. The cost to the local economy in lost time, air pollution, & lost earnings is not quantifiable as its massive. A public enquiry into this would be the first step.",
        "background": "Thatcham Railway Crossing is a major transport route linking the south of Newbury to the east of Thatcham. Traffic uses this route to avoid the horrendous queues through Newbury Town Centre. The crossing is now closed more than it is open causing huge queues & long delays in peak hours to cross it.",
