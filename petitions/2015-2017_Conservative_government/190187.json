        "additional_details": "The DWP rely on assessors supplying accurate reports of PIP and ESA face-to-face assessments,many reports contain errors and false or inaccurate statements of events.This leads the DWP to reject a claim or make lower awards than the claimant is entitled to. A claimant may then have to request a mandatory reconsideration or appeal. A video recording of the assessment could help stop errors and would provide a point of reference to DWP staff and appeals panels.",
