        "additional_details": "This could be achieved by implementing Hyperloop technology instead.\r\n\r\nWith recent announcements from other nations investing in Hyperloop technology, there is a very real worry that if we commit to HS2, the UK will be investing in the wrong choice. \r\n\r\nWe'll end up with an overpriced, lacklustre rail technology that is obsolete before the project even gets started.",
        "background": "HS2 provides minimal gains over our existing rail infrastructure. The cost/ benefit ratio is unacceptable to the taxpayer at \u00a355 billion.\r\n\r\nIf the UK is to spend this sort of money on a transport project, we should be making substantial leaps.",
