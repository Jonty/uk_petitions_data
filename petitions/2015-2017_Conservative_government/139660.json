        "additional_details": "72% is a comprehensive turnout. \r\n\r\n52 to 48 is not a small victory anymore than many general elections. In democratic votes someone has to come second. \r\n\r\nIn 2010 a government was formed by two parities without a majority. Undemocratic? Not really, as a democratic vote has to provide an outcome!\r\n\r\nIs there one more comprehensive than a majority answer on a yes/no question? Ignoring that IS undemocratic. \r\n\r\nWestern civilisation is defined by respect for democratic decisions. Never compromise this. ",
        "background": "On 24 June 2016 the UK electorate voted 52:48 to leave the European Union. There is a movement from those who wished to remain to hold a second referendum as the leave vote wasn't over the arbitrary number of 60. 50 = majority. Turnout the highest since 1992. Don't undermine democracy.",
