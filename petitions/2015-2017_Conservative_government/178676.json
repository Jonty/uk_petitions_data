        "action": "Put restrictions on the amount of packaging used by British supermarkets.",
        "additional_details": "Estimates put our annual levels of waste from packaging at around 5 mega-tonnes, this constitutes between a quarter and a third of our domestic waste. Responsibility for disposal and recycling of over-packaging should not be put on the consumer. Packaging to enclose goods such as bananas or tomatoes is entirely avoidable whilst for other products, such as confectionery, multiple layers of packaging are often used where one would suffice.",
        "background": "In the light of the varied problems of climate change and waste disposal, it is inexcusable that supermarkets produce vast quantities of unnecessary packaging. Consumables, such as fruit and vegetables, confectionery and ready meals, do not need to be enclosed in multiple layers of plastic.",
