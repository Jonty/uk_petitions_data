        "additional_details": "One of the most common criticisms of modern political figures is that they do not have an understanding or notion of how hard life is for most people in the UK. Recently there has been a trend towards punishing those who are unable to earn an income through physical or mental disability or through lack of job prospects. To enlighten those who supposedly care for us we believe that they should have to experience the hopeless desperation of being harassed by the DWP and having every job application turned down whilst you live on pot noodles and stale bread. Only then could they truly sympathise with those who they punish and therefore govern appropriately.",
        "background": "Life on benefits is hard. We cannot be the civilised society we claim to be when we punish the unfortunate or unable for their misfortune. It is time we take action to enlighten our government and educate them on the consequences of their actions.",
