        "additional_details": "Also, if despite paying a reasonable level of maintenance based on previous household bills, the leaving partner uses the CSA to obtain the maximum possible then paying the resultant determination can drain any available funds to pay for legal costs. This creates a very uneven playing field and therefore, full legal costs should be taken into consideration by the CSA in order that a parent can legally fight for their rights.",
        "background": "When one partner decides to breakup a relationship and leave, taking the children and denying the other partner an acceptable level of access and/or communication, the only recourse the other partner has to achieve reasonable access to their children is to take very costly legal action.",
