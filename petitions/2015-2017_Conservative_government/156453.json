        "additional_details": "This is not a party political matter.  It is a matter of integrity.  The roller-coaster ride on Boris Johnson's ego is fun, and endearing, and most enjoyable when he is chairing HIGNFY, but is manifestly unsuitable for a British PM. He has never held high political office. His tenure as Mayor of London was a great platform for showboating, and zip-wiring, but he had little executive power, and what executive power that  was attached to the office was exercised by highly competent deputies.  ",
        "background": "His support of Brexit was based on selfish political ambition, with cynical disregard for the interests of the country.  Some of his campaign promises - e.g. that Brexit would produce \u00a3350 million/week for the NHS - were fraudulent.  He has thus demonstrated that he is not fit for high office.",
