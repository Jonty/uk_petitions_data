        "additional_details": "The Scottish Independence Referendum on September 2014 allowed 16/17 year olds to vote. This was on the basis that the referendum was a once-in-a-lifetime decision. The EU membership vote was just as, if not more, significant to our nation and our democracy. Unlike general elections, this will not be repeated every 4 years, and so the argument that '16 year olds will have their chance to voice their opinion' is not relevant in the case of referendums. ",
        "background": "Britain has left the EU. An estimated 75% of 18-24 year olds voted 'remain', while 61% of 65+ voted 'leave'. The voices of the youth are being drowned out by the elderly. Lowering the voting age to 16 will allow young people to influence the future they will experience far longer than the elderly.",
