        "additional_details": "It was made clear to those leading the referendum campaigns on numerous occasions that there was a difference between setting out possible scenarios after a referendum and publishing and promoting misinformation about the EU or the cost or impacts of membership (e.g.: EU costs \u00a3350 million a week). Similarly material was produced claiming support from individuals, companies, or organisations who did not in fact support the campaign (e.g. the claims that Nissan or John Barnes supported Brexit).  ",
        "background": "Misinformation was at the heart of the EU referendum campaign, including false claims about how the EU works, how much money the UK pays into the EU, how much money might be available for the NHS. Those politicians responsible must be held to account and barred from public office. ",
