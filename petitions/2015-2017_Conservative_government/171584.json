        "additional_details": "In the Autumn Statement on 25 November 2015, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that higher rates of Stamp Duty Land Tax would apply from 1 April 2016 to purchases of additional residential properties, such as second homes and buy-to-let properties. With the Armed Forces numbers shrinking on a daily basis and recruitment drives failing this would be a big incentive for serving personnel to provide a return of service for exemption from Higher rates of Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT).",
        "background": "The MOD have changed service personnels pensions, pay and allowances persistently for the worst over the last decade. To supplement their heavily reduced pensions on retirement service personnel in the past have built up property portfolios, the Government have now made this practically impossible ",
