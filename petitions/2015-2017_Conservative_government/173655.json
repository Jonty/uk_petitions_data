        "additional_details": "There are already systems being put into place by some stores, but these aren't expected to come into action for several years. We think that this change should happen quicker so that there is no more unnecessary suffering in the egg industry. We hope that by doing this the supermarkets will eventually eliminate all products that leave animals in terrible, cruel and inhumane situations.",
        "background": "We read about the poor conditions that some animals live in and want to end the cruelty. Chickens are a start to achieving our goal because the effects gained from this would be most beneficial. ",
