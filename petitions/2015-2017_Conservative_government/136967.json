        "action": "Instruct the HM Government to negotiate that British nationals get  EU Passport.",
        "additional_details": "The Brexit Government should take care of the 16 million who voted to Remain  and arrange for the British Nationals who would want to apply for EU Passport or equivalent to be issued by any of one of the 27 member states so that those of us who voted to Remain will continue to get the benefit of freedom of movement, study and work. An EU Passport comes with obligations such as taxes and the equivalent of national/health insurance but we expect the Brexit Government to arrange a negotiated deal.",
        "background": "Currently all  British nationals are defacto EU nationals. They have the right to travel and work freely in the EEA. The only way to do so if the nation they are a citizen of is part of the EEA. Following Brexit, it would be necessary for British nationals get EU Passport automatically.",
