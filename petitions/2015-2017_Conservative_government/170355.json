        "additional_details": "A solicitor, conveyancer or even a financial adviser is not afforded the same trust. Unfortunately the small minority of agents do, often, run away with large sums of money!\r\n\r\nWhy are we as agents so poorly regulated?\r\n\r\nFurther discussion and details here: https://www.aaronjbarclay.co.uk/should-client-money-protection-be-mandatory. Estate agents in London and beyond should be made to comply.\r\n\r\nPlease sign if you feel this is a worthy petition. ",
        "background": "The Government is less than lukewarm about making it mandatory that all Landlord and Tenant money is safely held in Client Accounts and covered by insurance policies. Some of our present Landlords have lost thousands with agents that have closed down and run off with money they banked from Tenants.",
