        "additional_details": "The USA's 1933 Glass-Steagall Act strictly separated deposit-taking commercial banks from speculative \"investment banking\", which had caused the Great Depression. Its repeal in 1999, on top of London\u2019s 1986 Big Bang deregulation, led to the formation of Too-Big-To-Fail banks. Glass-Steagall is non-partisan: 445 UK MPs and Lords from all parties voted for it in 2013. The \u201cring-fence\u201d legislated instead allows TBTF banks to continue the risky mingling of investment and commercial banking.",
        "background": "The IMF, the BIS and many financial experts are warning of a new global financial crash far worse than 2008, which will be caused by the same forces: the unbridled speculation in derivatives, and outright criminal activity, of City of London and Wall Street megabanks.",
