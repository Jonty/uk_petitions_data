        "additional_details": "Airbnb recently introduced a 90 limit on their website restricting owners to rent their property out beyond the 90 day limit. Booking.com has no such system, allowing owners to rent out their properties for more than 90 days in the calendar year, without obtaining planning permission, in part breaking the law. This allows businesses to take advantage and  profit from using properties solely for hotel type holiday accommodation for the whole year, contributing to London's housing crisis.",
