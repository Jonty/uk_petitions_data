        "additional_details": "When legally filtering down two lanes of traffic, cars will quite often swap lanes without looking not knowing a bike could be traveling between the lanes. Car drivers will quite often believe the bike is at fault because they do not know the laws of filtering. Bikers also have the right to filter to the front of traffic. Car drivers get angry and often verbally and physically attack bikers that are overtaking them in traffic not believing they have the right. Education of learners is the key.",
        "background": "When learner drivers of cars are taking lessons it is not currently mandatory that the discussion is had about the rights motorbikers have when filtering and overtaking. This causes drivers to be careless, cause accidents injuries & deaths of bikers for doing what is there right, to filter traffic.",
