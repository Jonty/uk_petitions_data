        "additional_details": "As you know the population in the UK has more old people than younger people giving them an advantage to get more votes. Also under 16s are not allowed to vote which cuts the amount of young people that can vote. This makes it unfair. People don't even know how important economics is in this and therefore they make decisions of what they know. We are going to be in recession very soon if we don't remain in the EU putting many people's jobs at risk. We all might be homeless soon, who knows. ",
        "background": "We all know very well that David Cameron is not a good prime minister. We also know that we should remain in the EU as it is the best for us all and i would also like my magic stars back. Many people are not aware of the economics behind this and just vote for the sake of it without knowing anything",
