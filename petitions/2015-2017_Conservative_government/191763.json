        "action": "If a bully has drove their victim to suicide then charge them with manslaughter.",
        "additional_details": "According to statistics, in 2016 1.5 million young people were said to have been bullied. That is 1.5 million too many. No child, or adult, should ever be made to feel less by another. Due to social status in schools and communities and the access to social media, it is easier now for bullies to attack their victims without fear of reprisal and ramifications. These needs to stop. No parent should have to bury their own child, especially for something so senseless as name calling and shaming.",
        "background": "The statistics of suicides by young people in the UK due to bullying and abuse are horrifying. The government and ministry of justice is too laid back on those who commit the offences. Should someone be found guilty of bullying and their victim has turned to suicide - charge them with manslaughter.",
