        "additional_details": "Most fans plan away trips months in advance and often book travel before match tickets are on sale.\r\nVirgin rail release cheaper tickets 13 weeks prior to date of travel.\r\nMost cheaper hotel prices these days are non-refundable.\r\nSky and other TV companies know the fixtures before the start of the season and can plan accordingly.\r\nTV company revenues benefit from screening these games but the average fan suffers.",
        "background": "Yet again Sky has changed a fixture from a Saturday afternoon to a Monday night to screen it on TV. This time just 6 weeks before the original fixture date. Many fans have booked train tickets and hotels which are non-refundable. Either a minimum period or a compensation scheme is required. ",
