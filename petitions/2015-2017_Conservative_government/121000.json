        "action": "Save Age UK Training Center, Preston, Lancashire",
        "additional_details": "Age UK is the last training center of its kind based in Preston with specific targeted courses for the students, such as Business Admin and Maths training. It is a small environment designed to help students less suited to a large college environment and an alternative to college for over a decade. 16-19 Year old learners that have various issues ranging from anxiety to social skills will no longer have anywhere to gain education as Age UK Training was the last trainer of this sort in Preston.",
        "background": "The petition is to protest against the EFA/SFA closing down the center due to a failed Ofsted report (in which they did not even come to our center). Jobs will be lost as well as training opportunities for the 16-19 year olds that attend Age UK, most of which struggle with the usual college system.",
