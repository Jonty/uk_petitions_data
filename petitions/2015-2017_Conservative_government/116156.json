        "additional_details": "We call on the government to require energy companies to:\r\n1. Cut the cost of prepayment meters in line with the cheapest direct debit fuel tariffs saving consumers \u00a3226 a year\r\n2. End debt collection by energy companies during the winter (as Scottish Energy have done)\r\n3. Ensure homes with pensioners, disabled people and children don't have prepayment meters fitted \r\n4. Stop installation of prepayment meters during the winter \r\n5. Protect prepayment customers from disconnection as smart meters are introduced across the UK by 2020.",
        "background": "According to the Citizens Advice Bureau prepayment meter consumers pay \u00a3226 a year more than those who use direct debit, yet these consumers are often the poorest in our society.",
