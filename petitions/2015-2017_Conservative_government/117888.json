        "additional_details": "It cost me nearly \u00a390 and my mother over \u00a3110 for our permits. The council uses the same system as the DVLA  for Taxing Vehicles to determine their prices\r\n\r\nMy vehicle is registered before 2001, therefore the price of the permit is determined by the size of the engine, which for my car stands at \u00a389.10 (increases every year)\r\n\r\nMy Mothers vehicle is registered after 2001 therefore the price of the permit is determined by the CO2 emmissions which for her car stands at \u00a3111.40 (increases every year)",
        "background": "A new and more fairer system is needed where  residents doesn\u2019t feel as though they\u2019re being robbed.  It seems as though  Haringey council is compensating for the loss of government funding by increasing prices of parking permits. ",
