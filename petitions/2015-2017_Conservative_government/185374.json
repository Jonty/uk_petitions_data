So I complained to the LGO, only to be more shocked when they agreed with everything the council stated.  So, the LGO is not independent as claimed...\r\n\r\nThe Local Government Ombudsman completed their (so-called) investigation of the council and they were biased and agreed with everything the council stated without a shred of evidence from them.  They started the investigation without contacting me for further statements and evidence to support my complaint, and when the (so-called) 'biased' investigation had completed, I wasn\u2019t even informed.  It was I that had to contact them to find out why the investigation was taking so long to start, only to be informed it had completed a month earlier.",
        "background": "Normally, it is the victims that have to move to get away from neighbours noise while the offenders get to stay.  Where is the justice there?  My own experience is shocking!  You not safe either because the government and local councils want to extend HMOs on a wider scale.",
