        "action": "Extend London weighting for student maintenance loans",
        "additional_details": "In the county of Surrey, a student studying in Egham will have access to over \u00a32,000 per annum more in maintenance loans than a student studying in Guildford. Students round the fringes of London weighting are suffering the same problem where the London housing market has pushed up rents, but the student finance system has not kept pace.",
        "background": "High rents don\u2019t stop at the M25. London weighting is based on an archaic view of student funding, where students in a defined geographical area are granted more than those who are not, regardless of living costs in the area of study.",
