        "additional_details": "The U.K. referendum decided the outcome of our continued membership of the E.U. The result of the referendum was a majority of 52% for leave and 48% to remain, 17.5 million people voted to leave and that decision was accepted. We now appear to have reached a stalling point because the first minister of Scotland doesn't like the result. Does she not realise how this portrays Scotland to the rest of the World??. How will potential investors view them because of one woman's crusade. Give us a voice",
        "background": "Nicola Sturgeon has made continuous references to a second referendum for Scottish independence. As this affects the whole of the U.K., not just Scotland, then the entire electorate should be allowed a say in matters concerning the U.K. Let Nicola Sturgeon have a second referendum.",
