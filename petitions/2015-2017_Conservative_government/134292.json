        "background": "Every month I pay \u00a356 for my oyster fares, whereas with a child oyster I would have paid \u00a334 a month. It is unfair that we (16-17 year olds) are  charged more for our tube travel when nothing has changed in terms of education for most of us. We are not adults, we are children, so give us child fares",
