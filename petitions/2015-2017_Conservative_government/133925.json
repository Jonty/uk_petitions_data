        "action": "To require a two-thirds majority vote for all referendums in the United Kingdom.",
        "additional_details": "With turnout in referendums generally falling, the UK needs to adapt it's rules according to voting so that two-thirds majority is required. The UK needs to factor in the fact that turnout will never be 100%, and that 51% of anything less than that is not an actual majority.\r\n\r\nA two-thirds majority vote would secure popular consent on every level referendums are held, ensuring that government would have a genuine majority to grant the decision legitimacy regardless of voter turnout. ",
        "background": "A referendum on a national level is meant to be a means for parliament to secure popular consent on issues that leave government divided, or when there is special need for a vote of public support.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be done when important constitutional changes are decided with a 1-5% majority.",
