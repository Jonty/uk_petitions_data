        "action": "Call for a vote of no confidence in the Conservative government",
        "additional_details": "Throughout the referendum campaign, both Remain and Leave were scaremongering, making promises they could not keep (such as Farage promising 350mil to the NHS) and gave no indication of what the implications would be for individual people- the disabled, the working class, students, OAPs etc. The government failed to host a fair referendum, thus a vote of no confidence would trigger a new general election, allowing for us to regain confidence in a party and leader that can fairly guide us.",
        "background": "Following the EU referendum, the Conservative government has disintegrated. The leave and remain campaigns were biased with no goals for the future, so people did not have informed consent when voting. Cameron has resigned, indicating political turmoil, and no leader we can trust has come forward.",
