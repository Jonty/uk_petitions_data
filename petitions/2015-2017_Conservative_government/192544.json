        "action": "Give the option to all Police officers to carry a firearm to help protect them",
        "additional_details": "Politicians, senior officers and other dignitaries speak of a Police service without routinely arming its officers. Even some officers say they don't want to carry a firearm but l feel that should be a choice for the person putting their life on the line. Every officer should have the choice to carry a firearm as many other countries do. Unfortunately the debate always compares us to the States instead of our neighbors in Europe who all carry guns and operate with a more level headed approach.",
        "background": "We have all seen news stories the most recent Pc Palmer taking on a man with a knife and getting stabbed in the process. The two female officers in Manchester who were unarmed and were shot. All of which should have the right to defend themselves on an equal standing.",
