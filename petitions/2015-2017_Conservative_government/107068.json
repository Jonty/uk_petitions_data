        "additional_details": "Lowering the age to 16 for beer, wine and cider has proven successful in many EU countries such as Germany, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and Denmark. (Although in Switzerland and Denmark this is done by alcohol percentage not the overall drink, for example in Denmark if the drink is under 16.5% ABV then it can be sold to someone aged 16). These countries have taken this approach to try to teach youths to be more responsible with alcoholic drinks and I feel this would be benificial in the UK.",
        "background": "Lowering the age of purchase for beer, wine and cider has proven effective in EU countries such as Germany & Austria. I feel this would be effective in the UK as it would help teenagers to become more responsible around alcohol & teach them an appropriate approach to drinking it.",
