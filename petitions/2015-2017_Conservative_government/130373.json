        "additional_details": "We know by doing this, it is extremely unscientific to put this Bill through, it will only create more criminality, through the likes of possession, selling illegally etc. It's completely unscientific to ban these substances, even considering the fact that this Government haven't even defined what a \"psychoactive substance\" is. Having some chocolate releases endorphins, going for a jog or exercising does the same thing, should we ban coffee and sugar too? It's ridiculous and needs to be debated",
        "background": "We know that these substances have killed a number of people in this country, but that is not a reason to ban them all and throw them onto the black market, this will only make things worse and will be put into the hands of criminals who don't care and don't research. ",
