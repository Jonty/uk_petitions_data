        "additional_details": "The Theft Act 1968 enacts the crime of theft, burglary and handling of stolen goods as well as advertising reward for the return or stolen or lost goods but nothing specific to the theft or sale of power tools acquired by theft from private property. Tools are favourable items for thieves as they can be sold on quickly for an easy to find sum of money; the laws in place regarding theft are not a deterrent enough to prevent such crimes from happening while many bear a high cost to replace them.",
        "background": "Sole traders bear a high risk and heavy cost of tools and equipment being stolen because of the lack of policing, prevention and deterrent imposed by law. As a victim of such crime and having paid a high cost I believe those who acquire tools through theft or sale should face a specific charge.",
