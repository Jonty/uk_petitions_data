        "additional_details": "16 and 17 year olds weren't allowed to have a voice in the EU Referendum so it's important that we are given a voice now as potential Brexit deals will no doubt be discussed a lot during election campaigns. 16 and 17 year olds were allowed a say in their future during the Scottish Independence Referendum and this helped to increase the turnout to 80%. \r\n\r\nWe deserve a say when deciding the future of our country and having the vote will allow us to have our voices heard.",
        "background": "16 and 17 year olds don't have the right to vote in General Elections. If the House of Commons votes to hold a General Election on the 8th of June, over 1.5 million young people will not have the right to vote on our futures and won't be able to vote in a General Election until we are in our 20's.",
