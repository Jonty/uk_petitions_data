If they didn't plan to go through it and never used it before, they won't know how to pay, and would expect it to be automated (postal). Because it's not, they miss the pay deadline but then get posted a penalty. Are threatened \u00a35000 for making false complaints, if they have to appeal a declined complaint, threatened further costs in court.",
        "background": "Currently in the UK, TFL dont post the charge to people and only advertise info on their website. Their road signs don't say how, when or where to pay. Yet when the payment isnt received, they use the postal method to effectively recover the \u00a360 penalty. So why not begin with the postal method.",
