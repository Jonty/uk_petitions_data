        "action": "Recognise Brexit is too costly, cancel and prioritise spending on the NHS",
        "additional_details": "The costs of Brexit are increasing day by day. Thousands of expensive civil servants will be needed to renegotiate forty years of EU legislation and treaties with no guarantee that there will be improvement for any section of the population. Millions of EU and UK citizens abroad are living in uncertainty as to their futures while attention and resources are diverted from solving the crises in education and the NHS. Cancel Brexit and divert the resources saved to the NHS and our schools.",
        "background": "The costs of Brexit will be enormous - a shrunken economy wiping out any savings from leaving the EU with no guarantee after years of tough  and costly renegotiation we will achieve better trade treaties. Accept this now by cancelling Brexit in order to concentrate on saving the NHS and our schools.",
