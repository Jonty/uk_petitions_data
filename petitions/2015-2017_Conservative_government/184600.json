        "additional_details": "Drop in services are there when those suffering from mental health difficulties are in need of a safe place with trained staff to offer support & advice. They provide social & relaxation activities, promote social inclusion & self-care. Without these services, service users risk becoming socially isolated, unwell & putting pressure on GPs, A&E, inpatient beds & paramedics. With the NHS & social care in crisis, drop-in services provide a life line for people who need support. They save lives.",
        "background": "Mind provides open-access mental health support across the country, but it's only possible with help from government and support of local council and NHS partnerships. Mind Exeter & East Devon is now stopping this vital  service, replacing it with fixed appointments for a limited time.",
