        "action": "Make UK exit from EU dependant upon a secondary referendum on the terms agreed",
        "additional_details": "The Leave campaign made promises prior to the referendum which they were ill-positioned to make and which influenced the referendum decision. Leave campaigners were not representative of government and made idealistic promises as if in an election manifesto. Many of these promises, such as; an \u2018Australian style\u2019 points system for migrants, and extra spending on the NHS may not be possible and therefore voters may have been misled regarding the potential future state of UK outside of the EU.",
        "background": "The referendum decision to leave the EU is a very important one for the UK with currently unknown consequences. The consequences will depend upon the terms agreed. Therefore, triggering of article 50 should be delayed until the new terms are agreed and a secondary referendum is held on these.",
