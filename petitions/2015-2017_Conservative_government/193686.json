        "additional_details": "Poll from British Election Study, an academic on voting trend research, has found that the portion of Leave voters who regret their vote (or \"don't know\") is greater than the total margin of victory for Brexit.\r\nThat level of post-poll regret is unusual; only 4% of voters regretted their ballot in the 2015 general election.\r\nThe margin in the Brexit vote was 52% to 48% in favour of Leave. The BES study suggests that if the vote were taken again today then Britain would stay inside the EU\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Many of the people who voted \"Leave\" in the EU referendum now regret their vote because they didn't think \"Leave\" would win or they didn't realise the consequences of leaving the Single Market\r\n\r\n",
