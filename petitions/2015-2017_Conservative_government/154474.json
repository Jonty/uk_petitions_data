If last 27.8% were assumed status quo we would not be in current mess (share prices crashing, banks stopping trading, effect on pensions/jobs and increasing social tension)\r\nDisappointed not greater turnout at 1997 Welsh devolution referendum (Welsh BTW), 50.22% turnout + 50.3% Yes = 25.26% vote for the change.\r\nStrong mandate for change on critically important matters?\r\nFor legal requirement should be some exceptions. Before any vote, clear, concise & truthful information provided in advance - e.g. nobody Google \"what is the EU\" after casting vote. Check out facts before voting!!!!!!!!",

Their wasted vote should be cast to maintain the status quo. Very often little difference between or scant information on ramifications.",
