The price of tickets on public transport, including buses, is the responsibility of local transport authorities and transport operating companies.\r\n\r\nWhile the UK Government and Parliament do not directly set the price of tickets on public transport, the Government can set the rate by which transport authorities and companies can raise some ticket prices. You could start a new petition calling on the Government to change this rate, or a petition asking for other changes to the way in which public transport fares are set."
