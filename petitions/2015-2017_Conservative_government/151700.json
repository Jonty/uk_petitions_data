If a party gets 50% of the votes they would get half of the seats in parliament. \r\nIn our current First Past the Post system, if your vote is for a candidate who does not win the seat in your constituency it counts for nothing. \r\n",
        "background": "I have always been a Liberal Democrat supporter but I live in a Labour stronghold.  I always vote but have the depressing feeling that it doesn't really count.  A PR voting system would make parliament more representative, especially for those who are not supporters of the two big parties.",
