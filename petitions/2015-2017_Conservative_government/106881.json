        "additional_details": "There is also a general lack of awareness surrounding the issue of mental heath and physical disabilities, meaning people have a lack of knowledge surrounding the issue because the government do not address the topic as much as they should. If the goverment re-evaluate their approach towards mental heath and physical disabilites, more awareness could be raised and potentially more centres could be opened, with more volunteers and staff. ",
        "background": "Since 2010, the funding for mental health has slowly decreased. Studies show that mental heath funding has been cut by around \u00a3600m. This has resulted in closure of day centres and loss of staff leading to further closure. We feel that the government need to address this and provide extra funding.",
