        "additional_details": "The UK has the highest reported incidence in the world of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), a disease heavily associated with persistent and severe reflux and the precursor condition Barrett\u2019s Oesophagus, that kills 7,700 people each year. Many people who develop OAC have been self-medicating on over-the-counter medication for years before their cancer diagnosis. Diagnosing, monitoring and treating Barrett\u2019s Oesophagus is a key strategy for reducing the incidence of this cancer.",
        "background": "We call on Government to take steps to promote the earlier diagnosis of oesophageal cancer by requiring all packets of heartburn medication to carry an explicit warning of the importance of seeing a GP if symptoms persist for more than three weeks.",
