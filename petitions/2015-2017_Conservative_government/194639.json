        "additional_details": "We run the UK's only Cockerel rescue Big Red Rooster Rescue. We are being approached almost daily with pleas for help when the schools decide that they no longer want the responsibility of the resulting chicks. Very sadly the vast majority of male chicks are either slaughtered when sent back to the egg companies or are given away to well meaning but often totally unsuitable homes. You can see more evidence and stories on our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/BRR.CockerelRescue/",
        "background": "These schemes are basically a cute novelty dressed up as education and it is totally unacceptable that living creatures are exploited in this way. Especially in this modern era when you can live-stream chicks hatching and there are many city farms and facilities schools could visit.",
