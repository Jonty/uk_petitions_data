        "additional_details": "Patients cannot be discharged because they are unable to cope at home alone without care.This puts huge pressure on the NHS and puts seriously ill patients at risk. Budgets in elderley, disabled and mental health care are being continually cut thereby forcing people back into the NHS system. The problem will continue to get worse as the population lives longer and budgets are squeezed even harder. This cash could be used to create a sustainable social care plan to address these issues",
        "background": "Approx \u00a312bn was spent in foreign aid in 2015. The biggest recipient Pakistan has nuclear weapons! This cash could be used to fund a social care program that cares for the elderly, disabled and those with mental health issues. Bed blocking costs the NHS approx \u00a3900m a year.",
