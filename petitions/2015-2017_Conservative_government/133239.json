        "action": "Change NHS sight tests to meet the needs of people with learning disabilities",
        "additional_details": "The charity SeeAbility is calling for national pathways of eye care for people with learning disabilities, including for children in special schools, and for all working age adults with learning disabilities to be eligible for NHS funded sight tests. People are likely to need additional time or appointments to complete a sight test. This requires the Department of Health and NHS England to change the statutory and funding framework for NHS sight tests, to deliver an equal right to sight.",
        "background": "There are huge levels of sight problems amongst people with learning disabilities but they suffer unequal access to eye care. This is leaving many people with poor vision or even tragically losing their sight.",
