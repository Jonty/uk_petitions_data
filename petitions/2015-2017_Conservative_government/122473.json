        "additional_details": "Why not allow local councils to vote whether to keep the ban as it, weaken it slightly, strengthen it, or outright repeal it, this would be a way for local democracy in this country to help those who feel passionately on both sides. This could allow councils in rural areas that are against the ban, to show this and would allow councils in areas where people are passionately for the ban to strengthen the ban to levels they find acceptable?",
        "background": "The Hunting Act of 2004 and the Protection of Wild Mammals Act (Scotland) of 2002, ban the Hunting of wild mammals with dogs. There are arguments for and against this bill, but there is a large amount of people who want it repealed and a large amount of people who want it strengthened.",
