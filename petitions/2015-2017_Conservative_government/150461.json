        "additional_details": "One of the reasons for this is a basic lack of understanding on how our political system works, information on the parties themselves and how voting can have an impact on our daily lives. Also essential to this education is an ability to subjectively view information, making decisions by weighing up arguments and identifying bias. The EU referendum was particularly notable for misinformation by both camps and if this is the political world we are now entering, voters need to be prepared.",
        "background": "With only a 72% turnout in the EU referendum and some estimations of only 36% 18-24 year olds voting, it is clear that the importance of last Thursday's vote was not felt by everyone. At general elections it is even lower and lower still for local elections.   ",
