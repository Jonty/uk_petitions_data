You are happily driving along the motorway and come to a situation where you look to over take a vehicle ahead from the middle lane to the outer lane.\r\nHowever the vehicle ahead of you is also trying the same manoeuvre but is limited to 70MPH and you are then stuck behind them for quite some time before you are able to pass.\r\nThis can sometimes lead to a lengthy tailback in the traffic flow.\r\n",
        "background": "Cars, Vans or other forms of vehicle that are fitted with a 70 MPH speed limiter should not use the outer lane of a motorway.\r\nAs with HGV, they are restricted from using the outer lane.",
