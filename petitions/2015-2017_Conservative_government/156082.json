        "additional_details": "These issues are too important and volatile to be put on hold until September. MPs lead the country to a Referendum which was guaranteed to have profound and unexpected effects on the country. But it seems no contingencies were in place to handle one of the two possible the results. It is their responsibility as public servants drawing a publicly-funded salary to remain sitting until they have agreed a full and detailed plan. See www.parliament.uk/about/how/occasions/recallparliament for process",
        "background": "Parliament is set for a summer recess in July, not to return until September. Our country currently faces division and violence, uncertainty over the leadership of the two major parties, no answers for the future of The Good Friday Agreement, the position of pro-EU Scotland or the national economy.",
