        "action": "Guarantee EU residents the right to live, work, and study in the UK post-Brexit",
        "additional_details": "It is inconceivable that HM government would turn its back on three million EU citizens with family, children, friends, and professional ties in the country. Hence, it is right and just that HM government guarantee the rights of all foreign EU citizens currently living in the UK and of those legally taking up residence before exit terms have been agreed. We demand that HM government provide in writing a guarantee for EU citizens to permanently live, work, and study in the UK in the future. ",
        "background": "On 23 June, HM government held a referendum about the UK\u2019s membership in the EU, which resulted in a vote to leave. Many EU citizens residing in the UK were not given a voice in this referendum. We believe HM government must guarantee the future immigration status of EU residents. ",
