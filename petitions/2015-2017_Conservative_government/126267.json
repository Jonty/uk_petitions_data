After ten years of redevelopment the collection is now being dismantled, rendering it largely useless.",
        "background": "The Corsellis Brain bank took almost 50 years to build and was hugely important in research into illnesses such as epilepsy, CJD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and dementia.  \r\nThe West London Mental Health Trust is dismantling it for no purpose, as storing it would cost less than dismantling.",
