        "additional_details": "13 billion plastic carrier bags are used in the UK each year. Just 8.7 plastic checkout bags contain enough embodied petroleum energy to drive a car 1 kilometre. \r\n\r\nUsing sustainable and renewable natural plant fibres (such as hemp, flax, jute, and kenaf) and through industrial production techniques that mix them into plastics, a new award winning (Biomaterial of the year 2010) granule has been made from a combination of hemp with polypropylene, thus reducing the use of petroleum products.",
        "background": "With the advent of Plastic Bags came a worldwide problem that has shown itself to be one we must tackle head on.\r\n\r\nPlastic in our Eco Systems has cause major environmental issues. We've had the solution for many years, but we haven't had the backing of legislation to support change for the better.",
