On \u00a336,000 per year for 3 children this is \u00a3567 per month. Leaving the payee with \u00a31700 per month to live on. This is unfair on the payee.",

If you're earning \u00a336,000 per year it goes to over \u00a3100 per week for a child and continues going up with each pound earned. Cap the CSA payments to child benefit amounts! ",
