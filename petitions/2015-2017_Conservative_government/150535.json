        "action": "Make a statement of support to EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU.",
        "additional_details": "Post-Brexit there was no political statement regarding EU citizens in the UK and vice versa. But we've seen hostile depictions of migrants in the media, populists playing groups against each other, and even openly racist behaviour. While we all accept the UK electorate's decision we do not accept migrants being made scapegoats or target of abuse. EU migrants are a part of the UK. Politicians should remove insecurity and uncertainty about their future and state what a modern democracy stands for.",
        "background": "We ask the UK Parliament to declare that:\r\nAll migrants in the UK and EU are treated fairly and racism will not be tolerated.\r\nThe UK and EU will work together on agreements for EU migrants so that families aren't split or uprooted and companies and public sector won't lose employees or key workers.",
