        "additional_details": "The council are turning off ALL 75 CCTV CAMERAS in Westminster on the 1st September - This is going to result in a massive increase in robberies, drug misuse, assaults, rape and many other crimes. The Police would no longer be able to track a terrorist's movements, would no longer be able to follow someone that has just committed a serious crime or even see over a stop & search that an officer needs. We need these cameras kept on, please sign this petition to keep us all safe. Thank you.",
        "background": "Throughout our lives we have been surrounded by eyes in the sky, those little things that move from left to right, being there for us when we need them, defending us in court, putting that criminal behind bars due to what they have witnessed - Our Westminster CCTV. ",
