        "additional_details": "Periods are not optional and so neither are sanitary products; all women should be able to make informed decisions regarding which sanitary products to buy and use. Menstrual cups are not well known, but they need to be. If we are not careful, soon we will be walking on landfills full of used sanitary products. Not only are they better for our planet, reusable sanitary products are far cheaper in the long term and are equally, if not more, hygienic, as they don't risk TSS as tampons do.",
        "background": "Young girls should be educated in school about reusable sanitary products. They are informed about non-recyclable and non-reusable products, such as tampons, but not environmentally-friendly products, such as menstrual cups and washable towels (which also work out cheaper in the long term too).",
