        "additional_details": "Climate change has to be taken seriously and is a serious threat. There is a lack of understanding of the threat that climate change poses and it is deeply worrying that our government is seeing climate change as an afterthought to the Brexit negotiations. Climate change requires a dedicated minister, separated especially from Business and Industrial Strategy that drives a linear economy and compounds climate change. The new government reorganisation should move the UK forwards, not backwards.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The new government reorganisation has abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change. Climate change is not being prioritised in the new Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, under Greg Clark, evidenced by not even mentioning climate in the title. ",
