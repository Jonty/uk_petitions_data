        "additional_details": "Politicians seem to hate the English. They attack our national identity, criticise us for flying the flag of St. George, charge us more for our medicines, charge our children \u00a327,000 more for university tuition, apply an unfair funding formula so that the English have to subsidise the rest of the U.K., deny us representation through an English assembly/government and even deny us any the right to be proud of being English. Enough is enough. The English need to fight back for fairness and parity.",
        "background": "If the Scots get a St. Andrew's Bank Holiday (not to mention free university tuition compared to \u00a327,000 for the English) and the Irish get a St. Patrick's Bank Holiday - why do the English lose out again in not getting a St. George's Bank Holiday? We're at the bottom of the pile for everything.",
