        "additional_details": "The illegality of recreational drugs and subsequent lack of regulation in the market leads to substances being cut and mixed with dangerous or poisonous knock-offs. \r\n\r\nWhile it doesn't look like this government will legalize or decriminalize drugs, it is hoped that they will take this measure to enable people to make informed personal choices. ",
        "background": "More than 3,300 people died from drug poisoning in 2014 - The highest number since records began. This could be alleviated if festivals could offer tests to identify the purity and content of festival-goers pills and other substances.\r\n\r\nClear and simple legislation should be written to allow this.",
