        "additional_details": "We have seen a shift over the last decade to political parties targeting undecided voters with campaigns of soundbites, defamation, and poor information, instead of facts and balanced discussion.\r\n\r\nThis is leading to increasingly toxic views among the electorate both of opposing views and the political system, as well as the political entities themselves.\r\nThis is a trend that must be curbed and changed for the future health of the UK.\r\n\r\nMedia coverage is beyond the scope of this petition.\r\n",
        "background": "Both sides in the EU Referendum undertook campaigns of misinformation, lies and personal attacks. This includes claims by Leave which have been retracted after victory.\r\n\r\nWe need to hold political campaigns to account for this as the electorate cannot make informed decisions without clear facts.",
