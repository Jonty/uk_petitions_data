        "additional_details": "As there appears to be a petition for a 2nd EU referendum, I feel it only right and on behalf of 17 million other OUT voters that should this go ahead and the IN votes win, we demand a 3rd EU referendum. \r\n\r\nShould this ho ahead it would appear there was no democratic voting system, or the 2nd referendum wouldn't go ahead. \r\n\r\nEvery eligible voters had an opportunity to vote. Most eligible votes took up that right, the minority lost, the majority won but yet people don't like. \r\n\r\nIt was a fair vote, more fair than our general election that of done the same way Scotland wouldn't have 50 seats in Parliment. \r\n\r\nSo I urge the out voters to sign this petition so at least this side of the debate is heard in Parliment too. \r\n\r\nThanks ",
