        "additional_details": "Crabb, on his own Facebook account (https://www.facebook.com/StephenCrabbPembs/posts/1123686301014718) describes people on Employment and Support Allowance, in the Work-Related Activity Group, as \"able to work\". This is a grievous inaccuracy; all ESA claimants have, by definition, \"limited capability for work\". He then says all people who cannot work  are in the \"Support Group\" - another gross inaccuracy. He clearly has no grasp of the ESA legislation (eg Welfare Reform Act, 2007).",
        "background": "Stephen Crabb was appointed as the new Work and Pensions secretary, but has already revealed himself to not understand the simple legislative basis of the Department's work. He is not competent to manage this complex and important Department.",
