        "additional_details": "Frustrated at additional booking fees when you wish to see your favourite artists on tour? You're far from alone. And not only do Ticketoligarch, etc. charge 10+% in 'booking' fees, they do so per ticket, not per transaction, even if you print your tickets at home. It's a middle man's licence to print money, and it's slowly killing the appeal of live entertainment. Such online ticket sales must have fees capped, and made PER TRANSACTION.",
        "background": "Most high-profile musicians and entertainers on tour use ticketing websites - e.g. Ticketoligarch - who charge 10+% on top on the cover price. E.g. Russell Howard at Belfast Arena, \u00a333. Booking Fee, 3.95 per ticket. And tickets printed at home! We consider this unreasonable profit.",
