        "action": "Do not amend the Hunting Act using a Statutory Instrument",
        "additional_details": "\r\nMr Cameron has said he believes in the \"freedom to hunt\" and wants fox hunting legalised. He will go to any lengths to achieve this including riding over the will of parliament and that of the British people.\r\n\r\nFox hunting involves chasing and killing a fox, on horseback, with a pack of dogs, in traditional dress. This is a vicious and outdated pastime, and the idea of repealing the ban introduced by the Labour government, so that people like Cameron can hunt and kill foxes is a horrific one.\r\n",
        "background": "Mr Cameron is likely to repeal the fox hunting ban through the back door using a Statutory Instrument which does not require a vote in parliament. Over 80% of the British people and most MPs don't wish to see fox hunting reintroduced.\r\n\r\nPlease sign to show your disgust in this undemocratic act. \r\n",
