        "additional_details": "I have personal experience of this and it is heartbreaking being left on a ward with babies crying when you are trying to come to terms with the fact you have just lost your baby. During my experience a midwife had come in the room and congratulated me only to be told that my baby hadn't survived. I believe a separate area would benefit parents and help with the healing process. An area where information could be talked about and not whispered and where midwives could not make a hurtful mistake ",
        "background": "When a woman loses a baby or babies due to either a miscarriage or stillbirth they are placed on a maternity ward to recover. The woman who is grieving is surrounded by women who have just given birth and can hear babies crying. This is very hurtful and noway to help the healing process.   ",
