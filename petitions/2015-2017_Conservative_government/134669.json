        "additional_details": "Sovereignty and democracy were the backbones of this debate, let us keep on the march for change and build a better future. The fact that the current Conservative government holds court with such a small percentile of the vote is not democracy. Now they are trying to change leaders and keep control even though the landscape was changed by their hands. This is not fair. Proportional representation must be given a referendum. A general election must be held. A unified government is what we need.",
        "background": "The prime minister has resigned, whether you voted leave or remain is now irrelevant. A conservative government elected on a minority are now trying to foist an unelected candidate on us. This is not democracy, a second referendum on a PR voting system and a general election must now be called.",
