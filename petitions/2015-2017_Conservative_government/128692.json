        "additional_details": "Couples and families should not be torn apart my own included, I like many others do not have the freedom to be with my partner due to him not being an EU national. As a British Citizen I should not have to choose my love for my partner or the love of my family and country. The size of a bank account does not measure love. The way visa applications are reviewed needs to change, it needs to be accessed on individual cases and not finances, when this contradicts what JSA deems a liveable income. ",
        "background": "I am a British Citizen; I work, pay taxes and contribute positively to society. I am law abiding and want the freedom to be with the man I love without restriction due to ridiculous limitations set for spouse visa. This should be accessed on truth of relationship and not size of bank accounts. ",
