        "additional_details": "I, my wife & son are UK Citizens. We own a house in London & had decent jobs in financial service industry until we moved our center of life to India in Apr'14.\r\nFollowing my dad's demise, I'm desperate to return to our home in London but are forced to stay in India as UK won't let my mum in to settle & I can't leave her alone!  UK allows non EU family of EU immigrants under EU law but can't do the same for it's own citizens. Is this the price we have to pay for being UK citizens & tax payers?\r\n",
        "background": "Following my dad's terminal illness, my family (I, my wife & son) relocated to India in 2014 to look after my dad & support my mum.\r\nSince I have lost my dad, we want to return home (London) but I can't leave my elderly mum (who has already gone through a lot since 2012) on her own in India.",
