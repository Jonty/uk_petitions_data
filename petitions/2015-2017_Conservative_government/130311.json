With legal costs over \u00a313,000 for the parent! Would it not be easier to just know what the definition of regular attendance is? \r\nPlease support this petition, and support the hard working parents who either cannot take time off together in school holidays or cannot afford to take the children away in holiday time! Children deserve a holiday too!!",

Our two boys deserve a holiday as much as anyone! Both have good school attendance records and one week missed will not affect their learning!",
