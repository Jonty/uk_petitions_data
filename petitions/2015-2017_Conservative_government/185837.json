        "additional_details": "The problem is evident all over the country; more people who are in a mental health crisis or who have a history of mental health issues are calling 999, paramedics are sent to these individuals but because they are not usually physically unwell they are either assessed and left, or taken to hospital, where A&E doctors evaluate their physical health and once that is given the OK they are sent home, with no intervention from mental health services and usually the cycle starts again...",
        "background": "Any individual who is training to become a paramedic or nurse does not have to have any mental health training. With more and more people developing mental health issues, all medical professionals; especially frontline ones, should have mental health training alongside their medical training.",
