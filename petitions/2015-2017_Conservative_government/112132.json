        "action": "Ensure that Asylum Seekers and Refugees are fairly distributed throughout the UK",
        "additional_details": "The North West of England is being sent 33% of asylum seekers, despite having around 11% of the country's population. By contrast the South-East & London are taking very few refugees, with Liverpool taking more than the whole of London. This is placing a strain on community cohesion as certain areas struggle to allocate resources, and impairs our ability to adequately accommodate those in need. The only govt answer is we have a 'proud history' but we must have a fair UK system if we are to help.",
        "background": "At present the Home Office's Asylum Dispersal scheme is placing far too many people in particular areas of the UK whilst other areas share little of the responsibility for housing refugees. We ask the government to ensure that refugees are spread evenly throughout the country and not all sent north.",
