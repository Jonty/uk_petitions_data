Wrongful convictions destroy innocent lives and rip innocent families apart.  This needs to stop.\r\n\r\nAt trial, the judge should be required to state to the jury something along the lines of: \u201cDefendants are innocent unless proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt; therefore if you have ANY doubts, and those doubts are REASONABLE, you must find the defendant not guilty\u201d.",

If a complainant makes a false allegation, maintains it during cross examination, and the jury believe them, this is considered enough 'proof' to convict.",
