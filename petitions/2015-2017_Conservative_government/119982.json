        "additional_details": "What is needed is an awareness campaign like in 2000 when there was a country wide campaign to highlight the symptoms of meningitis. \r\nType 1 diabetes can kill equally as quickly as meningitis.\r\nEducation is needed for parents, carers, and even those in the medical profession.",
        "background": "The number of children being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes is rising at an alarming rate, especially in the under 5s. Unfortunately many people are unaware of the symptoms. This needs to change, children are dying due to mis-diagnoses. We, as a family were lucky with our son, we knew the signs.",
