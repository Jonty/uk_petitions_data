Despite this, and despite working between time at uni and placement I still struggle to survive, as many students do. I have seen the hard work and dedication NHS staff demonstrate and yet they are nother rewarded. I propose they are rewarded, and given the wage they deserve. Footballers and government officials receive thousands for a weeks \"work\". Give that money to the NHS workers who actually deserve it.  ",

I would like to see them given a wage that is appropriate for their skills and dedication, and hard work. A wage that permits living without so much worry. ",
