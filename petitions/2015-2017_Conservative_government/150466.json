        "additional_details": "Whilst I understand certain convictions should remain on a dbs disclosure permanently, my view is that a lot of people deserve a bona fide second chance. \r\nA wiping of the slate clean so to speak. I don't want myself and probably many others to keep on getting refused the chance to do better for themselves and their families because of a mistake they've made many years ago and have properly rehabilitated from. \r\nI urge the government to seriously consider this and let genuinely remorseful people move on. ",
        "background": "I was convicted 15 years ago of possession with intent to supply cannabis. \r\nI served my community service order and have never or will never re-offend.\r\nThe problem I have know is this will always show on a dbs disclosure and has stopped me, in some cases having a good career.",
