        "additional_details": "So many voters in the EU referendum have been shown to have little or no understanding of what it is they are actually voting on and why. This is in no way removing peoples right to vote, as anyone who wants to vote can then do the required research and pass the required test. We can't do many things without showing the required knowledge, why should we decide the country's future without it? This surely wouldn't be too hard to implement with today's online technology.",
