        "additional_details": "DLA is a benefit for children with disabilities.   Decision Makers have a guide which they use to make awards.  However because heart conditions do not appear in this guide even though they were in the old 'adult' version, Decision Makers have no guidance as to what awards to give.  Because of this, often they will make no award at all.  Sometimes they make awards that don't truly reflect the needs of the child and will only make them for short periods of time when these conditions are for life.",
        "background": "12 children each day in the UK are born with heart defects, others acquire them due to viruses. Outcomes for these children have never been better with surgical advances, but they need supervision, care and medication to allow them to live longer lives.  Many also have mobility needs.\r\n",
