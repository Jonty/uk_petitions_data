        "action": "No more bank bailouts - allow reckless banks to fail",
        "additional_details": "Since 2008, banking practices and culture have not changed enough to prevent a re-occurrence. The burden of saving the banks has fallen mostly on taxpayers, rather than those responsible for the crash. We cannot, as a nation, allow this to happen again. If banks cause another crash, they should be allowed to fail, and not receive another bailout. The government has refused to bail out non-banking industries that provide many jobs (most recently, steel), so they should treat banks the same.",
        "background": "In 2008, due to their reckless gambling with speculative financial products using money they did not actually have, the banks precipitated a worldwide economic crisis. The banks received over \u00a3100billion of public money in bailouts and loans to try and prevent them from collapsing completely.",
