If we are held up for more than 15 minutes it should be free to use also once we do get the chance to move we then have cameras holding us back which is unfair. Current management need to go as soon as possible. It is not healthy for humans to be stuck in traffic. We pay for this and we want the service we deserve ",

The tunnels are constantly being closed for the slightest thing. The current management need to go along with the unfair charges ",
