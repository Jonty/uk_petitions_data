        "additional_details": "According to census data, the percent of people in the UK who are Christian is declining. Only 59.5% of people in the last census said they were Christian, with no religion taking 25.7% and non-stated taking 7.2%. Since the Queen is the Head of the Church of England it is clear the meaning of \"God\" in the anthem cannot be about Allah or Zeus.\r\n\r\nThe current anthem talks about \"rebellious Scots to crush\". This shows how the anthem does not represent the country.\r\n\r\nThe current anthem does not unify the country and \"Rule Britannia\" and \"Land of Hope and Glory\" are clearly the best alternatives. Many other proposals for alternatives are often England-specific, such as \"Jerusalem\". ",
        "background": "The national anthem does not represent the nation. The national anthem should be \"Rule Britannia\" or \"Land of Hope and Glory\" as they are the best candidates to replace the anthem. The current anthem represents the monarch over the nation and does not promote solidarity within the United Kingdom.",
