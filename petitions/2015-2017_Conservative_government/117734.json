Of them, I'm sure, they will agree they've encountered numerous occasions where other motorists have almost hit them, causing them to swerve; putting their lives at risk. \r\nUnfortunately, there is not enough signage on the road to remind people about bikers. There are no warning signs on slips onto carriage and motorways. There are no reminders on sharp blind bends. There are no reminders at junctions. Why? This needs to change, and fast!",

FACT!\r\nWe are more exposed and less mentioned on the roads, with lack of signage and notifications, warning and reminder signs for people to check their blind spots causing us to swerve and near miss. Lets change this!",
