        "additional_details": "Key figures have made statements throughout the campaign that they are now disclaiming, and which were key to the decisions of the public. Given these have now been shown to be incorrect, and the catastrophic impact on the Stock market and Pound has proven to be accurate, the referendum should be voided and a new referendum started which ensures only factual material is allowed to be promoted by law.",
        "background": "The campaign on both sides have continually misinformed the public throughout the campaign. The public has made a decision without facts available, and this is becoming clear in the follow up with key items such as the \u00a3350m per week claim being incorrect, as well as the immigration control.",
