        "action": "We would like to abolish VAT from all fruit, vegetables and health related foods",
        "additional_details": "As a teenager in the UK, i feel buying healthier options is less appealing as they cost substantially more than sugary goods E.G a chocolate bar. By removing VAT on healthy products i would be more inclined to buy more nutritious food choices. We have seen that over 13,000,000 people in the UK in 2016 are now obese as published by the university of Birmingham. We feel that this can be dropped by removing VAT on healthy products.",
        "background": "We strongly believe that healthy foods are being wrongfully taxed. By abolishing these taxes, we hope to achieve a healthier, more active society. With healthy foods becoming more accessible, our aim is to reduce the rising obesity rates affecting teenagers across the UK. ",
