        "additional_details": "The Referendum must be run again, this time with the public being given the true facts.  This is probably the most important decision ever made by the public in the last 50 years, at least allow us to make that decision with honest, uninflammatory and accurate information.  Claiming that we pay \u00a3350 million per week to the EU and that the money could be spent on the NHS is a complete fabrication of the truth.  Honesty is essential.",
        "background": "Too many of the public are complaining about the lies told to them by the politicians when campaigning for Brexit or Remain.  It is essential that information passed onto the public must be accurate and truthful in order that a sound judgement whether to Remain or Leave can be made. ",
