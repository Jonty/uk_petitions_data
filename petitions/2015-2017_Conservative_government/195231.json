        "additional_details": "Currently the electorate is addressed by parties on the general policies and intentions of a prospective government, but are not reliably informed of which members of that party would be given key posts before they vote. It seems like a sensible addition to the electoral process to state the expected composition of the new government so that voter choices can be better informed, and thus make a better estimate of how successfully the various operations of government will be carried out.",
        "background": "Political parties should be required to annouce who they intend to fill government offices prior to any election, thus giving the electorate opportunity to compare the experience and ability of candidates for the various departments of government.",
