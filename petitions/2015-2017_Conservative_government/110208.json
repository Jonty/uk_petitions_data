        "action": "Prevent the closure of The Green residential care home, Leeds.",
        "additional_details": "The Green has been a staple in giving many older people a sense of independence in a safe, secure environment. The closing of this care home would mean that the residents would have to be moved to other homes, many of which do not provide the same support and care. Having a family member living in The Green, and seeing her thriving in a caring environment has been an amazing reassurance for my family. Closure would mean upheaval of residents; upsetting and confusing for all those involved.",
        "background": "Due to cost cutting by Leeds City Council, steps have been made to close The Green care home. This care home provides specialist care for residents with Alzheimer's and Dementia, providing a caring, secure environment. We hope to stop this and urge LCC to direct cutting measures to other areas. ",
