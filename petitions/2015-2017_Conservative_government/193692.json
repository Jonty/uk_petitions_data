Individual trust hospitals do not work and a national strategy managing ALL aspects of health is required.",
        "background": "NHS has gone through too many changes following political dogma depending on which party or minister is in charge.  NHS requires steady management on long term basis so it can concentrate on long term public heath and needs.  It needs to be taken out of the political arena ",
