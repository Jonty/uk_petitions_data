        "action": "Pass a parliament motion in support of United States President coming to the UK",
        "additional_details": "In 2016 the British people voted to leave the EU. Among the principal reasons for this vote was the unpopular policy of mass immigration and its concomitant cultural and economic consequences. Many who voted leave would support policies similar to those espoused by Donald Trump. This considered, the President of the United States undoubtedly has large support among the UK electorate who wish and hope he is welcomed with open arms to our country and received hospitably by Her Majesty the Queen.",
        "background": "The mainstream media display explicit bias against the U.S President Donald Trump. This petition has been created for his many supporters and admirers in our country to express approval of Donald Trump, and his recent executive order prohibiting entry to the US from specified countries.
