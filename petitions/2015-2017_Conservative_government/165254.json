        "action": "Hold a Parliamentary debate on Social Media Abuse",
        "additional_details": "The NSPCC, along with Barnados, have a huge amount of data highlighting the serious issues teenagers are dealing with when becoming victims of social media abuse. Not enough safeguards are deployed within these sites to deal with the amount of abuse aimed at our children which leave parents in total despair. The level of abuse affects our children in many ways with poor exam results, disengagement within society, drug and alcohol abuse, eating disorders and in some cases self harm and suicide.",
        "background": "Social media abuse, including cyberbulling, trolling, sexting and grooming, are negatively affecting thousands of teenagers' lives on a daily basis, culminating in self harm, alcoholism, mental illness and suicide. We wish for the companies responsible to take additional steps to police their sites.",
