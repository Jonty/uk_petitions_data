        "additional_details": "I have a photograph for evidence for how much room the animal had to move and stretch. This animal was growling in agony trying to get out. The polar bear needs to be in its own environment in the cold where they belong! Not trapped in a cage. The animal was muddy and covered in dirt. It didn't have a White fur as you'd expect.",
        "background": "I visited Yorkshire Wildlife Park on Wednesday 29th March 2017. I came across 3 polar bears who had a large amount of land to walk on with a big built in pond where they could swim and jump around. I then came across a 4th polar bear isolated on its own with 4 foots worth of height to walk under.",
