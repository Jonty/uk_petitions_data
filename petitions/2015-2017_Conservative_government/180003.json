        "action": "Support a state visit invitation to US President Donald Trump to the U.K.",
        "additional_details": "Furthermore, the details of President Trump's accord DO NOT represent a ban on all Muslims entering the US as being portrayed, but a temporary measure pending a review of the profiling and security processes that protect the USA. There are clear potential threats associated with allowing entry from certain high risk, destabilised countries in the Middle East. \r\n\r\nAffording President Trump a State Visit furthers the opportunity for debate. Blocking it achieves nothing positive at all. ",
        "background": "Donald Trump is the democratically elected President of the USA, Great Britiain's closest  ally. A state visit invitation must be extended, making for an open political forum to debate international policies. The President is reflecting the will of the American people and that must be respected.",
