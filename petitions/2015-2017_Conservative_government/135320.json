        "action": "Disregard the motion of no confidence on Jeremy Corbyn.",
        "additional_details": "This seems to be an odd decision as I see very little evidence against Jeremy Corbyn. The evidence of his hard work and dedication to help people make a decision is evident in many areas of the U.K that he campaigned scrupulously at every opportunity. \r\n\r\nHe has done a lot for his party and was given a clear mandate as the leader of Labour. As a member of the general public with a knowledge of the consensus of the people he is loved by many and seen as a beacon of hope in these troubled times. ",
        "background": "Jeremy Corbyn is being brought to a vote of no confidence due to a lack of drive in his EU referendum campaign. I am forwarding a petition to disregard this as I and many others have witnessed his thorough campaign to remain in the EU through both social media and his local visits and interviews. ",
