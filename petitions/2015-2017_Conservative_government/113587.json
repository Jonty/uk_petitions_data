        "additional_details": "Using figures from 2013 it costs on average between \u00a320k and \u00a345k to keep a prisoner in a UK prison, the amount increases with the severity of the criminal offences the prisoner is charged with.\r\n\r\nOver crowded prisons are bleeding money, if the government can't keep drugs out of prisons how do they plan to keep them off the street? Prohibition has failed, the time for change is now.\r\n\r\nOutside of the known medicinal benefits (which seem to increase daily) there are numerous monetary benefits too.",
        "background": "By legalising (minimum decriminalising) cannabis we can help to make our society better. \r\n\r\nIf we legalise cannabis we could save all the time, money & resources spent on policing etc. & put the money made back into the local economy, housing, the arts, education, hospitals & the care industry.",
