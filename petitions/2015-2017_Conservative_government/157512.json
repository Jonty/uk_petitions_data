        "additional_details": "The \"brain drain\" was a concern for governments in the sixties and seventies who were concerned to see many scientists and academics choosing careers in the US because of better pay and conditions.  \r\n\r\nNow that the future of higher education is in doubt and many jobs are at risk the UK looks set to see a second brain drain.",
        "background": "In the aftermath of the EU referendum a high number of professionals are considering leaving the UK for jobs in the EU or elsewhere.  \r\nThis is something the government can and should monitor as the departure of those unloved experts will negatively impact the UK economy.",
