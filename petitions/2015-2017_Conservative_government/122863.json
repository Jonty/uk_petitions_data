IPSA conducted a public consultation after 2012 and decided what the salaries of MPs should be after the election.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contact IPSA about its decision, here\u2019s how to contact them:\r\n\r\nhttp://parliamentarystandards.org.uk/About%20Us/Pages/Contact-Us.aspx\r\n\r\nHowever, the Government does have the power to increase or decrease Ministers' pay. You could start a new petition calling for a cut in minsterial pay.\r\n"
