        "additional_details": "As it stands, it is the Government's decision whether or not to invoke Article 50. Furthermore, the result of the recent referendum has revealed great divisions in our country; the close result, in combination with the advisory nature of the referendum, means whatever the Government chooses to do will be viewed as essentially illegitimate by a great many people. We believe that allowing Parliament its say in this issue is important to preserve the integrity of the Government's decision, and, moreover, to begin to help us end the discord between ourselves.",
        "background": "The recent referendum has shown that many in the UK wish it to leave the EU. This would require the Government to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. We call on the Government, following the result of the advisory referendum, to let Parliament vote on whether Article 50 should be invoked or not.",
