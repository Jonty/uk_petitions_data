        "additional_details": "Here is one of many many examples over a broad spectrum of reporting. It states \"a dramatic drop in UK economy\", whereas the report was about PMI which measures sentiment. Two very different things; either the BBC is incompetent or is deliberately aiming to deceive. Since the vote the BBC has been totally anti Brexit. Regardless of anybodies position on this vote, the truth should be reported. Also, news that the British people have the right to hear should not be unreported or BLACKED OUT.",
