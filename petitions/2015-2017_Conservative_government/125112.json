        "additional_details": "Me and my young family will never own a council property because we are hard honest working people and have been for 10 years,it seems like my generation have been let down by a shoddy system that allows lazy people who don't intend to work get a lovely council place at a drop of a hat while people like us are forced to pay the likes of \u00a31200 a month for a 2 bed room flat in Surrey!,the government has got the system all wrong if you ask me,time to protect your workers who want a future",
        "background": "It seems the only way to acquire council properties is to be pregnant and single mothers,being \"kicked out\" by parents writing letters,or just not being British at all that you get help with council properties,stop penalising people who don't sign on.",
