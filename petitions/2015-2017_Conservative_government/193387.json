        "additional_details": "Most people don't realise that gender reassignment doesn't require 'sex change' surgery. Under the proposed Gender Identity Equality Bill, the only requirement is a person's feeling about their gender. \r\n\r\nPeople are already confused about what constitutes sex in humans - criminal data's no longer reliable; sex segregation is compromised; women's sports & scholarships are open to anyone with a 'female identity'. Sex and gender are both protected characteristics but this is legally unsustainable.",
        "background": "With recent developments in gender identity, we need to clarify what we mean when we talk about a person's sex. The law treats gender the same as sex, but gender reassignment doesn't require any medical treatment. There are conflicts of interest between people of the same gender but different sexes.",
