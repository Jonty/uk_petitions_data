You would need to explain clearly how you would like the law to change, e.g. to require a minimum number of established trees/bird boxes per square meter of developed land. \r\n\r\nAn example of a similar petition which we recently accepted, and which you may like to sign, is: \"Change planning laws so all New House Builds must have hedgehog holes in fences\" - https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/119873"
