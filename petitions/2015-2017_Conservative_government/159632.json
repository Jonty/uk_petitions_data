        "additional_details": "After the invasion no evidence was found to support the WMD claims, the Chilcott enquiry has also found that parts of the intelligence used to make these decisions was either false or not properly vetted before the PM made a decision.\r\n\r\nThese failings cost the lives of 179 British service personnel and countless thousands of Iraqi's, left a nation completely destabilised and has cost the taxpayers countless 10's of millions of pounds.\r\n\r\nMr Blair should go before The Hague to be investigated.",
        "background": "Tony Blair used made up evidence and poorly conceived intelligence to launch an illegal war against Iraq. They claimed they had intelligence on WMD's which would allow them to use UN resolution 1441 so that military action could be legally justified without a further resolution.",
