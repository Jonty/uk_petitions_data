        "additional_details": "i and many others have had a bad time with company`s that do medical assessments for the DWP many times what has been written in the assessment the claiment says is wrong so if all interviews are voice recorded this would eliminate incorrect  evidance\r\nthe claiment should be allowed to supply there own voice recording equipment and record the interview\r\nin my own case i had an interview at home and 4 mths later was booked another one company lied and said no one had been to see me i won my case",
        "background": "Due to the amount of assessments being overturned by the tribunal that are carried out on behalf of the DWP,If they are all recorded on a machine that will/can record voice then there can be no mistakes made as to what was said at the  interview and in the long run this will save tax payers money.",
