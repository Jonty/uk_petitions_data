        "additional_details": "\"They make people lazy\" is the general consensus when people talk about these, whilst they do allow people to just lean to move instead of walk they help peoples balance and tighten the muscles in the lower legs. \r\nPeople used to complain about young people spending too much time playing games, but when given the chance to use technology outside they are breaking the law.\r\n How are we meant to inspire inventors and pioneers of technology if the latest developments are locked out of public sight",
        "background": "Self-Balance Boards are small compact devices that are often called swegways or hoverboards and have sparked up all over the media in the past few months.\r\nThey are ideal for short journeys around city centers, shopping centers and public parks. They are currently banned due to a 180 year old law.",
