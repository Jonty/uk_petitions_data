In total, Tiheros received 5 seperate opinions on a solution, including that of the leading soft tissue specialist in Europe, but it was deemed unethical and inhumane to keep him alive. Less than 3 weeks after bringing him home we had to put him to sleep. That he was ever deemed \"Fit To Fly\" is disgraceful and needs to be reviewed.",
        "background": "I recently had an awful experience of adopting a cat from Cyprus who I thought was healthy. Unfortunately he wasn't and had a very serious rectal prolapse which, following veterinarian checks was inoperable. The most human solution was to euthanize him. He should have never been allowed to fly!",
