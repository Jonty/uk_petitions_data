        "additional_details": "The EU Referendum, and all of the ensuing media coverage, has been going on for months - certainly all of 2016, almost daily. This should not - MUST not - be hijacked by any 'change of direction'. This is a vital vote, and whichever side you may feel moved towards, then the loss of an MP, sad though it may be, cannot be reason enough to stop the EU Referendum taking place.",
        "background": "There has been a knee-jerk reaction to the tragic death of a UK MP. Suddenly the audience is being asked to put a hold on the EU Referendum, and I maintain that this is wrong. The two points are not connected, and should not be. The EU referendum is more important, bigger, than all of this.",
