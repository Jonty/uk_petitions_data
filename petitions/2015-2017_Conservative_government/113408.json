        "additional_details": "The surrounding villages are heavily impacted from Cannock to Coleshill by commuters avoiding the toll and certain A roads like the A446, A5 between Cannock and Tamworth and A38 south to Minworth hit a standstill almost every day during the rush hour. It is now time the government put the M6 toll in to public hands, make it free and allow the thousands of midland commuters, surrounding villages and truck firms to benefit from this project and free up the west midlands and M6.",
        "background": "The M6 Toll road was created as a bypass to ease congestion on the M6. Unfortunately the cost to use the road is an issue and for a regular commuter costs approximately \u00a3200 per month with the discount. The lack of use causes huge congestion on every A road and has not eased congestion on the M6.",
