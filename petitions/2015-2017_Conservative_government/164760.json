        "additional_details": "This petition aims to remove Parental Responsibility from abusive parents in cases involving domestic abuse.\r\n\r\nI am a mother and I have fled an abusive marriage; my experience trying to protect my child from an abusive father is that the justice system strives to ensure child access to both parents, despite there being incidents of domestic abuse. This jeopardises the safety and well-being of the child, which should be paramount.\r\n\r\nUltimately, would you want your child in the unsupervised company of an individual that has committed domestic abuse?",
        "background": "In Child Access disputes, the safety and well-being of the child should be paramount, not access to both parents. \r\n\r\nParental responsibility is an automatic right to a mother from birth and to a father from birth if he is married to the mother or listed on the birth certificate.",
