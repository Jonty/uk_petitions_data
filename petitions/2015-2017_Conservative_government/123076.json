        "additional_details": "Ticket resale websites such as getmein.com and viagogo.co.uk allow individuals to resell tickets for events at extortionate prices. For example the recent sell out of Catfish and the Bottlemen's tour has lead to hundred's of tickets being available for up to ten times face value of the ticket just minutes after the event sold out. Although the live music industry is where this problem is most significant, individuals continue to capitalise on events throughout the arts performance industry.",
        "background": "There is no cap on the profit individuals are allowed to make when reselling tickets using the appropriate resale websites. This is means people are able to make an extreme profit on the hard work of artists. Exploitation of the arts industry like this should not be acceptable.  ",
