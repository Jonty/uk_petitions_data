It is therefore unfair for Londoners to pay the price of what they chose to not Happen.It is therefore extremely undemocratic.London is also  multicultural and is very much capable of independency.Therefore Holding a Referendum on Londons independency will hence clarify if Londoners truly feel if they are being stripped of their poltical views.",
