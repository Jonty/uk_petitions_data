Abattoirs are supposed to do this cleanly and fast with a sharp blade in one cut. Evidence has been published by the press showing this is not happening and the animals are being beaten with several cuts to the throat. We do not allow the beating and stoning of woman, polygamy and underage marriage, etc. on religious grounds, so why the slaughter of animals in this ancient barbaric way?",
