        "additional_details": "Why should more civilians die at the expense of the British government's decision to bomb Syria, especially when we have the evidence of the past mistakes in Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003) to learn from this? The money used to bomb countries could be better used to help keep refugees safe, rather than creating more and to improve domestic problems, such as saving the NHS.",
        "background": "There have been many accounts of military action in the Middle East, all of which have resulted in the death of hundereds of thousands of innocent civilians.",
