        "additional_details": "Enough is enough!\r\n\r\nTomorrow it could be you or I or your children or loved ones.\r\n\r\nThese cowards think that we are weak because we do nothing and whilst ever they believe this they will carry on slaughtering us.\r\n\r\nBy doing nothing we are in danger of losing the Freedom bought for us at such great cost twice in the last Century.  We must not betray the Sacrifice of those brave men and women who gave their lives for us to live in Freedom.\r\n\r\nThose who bring, or would bring, death and destruction into our Homelands should also forfeit their lives in order to save innocent lives and we therefore humbly petition our Members of Parliament to re-introduce the death penalty for anyone found guilty of terrorist offences\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Since the attack on America on 9/11 2002 when some 3,000 innocent people were murdered there have been at least another 2,000 men, women and children cowardly murdered in addition to those murdered in Belgium today.\r\n",
