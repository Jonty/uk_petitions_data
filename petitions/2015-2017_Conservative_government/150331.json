        "additional_details": "Over 65's voted 61% in favour of leave versus 18-24 year olds voted 75% for remain.\r\n\r\nThe leave camp will have a net loss of 83,070 people every year due to deaths. The remain camp will have a net gain of 102,375 due to 17 year olds becoming voters.\r\n\r\nThat's a swing of +233,820 votes a year for Remain, meaning it will take 5.4 years before the decision to leave the EU becomes functionally undemocratic.\r\n\r\nThanks to Dave Baldelli for this info (Mid-Worcestershire Green Party Communications Officer)",
        "background": "The vote this time was determined in part by the large numbers of the older voters supporting Brexit. However, they will obviously have to live for much less time with the consequences of the vote than those aged 16-18 - so in this case 16-18 year olds should have a vote.",
