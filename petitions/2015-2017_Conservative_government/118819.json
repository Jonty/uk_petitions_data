        "additional_details": "The British Medical Association is one organisation trying to push for an opt out system of organ donation in England.\r\n\r\nWith an opt-out system every one over a certain age automatically gets signed up for organ donation, unless they choose to opt out. With around 82% of people willing to donate their organs but only 33% actually doing it we could see an increase in organ donation and save lives.\r\n\r\nThe system of donation in Wales recently changed to opt-out. England should be looking to follow.\r\n\r\n ",
        "background": "Statistics show that 82% of the population would consider donating their organs.\r\n\r\nBut only around 33% of people in the UK are actually registered.\r\n\r\nEach year around 1000 people die while waiting for a transplant.\r\n\r\nOpt-out organ donation will encourage people to donate organs and save lives.\r\n",
