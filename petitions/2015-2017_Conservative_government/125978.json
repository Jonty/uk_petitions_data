        "additional_details": "In 2011 the MOD gave back most of its housing stock to the Gibraltar Goverment in a land agreement. This caused an end to marriage accommodation for Serving MOD soldiers. Thus meaning soldiers were expected to pay \u00a31200-1500 a month for a two bedroom on a soldiers wage. Soldiers cant afford this and are either having to rent illegally in Gibraltar, live in poverty, beg for postings to the uk which are limited, live in a different country than the one they are protecting or leave the regiment.",
        "background": "Currently married soldiers serving in the Overseas Gibraltar regiment are not offered any form of SFA housing or help with rent relief. They are paid less than UK soldiers, live in a place with a much higher rate of living and has private rental prices of 1200-1500 for a 2 bed small flat.  ",
