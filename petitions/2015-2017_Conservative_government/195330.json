        "action": "Make killing farm animals in front of each other illegal.",
        "additional_details": "There are so many issues with how slaughterhouses are managed, there is no cctv, calves are taken away from their Mothers and killed so that people can consume the cows milk, amongst many other problems. However, this must be tackled one problem at a time in order to cover all areas concerned. \r\n\r\nPutting animals in one room and slaughtering other animals in view of them is barbaric and archaic. There is a rise in documentaries and videos that highlight this issue.",
        "background": "Farm animals are slaughtered in front of other farm animals. It causes great distress to the animal and is inhumane on numerous levels. People are becoming increasingly aware of the treatment of farm animals, hence the rise in veganism, which wouldn't happen if farm animals were treated better. ",
