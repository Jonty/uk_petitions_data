        "additional_details": " Therefore responsibility has gone. A car is a lump of metal but people are fined if the log book is not changed over to the new owner. The same law needs to be applied to chipped pets. If you sell/give away a pet then you are responsible for obtaining the new owners details, the same as selling a car on. If not, YOU are liable.  Proof of address is all is needed, passport etc. It is not hard! This now needs to be the next stage in making people responsible for their pets and liable if any harm comes to them if you have not taken the correct steps when your pet goes to a new home.  This WILL stop further animal abuse.",
        "background": "Too many owners are getting away with animal abuse. They are stating, when RSPCA/ police knock on their door, they \"sold it on\" or \"only bred it\". Therefore responsibility has gone. A car is a lump of metal but people are fined if the log book is not changed over to the new owner. ",
