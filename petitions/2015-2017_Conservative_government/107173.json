        "additional_details": "Container deposit legislation has proven itself to be very effective elsewhere in Europe (Germany, Denmark, etc) and North America.\r\n\r\nA 10p deposit on each item, eg: 15 items would be worth \u00a31.50, is not a huge amount - but enough to make people think twice before littering and/or a sufficient incentive for someone to pick up such items.\r\n\r\nPrices would not increase - as any deposit paid is refundable upon return.\r\n\r\nThis petition requests that the Government put a Bottle Bill before Parliament.\r\n",
        "background": "Tons of litter consisting largely of plastic bottles and aluminium cans is dumped on our streets, roads and parks each year. It remains littering our streets - or costs councils millions of pounds to pick up.\r\n\r\nThe UK has one of the worst litter problems in Europe - Let's clean up our country.",
