A month ago I wouldn't have known my self. \r\nIt's an evil disease that effectively makes your child waste away. Their muscles waste until eventually they suffer respiratory failure, the whole time their brain unaffected.",
        "background": "NHS England have today announced that all early access programmes regarding Nusinersen will be put on hold. They want to open just 5 centres accross the country, this takes time. Time is something many SMA children don't have. \r\nPlease join me in asking NHS England to reverse this decision. ",
