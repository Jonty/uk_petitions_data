        "additional_details": "George Osborne, who set up the scheme last March said: \"A 10 % deposit on the average first home costs \u00a315,000, so if you put in up to \u00a312,000, we\u2019ll put in up to \u00a33,000 more.\" \r\n\r\nOnly now are we finding out that this will actually be given after completion. So who exactly does this help? A maximum of \u00a33000 off a \u00a3240,000 mortgage? This isn't little to NO help.\r\n\r\nPlease sign my petition to help get this changed, so the bonus can actually be used to help young people buy their first home!",
