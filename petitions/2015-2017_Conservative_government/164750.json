        "additional_details": "To be accepted into Uni, you are expected to have so many qualifications and diplomas and grades before you even get considered a application. There are thousands of people who deserve a chance and who desperately want the opportunity but are seen as not good enough to do so. This partition to lower expectations of entry requirements could change the lives of so many, Young people who are at the beginning of the career chances or even parents who want to start a new career for their families.",
        "background": "It is very hard to get where you want to be in life when it comes to careers that can only be accomplished through university, I have a level 2 diploma and GCSE'S but this is not enough to accomplish my dream job. University expectations are too high and do not give people the opportunity.",
