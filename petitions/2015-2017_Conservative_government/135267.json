        "additional_details": "True democracy can only stem from an informed populace, and misinformation undermines this principle. \r\n\r\nThe most obvious example of this recently comes from the EU referendum, where the Leave campaign repeatedly claimed that we spend \u00a3350m per week on the EU. \r\n\r\nThis figure was robustly shown to be untrue early on in the campaign, but continued to feature prominently on advertising throughout. The ASA was unable to act on inaccurate information due to the exemptions on political advertising.",
        "background": "Political advertising is currently not held to the standards of truthfulness, decency or honesty required in commercial advertising. We apply far stricter rules when selling a toaster, than when selling the electorate a manifesto. We require the same high standards for all advertising.",
