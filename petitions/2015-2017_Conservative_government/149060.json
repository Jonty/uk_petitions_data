        "additional_details": "The threat of a punishment in a clear attempt to undermine democracy in this country and to rig the referendum, through blackmail to remain. The fact that even 60 of his own MP's threatened to reject such a budget is telling. This, in conjunction with the British people to vote to leave the European Union has seriously undermined his authority and legitimacy",
        "background": "George Osborne's attempts to blackmail the British people into voting remain are beneath contempt. His failure to prepare for Brexit could have far reaching implications. Britain has spoken and this Chancellor is not fit to hold office. The Prime Minister has resigned, so should George Osborne",
