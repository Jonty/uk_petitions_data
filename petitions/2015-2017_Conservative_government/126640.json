        "additional_details": "Dyslexic experts, educationists and teachers' unions say the new rules on marking, announced by the Department for Education last month, will penalise hundreds of thousands with a genuine spelling disability and make it more difficult for them to reach target grades. A spokesman for Ofqual confirmed there would be no special exemptions from the marking regime for dyslexic pupils. ",
        "background": "Dyslexic pupils can lose 5% of their marks in English literature, geography, history and religious studies due to poor spelling. Why should these pupils be discriminated against because of their disability",
