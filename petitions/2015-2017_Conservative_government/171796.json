        "additional_details": "The UK Government provide 0.7% of the Gross National Income to International aid. Most of this money is spent on educating children, immunisation, refugees and encouraging global action on climate change. However the water crisis is a significantly problematic issue, as 1 in 9 people do not have access to clean water and adequate sanitation, which kills 5,000 children daily.This leads to a lack of education and rapid spread of diseases, forcing families to fall further into extreme poverty.   ",
        "background": "Priti Patel, the Secretary of State for International Development said British aid money had previously been wasted and stolen. Funds as such could have been used towards Water And Sanitation Hygiene Projects; which would work towards the Global Goal 6, ensuring the availability of water to everyone",
