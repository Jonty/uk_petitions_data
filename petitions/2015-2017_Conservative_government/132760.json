        "additional_details": "In 2000 the First Minister Mr David Trimble of the power sharing executive announced its decision to give official recognition to Firefighters for their contribution during the Troubles. Many retired and serving Firefighters believed that the form of recognition to be received would be a medal that they could proudly wear on their uniform or display in their home. Many have been so disappointed that they did not receive a medal which is just deserved for the service and sacrifices made.",
        "background": "Firefighters in N. Ireland worked on the frontline within their own communities dealing with many horrifying situations. At times they worked at great risk to their own safety but always putting the safety of members of the public first. Such incident would shake you to the core upon returning home.",
