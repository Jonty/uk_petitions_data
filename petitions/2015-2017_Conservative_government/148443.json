        "additional_details": "Only 2 of the home nations voted in favour of leaving the EU.\r\nScottish independence has already received higher levels of support as a result and a referendum seems likely.\r\nSin Fein are already suggesting that NI could join the ROI rather than leave the EU, raising the likelihood of an increase in sectarian violence. \r\nDon't be the government who allowed the UK to fall apart. \r\nDo your duty and vote down the referendum result to save the UK.",
        "background": "We are a parliamentary democracy and parliament has the right, and the responsibility, to act in the best interests of the UK regardless of public opinion.\r\nThe result of the EU Referendum has already proved harmful to the stability of our country and article 50 should not be invoked by parliament.",
