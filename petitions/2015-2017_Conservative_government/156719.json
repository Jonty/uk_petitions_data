        "action": "Ban the use of \"committed suicide\" by public bodies or in any official context.",
        "additional_details": "There was a similar petition to this which recently gained over 2000 signatures, but this has since become inactive due to it being on here for more than six months and failing to obtain 10,000 signatures. I am doing several charity events to raise money for the SOBS charity who help those left behind following death by suicide, and I would like to reignite this petition, gaining enough signatures for this issue to be seen and considered in parliament.",
        "background": "My Grandfather ended his own life 11 years ago, for reasons we will never know. My Grandmother never recovered from both finding him after he had passed, but more so the stigma attached to the way in which he died. Suicide isn't a crime, and the term 'committed' should cease to be used in reference.",
