These skills taught at a young age will ensure that they are never forgotten. \r\n\r\nUp to 150,000 people a year could be given a chance to live if more people knew first aid.\r\nThousands of people are dying each year in situations where first aid could have made the difference. This includes nearly 2,500 who asphyxiate from a blocked airway and 29,000 who die from heart attacks. Source St Johns.\r\n\r\n",
