        "action": "Make bullying in all its forms amongst school children a criminal offence",
        "additional_details": "Bullying needs to be tackled head on. Recently an 11 year old boy took his life as a result of being bullied. Repercussions need to be severe so that bullies realise their actions will do more damage to their own selves and not the victims. Why should school children old enough to know right and wrong be able to get away with causing so much damage in some cases irreversible. It needs to be made a criminal offence. Sign this petition so that changes can be made for the betterment of all children",
        "background": "Bullying is extremely prevalent in schools. There is very little being done to tackle this problem, with more and more youngsters being affected by it. Whether it is actually within the school environment, or via social media, too many children have taken their lives as a result of being bullied. ",
