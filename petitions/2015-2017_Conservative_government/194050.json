        "additional_details": "The 2015 Big Tick Project demonstrated that dogs who had travelled outside the UK prior to the study, returned carrying a tick. The study found that of the 56 pets examined who had travelled, 76% were carrying a tick. Analysis of the ticks in the study showed the presence of the potentially fatal disease Canine Babesiosis in a tick from a dog who returned from France.\r\nTwo dogs died after Canine Babesiosis was found in the UK last year for the first time in dogs who had not travelled abroad.",
        "background": "In 2012 the requirement for dogs entering the UK to be treated against ticks was lifted. Dogs picking up ticks abroad may be exposed to disease pathogens not present in the UK and allowing untreated pets into the UK risks importing non-native tick species which may potentially carry fatal disease.",
