        "additional_details": "Our friend is recently going through this she's had to leave private accommodation, so she went to the council for help, where she was placed in a temporary house but wasn't ok to have her three lovely rescue dogs. She decided to keep them there in the day but has now received a 21 days eviction letter to find her own accommodation (private) which she just can't afford. \r\nThe system is so unfair and many pets are loosing there family's because of the councils. \r\nPlease help us get this changed. ",
        "background": "Everyday we as a dog rescue get many calls from owners saying they are having to find new homes due to landlords and councils saying they can't keep there dogs in the properties. \r\nThis is putting a huge pressure on rescues like my own rescue. \r\nlets help people with pets to stay with there family's",
