        "additional_details": "When driving a car, the training is all compulsory and extensive. The theory test; many driving lessons, the practical test ensuring safety of other road users too.\r\n\r\nSixteen year olds are being allowed to legally ride a moped within just a day of first sitting on a moped for the first time. They have no Road Experience and no Road Theory test.\r\n\r\nIn a collision, the rider takes the full impact.  A moped also offers no onboard safety functions such as, a seat belt, airbags or even a steel frame.",
        "background": "At 16 the problem can be overcome by purchasing the all too easy to pass CPT moped licence\r\n\r\nOver 250 16 year old riders are killed every year. The likelihood of dying is higher than walking, cycling or travelling by car\r\n\r\nThese stats could fall if 16 year olds are legally allowed to drive a car",
