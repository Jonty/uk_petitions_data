        "action": "Lower the voting age for important referendums to 14",
        "additional_details": "I would like to propose the idea of a formal exam. This would be taken outside of school and would test the participant on political knowledge and their passion to have their voice heard. If this exam is passed, the participant will receive the right to vote in that particular occasion. This exam would be repeated for each referendum a the applicant desires to vote in. These tests will result in a more politically smart generation, and will help educate the future leaders of this country.",
        "background": "As young teenagers in the UK, many of us have a strong passion to convey our opinions about the country we live in. I'm sure most other young people will agree that our say on the policies brought to our country is extremely important, as older generations are leaving us to deal with their mistakes.",
