That is why all eligible students can apply for an upfront tuition fee loan to meet the full costs of their tuition fees, as well as loans for living costs. \r\n\r\nLoans are only repaid once students are earning over \u00a321,000 a year. Students earning below \u00a321,000 will not have to make repayments. Deductions are taken at 9% of any income over that threshold and any outstanding balance will be written off after 30 years.\r\n\r\nEligible full-time students from some of the most disadvantaged backgrounds will also receive 10.3% more living cost support in 2016/17 than under previous student support arrangements.\r\n\r\nIn order to charge tuition fees above the basic amount of \u00a36,000 and up to the \u00a39,000 fee cap, higher education institutions are required to agree an access agreement with the Director for Fair Access. Higher education institutions are expected to spend \u00a3745 million through these access agreements in 2016/17, this has risen from \u00a3395 in 2009/10.  This will be invested in measures to improve the access to university and successful outcomes of disadvantaged students.\r\n\r\nThe steps we have taken to ensure higher education remains sustainably financed has enabled us to lift student number controls, so that more people have the opportunity to secure a university place. The proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds entering higher education is up from 13.6% in 2009 to 18.5% in 2015. \r\n\r\nLowering tuition fees would carry a number of possible consequences, including a cut to funding for universities and additional demands on public spending, which would be met through higher taxation, including on those who have not themselves benefited from university. This could also mean the re-imposition of student number controls, leading to fewer university places being available for students.]\r\n\r\nThe Government\u2019s approach has struck the right balance between delivering a sustainable system and ensuring higher education remains open and accessible. This has been recognised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which said we are \u201cone of the few countries to have figured out a sustainable approach to student finance\u201d. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Innovation and Skills",
