        "action": "Relax gun laws by lifting the ban on handguns",
        "additional_details": "Preventing handguns make no sense considering rifles and shotguns are still available to people in the UK with a license. By introducing proper background checks, the authorities could issue handgun licenses to people based on the same reasons most shotgun and firearm licenses are issued: hunting / sporting purposes. \r\n\r\nIn the US, you do see dramatically more gun crime where yes, handguns are legal; looking at statistics, the majority of these shootings are in gun free zones - having guns reduces crimes. ",
        "background": "Since 1997, handguns in the UK have been banned due to a shooting in Dunblane. With proper background checks (criminal and mental health) there should be no reason people should be banned from purchasing such firearms for hunting and sporting purposes.",
