        "additional_details": "Trafford General is the Birth place of the NHS, I went back to the 'hospital' a few days ago and it's just such a shame, entire wards are closed off and in darkness.  The infestruction, the wards, operating theatres, the buildings etc it's all there going to waste, it could be fully staffed and up and running again in no time at all....  The NHS could certainly do with another hospital in this time of crisis and we have this place just going to waste.  ",
        "background": "Trafford General Hospital served south Manchester for decades, a couple of years ago the A&E was closed and since then residents in this region need to go elseware. After a personal experience the A&E at the MRI is overworked and understaffed. Re-open Trafford General as a fully staffed A&E/Hospital",
