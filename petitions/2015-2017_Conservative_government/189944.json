        "additional_details": "One only need to scour the newspapaers and various media sites,  Facebook being one of those to see people in despair because they have been made to pay without being given the opportunity to fairly represent their case.  Some have been jailed, not because they would not pay but because they could not - It is time to investigate the practices employed by councils in recovery of  Council Tax debts. How can a process be fair when the Councils have declared themselves Judge, Jury and executioner",
        "background": "There seems to an exponential increase of late in cases of Council Tax arrears being heard in bulk, by council staff within a 'legal setting' - denying a debtor the right to a fair trial under Protocol 1 Article 6 of the HRA 1998.  This needs to be changed and better measures put into place. ",
