        "additional_details": "It will help assess drivers reaction times, road knowledge and make sure they are suitable drivers.\r\nA number of occasions I have been behind a particularly slow (at least 10-20mph below required limit) elderly driver and it becomes a hazard for not only the driver but also other drivers who are obeying the speed limit- They are not keeping up with the speed of the drivers around them and their reactions are slower\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "As a 23 year old driver with a full time job, i have increasingly noticed the number of unsafe elderly drivers on the road. I want a 'refresher' theory and practical test introduced to drivers over the age of 60 to help prevent accidents and to help the older generation stay up to date and aware. ",
