        "action": "Allow Tier 4 visa applicants use partner/spouse's bank account as proof of funds",
        "additional_details": "The current policy states that one can ONLY use one's personal/joint/parents' account bank statements or building society statements as proof of money (aka maintenance/funds) available to support one's studies, if one did not receive any official sponsorship or apply for any loan. However, given the fact that some of the applicants are married/in a civil partnership, allowing them to present their partner/spouse's bank statement is arguably rational.",
        "background": "Current Tier 4 (General) visa policy does not allow any flexibility regarding proof of money available to support one's studies. Applicants cannot submit their partner/spouse's personal bank statement as evidence. What if they do not have a joint account? What if their parents cannot afford it?",
