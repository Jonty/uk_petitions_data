        "additional_details": "We demand that:\r\n\r\nAll members of the House of Lords are appointed by the public's vote only and each members term is subjected to a vote every 5 years.\r\n\r\nIf voted out, their position is to be replaced by a member elected by public vote.\r\n\r\nMembership is to open to all current and former MP's.\r\n \r\nIf a MP is currently serving when elected to the House of Lords, their local position is to be replaced by a member of their own party. This member is to be elected by the people in their constituency only.\r\n",
        "background": "Currently the key decision makers in the UK in the House of Lords are un-elected. They are appointed by being vetted by the Appointments Commission, then approved by the prime minister and formalised by the Queen. We feel that all aspects of our Government, especially key members should be elected.",
