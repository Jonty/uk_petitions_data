        "action": "Stop the free movement of people, even if it means leaving the EU single market.",
        "additional_details": "Extensive polling consistently shows that immigration is the number one issue for the British electorate, particularly surrounding the EU referendum. Vote Leave promised three fundamental changes which would occur as a result of leaving the EU: taking back control of our borders; taking back control of our finances; taking back control of our lawmaking. The will of the UK electorate must be respected, and freedom of movement must not be accepted as part of our new deal with the EU.",
        "background": "The people of the United Kingdom have voted to leave the European Union. Chancellor Merkel today has warned that if the UK wants to be within the single market, it must accept the free movement of people from the EU. If we cannot control our borders within the single market, we must leave it.",
