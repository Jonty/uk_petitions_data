        "action": "Make carbon monoxide alarms compulsory in social housing accommodation",
        "additional_details": "Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, invisible, and tasteless poisonous gas and continuous inhalation can be fatal. Carbon monoxide can be produced by incomplete burning of carbon-based fuels, including gas, oil, wood and coal. This could be caused by faulty or poorly maintained appliances. Having a carbon monoxide alarm installed serves as an early warning sign if any CO is leaking into your home. Just like a smoke alarm it can save lives early. Make this a necessity for all UK homes.\r\n ",
        "background": "Carbon monoxide poisoning sends 4,000 people to A&E each year and leads to 50 deaths every year in the UK. From 1st October 2015 regulations require both smoke and carbon monoxide alarms to be installed in rented residential accommodation. There is an exemption for providers of social housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
