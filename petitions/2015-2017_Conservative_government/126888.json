        "additional_details": "My own personal case has seen me paying child maintenance for 4 years and I am yet to see any benefit it has had for my children. If by law the receiving parent had to provide receipts to show that the money received had been spent on the children and not on themselves then the majority of children in child maintenance cases would be better off as they would get 100% of the money spent on them.",
        "background": "Fathers and Mothers paying child maintenance should have proof that the money is being spent on their child/children and not funding the receiving parents social life or any other activities that do not directly benefit the children involved.",
