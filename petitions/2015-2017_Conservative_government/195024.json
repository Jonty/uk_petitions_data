        "additional_details": "Under Bereavement Support Payment, widowed parents will receive a larger first payment, but then only be able to receive the benefit for 18 months after a partner's death.  This is a significant change from Widowed Parents\u2019 Allowance, which allowed parents to claim until a child turned 20 or left full-time education. ",
        "background": "Changes to bereavement benefits mean widowed parents with children can now only receive payments for up to 18 months, compared to WPA that was paid until a child left full-time education. The payment period should be extended to up to 10 years to provide financial security to bereaved families.",
