            "details": "Over the years there have been various suggestions from the public for new bank holidays, such as a new national day to promote a British identity to reflect the different histories and traditions which vary from country to country. The Government regularly receives requests for additional bank and public holidays to celebrate a variety of occasions. However, there are no current plans to create another permanent public holiday. The current pattern is well established and accepted.  Whilst an additional bank holiday may benefit some communities and sectors, the cost to the economy of an additional bank holiday remains considerable.\r\n\r\nThe most recent assessment following an Impact Assessment (IA) for the additional holiday for the Diamond Jubilee is that a bank holiday (across the UK as a whole) costs employers around \u00a31.2bn. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Innovation and Skills",
