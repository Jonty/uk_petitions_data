        "additional_details": "It is unacceptable that MPs, elected usually in large part due to their political allegiance, are permitted to drop or change that allegiance, retaining their Parliamentary seat, without the explicit consent of their electorate.\r\n\r\nSometimes MPs do the decent and moral thing, such as Zak Goldsmith upon leaving the Conservative Party, to stand as an Independent.\r\n\r\nOthers do it when they think the odds are in their favor, but find their principles disappear when the risks are real.",
        "background": "Petition calls on Parliament to legislate, to mandate all MPs joining, leaving or changing political party, relinquish their seat with immediate effect, until a by-election decides their political future.\r\n\r\nLegislation should retrospectively affect, any seat so affected since previous election.",
