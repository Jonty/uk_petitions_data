        "additional_details": "Far too many equine communities try to hide the fact that an outbreak has occurred in doing so it risks the lives of any equine that is unlucky enough to be exposed. \r\nOur equines need protecting from the irresponsible people who are unable to be honest and knowingly risk the lives of equines with an illness that is able to be confined if the correct procedure is followed our government need to help ensure that is possible.",
        "background": "\r\nStrangles is a potential killer and spreads quickly if a bill was passed to make this notifiable and precautions taken it could be contained.\r\nGovernment should make it notifiable and enforce fines and fixed penalties to those who refuse to abide by restrictions set in place by DEFRA.
