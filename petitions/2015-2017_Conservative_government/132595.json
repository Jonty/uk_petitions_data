        "action": "Bring back compulsory Sexual Education lessons in Secondary Schools in the UK",
        "additional_details": "As a 15 year old, I can tell you levels of homophobia in Secondary Schools are high, and actual Sexual Education lessons are no longer compulsory. The school has to do something, but actual lessons are no longer compulsory. I believe that homophobia in secondary schools is a direct result of this. I am LGBTQ+, and I always see this prejudice and discrimination in school and on social media and it is sickening. Now more than ever, the UK needs to be united, and attempt to eradicate homophobia.",
        "background": "In the early hours of the 12th June 2016, a horrific, homophobic-fuelled attack happened in a gay club in Orlando. In response to this tragedy, I am proposing that we bring back compulsory Sexual Education Lessons, with a focus on LGBTQIA+ and Feminism in order to help eradicate homophobia.",
