        "action": "Reverse the shameful decision to close the Dubs scheme for lone refugee children",
        "additional_details": "Lone refugee children across Europe are vulnerable to disease, trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse.  In recognition of their plight the UK government passed the Dubs Amendment in May 2016 in order to offer refuge to up to 3000 unaccompanied vulnerable child refugees.  The government has now ended the scheme after bringing only 350 such children to the UK.  This is a deliberate decision by the government to renege on the spirit of the Dubs amendment and turn its back on children in need.",
        "background": "We call on the government to reconsider its shameful reneging on its commitment to help lone refugee children and to show compassion and welcome for those fleeing conflict and persecution. Re-open the Dubs scheme and fulfill our duty to save these lone children from trafficking and exploitation.",
