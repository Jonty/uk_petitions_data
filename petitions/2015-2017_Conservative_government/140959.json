        "action": "Respect the result of the EU referendum and refuse anti-democratic demands.",
        "additional_details": "The demand to change the rules of the EU referendum after it has been held is not only undemocratic but it is childish. In addition, the petition as it stands does not propose any contingency for what should happen should any 2nd referendum fail to meet its 60% target, rendering the proposal meaningless. It is incredibly important that the losing side in a referendum not be allowed to dictate terms such as these when, and only when, they lose. This is anti-democratic and cannot be countenanced.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call upon HM Government to respect the result of the EU referendum and not give in to the anti-democratic demands of a small fraction of the supporters of the losing side (at the time of writing only around 13% of those who voted to remain are making this demand).",
