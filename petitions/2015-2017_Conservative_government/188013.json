        "action": "Build a bypass around Sedbury to reduce traffic and help development.",
        "additional_details": "With the addition of new housing estates in both Monmouthshire and Forest of Dean the current proposals fall unacceptably short in facilitating growth.\r\n\r\nA new route is required, around Sedbury on the English side and Chepstow on the Welsh side, to avoid stifling sustainable economic development.\r\n\r\nA sister petition has been lodged with the Welsh National Assembly regarding the Welsh side of the bypass. We urge parliament not to let this issue fall prey to cross border buck passing.",
        "background": "The lowering of the Severn Bridge Toll represents a huge oppurtunity for growth in Monmouthshire, Forest of Dean and South East Wales. However the road infrastructure is inadequate. The A48 is already suffering from congestion and poor air quality.",
