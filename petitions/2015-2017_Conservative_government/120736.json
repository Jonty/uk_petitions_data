        "additional_details": "As a student with a part time, minimum wage job, I would be expected to pay between \u00a3200 and \u00a3300 a month to be insured on a car, while one person living 7 miles away would be expected to pay between \u00a360 and \u00a380 a month. These are extremes that the wealthy or plain lucky benefit from simply due to their birth and/or parents' circumstances. Insurance for young drivers should be made realistic, affordable and fair for all and provide all young people with the opportunity to drive.",
        "background": "I am a 19 year old, working class female trying to purchase a car while studying at University. While looking, it has come to my attention how extreme insurance costs for young drivers are and how these extremes repress those lower class families who simply cannot afford the outrageous costs.",
