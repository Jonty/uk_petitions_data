        "additional_details": "Special DID therapy was recommended by specialist Dr Lloyd at the Complex Trauma and Dissociation Service at Vale House and the commissioning group has decided to ignore this despite it being backed up by the guidelines set out by the International Society for the Study of trauma and Dissociation.\r\nDID alone affects 1-3% of the population and is usually caused by severe trauma. They may also have inherited a biological predisposition for dissociation.",
        "background": "For over 2 years the Cheshire West Commissioning Group has left patients of Dissociative Disorders on hold. Now they won't provide funding for a service or individual treatment despite a big demand for it. This decision is detrimental to patients health and could result in serious harm to sufferers.",
