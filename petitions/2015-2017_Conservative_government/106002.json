        "additional_details": "My Group have been informed of 3 instances in the last week of cats/dogs being killed by dogs not on leads. The Law needs to protect these innocent animals.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/control-dog-public/overview\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s against the law to let a dog be dangerously out of control anywhere, such as:\r\nin a public place\r\nin a private place, eg a neighbour\u2019s house or garden\r\nin the owner\u2019s home\r\nThe law applies to all dogs.\r\n\r\nWhy are people getting away with their dogs killing innocent family pets?",
        "background": "Far too many cats and dogs are being killed by dogs that are not on leads in public places, as per the Law. Too many Dog Wardens and Police seem unable to bring forth any convictions to owners, this HAS to change. Owners need to be held accountable for these deaths their dog is their responsibility ",
