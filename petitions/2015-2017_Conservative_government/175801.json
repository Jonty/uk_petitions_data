        "additional_details": "Filibustering is not uncommon during back bench bill presentation due to lower attendances making a cloture motion difficult to attain.\r\nAllowing important social issues to be swept under the carpet through filibustering undermines the core principles of pur representative democracy and needs to be stopped.\r\nCloture motions should be able to be granted by a percentage of members in attendance, rather than by a fixed number of 100 members. Or should be implemented by the speaker when necessary.",
        "background": "On December 16th, anti feminist MP philip Davies attemped to filibuster the Domestic Violence bill. On this occasion the bill  was passed to the next stage, but Mr Davies has successfully filibustered bills on multiple other important social issues, often to further selfish personal interests.",
