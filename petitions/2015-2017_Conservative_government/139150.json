        "additional_details": "We have a media controlled, Edward Bernays factory of consent that is abused by political parties that are factually incorrect and designed to play upon the irrational emotions of the public. This leads to an incompetent voting populace. The result of the \"brexit\" must be found to be invalid and a new campaign and new referendum must take place with a proper baseline of factual and educational data with a longer more appropriate timeline for absorption and understanding.",
        "background": "The UK EU referendum is invalid. The public were not educated sufficiently to make a sound judgement. Party politics, propaganda and gross negligence on behalf of both the leave and remain campaigns has produced a mislead and misinformed public not fit to vote in a correct and faithful manner.",
