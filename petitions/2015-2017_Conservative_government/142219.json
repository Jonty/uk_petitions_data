        "additional_details": "My evidence is their continual moaning, verbal abuse and grossly over exaggerated belief that they are intellectually superior to the majority of the British public that voted to LEAVE the undemocratic EU. As the whole point of the referendum was to show the world how a truly democratic county behaves i feel the remain pertition makes a mockery of our great country and as such must be repelled.",
        "background": "Polling was held on the 23rd June 2016. The result returned 24th June 2016. The result was a majority decision to LEAVE the European Union. Remain voters fail to understand the meaning of the word DEMOCRACY and upon losing the vote have started a petition to overturn the majority will of the people",
