        "action": "Prevent further extension of government surveillance laws",
        "additional_details": "The Snooper's Charter was an incredible overreach of government power, allowing unprecedented surveillance (funnily enough, MPs are exempt) and should be repealed. However, the government is trying to increase its surveillance program to a degree which is not compatible to living in a democracy with basic freedoms. Sign this petition to stop the government quashing our freedoms. ",
        "background": "Recently, Westminster was subject to a terror attack. The police have concluded that the attacker acted alone, yet Amber Rudd is insisting the government be able to read encrypted messages. This is unacceptable, wrong and an invasion of privacy. It must not be allowed to happen. ",
