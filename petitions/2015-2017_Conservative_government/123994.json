        "action": "End the flawed badger cull: no roll out to new counties.",
        "additional_details": "Experts in disease control and animal welfare agree that pilot badger culls have proven both ineffective and inhumane. Shooting badgers is also expensive, costing tax-payers some \u00a35,000 per animal. Bovine TB is a serious problem but killing badgers is not the solution, and could actually make the situation worse. It is a costly distraction from an effective solution incorporating vaccination, increased cattle movement control measures and improved testing.",
        "background": "Since 2013, thousands of badgers have been killed in a government cull attempting to control bovine TB. Against scientific advice & before a 4 year trial has completed, the government is now considering expanding the cull to new counties - tens of thousands of healthy badgers could be killed.",
