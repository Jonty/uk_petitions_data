        "action": "EU referendum based on false prospectus means new referendum required",
        "additional_details": "We were told that we pay to the EU \u00a3360 million pounds per week. This is untrue. The net figure, after rebates and subsidies, is nearer \u00a3136 million. This is less than 40% of the figure claimed .\r\nFurthermore the Leave battlebus claimed that this money would be spent on the NHS.  This claim has now been retracted by key figures in the Leave campaign.\r\nAs to immigration, the Leave campaign neglected to mention that there are more immigrants to the UK from outside the EU than from within it (277,000 compared with 270,000 according to the Office for National Statistics). ",
        "background": "Now that it is acknowledged that the campaigning groups in the EU referendum made many claims to the British electorate that were either misleading or untrue it follows that the referendum was held on a false prospectus. There is no alternative but to hold a new referendum",
