On the contrary it is fault of Boris Johnson who joined the campaign, which was based on lies and let millions of conservative votes down who respected Boris Johnson.\r\nI have met Boris Johnson as I have a lot of respect for him but now I am disappointed as he turned an opportunist politician eager to becom PM.",
