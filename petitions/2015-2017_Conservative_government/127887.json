Im michael and i get paid \u00a35.35 an hour at one of my jobs. that's nearly \u00a32 less than someone over 25, meaning people my age have to work more for the same amount of money. this is ageism as it is assumed i don't need as much money to get by. But this is wrong. I realise it would be expensive for employers which is why the gap could be closed gradually not all at once. Im not the only one, this is happening all over the UK. Please support.",
