        "additional_details": "The Borough of Lambeth voted overwhelmingly in favour of remaining in the EU, with 79%, the highest in the England. The MP for Vauxhall Kate Hoey, campaigned for the UK to leave, which demonstrates that she no longer represents the interests of the majority of her constituents. This poses the question of whether she should remain in her seat or give her constituents the power to vote for a new MP.",
        "background": "In the EU referendum, many constituents felt let down by their local MP, after showing support for the opposing view. In some instances it was abundantly clear the MP was completely at odds with their constituency, e.g. Kate Hoey. In such cases, we should be able to request a vote to unseat the MP.",
