        "action": "Amend the  Dog Act to include taking DNA of every dog to be kept with Microchip.",
        "additional_details": "If a dog is  already microchipped the addresses are known and the owners could be contacted and asked to get the DNA profile done.\r\nThe DNA would also help with tracing of owners of dogs who leave poo uncollected, which will help District Councils prosecute culprits.",
        "background": "Due to the high number of dog attacks the aim is to force all dog owners to have their dog DNA taken and  register it with the dog's microchip. This  would allow all dogs to be screened for banned breed DNA and if attacks take place wounds could be swabbed and aggressors traced.",
