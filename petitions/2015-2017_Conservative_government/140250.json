        "additional_details": "Despite all of the media propoganda the people did vote out using a democratic system and everyone was given the opportunity to vote. I therefore don't think that it is fair that a call for a second referendum should be allowed because firstly this isn't in keeping with a democracy and secondly there would be ample opportunity to influence and scare the people who originally voted out to now vote in, along with the people who didn't vote at all. ",
        "background": "On Thursday 23rd of June 2016 every UK citizen was given an opportunity to vote whether they wanted to stay in the EU or to leave. So why should it be necessary to have a second referendum as a democratic decision was made in the first one.  A second referendum would not be democratic!",
