Very recently, pro-LGBT lyrics were removed from LGBT rights activist Lady Gaga's acceptance song Born This Way on prime time BBC. The Government must ensure LGBT issues are not hidden behind the watershed for viewer figures and LGBT role models kept from young children who need inspiration and signs of acceptance the most ",
