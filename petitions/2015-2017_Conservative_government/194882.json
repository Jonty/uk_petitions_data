        "additional_details": "This is a so called toxin tax. No real proof of this at all .Just like acid rain and the hole in the ozone layer so called experts were wrong.\r\nThe mayor of London says 9000 people died of lung related illnesses. How many were smokers or worked in jobs that could cause lung disease. There are 8.6 million people in London.\r\nHe wants to start an increased charge of \u00a312.50 straight away. This is another tax / attack on the lower paid.\r\nIf the wind blows in these cities then toxins will not build up !\r\n",
        "background": "Diesel drivers are going to be charged far more tax and more money to enter some towns and cities. Diesels are driven mainly by people that bought them for their good mileage ability and value for money. People on lower wages and people in community services like nurses and carers. \r\n",
