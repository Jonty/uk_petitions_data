        "additional_details": "When a child turns 18 they are expected to start making their own decisions and be treated like adults. They are obliged to take responsibility for their own lives, so why is the legal age of marriage in England and Wales 16 when they are still considered children? This is common in Asian communities where young 16 years old's are expected to marry and take on responsibility they are not ready for.  Does a 16 year old understand what marriage is at that age? Are they ready for this commitment? ",
        "background": "Legal minimum age to enter into a marriage in England and Wales is 16 years, although this requires parental consent if a participant is under 18 years.\r\nChanging the law to 18 years will have a huge positive impact on arranged or forced marriages here in England and Wales as some are forced at 16.",
