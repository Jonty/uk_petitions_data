        "additional_details": "As it stands, carers allowance is \u00a362.10, and requires claimants to do a minimum of 35 hours a week. Being a home carer is usually 24/7, and is the hardest job anyone will ever have to do. Carers get less than jobseekers, and that needs to change. No where else in Britain can someone pay their employees just 40 p an hour. Carers need to be legally recognized and properly paid, at least for the 35 hour minimum the government says we must care for before claiming carers. Carers deserve better.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, petition the Government and chancellor of the exchequer for recognition that being a home carer is a fulltime job, and that we need a decent livable wage for home carers eligible for carers allowance. Minimum wage for the minimum 35 hours carers must work to claim benefit. ",
