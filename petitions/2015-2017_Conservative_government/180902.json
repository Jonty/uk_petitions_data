        "additional_details": "The biggest petition that this system has seen was the one calling for the EU referendum to to be rerun if it was too close to be decisive. I got 4 million signatures - twice the margin of victory in the referendum. It got, as any other petition does, a patronising \"reply\" from the government, saying that they would ignore the petition, and a token mention in Parliament. \r\nSimilarly, a petition abhoring the gifting of President Trump a State Visit has drawn defiance from the Prime Minister.",
        "background": "The government petitions site gives the impression that it give people the opportunity to petition for the government or Parliament to address issues that they feel need to be dealt with.\r\nIt is however a sop, intended to deflect people from taking effective action, such as lobbying their MP.",
