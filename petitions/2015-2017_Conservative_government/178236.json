        "additional_details": "If 2 opportunities were given in Yr 9 and Yr 11 to undertake 2 weeks of work experience young people would be able to make better informed GCSE and A Level choices.  It would also allow them the opportunity to build their character by recognising what key skills they may need to develop further.  It also allows them potential segues into jobs when they reach school leaving age.  This opportunity for personal development should be just as essential as the rest of the curriculum.",
        "background": "We are being made to make choices that may shape our entire career without having been given the opportunity to experience a working environment.  If work experience was compulsory we could experience different types of jobs and make informed choices about what qualifications we wanted to pursue.",
