Last winter there were cases of homeless people dying because of the cold, older people suffer more in winter too. It will take a massive investment but the outcomes will benefit everyone.",

To help the government and country I think we should encourage the start of a new difference for both of these vulnerable groups let's help homeless people get a job and home, let's give older people a companion and a carer.",
