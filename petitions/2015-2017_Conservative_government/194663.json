        "action": "Make it illegal for stray pounds to sell dogs without neutering and vaccinations",
        "additional_details": "There are laws in place to protect humans, but very few that protect animals. Dogs being sold at low cost from pounds is a major issue. Many of these dogs will go on to live lives of abuse and neglect, being bred from or even used for baiting and dog fighting. It should be made illegal for pounds to sell dogs who may be sick, without vaccinations, or who may be used for breeding, without being spayed or neutered. The law needs to be changed to prevent the pound making quick money off these dogs.",
        "background": "At present a dog who enters the stray pound, becomes the legal property of that pound after 7 days. Some pounds sell the dogs at low cost after the 7 days. The interested parties are not vetted. The dogs are not neutered or vaccinated, which makes them easy targets for back yard breeders and baiters",
