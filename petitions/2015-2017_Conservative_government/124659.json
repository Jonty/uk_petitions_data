        "additional_details": "In February, the French government began fining supermarkets for wasting food. On Monday, the lower house of the Italian parliament is set to pass a law ensuring that Italian supermarkets don't waste food. The Italian government will give businesses incentives to donate food and help tackle the country's 12 billion euro waste problem. The UK must do the same if it is to be seen as a progressive, environmentally-friendly country.",
        "background": "Both France and Italy have now passed laws ensuring that all supermarkets give any unsold food to the hungry and the needy, rather than letting it go to waste. The UK must be next. We cannot allow such vast quantities of food to be wasted when there are people in this country going hungry.  ",
