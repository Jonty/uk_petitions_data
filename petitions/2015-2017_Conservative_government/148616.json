Her ability to retain the seat is surely down to her running in a middle class conservative area as opposed to her individual leadership.",

Her constituents have voted against her pro-Brexit stance; yet she claims that she will vote with the national voice instead.",

The expression \"vote of no confidence\" is used when talking about a vote in the House of Commons which tests whether or not the Government of the day has the confidence of a majority of MPs in the House of Commons. That's why we allow petitions asking for a vote of no confidence in the Government or in individual Ministers. The concept of the House having \u201cconfidence\u201d in someone does not apply to backbench or Opposition Members. "
