        "action": "Require the UK to hold a referendum on EU after leave negotiations are known.",
        "additional_details": "Throughout the both the leave and remain campaigns both sides made predictions regarding what the situation would be in the event of the  UK leaving. Both sides argued as to whether the UK would be either better or worse off, but it would appear that that can only be known at some point during exit negotiations, so it seems reasonable to judge the situation when further information is known.",
        "background": "Since the referendum took place there is much talk about the fact that the UK would still have to abide by much of the EU legislation in order to get the trade deals that the U.K currently enjoys, so the electorate should have the final say once results of leave negotiations are known.",
