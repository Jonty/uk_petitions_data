        "action": "Make a mandatory 6 months ban if caught using mobile phone while driving",
        "additional_details": "Public should also be allowed to forward dash cam footage to police to help with a conviction. Over 500,000 people a day are still using phones while driving. 1 in 5 accident are results of phone usage. How would you feel if one of those 5 killed a member of your family because they had a phone in their hand? The consequences for this are too lenient to stop people doing it. Skip the points and fines, straight 6 months ban and points should be mandatory.",
        "background": "We've all seen the results of driving while using a phone and many people are still doing it. If the law was a 6 month ban on the first instance, this would deter people from doing it again. You will loose income without a licence. Get caught again and it's a 12 months ban.",
