        "action": "Prevent Highways agency from removing centre white lines from UK roads",
        "additional_details": "Speaking to The Times, AA\u2019s head of road policy, Paul Watters, said: \u2018Without exaggeration it is true to say that a simple pot of paint can save lives.\r\n\u2018In particular, highly visible markings at the edge and centre of the road that can be seen on a wet night are enormously cost-effective in saving lives.\u2019",
        "background": "The Highways Agency argue that removing the centre white line creates driver uncertainty and a resultant reduction in speed which will reduce Road Traffic Collisions. There is a groundswell of opinion that a lot of drivers use the white line as a measure of safe road positioning.",
