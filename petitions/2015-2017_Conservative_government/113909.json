        "additional_details": "many companies employing on zero hour contracts are major companies that have no excuse for not offering a proper contract to their workers. A well known example is McDonalds but the same goes for most of the hospitality and food industry work. We're talking about a whole section of hard working british society being penalized whilst companies become richer.. It's not true these contracts are flexible for the worker, they're only flexible for the employer and force workers to claim benefits.",
        "background": "Workers on zero hour contracts cant budget or save. They are not sure if they will be able to pay their bills or put food on the table. Usually they go from 20 or 30 hrs a week during most of the year to a sudden cut of the hours in less busy months.Companies earn billions but wont pay workers,why?",
