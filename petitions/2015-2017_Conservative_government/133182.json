        "additional_details": "Only last year adult social care regulators were reported to be receiving up to 150 reports of abuse per day - which Andrea Sutcliffe (Head of Adult Social Care) attributed to service failures, caused by underfunding. Moreover, children Trae-Bleu Layne, Rio Ross, Keanu Williams and Khyra Ishaq (four examples of many) - all died due to a lack of an organised response towards their welfare by social services - which may have been provided had funding been available to plan such a response. \r\n\r\n\r\n ",
        "background": "A failure to ring-fence government and local council spending on social care and services has allowed spending cuts to leave such services underfunded, and unable to meet the needs of the entire population - which can be seen in numerous failures of care for children, the elderly, and the disabled.
