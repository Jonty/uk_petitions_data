        "action": "Impose tighter regulations and fairer contracts on airlines.",
        "additional_details": "Me and my partner were affected by the sequential use of tickets policy recently when flying with KLM. Airlines commonly charge customers to reissue a return ticket as a single if the initial flight is not taken, even though all flight are already paid. This is a cartel designed to limit customer choice. There are other unfair terms in airline contracts. Trading Standards should be made to set up a commission to look into air transport contracts and force airlines to revise them to be fair. ",
        "background": "Even though progress has been made, airline contracts and often their treatment and attitude towards customers still leave a lot to be desired. Airlines impose contracts on customers which still have unfair clauses and use the disproportionately large position of influence of the airlines. ",
