        "action": "Call for a vote of no confidence in David Cameron",
        "additional_details": "From the moment the referendum date was set David Cameron has dictated what access people have and do not have. He is not fighting for the British people and does not have our best interest in mind. He is not allowing a fair campaign and is allowing scaremongering to run riot. With this in mind I can not see how his position as the highest representative of the British people can continue. As such there should be an immediate call for a vote of no confidence in him.",
        "background": "I am calling for a vote of no confidence in David Cameron. This is based on his pathetic EU renegotiations that do little to solve many of the problems EU membership brings. He is also hampering a fair vote by disallowing euro sceptic civil servants access to important information.",
