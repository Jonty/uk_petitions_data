        "additional_details": "Long hours are not good for us; they cause stress; they are bad for our health; they wreck relationships; they make caring for children or dependants more difficult; and tired, burnt-out staff are bad for business. Evidence suggests that it is increasingly difficult for people to get their jobs done in their contractual hours and that there is a mismatch between the hours that people would like to work and the jobs available. https://www.tuc.org.uk/workplace-issues/working_time.cfm ",
        "background": "Some employers make a contract of employment where it says \"you may have to finish late in this industry\" it is not explained to how late you might have to finish. There is no limit and most employees (especialy in the transport industry) have to finish work several hours late.",
