        "action": "Make car parking charges illegal in or around public parks",
        "additional_details": "This is unfair now on people with little mobility, elderly and families that just wanted to spend a day out without having to pay. Places like Mote Park in Maidstone for example which has now started to charge parking fees. They justify this on the local government website by stating that this is to \"keep it at the high standard residents and visitors have come to expect, as well as allowing for vital improvements\". I am intrigued as to when they started to \"keep it\" at any standards.",
        "background": "For as long as I remember, most public parks were for families, friends, dog walkers and couples etc to enjoy the sceneries, taking walks, picnics or generally just feeding the ducks and birds. But more and more public places are now charging people to park.",
