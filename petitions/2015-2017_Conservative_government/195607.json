I have a real passion for politics along with thousands young people at the moment. \r\n\r\nAt The end of the day long term key political decisions are being decided by the elderly who statistically speaking will be dealing with the consequences for a much shorter period of time. \r\n\r\nWe need to stop the marginalisation of young people.",
        "background": "We have a political system that prides its self on democracy.Throughout the Brexit debate people both sides were preaching about giving people a voice and bringing back control. Is it not ironic that the people whose futures are being debated don't have a voice? We are the future, let us have a say.",
