The use of stop and search in London is an operational decision for the  Metropolitan Police Service, which is the responsibility of the London Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC). MOPAC is overseen by the London Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe London Assembly has its own petitions process. You can find out more about how to petition the London Assembly here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.london.gov.uk/about-us/london-assembly/petitions\r\n\r\nIn any case, it appears that the Metropolitan Police are still using stop and search.
