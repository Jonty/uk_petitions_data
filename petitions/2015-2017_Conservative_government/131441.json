        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition to prevent the BBC's using their public & EU funded position to give much greater prominence to the Remain side, than those of who support the leaving the EU.\r\nAlso, when the BBC reluctantly broadcasts the view of the Leave Campaign, they are treated as dangerous xenophobes. \r\nIn the interest of democracy, the voting public deserve the BBC to broadcast an imparticial and even view across all medias.  \r\n\r\n\u201cThis seems to be an institutional bias, and in the interest of democracy, it must stop, urgently.\" ",
        "background": "Both sides agree, we will be making the biggest political decision of our lives on 23rd June. The BBC have a duty to the licence payer and for the sake of democracy to broadcast an imparticial view of the debate.",
