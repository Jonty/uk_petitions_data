        "additional_details": "At present, the two most formidable opponents of Britain in any post Brexit deal will be Merkel and Hollande.  That is the worst case scenario.\r\n\r\nIf Merkel is displaced, it will likely be by the election of candidates from the AfD.  If Hollande is displaced, it will likely be by the Front Nationale.  In both cases, they are highly Eurosceptical Parties and therefore unlikely to make it difficult for a British withdrawal. They are far more likely to give a good deal for us than at present.",
        "background": "Delaying Article 50 because of German and French General Elections in 2017 is a political ruse on the part of Theresa May as the negotiations will not be affected by either result.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why negotiations cannot start because a change will be to our advantage and make them easier.",
