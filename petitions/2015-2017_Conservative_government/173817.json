        "additional_details": "Telford has been described as the \"child sex capital of Britain\". There could be as many as 2,300 victims in Telford & Wrekin - 40% more than Rotherham's 1,400 - based on being 2 and a half times more likely to be a victim in Telford & Wrekin which has 60% of the population of Rotherham.",
        "background": "Telford & Wrekin has more reports of Child Sexual Exploitation per capita than anywhere else in the UK. There are 15 reports per 10,000 people in Telford & Wrekin compared to 6.4 in Rotherham. An independent inquiry would establish (as it did in Rotherham) the facts behind this disturbing statistic.",
