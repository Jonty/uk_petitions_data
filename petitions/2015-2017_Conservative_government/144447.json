        "additional_details": "Influential, non-fact based rhetoric has been employed to successfully promote electoral campaigns. The result is that the public are misinformed when casting their ballots. Following the elections / referenda, the public can feel that they were deceived.\r\n\r\nThis is most relevant where extremist views are used to influence emotions. In 21st century Britain, there are no safeguards in place to prevent the democratic system from being hijacked using methods employed in early 20th Century Germany. ",
        "background": "There is not sufficient regulation in place to protect the public from misinformation during electoral and referendum political campaigns. The lack of safeguards enables voting results to be strongly influenced using false and highly motivational rhetoric. Facts are obscured and voters are mislead.",
