        "additional_details": "Also many companies although not all do not make it easy for you to be able to check if a particular site is owned by one you are already excluded from. and more than often if this happens the company is just taking your money and hiding behind daft T&CS. and not really helping the problem gambler. Also make it standard practice to have self exclusion buttons on uk gaming sites again to protect the player and so they can be instantly excluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "After going through a massive gambling problem myself I believe the UK is still failing to protect problem gamblers. I believe if you are self excluded from one company this should exclude you from all companies as there's way too many and you can just open another account.",
