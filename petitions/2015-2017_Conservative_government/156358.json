        "action": "Article 50 declaration must first be authorised by a vote of the UK Parliament.",
        "additional_details": "Parliament has various options. It can consider the referendum to have been democratically binding and empower the Prime Minister. Or that the referendum was conducted on a \"false prospectus\". It might consider that the refusal by EU members to negotiate any terms was not known at the time of the vote and it is not now in the national interest to proceed. It may decide that the United Kingdom is at serious risk of disintegration. These are issues for Parliament, not the government of the day.",
        "background": "The Article 50 declaration must be \"in accordance with (a Member's) own constitutional arrangements\". The EU Referendum Act 2015 established that the referendum was advisory. The final decision on Brexit is therefore for Parliament not for the Prime Minister exercising the royal prerogative.",
