        "additional_details": "Due to fear or ill-advise on immigration matters, some Commonwealth citizens overstayed their welcome in UK but have lived here for 10 years or more.  These people have paid their dues working and paying taxes and contributing to national insurance but cannot live UK to see their fatherland and loved ones.  IS THIS NOT SLA VERY AGAIN?  \r\n\r\nUK Home Office - the set time is now. Let my people go. Give Commonwealth citizens their freedom even as you consider the Syrian asylum seekers.",
        "background": "Many Commonwealth citizens have been in UK since 2004, 2005 and even 2006 and are still being denied their \"stays\" for some unwarranted reasons and yet the Home Office continue to collect their hard earned monies from them via applications only to be denying them. IS THIS FAIR?",
