        "additional_details": "Vaping is not smoking, therefore vapers should have their own rights and not be discriminated against or put at risk of passive smoking.",
        "background": "Hundreds of workplaces are rightly, making policies to include ecigs. The trouble is that some policies are stating that vaping must be in smoking shelters. It is putting vapers at risk and forcing them off the premises to remain smoke free when the smokers have a shelter.",
