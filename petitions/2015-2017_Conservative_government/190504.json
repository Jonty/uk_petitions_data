        "action": "A referendum as to if the UK people care if Scotland remains in the Union",
        "additional_details": "Surely we should be allowed to have an opinion in the debate. The Leader of the Scots appears to assume that the bulk of the Union's citizens would be upset, or care if the Scots left. Let's find out the truth. Do we care? If not let's cut them lose ASAP.\r\nIf they don't want to be in our club....bye,bye. And good luck on your own. The rest of the Union would benefit from the funds currently keeping Scotlands head above water.",
        "background": "The Scottish referendum was unfair as it only polled one quarter of the four affected \"family\" groups. No one seems in the least concerned about asking for or hearing the opinions of the \"rest\" of the Union members. No account taken of if the rest of the Union would be happier if they left. ",
