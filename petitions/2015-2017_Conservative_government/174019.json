A low income mother may choose to buy food for her children rather than buy a \u00a34.00 loaf of bread.\r\n\r\nThe main ingredients in commercial food is rice &  potato flour,  which have a high G.I. that isn't good for diabetics & those on verge of diabetes. \r\nPrescription staples are a necessity. Cutting to save costs will lead to rising costs in other areas. ",
        "background": "Cutting Gluten Free staples from prescription effects the quality of life of coeliacs.\r\n\r\nIn the long run it will not save the NHS money but infact cost more as general gluten free food is expensive and full of sugars and fats. Which can lead to other conditions such as diabetes.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
