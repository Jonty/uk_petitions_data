        "action": "Lower the voting age to 16 for the 2017 General Election so brexit has a mandate",
        "additional_details": "The terms of brexit will be a huge part of the election and the demographic that would be most effected and devastated by it should therefore have a vote, to deny them one is undemocratic. ",
        "background": "Brexit will have the largest burden on the younger generation who were not given the opportunity to shape their future. This is grossly undemocratic and brexit's mandate is weak given that the people most effected by it were denied a vote. The voting age should ergo be lowered for the next election.",
