I am who only knows about politics from my dad, and without him, I would be with the other teenagers who have little or no understanding about what is going on politically in this world. Of course, my dad only offers one view. Politics shapes and determines our future, just like any other subject taught in school and so we need to understand it!",

How political parties are organised and what they believe\r\n3. Why and how we vote\r\n4. What politics means for the individual, community and the world.",
