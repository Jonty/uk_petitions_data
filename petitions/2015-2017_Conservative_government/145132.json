Article 50 entails a 2 year maximum period to negotiate a withdrawal and is irreversible. The U.K. has been greatly divided by the referendum and we should reach a national consensus and compromise on what future relationship we do want before invoking Article 50.",

We should establish what relationship we do want with the EU before we commit to leave irrevocably.",
