        "additional_details": "Please look at this link to an investergation conducted by Channel 4 news\r\n\r\nhttp://www.channel4.com/news/electoral-commission-to-investigate-tory-election-spending\r\n\r\nWith out the power to investergate and sanction, the Electoral commissions hands are tied and they have to ask local police forces to investergate on their behalf. I feel it would be better for them to not have to rely on the police who could be pressured by others not to investergate, as we have seen many times in the past.",
        "background": "The Electoral commission does not have powers to investigate potential breaches of the Representation of People Act. This seem strange because surely that is the reason they are in existence, to over see and protect the democratic process of this nation. ",
