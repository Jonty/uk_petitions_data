This could be a long-term charitable or voluntary activity, or innovative work of a relatively short duration (3 to 4 years) that has made a significant difference\" {https://www.gov.uk/honours/types-of-honours-and-awards}. \r\n\r\nIt is proposed that unpaid civil and military Mountain Rescue and RNLI volunteers be able to apply for this medal following a period of 4 years verifiable service.",

The British Empire Medal is an eminently appropriate means by which to recognise the selfless and life saving services provided by these volunteers. ",
