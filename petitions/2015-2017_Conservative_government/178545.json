        "additional_details": "Different constituencies have answered differently to the referendum question. To vote for the desires of constituents, if necessary in opposition to the policy of their party, is a right all MPs should be granted. All MPs must have the opportunity, without penalty, to represent the views of their constituents. In matters of sovereignty it is quite wrong that MPs should be compelled to act according to party policy. Let our views be represented by our MPs not coerced by their party's leadership.",
        "background": "Triggering Article 50 will set in motion the most radical change in the status of our nation and its citizens for half a century. One aim of Brexit is to recoup sovereignty. Parliamentary sovereignty requires freedom of conscience for MPs. Every vote must be free and not dictated by party policy.",
