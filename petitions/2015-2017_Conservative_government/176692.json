        "background": "Why are we still breathing in smoke that we know will kill us, even when we've chosen not to?\r\nThose of us who have decided not to smoke, or to give up, are still forced to inhale cigarette smoke every time we go for a walk or take our children to the park or pop to the shops! It's not right!",
