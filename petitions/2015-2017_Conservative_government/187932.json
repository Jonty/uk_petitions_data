        "additional_details": "Both wheelchair users we paid \u00a327,500 for a downstairs disabled toilet & lounge extension. Despite agreeing the contract last April and paying the total in three payments, less than half the contracted work has been done.  We've been informed that it\u2019s unlikely we can get our money back, even using the courts. The Government must investigate how the laws are failing to protect people like us and take action to make them more effective so others don\u2019t have to go through what we have.",
        "background": "It's illegal to breach a contract but in reality it's very difficult for a consumer to recover their money. The Government needs to investigate how the current law is working and improve protections for consumers.",
