        "additional_details": "A recent video showed a lorry driver crashing into a line of cars, including one full of a family, because he was on his phone. He would not have taken his eyes off the road if he had had his mobile phone in a mount. It is devastating what has happened to this family, but for the driver as well. All he did was something that Everyone does at one time or another and he was unlucky. A family were killed instantly, this could have been avoided.",
        "background": "It should be a legal obligation to have a phone dock, holder or mount fitted in your car to pass an MOT. It is illegal to have your phone in your hand while driving but for most, unfortunately it continues to be a problem. We hope to reduce the deaths associated with mobile phone use while driving.",
