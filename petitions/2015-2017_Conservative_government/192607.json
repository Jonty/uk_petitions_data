        "additional_details": "The nature of the terrorist threats have changed now. People are becoming radical over the internet or propaganda and there are more and more lone wolf attacks. It is not possible for the intelligence agencies to follow every suspect all the time. It is also not practical for armed squads to be called upon within minutes to deal with a situation.  Hence arming all police officers has become necessary to deal with new challenges to security.",
        "background": "The police officers require weapons not only to protect themselves but also the public. With more and more lone wolf attacks, an armed police officer is lot more effective when in a situation near a major event or an attraction if he can confront the attacker with a weapon. ",
