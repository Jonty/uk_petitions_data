        "action": "Allow US President Donald J. Trump to address Parliament during his state visit.",
        "additional_details": "Speaker John Bercow claims President Trump's temporary restriction on the citizens of 7 countries is an act of racism, despite it only targeting countries on a shortlist created by former President Obama that are known to harbor terrorist organizations. A nation such as the UK, in a time of such uncertainty needs a partner she can rely on, and the US has always been there for us. However, we can no longer rely on that support if people like the Speaker do not show a tinge of respect for them.",
        "background": "It is a disgrace that Speaker John Bercow is no longer allowing the President of our biggest ally to speak in Parliament, despite allowing world leaders speak from countries with gross human rights violations. HM Government must not allow such a lack of hospitality to occur in our free country.",
