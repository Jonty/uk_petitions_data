Micro chipping is law now in this country for dogs. Why can we not pass a law that states that when you get a dog you have to attach your national insurance number to said dog?? If you sell this dog rehome or put no rescue or even dump and you do not change NI details any costs incurred should be billed to the last NI on record, this way any costs made could be received back. ",
