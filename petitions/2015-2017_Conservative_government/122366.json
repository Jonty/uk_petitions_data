        "additional_details": "Recognised conditions include hypoparathyroidism and diabetes - both long-term conditions which require ongoing prescriptions. There are multiple other diseases which require regular prescriptions, including multiple sclerosis. \r\n\r\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological condition which affects around 100,000 people in the UK. One medication of many given to MS sufferers is Gabapentin to help with spasms - a drug more commonly given to epilepsy sufferers. Epilepsy is also on the list. MS is not.",
        "background": "To obtain a Medical Exemption Certificate and get free NHS prescriptions a condition needs to be on the current Medical Exemption list. We feel this list does not go far enough to help those suffering with other long-term conditions and diseases. A revision could help thousands of British Citizens.",
