        "action": "British Government to reconsider its decision to renew the Lease on Chagos",
        "additional_details": "The British Government has recently made \u00a340M available in a pot to assist the Chagossians over the next 10 years. The sum is not sufficient to redress the wrong-doings by the Government and instead a more legitimate programme for resettlement of the Chagossians should be considered, wherever the Chagossians are today, irrespective of their current circumstances.  All the Chagossians HAVE BEEN UPROOTED and therefore should EACH be treated equally in benefiting from any form of redress.",
        "background": "The British Government decided to stop resettlement of the Chagossians. The Government should stop the renewal of the Lease in December 2016. If proceeds the natives would be too old or be dead in 2036, when  the lease expires.  Exiled for over 40 years. Join me in condemning this decision.\r\n",
