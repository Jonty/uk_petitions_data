        "additional_details": " \r\nIn his role as Deputy Head of the Home Affairs policy unit he held responsibility for co-ordination of the government response to the problem of abusive images of children on the internet.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe that the Judge Alistair McCreath's comment that Rock's punishment was, \"the loss of your reputation and your very public humiliation', indicates a preferential approach to the sentencing of child sex offenders seemingly dependent on their social status and privilege. We demand that his sentence be reviewed and increased to reflect the impact on the victims and the fact that he brought into disrepute his position of  trust and responsibility in relation to his specialist role in government.",
        "background": "We believe that the sentencing of Patrick Rock, former  advisor to David Cameron, to a 2 year conditional discharge is an insult to the child victims of the abusive, indecent images he downloaded. The children were young, underage girls and the images were of them in 'sexualised poses'. ",
