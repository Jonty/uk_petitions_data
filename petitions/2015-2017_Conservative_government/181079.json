If you live in a council property and have any spare bedrooms, you will be forced to pay the tax whatever your personal situation may be; even if you have lived in that property for up to 22 years. \r\n\r\nThe government has decided that:\r\n\r\n* Any single person aged 16 or over needs their own bedroom.\r\n* A couple need a bedroom.\r\n* A child needs a bedroom BUT.....\r\n* A boy and a girl are expected to share a bedroom if they are both under 10.\r\n* 2 boys or 2 girls are expected to share if they are both under 16. See below for examples.\r\n* Foster children are not taken into account \r\n* Children who stay with you part of the time aren\u2019t taken into account.",
