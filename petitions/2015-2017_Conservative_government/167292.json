        "background": "For so long English people have been chastised by the government of the UK.\r\nPeople that reside in England are charged for prescriptions when the rest of the realm is exempt! WHY!?\r\nIt borders on racism and is unacceptable in this day & age!\r\nThose of us who have to pay, join the cause!",
