        "additional_details": "Saudi Arabia is undermining western democracy and do not wish Muslims to receive the freedoms of democracy. They are using religious funding channels to achieve such aims. This actual lets down the whole idea of offering refugees a democratic haven from the evils of dictatorship and fundamental strict inhuman punishments and torture. We have let our Muslim refugees down, especially the woman and children. Such committee's and funding should be banned immediately.     ",
        "background": "Saudi Arabia has been funding the building of British Mosques. Plus setting up religious councils that promote Saudi style Sharia Law. This undermines our laws of equality and human rights. In tight knit communities they deliberately ostracise women and children when Sharia laws are infringed.    ",
