        "additional_details": "There are countless examples of the media either lying about or grossly exaggerating information in order to sway public opinion. This is especially prevalent during elections and times of other important political decision making -- the most vital points in democratic life. The media must be made accountable, for the sake of democracy and general decency, for their words, when it is found, post event, that they were falsifying or exaggerating information in spite of what they knew to be true.",
        "background": "The media is the most far reaching and influential social-informant medium and it holds the power to sway the outcome of democratic decisions. Very often it will abuse this power by deliberately putting forward false and grossly exaggerated information. This must be legislated against. ",
