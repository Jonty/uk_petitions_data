        "action": "Update the law, to allow subjects of unhappiness or same-sex adultery a divorce.",
        "additional_details": "In March 2017, Tini Owens, 66, lost her case at the court of appeal. She described herself as 'desperately unhappy' in her marriage of 39 years. She says her husband has been dismissive, insensitive, distrusting and generally unloving towards her for years. Even if Tini Owens is lying, and wants to leave her marriage - why should any court be in a position to stop her?! This is embarrassingly backward legislation, and needs reforming urgently. ",
        "background": "Laws surrounding divorce in the UK are woefully outdated. UK courts neither recognise same-sex adultery, nor blatant unhappiness as suitable grounds for divorce. As a supposedly progressive country, we need to give unhappy people a choice, and take our divorce laws into the twenty-first century.\r\n\r\n",
