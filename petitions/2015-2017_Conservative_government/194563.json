        "additional_details": "Previous Labour Party had advised the public to buy diesel cars as they were considered better for the environment. Why now must the public who listened be at loss?\r\n\r\nDiesel cars only make up 10% of the environmental pollution so why are they being singled out?\r\n\r\nThe fees that have been suggested are unreasonable to say the least. How would the government expect some people to keep their jobs and what will happen to delivery drivers, vans, busses etc? \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Upon hearing the news that drivers of diesel cars would face a 300-400% increase in road tax as from 2019 and also face having to pay up to \u00a324 a day to drive into towns something needs to be done. diesel cars only make up 10% of pollution so let's do something about this outrageous decision.
