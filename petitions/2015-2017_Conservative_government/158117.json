        "additional_details": "I believe that during this historically unprecedented time, all care, time and consideration should be given to the election of the new Prime Minister and this should be done under the remit of Conservative Party Constitution for a New Leader.  To elect a Prime Minister in any other way will be seen by the public as undemocratic and un unifying at a time where both democracy and unity are paramount. In the long term this will damage the credibility of the Conservative Party.",
        "background": "Plans are for Theresa May to become Prime Minister, on the basis of the number of Conservative MP's backing her, thereby eliminating the need to put the vote to Conservative Party Members.  It will take 2 years to exit the EU after Article 50 is invoked, there is enough time for due process.\r\n ",
