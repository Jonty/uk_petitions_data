        "additional_details": "Balloon and Chinese Lantern Releases usually take place, because of the start of a new life, or the end of a life. Instead of polluting our wildlife and environment, plant a tree. It is much cheaper, and will last a lot longer! A little plaque can be placed in front of it, to dedicate the memory of somebody, or a time/event. It is a lot cheaper, efficient and friendly (both socially and environmentally).",
        "background": "Daily Balloon and Chinese Lantern Releases are taking place. More animals are dying because of this. Animals can mistake litter for its' food when it eats this litter, it clogs up its guts - eventually killing it. With this, more species of animals are dying. Plus, it pollutes our environment.",
