        "additional_details": "The USA now requires a rear-facing seat for children aged 0-2 and many Scandinavian nations place requirements to the age of 4 years. The UK lags ways behind. The EU has called for rear-facing seats to the age of 3 years but no action has been taken. This situation is compounded because the UK retail market does not supply a wide range of affordable rear-facing seats for babies and small children.\r\n\r\nChange the law so children need to be rear-facing for a minimum of 2 years before forward facing.\r\n",
        "background": "UK legislation only requires a rear-facing car seat for children that weigh up to 9kg \u2013 approx. 9-10 months old. However, evidence clearly shows that a rear-facing seat is five times safer and that all children weighing 18kg \u2013 approx. 4 years should remain rear facing to increase car safety. ",
