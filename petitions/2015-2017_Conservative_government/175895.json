        "additional_details": "It is totally disgusting and disgraceful that ex-servicemen and women having served their country loyally and in good faith, are now having to live in fear of profit chasing solicitors assembling legacy evidence of dubious heritage in the false name of 'justice' It must stop. Allow the military courts to deal with any misconduct OR open all unsolved cases of disappearances and murders during the Irish Troubles. It happened, it wa awful, and it's over. Both sides have to move on, both sides.",
        "background": "The blanket pardon issued to all those who committed atrocities in both Northern Ireland and in the UK (Republican and Unionist), was done without mandate from the UK populace. The associated hounding of ex-servicemen for their alleged misconduct is both biased and prejudicial to any moral code.",
