        "additional_details": "When we decided to cancel the city was on lockdown, much of the public transport network and many tourist attractions were closed.To alter flights would have cost \u00a330/person each way and the new dates were more expensive so we would still have lost most of our money. I feel that it should be the responsibility of this government to legislate that if destination is Level 4 threat level and advice is to avoid airports then airlines should give full refunds!",
        "background": "Like many others over the past few weeks, we decided to cancel a weekend trip to Brussels, gov.uk website and other countries advised avoiding airports and public places yet Ryanair offered no option to cancel which I feel is against government advice. At level 4 people should be allowed full refund",
