However, the consequences in this instance are so grave for the future of the UK, especially for our children and young people, that we believe that such a decision can only be taken after giving those who voted the opportunity to reflect upon the actual consequences for themselves and their families, rather than on the basis of untruths, before they decide on such a perilous course.  ",
        "background": "The recent referendum was held upon the basis of a false prospectus, in that the principal arguments advanced by the \"leave\" campaigns were factually incorrect and highly misleading, and leading campaigners are now on record admitting as such. \r\n",
