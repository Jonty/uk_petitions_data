        "additional_details": "To deny fathers the same benefit is unfair, unequal and sexist, the father should be available to help the mother of a new born child, a very difficult time for many families. For up to 39 weeks with pay as women are. \r\nMany women who have C sections or difficult births require extra care, especially if they already have an older child. \r\n2 weeks leave is not suitable or long enough to allow a father to bond with a new baby and to aid the recovery of his partner after child birth/C section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Women in the UK are entitled to paid maternity leave up to 39 weeks. \r\n\r\nMen only get 2 weeks. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
