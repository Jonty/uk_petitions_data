This is money that can be used more appropriately such as for healthcare and benefits, so needed by the public and currently being cut due to \"lack of money available\". \r\n\r\nThe public should not be paying for such lavish costs for the monarchy when the money is in dire need elsewhere.",
        "background": "The government has agreed to providing \u00a3369 million of tax payers money to pay for refurbishment. The Queen is one of the richest women in the world and could easily afford to cover costs for the refurbishment. Opening the Palace all year round to the public would be a start. ",
