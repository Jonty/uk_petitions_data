        "additional_details": "As a background, I would direct you to many you tube clips of Tony Blair justifying the need to go to war against Iraq, which as I recall was to \"make us safer\" - clearly it did not.\r\n\r\nNo government should be allowed to go to war in the light of such opposition from the electorate.",
        "background": "I have seen two petitions today, one from the Daily Mirror and one from ITV.\r\n\r\nBoth petitions seem to show an 80% opposition to further UK involvement in Syrian bombing campaign.\r\nIf this is representative of public feeling I believe of the current Government should hold a fresh General Election.\r\n",
