        "additional_details": "If there is a clear demand for a referendum no politician has the right to stand in the way of the people of Sco to choose their own future.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the Sco Parliament should have the right to hold another referendum if there is clear and sustained evidence that independence has become the preferred option of a majority of the Sco people \u2013 or if there is a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014, such as Sco being taken out of the EU against our will.",
        "background": "On 23rd June, Eng & Wal voted to leave the EU contrary to the opposite yet decisive vote in Sco to remain.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to show the UK Gov that the Sco people are supportive of the Sco Gov to allow a 2nd Independence Referendum if they chose this option to protect Scotland's best interests",
