        "additional_details": "forced adoption happens in secret family courts, a council are given a target to meet on how many babies/children they need to adopt to get bonuses. John hemming, a known mp who knows all about this matter and sees the doings. Understandingly I know ss have the duty of care to a child I don't disputes that but ever since baby p (bless hes soul) mothers that wouldn't put their babies at harm are paying the price or living the consequences of how you had a bad up bringing",
        "background": "We need a full investigation on how SS work taking children from their mum when no acutal harm has come to their child, however they say that there 'could be potential harm'. It costs more to adopt out then to keep the baby with the mother, something needs to be done, our children are at risk.",
