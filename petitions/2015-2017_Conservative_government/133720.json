        "additional_details": "London generates far more tax revenue per head than the rest of the UK. It also receives far less public spending per head than other major cities. Sign this petition to force parliament to start the legal process for independence. There are many successful city states in the world. We can be the new one.",
        "background": "The UK voted to leave the EU. London clearly voted to remain. The rest of the country does not share our values of cooperation and inclusion. We deserve the opportunity to make our own way in the world and to direct our own economy and our future. We shouldn't have to support a backward looking UK",
