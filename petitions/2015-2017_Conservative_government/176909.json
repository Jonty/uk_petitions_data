This is a clear breach of the contract. Not only will the noise cause distress to the people living on Kingsmead park, but also, residents will have some of their gardens cut away to make room for the holiday park. There will be noise, increased traffic and litter. The views from people's houses on Kingsmead Park will also be spoiled.",
