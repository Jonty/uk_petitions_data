        "action": "Repeal and replace the NFAOP act 1861 with something new and up to date",
        "additional_details": "This act is used daily. It is over 150 years old, and lacks key definitions. It is an extremely important act of Parliament, even being considered the workhorse of the legal system by some. The courts themselves have had to define key terms including what constitutes as ABH (Chan Fook) and what constitutes as Wounding (Eisenhower). It shouldn't be left to the courts to decide what Parliament meant when writing the acts as Parliament should have done a good enough job in defining these terms.",
        "background": "The best ways in which parliament could update this act is by putting the offences of ABH and GBH in the same act as battery and assault so the law is more concise. In addition to this they could actually define what GBH and ABH is rather than leaving it to the courts to define.",
