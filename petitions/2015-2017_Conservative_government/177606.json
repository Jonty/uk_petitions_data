This means they are no longer entitled to a Motability vehicle. The letter informing them of this gives them four weeks to return their cars. \r\n\r\nIf their reconsideration and/or appeal is successful, they will have given up their cars for nothing. \r\n\r\nPlease find a way to help these people keep their cars until a final appeal is unsuccessful.
