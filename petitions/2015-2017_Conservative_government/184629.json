        "additional_details": "This problem has been going on for a long time and is getting worse with ministers doing very little to curb it. Recently a proposal was put forward by the house of lords to requite sites to seek permission from event organisers before reselling tickets. The main problem with this being the control Ticketmaster has over the event market meaning they would likely corner the ticket resale market. However, this solution would circumvent that problem and level the playing field for all resale sites.",
        "background": "The market for live entertainment events is in shambles with touts bulk-buying tickets for highly anticipated events and selling them at a massive mark-up. We propose amending the digital economies act to include fines for reselling tickets above face value plus reasonable booking and shipping fees.",
