        "additional_details": "The NHS makes me proud to be a citizen of the UK. As I sit here and write this from my baby son's bedside on a children's ward, I am moved to tears by the care he is receiving tonight from highly trained and caring professionals who have left their own family behind to care for mine. What is most amazing is that this is free at the point of use for all. Why not dedicate a day per year for the appreciation of the NHS and its staff. ",
        "background": "1 and 17 March, and 30 November are bank holidays in Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. There is no such holiday on 23 April in England. This date should be nominated as appreciation day of a Great British and Northern Irish institution to unite all who benefit from this service around the UK. ",
