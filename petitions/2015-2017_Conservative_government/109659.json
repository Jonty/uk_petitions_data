        "additional_details": "Alsager has seen 5 housing developments on green fields allowed on appeal in recent months,some within the Royal Ordnance Radway Green 'blast zone' and some on land prone to flooding. There are 2 brownfield sites (Manchester Metropolitan University abandoned site, CaradonTwyfords former commercial site) in the town. There are over 150 pre-owned homes in the town for sale. There is no change in employment availability in the town. Presumably many new residents will commute to work using the seriously congested stretch of M6 around junctions 15-19. There is no supporting infrastructure planned in Alsager and roads/traffic is currently a problem.",
        "background": "Housing developments on green fields have been allowed on appeal in Cheshire East due to the lack of a Local Plan. There are brownfield sites that are not being developed. Developers are rushing to profit from this. Local residents feel powerless as they see their local environment spoilt.",
