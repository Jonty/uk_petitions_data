Sometimes called sensory processing disorder or SPD, these issues happen because the brain has trouble organizing information from the senses.\r\n\r\nChildren with sensory processing issues can be oversensitive to sights, sounds, textures, flavors, smells and other sensory input. This can make a trip to a toy store or trying a new dish at a restaurant an overwhelming experience for them. Other children with sensory processing issues are undersensitive to information they receive through the senses. This can lead to other problems.\r\n",
