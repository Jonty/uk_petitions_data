        "action": "Hold a general election in October of 2016",
        "additional_details": "During the EU Referendum we fell far far short of the honesty, ethical and moral standards the British electorate should have been accorded by its politicians. No longer is it credible for any party political organisations to be considered representative of the public as a whole, in respect of this most fundamental change to our nation.\r\n \r\nAs we face change by leaving the EU, we must demand absolute clarity from our politicians regarding their non-partisan future intentions for the British nation as a whole.\r\n",
        "background": "This petition calls for a full general election before EU exit negotiations start (likely in October 2016). To give time for the public to reflect on the EU Referendum's outcome, and be assured that a fresh Government has a clear mandate to act - according to its published and detailed manifesto.",
