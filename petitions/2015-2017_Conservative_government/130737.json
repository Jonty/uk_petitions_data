Exam boards are regulated by the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual), which regulates qualifications, examinations and assessments in England. \r\n\r\nYou can make a complaint to Ofqual about the organisations it regulates, including complaining about grade boundaries set by individual exam boards. Further information about how to complain is available here: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofqual/about/complaints-procedure.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could start a new petition calling on the Government to reverse the changes it has made to the subject content from which exam boards develop their specifications (which are approved by Ofqual). Over the past few years the Government has redesigned subject content to make the qualifications more challenging. You could ask for this policy to be reversed."
