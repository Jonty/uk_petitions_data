        "additional_details": "We had the infamous claim that if we leave the EU, instead of sending \u00a3350 million a week to them, we can send it to the NHS; and then after the result declaring that we didn't actually send the EU that much money, & also it wouldn't be going directly to the NHS. This new independent department should consist of teams from Ofcom,Advertising Agency,CPS,ONS and electoral lawyers (etc) to ensure that no politician can mislead the public with unsubstantiated claims and that UK politics are truthful.",
        "background": "In a year where the Oxford English Dictionary names its Word of the Year as 'post-truth', then something has gone wrong in the politics & campaigning world. This is a petition asking for the establishing of an independent department that will ensure truthful politics.",
