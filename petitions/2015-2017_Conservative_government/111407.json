        "additional_details": "Here is what I'm suggesting, if our government are to keep this VAT then I think it should be donated to 3rd world and disadvantaged countries where women and young girls don't have this 'luxury'. They use cloths and dirty rags during their periods. TSS or toxic shock syndrome is very common and very fatal. \r\nPlease sign the petition to get he government to use our taxes in a respectable and useful fashion. \r\nI don't mind paying tax if it changes the world.",
        "background": "Ladies from all over the UK are becoming irate and sickened by the fact we have to pay VAT on our sanitary products. Parliament claim these items are luxury and therefore are taxable. I for one, find it a little disgraceful we have to do this.",
