Advising and helping people to try the 'blood sugar diet' will be more effective both in terms of health and cost, yet this hasn't been mentioned.\r\nDr Maureen Baker of The Royal College of GPs said she welcomes the scheme but warned 'The long-term behaviour change we need to see is hard to inspire'.   However, there are forums which offer support for this 'blood sugar diet' offering a lot of support which will ease the pressure on GP surgeries.",
        "background": "Professor Taylor of Newcastle University has shown that a low calorie, low carbohydrate diet can reverse Type 2 diabetes. \r\nIt has been announced that by 2020 100000 pre-diabetics will be given 'lifestyle help' to reduce the risk of developing diabetes. The evidence does not support this hypothesis.",
