        "action": "Stop passport checks on pregnant NHS patients",
        "additional_details": "Antenatal wards already require a form with proof of eligibility but these cannot always be done fully. The proposals would require checks to be stricter and could, in the view of multiple critics and medical staff, lead to higher risk to patient health. These proposals give no assurance that patients would have access to care regardless of immigration status, as is current government policy and law. Focus on \"health tourism\" is a racist smokescreen for the Conservatives' destruction of the NHS.",
        "background": "The proposals by St. George's University Hospital Trust, and backed by the Home Office, that pregnant people would be subject to mandatory passport checks before being able to access care to crack down on \"health tourism\" are deeply worrying, steeped in racism, and should be rejected immediately.",
