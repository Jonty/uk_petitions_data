        "additional_details": "Traditionally the British airshow is and has been one of the safest and well attended events. Sadly last year an horrendous accident at the Shoreham Airshow which resulted in the sad deaths of a number of people brought safety in to the headlines. The sad thing is the CAA's biggest change is to charges which are forcing widespread cancellations, with the greatest of respect money does not equal safety and if we dont do something now the Great British airshow could be lost forever.",
        "background": "One by one the Great British Airshows are disappearing from the calender as a result of changes made by the CAA under the guise of safety but resulting in extortionate increases in charges and over the top changes to flying regulations resulting in widespread cancellations.",
