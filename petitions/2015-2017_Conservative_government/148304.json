        "additional_details": "Whatever your position on the vote, the democratic outcome must be respected but with continued fighting across political parties, social media, the press, TV, the UK looks like it will struggle to find a path towards a strong and unified future.\r\n\r\nParty political gains have no place in this time of national crisis.\r\n\r\nI call upon all MPs, whatever their party, to unite for the good of our country and form a Government of National Unity to steer the UK towards a safe, secure and prosperous future.",
        "background": "On June 23rd the people of the UK voted to leave the EU. The following day the country was thrust into political chaos with crisis in the Conservative and Labour Party and the SNP calling for Scottish independence. We now need a Government of National Unity to steer the UK towards a secure future.",
