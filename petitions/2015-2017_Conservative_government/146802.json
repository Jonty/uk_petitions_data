        "additional_details": "The UK government has agreed that people will always be asked to vote in a referendum on major EU treaty changes. Arguably the exit of the UK from the EU, on terms yet to be discussed, let alone agreed, is as important as any treaty change. Discussions with the EU, and the deal available to the UK must be voted on by a referendum. To ensure this, the UK must agree with the EU, before giving any formal notice to the EU, that exit is not binding until the final deal is put to a UK a referendum.",
        "background": "When the EU remain/leave question was put to the UK people, there was no plan or terms agreed between the EU and the UK. If the UK government gives notice to the EU, by article 50 or otherwise, there is no turning back. The UK must hold a referendum on the terms before exit becomes binding.",
