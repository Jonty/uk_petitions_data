        "additional_details": "What I believe should happen is that when a dog commits a crime such as attacking a child they are to be put on a 2 stage warning system, the dog is then taken for an behaviour assessment and the owners property is assessed for welfare standards. If the dog then commits the act again more serious action can be taken to change the behaviour such as rehousing the dog to a different family to see if the dog with change then if this option has failed then the dog can be destroyed.",
        "background": "Many dogs that are confiscated are done so because they look dangerous or because of their breed specification; Pit Bull Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, I believe that they should only be destroyed if they commit an act that deems them dangerous (full on attack on a child or vulnerable person)",
