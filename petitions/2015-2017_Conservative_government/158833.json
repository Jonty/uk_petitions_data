        "additional_details": "A political promise might be a politician / political party promising to put money into education within 4 years if they win the election. If they don't do it then they should face the courts. If there's a good reason for not meeting a promise, e.g. if a recession hits just after the election, then that is a good reason to break the promise and so nothing happens. If there are no good reasons for breaking a promise then the party is fined, loses seats or the politician may face jail time.",
        "background": "Political parties often lie in their campaigns or make promises that they rarely keep (e.g. in their manifesto). Politicians have got away with this behaviour forever it seems. This is why I propose a system where political promises made during campaigns are legally binding.",
