        "additional_details": "The radicalizing of people in prison is well documented. As a result, the problem is increased, making it more (if not impossible) for the police and security services to monitor and control them.\r\nThe net result will be that terrorists will be an extreme and increasing, danger to the health and well being of the population of the United Kingdom.\r\nThey should only be considered for release when the controlling group has disbanded and ceased its activities.",
        "background": "Terrorists, such as so called IS, are not common criminals. Invariably, when they are imprisoned, they undergo and assist with radicalizing others. The result is that when released, these people and those who have been newly radicalized, are more of a danger to the public.",
