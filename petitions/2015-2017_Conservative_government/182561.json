Majority parents want their children to get best education and should be able to make decision for them. Children need to learn about the world outside the class room. Happy children also have better results at school therefore they need quality family time. Maybe they can be issued with the teaching material or homework instead",

This means children are losing on valuable family time and learning skills they can not learn in the class room. Parents together with teachers should be allowed to decide if child can miss school.",
