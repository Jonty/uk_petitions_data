        "additional_details": "Protecting your baby from tobacco smoke is one of the best things you can do to give your child a healthy start in life. It's never too late to stop smoking. Every cigarette you smoke contains over 4,000 chemicals, so smoking when you are pregnant harms your unborn baby. Cigarettes can restrict the essential oxygen supply to your baby, so their heart has to beat harder every time you smoke. \r\n\r\nRef : http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/smoking-pregnant.aspx",
        "background": "I have just seen a pregnant woman walking down the street smoking a cigarette. I think it is wholly wrong for a woman to have a decision whether or not to smoke when it can negatively affect a child's health, wellbeing and future. ",
