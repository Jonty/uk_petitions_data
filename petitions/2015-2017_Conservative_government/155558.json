        "additional_details": "The cars were still fitted with the cheat device in Europe, and inaccurate data was published regarding the vehicle's emissions, therefore misleading customers into thinking they were buying something that they were not.  The compensation should be the same.",
        "background": "After the \"Dieselgate\" scandal emerged in the USA, owners of affected cars are to be compensated $7500 each, plus an option to sell back the affected vehicle to VW or have it 'repaired'. VW have said that they will not do this in the EU as the 'situation is different', and will only modify the cars.",
