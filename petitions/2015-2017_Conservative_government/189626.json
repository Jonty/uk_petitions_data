Yet again we are under attack - The grossly unfair IR35 proposals, limits on dividend payments and the reckless, ideologically-driven descent into \"Hard Brexit\" are undermining the security of self-employed workers. Give us a break - we are already walking a tightrope and the government should not underestimate the impact of these proposals.",

What little tax advantage we currently benefit from falls a long way short of making up for this",
