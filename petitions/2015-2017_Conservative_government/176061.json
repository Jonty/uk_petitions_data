        "additional_details": "I have felt annoyed and angry many times boarding a plane when I see someone sitting in an Extra Leg room seat who does not require it, but because they have paid for it they get allocated it. Also one of the requirements for sitting in these seats is that you are able bodied to open the Emergency Door and the amount of times I have seen elderly people who have no chance of opening the door sitting in these seats has left me concerned about my safety, but yet again if you pay for it you get it. ",
        "background": "I am 6ft 5in and have problems sitting on a plane, but if I am prepared to pay for an Extra Leg room seat I can resolve the problem. I never asked to be 6ft 5in and I believe I am discriminated on a plane by having to pay to sit in comfort. I believe Extra Leg Room seats should be for tall people.  ",
