        "additional_details": "The EU referendum result is clearly geographically biased. The petition to have a second referendum has the same pattern.  In England and Wales, the Remain vote was strongest in London. The second referendum petition has its core signatories in London. Why is there an assumption that only London's opinion matters? Where is the democracy in a second referendum in a first past the post system?",
        "background": "The Remain campaign appears to be trying to hijack democratic process after the wider country had the temerity to disagree with London. This petition is to allow those who feel they actually are entitled to an opinion even if they don't live in London to have a voice.",
