        "additional_details": "Another way the media helps terrorists is that the extensive, sensationalist coverage spreads irrational fear of Muslims. This makes Muslims feel marginalised and ISIS recruiters use this to their advantage. \r\n\r\nThere are already some restrictions on what the media can cover. This issue is a matter of public safety and therefore should also be restricted. Without the disproportionate attention from the media, becoming a jihadist becomes less desirable.",
        "background": "One of the main reasons groups like ISIS are so successful at recruitment is the extensive media coverage of attackers following an incident. This attention and fame is attractive in the eyes of jihadists. They seem to aspire to be \"news material\".\r\n\r\nWhy is the media allowed to directly help them? ",
