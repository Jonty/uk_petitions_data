        "additional_details": "I would suggest that you take a look at the Pernicious Anaemia Society website where there is so much evidence from experts that treatment should be symptom led and not restricted to 4 injections yearly.  Patients used to die of this disease as this Vitamin is vital to life.  If it cannot be absorbed and stored in the liver, patients must have these injections for life.  Treatment should be based on the symptoms as every patient is different.  You cannot overdose on this vitamin, it is cheap, and it's hard to believe given all the evidence that there are restrictions on it's use.",
        "background": "The damage this illness causes include terrible depression, anxiety, personality changes, memory loss and irreversible neurological damage if not untreated. Many need more B12 to alleviate symptoms but are refused access to it due to restrictions on doctors.  Around 50p per jab.  A disgrace! ",
