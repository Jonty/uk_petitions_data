        "additional_details": "A large percentage  of missing dogs are micro-chipped, but this is useless unless someone scans the dogs. Many of the dogs have been taken in or sold to unsuspecting people, some are in puppy farms, others used for dog fighting. There are so many lost pet sites now online, but we need ONE national database that all wardens have to use, and COMPULSORY scanning by all vets and wardens. Also a system of random checking of homes/farms/travellers sites to scan dogs.",
        "background": "In 2014, statistics show 70,000 missing pets in the UK. Many of these were dogs, and a large percentage are still missing. In April 2016 it will be compulsory to chip dogs. This will only work if checks are made.  We are looking for all vets and wardens to scan dogs, plus random checks on homes.",
