        "action": "Ban the use of non-rewirable (moulded) plugs on electrical appliances.",
        "additional_details": "Because non-rewirable plugs are very difficult to remove from the cables to which they are attached, they are more likely to be left on discarded cable, posing a risk to children (See: http://www.fatallyflawed.org.uk/html/other_dangers.html).\r\n\r\nOver six million electrical items are thrown away every year in the UK (http://www.recycle-more.co.uk/pwpcontrol.php?pwpID=12809). If half of these items had non-rewirable plugs, that's three million usable plugs being discarded yearly in the UK.",
        "background": "Non-rewirable plugs cannot be re-used once the appliance they are attached to is discarded. This adds to land-fill as otherwise reusable plugs are discarded with non-working appliances (fridges, kettles etc.).\r\nAdditionally, non-rewirable plugs are more hazardous to children than rewirable plugs.",
