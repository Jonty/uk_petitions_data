        "additional_details": "the death rate on Britain's roads is reducing thankfully, but the exception is with cyclist's.  I have never understood the logic of untrained people using busy roads and risking their lives daily. If a cyclist is a driver then they will have taken the driving test and know the rules of the road, but many are non drivers and are a danger to themselves and others.",
        "background": "with the increase of  cycling in the UK in recent years deaths of cyclists on British roads are increasing . There is already a test but its not compulsory , the National Standards for Cycle training test known as Bike -ability.",
