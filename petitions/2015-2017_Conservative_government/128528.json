        "additional_details": "I am one of those many women who suffers from chronic pelvic pain and it has devastated my life.  Leeds university is the only university to include pelvic pain in their curriculum for nurses. Healthcare professionals who suffer from pelvic pain themselves admit that they received no formal training in pelvic pain in their medical education.  The Pelvic Pain Support Network is a charity that promotes education, research and assists pelvic pain patients. Please support www.pelvicpain.org.uk \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Over 1 million women (and men) in this country suffer from pelvic pain.  Many suffer chronic, debilitating pain. Most struggle to find good medical care as their GPs and consultants received no education about pelvic pain during training.  Please help us make it a part of all medical training.",
