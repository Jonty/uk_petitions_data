        "action": "Use the single transferable vote in the next general election.",
        "additional_details": "The single transferable vote is a voting system which allows voters to express their preferences and results in a more representative government. Implementing such a system before the next election is vital for ensuring that the interests of voters are fairly represented.\r\n\r\nThe fact that this election will impact how we leave the EU means that we must replace the current system which effectively denies representation to the majority of the country",
        "background": "The last general election resulted in a minority of the population electing  the majority of MPs. \r\n\r\nIf the goal of the snap election is to unite the country then it is unacceptable that a minority should decide the direction of the country at such an important time.",
