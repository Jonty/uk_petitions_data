        "additional_details": "Voter turnout in the UK has been on a long-term downward trend.  Before 2000, national elections typically attracted over 70% turnout (see http://www.ukpolitical.info/Turnout45.htm) and 80% in the early 1950s.  Since 2000, general election turnout has been below 70%.  In addition, the ability to reject a slate of candidates would address or ease many of the issues identified in the Parliamentary report here: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmpolcon/232/23205.htm ",
        "background": "It's clear from the turnout at elections that voters are disenchanted with politics.  Many claim they dislike all candidates. All ballot papers should have an option for None of the above (NOTA). If NOTA gets more votes than any candidate, that area's election should be rerun with new candidates.",
