        "action": "Landlords must declare mortgage arrears or court proceedings related to property",
        "additional_details": "In November 2015 I took out a 12 month assured tenancy agreement with no break clause. 4 months into the tenancy it became apparent that our landlord was in mortgage arrears prior to our tenancy, that repossession proceedings had began regarding the property and that a further court case meant that power of sale was provided to a third party to dispose of the property. As tenants we should have been made aware of these issues prior to our tenancy beginning given the complications this creates.",
        "background": "This petition is to make it law that a landlord must declare whether there are any ongoing court proceedings in relation to the property being let (such as repossession, power of sale etc) and/or any mortgage arrears prior to a tenancy agreement being issued. ",
