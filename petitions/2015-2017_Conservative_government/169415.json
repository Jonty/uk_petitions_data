        "additional_details": "As a mother of 2 Autistic children I have joined many groups online. There are stories of family's being told they can no longer have DLA/ PIP with a diagnosis of Autism. DWP are employing staff that have no understanding of what Autism is and how it effects children/adults. We need change to make DWP aware that you cannot grow out of autism, cannot have medication to make it vanish. We need recognition that DWP, ATOS, CAPITA and MAXIMUS train staff  to understand and stop Austerity with AUTISM\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Since the Conservative party have been in power and the treasury have stated that major changes will happen for AUSTERITY. My self and many families looking after autistic children and adults have been made to feel that AUTISM does not exist.  Due to DWP not wanting to support us with benefits.\r\n\r\n ",
