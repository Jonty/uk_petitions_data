        "additional_details": "This is a blatant and unfortunately undetectable form of cheating by plagiarism. The best way to reduce this problem is to make the use of such essay writing services a criminal offence. In addition, this law would ideally be accompanied with a ban on such services from operating in the U.K., and banning the IP address of any service operating outside of the UK from being accessed via UK internet hosts.",
        "background": "The number of companies offering essay writing services to students at British universities is on the rise. These companies charge students hundreds of pounds to have an 'expert' write an essay that is passed off as the student's own work. ",
