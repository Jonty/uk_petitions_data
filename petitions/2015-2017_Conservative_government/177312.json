        "action": "Stop the Brexit process and declare that Britain will remain in European Union.",
        "additional_details": "The referendum was unfair and undemocratic because millions of British citizens living abroad and at least a million citizens of countries in the EU resident of the UK were denied the vote. The great majority of these excluded people are in favour of the UK remaining in the EU and had they been allowed to vote, the result of the referendum would almost certainly have been to remain. I for example am a British citizen resident of Spain but was not allowed to vote so my voice to remain was ignored",
        "background": "In response to the referendum the government is spending a lot of money on preparing to take Britain out of the European Union. This petition calls on the government to immediately stop this process and to declare publicly that Britain will remain in the European Union.",
