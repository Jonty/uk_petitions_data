        "action": "Reduce teachers stress by limiting teaching contact hours to maximum 18hrs/ week",
        "additional_details": "A 2015 study showed that 89% of 3500 teachers stated that workloads are a problem with 2/3 stating they are considering leaving. Teachers are not given a good work-life balance and often work at home because they do not have enough time to complete all tasks in normal working hours- with most reporting they work 60+ hrs /wk.  Teachers are currently expected to teach 25.5 hrs/wk. By legally reducing this to 18 classroom hours we can reduce stress and allow a more reasonable work week for teachers",
        "background": "There have been many reports that teachers face too much stress and increasing workloads are reducing, not only the quality of teaching, but the mental health of our educators. Planning and assessing takes time. Teachers currently teach upto 25.5 hours which is too much with other duties needed.",
