        "additional_details": "At a time where we need to 'negotiate' carefully with the EU, Nigel Farage is stirring up hatred for the UK by telling MEP's that they've never had a proper job and that they are 'not laughing now' now that we have voted to Leave. Who put Farage in charge of dealing with the EU? UKIP is not even in power at the moment. They're not even a big party in the UK! We the undersigned want amicable discussions with the EU, lead by PM whilst still in power. Not someone who is looking to annoy our allies!",
        "background": "Whether you voted Leave or Remain, you will agree this is a delicate time for our economy and we must tread carefully to protect our economy and our interests. As you will have seen today, Nigel Farage is provoking MEP's and potentially damaging our relationship with European countries yet further.",
