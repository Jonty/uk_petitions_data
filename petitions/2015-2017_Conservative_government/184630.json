Results of the BBC Gardeners\u2019 World Magazine's annual wildlife survey show that 51% of people did not see a hedgehog at all in 2016, up from 48% in 2015. Just 12% saw a hedgehog regularly.  This poll\u2019s result is in line other recent polls by the People\u2019s Trust for Endangered Species and the RSPB.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.discoverwildlife.com/news/survey-results-reveal-sharp-decline-hedgehog-sightings",
        "background": "The Government do not believe it is appropriate to list hedgehogs as a protected species, which is best reserved for species deliberately killed or injured by humans. I had a hedgehog in my garden last summer - first in years.  Then found it in the back alley, stamped to death. They need protecting.",
