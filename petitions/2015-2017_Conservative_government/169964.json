The RSPCA has called for an \u201coutright ban\u201d on animals being used in circuses, due to it being unnatural and cruel.",
        "background": "This petition calls for a ban on the use of all animals in circuses in the UK, wild and domesticated. \r\n\r\nWhether it be the long journeys, brutal training regimes or constant confinement, animals have no place in the circus. It is archaic, extremely cruel, and has no place in the modern world.",
