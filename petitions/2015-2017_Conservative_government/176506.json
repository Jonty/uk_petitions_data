        "additional_details": "The WHO: \"Climate change is among the greatest health risks of the 21st century.\" Personal actions should be prioritised by relative impact. Former DECC Chief Scientific Advisor Sir David MacKay urged these steps, among others:\r\nStop (or dramatically reduce) flying\r\nReplace driving with public transport, cycling or walking\r\nReduce the energy needed to make products we buy (frequent new electronics & clothing, packaging)\r\nEat vegetarian 6/7 days\r\nTurn heating to 15-17 degrees\r\nIncrease home insulation.",
        "background": "Our collective CO2 emissions are just those of each individual added together: each of us can and must limit our carbon footprint. As well as strong legislative action, the government should contact every home to explain the reality and danger of climate change and advise what each of us should do.",
