        "action": "A referendum to accept or reject the T & C of the Brexit negotiation from the EU",
        "additional_details": "There is no clear idea what are the areas of real and genuine concern in leaving the EU. There will be many areas of conflicting negotiation. For example, there appears to be a deep concern over immigration, while on the other hand a strong desire to keep access to free trade is an imperative, two possibly irreconcilable objectives. Therefore, it is imperative for National cohesion and reconciliation that the Nation agrees on the leaving terms and conditions from the European Union.",
        "background": "There was a vast range of views as to why we should leave the EU. In the interest of National Unity, it is imperative that a majority in the UK are agreed on the terms and conditions of the UK\u2019s separation from the EU and, if the T&C are rejected the status que shall be maintained.",
