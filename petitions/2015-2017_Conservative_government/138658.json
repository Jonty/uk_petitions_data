        "action": "Call for Second Referendum on the UK's membership of the EU",
        "additional_details": "Ireland had a 2nd referendum in 2001 regarding the Treaty of Nice.  The decision to invoke Article 50 to end the UK's membership of the EU should be representative of what the majority of people in the UK currently think. The public now has a greater understanding of the realities of departure from the EU, free from political misinformation. It is therefore of utmost importance that a 2nd referendum is called before Article 50 is invoked, so the public can now vote based on clarity.",
        "background": "Since the EU referendum we have seen a substantial number of leave voters express regret based on misinformation received from the leave camp & unawareness of the true consequences of their decision. Ireland granted a 2nd referendum on an EU treaty in 2001. Many say they would now vote differently.",
