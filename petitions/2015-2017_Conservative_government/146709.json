        "additional_details": "The main barriers are now gone.  The UK is leaving the EU and able to set its own tariffs.  The UK is once again wealthy and a large importer, and India has a new government that is open to trade.  The UK has an imperative to create a replacement to the EU, and is in a humble position needing this to happen.\r\n\r\nIndia has a strategy of Make in India, with Africa, Australia and Canada exporting the natural resources that India needs to convert into goods. \r\n\r\nLondon can provide the required finance\r\n",
        "background": "Brexit, requires an alternative to the EU.  A Commonwealth Free Trade Zone would be better than the EU since 50% of the population of the Commonwealth are under 30 and the GDP is rapidly growing.\r\n\r\nThis would make 1/3 of the world richer, and benefit the entire world.",
