        "additional_details": "The women and children's unit was only opened 2 years ago and has already provided vital services to so many families around the borough.  If this unit was to close, pressure would be placed upon current users who would then have to travel to neighbouring services such as Shrewsbury and Stoke.  The A & E department is a vital, integral part of the community.  A closure would create an unacceptable risk to life due to pressures placed on an already busy Shrewsbury hospital and current paramedic crews.",
