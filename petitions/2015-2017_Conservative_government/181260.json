It clearly puts them at a disadvantage with other children and are capable of more than what their teachers claim them to be.",
        "background": "Mental Health research and the way to deal with it within school environments have recently been very poor. Mental health seems to be the major cause of bullying in schools while people suffer in silence and are too scared to tell anyone or explain how they feel.",
