They can use mediation but failing that they can apply for a child contact order through the courts. This costs \u00a3215 just to apply! They also require permission to do this from a family court, as well as court fees.\r\nwww.gov.uk/looking-after-children-divorce/types-of-court-order",
        "background": "The decision about how much contact a sibling can have is controlled by the parents.\r\nThere are no legal guidelines and the support available can be costly(see below).\r\nThis results in many negative relationships which drives families apart.",
