        "additional_details": "Most countries still have licences. \r\nHaving one makes the owner accountable for its dogs actions. \r\nIf your dog goes missing the chances of getting it back are greater. \r\nNo puppy can be bought without a licence including their vaccination details. \r\nGreater fines for owners without a licence.\r\nDNA records would be held for prosecution and identification purposes. \r\nBreeders can only sell dogs with a recognised licence and permit.\r\nService dogs would be free. \r\nElderly concession rates. ",
        "background": "Unfortunately back in 1987 when policing  issues were harder this law was Abolished. \r\nWith modern laws and regulations a new licence can be enforced. \r\nThis will aid in the reduction of Back Yard Breeding and the ever increasing over population of stray dogs in rescue centres accross the country.",
