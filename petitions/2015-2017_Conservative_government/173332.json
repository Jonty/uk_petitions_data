        "additional_details": "As we have put the decision makers in power they need to understand that without us they wouldn't be in power and also the reason they are in power is so that our voice can be heard. ",
        "background": "The reason for this petition is because we believe that the UK isn't allowing the enough number of refugees into the UK. Also we should be allowed to be part of the decision of allowing refugees in or not because at the end of the day it is the public who put decision makers in power. ",
