        "additional_details": "How can a fathers annual income determine how much a child costs to raise? Wether a father earns \u00a320000 a year or \u00a3100000 a year, the price to raise that child doesn't alter. It's his reward for succeeding in life. \r\nThe new CMS service takes a GROSS annual income into account. He never even sees that money. \r\nChildren should not be brought up with this culture. It's about family values and raising a child to the best of our abilities. Having a relationship with a child means much much more. ",
        "background": "Child maintenance payments are becoming more and more difficult for people to keep up with. Reform is needed, along with a maximum cap on calculations made. Not calculated by contact, but what it actually costs to raise a child. People exploit this service and the children are suffering. ",
