        "action": "Renegotiate a better deal with the EU before a 2nd referendum",
        "additional_details": "David Cameron negotiated the deal with the EU from a position of weakness, by declaring beforehand that he wanted to remain. The referendum result has resulted in a general acceptance within the EU that change is needed. Now that it is clear to Europe that we WILL leave under the present conditions, we should offer the EU a 2nd referendum IF AND ONLY IF a more acceptable deal, addressing voters key concerns over immigration, can be offered to the British Electorate.",
        "background": "The Government should return to the negotiating table with the EU to attempt to secure a better deal for the UK to remain, acceptable to the British public, which could then be offered to the British people in a 2nd referendum BEFORE Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty is invoked.",
