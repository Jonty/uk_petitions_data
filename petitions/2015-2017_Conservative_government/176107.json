        "additional_details": "An introduction of British Winter Time (BWT) as an alternative to BST would be helpful in winter such that: \r\n\r\n1. Decent daylight would be around 07:00 which is usually the time people are leaving for work. \r\n2. Sunset will be at approximately 16:30 instead of 15:30 nowadays. We can have more of daylight. \r\n\r\nWe already have too much daylight in summer and sunset during summer is at a time when people are going to sleep. Decreasing one hour from both sunrise and sunset wouldn't make much difference.",
        "background": "British Summer Time (BST) has been implemented since early 1900s. However, there is little benefit that can be gained. If instead of BST, we turn the clocks one hour forward in winter, we can benefit a lot from it. Particularly in those months when we need daylight i.e. October - February",
