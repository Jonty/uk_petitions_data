You lose three weeks worth of VEL and therefore money.\r\nThis cannot be justified. \r\nComputers can be programmed to accept any date to any date, giving a full 6 or 12 month cover, the same as you get with the MOT system. ",
        "background": "The MOT is for the full 12 months.\r\nInsurance companies provide a full 12 months cover.\r\nA car hire company has no trouble charging you for the correct period.  If you booked the car from the 21st of the month and they charged you from the 1st of the month. it would likely be a criminal offence.",
