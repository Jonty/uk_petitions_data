Patients being told that because they aren't suicidal that minute, they can't be seen because staff are too \"busy\", patients being refused medication, being told they don't have the \"correct\" symptoms, being told they are \"making it up\". \r\nIf the people you are supposed to turn to when we need help the most don't treat us with dignity and respect, what hope is there?

This has been exasperated by GPs, their staff and other healthcare providers being unprofessional, unsympathetic or even understanding of their patient. ",
