        "action": "Expand the Syrian refugee resettlement programme and increase aid.",
        "additional_details": "While several Middle-Eastern nations have taken in millions of Syrian refugees, as well European countries such as Germany taking in hundreds of thousands so far, the UK government has pledged to resettle only 20 000, by 2020.\r\n\r\nThe US president has signed an executive order to ban Syrian refugees indefinitely, which will likely result in civilian deaths that could be avoided. One of the best responses from the UK to show its opposition would be to increase its pledge and increase aid.",
        "background": "The government should increase its pledge to resettle 20 000 Syrian refugees by 2020 as well as increase aid to help millions affected by the crisis.",
