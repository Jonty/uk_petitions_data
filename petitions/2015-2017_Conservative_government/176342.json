        "additional_details": "This sets a very dangerous precedent, with the possibility that many people who do not own or are unable to get a passport or driving license are not able to exercise their democratic rights, voter registration laws have already been tightened and this signals a worrying first step toward an american style system wherein voter ID laws are passed simply to prevent certain demographics from voting, these plans need at least a public consultation or some sort of free photo ID to be provided",
        "background": "In wake of the recent tower hamlets scandal, the government is trialling plans for photo voter ID laws, which would undermine democracy and disenfranchise millions of voters",
