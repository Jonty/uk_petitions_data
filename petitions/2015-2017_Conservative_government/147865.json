        "action": "Keep the UK within the European Economic Area (EEA).",
        "additional_details": "Whether you voted leave or remain doesn't matter, this is the line that divides us and some are going to have to cross it if the UK is to move forward. I invite all no matter how you voted to support this motion. The single market is vital to our economy not the EU. It's highly likely that the UK would still be able to 'Veto' legislation from the European Union. The EEA would allow the free movement of goods, services and people with the added value of trade agreements with the rest of the world",
        "background": "The UK has voted to leave the European Union without any clear strategy on what to do next. The UK cannot go back on the vote or have a re-run, therefore efforts should be focused on the future. This ensures that the UK remains part of the single market while been able to forge new trade agreements.",
