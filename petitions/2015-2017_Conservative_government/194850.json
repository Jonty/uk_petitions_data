        "additional_details": "Issues with medical assessors plague the FND community when they fail to recognise the often debilitating, yet, potentially reversible condition; therefore, leaving sufferers without the support needed to live as healthy and independent life as possible. It is thought that the cost associated directly to the NHS is \u00a33.1b. Another \u00a318b is estimated to be lost due to indirect costs. We need your support to bring awareness, FND recognition in medical assessments and much needed funds for research.",
        "background": "Functional Neurological Disorder [FND] is the inability of the nervous system to send and/or receives signals from the body properly rather than disease, causing a variety of neurological symptoms.
