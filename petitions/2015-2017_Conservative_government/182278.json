Democracy is undermined when unsubstantiated and unverified statements on the views of the electorate are allowed to influence Government decisions.   Unless the Prime Minister has evidence to support her conclusion on the will of an overwhelming majority of people, her opening statement in the Brexit White Paper must be amended accordingly. ",
