        "background": "UK Businesses are grossly overcharged in business rates without bearing on the revenue they generate. Almost 4% of UK GDP is from these rates, verses 0.65% in the rest of Europe. UK businesses have to charge more to compensate, making them less competitive. Move to VAT would level the playing field.",
