        "additional_details": "Disabled people's organisations and charities are disappointed that the judgment does not give disabled people the absolute right to the wheelchair space. Disabled people campaigned and took action for decades for this space. It was not meant to be \"dual use\". Some non-disabled people refuse to leave it, preventing disabled people from travelling.\r\n\r\nMumsnet state that disabled people should have priority use of the\r\nspace, with separate provision for buggies. The Buses Bill could\r\nimplement this.",
        "background": "The Supreme Court judgment requires bus drivers do\r\nmore to make non-disabled people move from the wheelchair space if\r\nneeded by a disabled person, but many people still refuse. This prevents disabled people from travelling. Bus drivers are in an invidious position.",
