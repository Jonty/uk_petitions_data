        "action": "Stop UK Armed Forces on Operations from paying tax during their deployment.",
        "additional_details": "Contractors that have worked overseas in the same areas do not pay income tax if they live outside the UK for a set period. Our Armed Forces are reducing in size every year however the commitment remains high to deploy to various countries and spend more time away. By allowing our Armed Forces a tax break during the deployments would increase morale and reward those who make sacrifices for others every day.",
        "background": "Our Armed Forces are working harder every year with overseas commitments growing, and are still paying income tax during Operations. The United States Armed Forces do not pay tax when deployed. Reward those that risk their lives and spend time away from families. ",
