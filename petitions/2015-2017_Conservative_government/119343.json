        "additional_details": "Smokers have been torpedoed out onto the streets of Britain. Social lives ruined, the working mans club fading, pubs closing every day and Bingo Halls becoming less popular. We are living in a modern country and rather than encourage isolation, we should be encouraging the opposite. \r\nAmend the ban for, \r\nPubs\r\nClubs (Social, Working Mens)\r\nBingo Halls\r\nCafe's & Coffee Shops. \r\nWe are living in the 21st Century where technology is on the up, ventilation is the key. We need the return of smoking rooms, before it's too late!!",
        "background": "Since the 1st July 2007, smoking has been banned in all public places throughout the country. Devastating the social lives of millions. Pubs, Clubs, Bingo Halls and Cafe's have been hit hardest. Changing the law to allow separate smoking rooms would repair financial and social crises. ",
