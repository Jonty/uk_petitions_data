        "additional_details": "As qualified and experienced dance teachers we understand the importance of keeping our students safe but in many cases what is now required of a dance/performing arts school is excessive. We currently have 2540 signatures on our change.org petition. The law needs to be changed before we all stop putting on performances which will have an effect on local theatres and our businesses. Help us small business owners to put our students on stage and regulate the requirements across the country.  ",
        "background": "Many councils do not know what exactly is required in regards to the documentation to put on an amateur performance. These amateur performers do not get paid. We want the law simplified for Amateur performers to be able to perform for their families without all the ever changing regulations. \r\n\r\n",
