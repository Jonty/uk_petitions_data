        "additional_details": "A collection of Twitter posts and Facebook pictures circling Social media depicts witnesses who have experienced racial hatred or xenophobia themselves directly in relation to the EU referendum result. The leaders of Brexit MUST deal with this by bringing in harder punishments by law, as the campaign has provoked to some extent this hatred for anyone outside of the UK, regardless if they were born and raised in this country or not. If this continues it will damage the reputation of the UK. ",
        "background": "Since the UK voted in favour to leave the EU on June 23rd, there has been a tremendous rise in Racial hatred and xenophobia directly in relation to the result.
