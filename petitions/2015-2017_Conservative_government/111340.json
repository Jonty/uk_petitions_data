Here\u2019s the solution', published by The Guardian on 29/10/15. For further background, visit: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/29/manifesto-promise-broken-general-election-david-cameron-child-tax-credits",
        "background": "Political parties often campaign on the basis of false promises. We propose that failing to honour manifesto commitments should trigger a general election. This rule would go some way to restoring the electorate's faith in politicians, and enable more honest debate and informed choices.",
