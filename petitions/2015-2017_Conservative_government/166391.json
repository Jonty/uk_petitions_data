        "action": "Guarantee rights of UK Nationals resident in other EU states will not change.",
        "additional_details": "According to UN estimates 1.2 million UK Citizens have exercised their right as EU citizens to move permanently to other EU states. In many cases, if not most, entire lives are now in adoptive countries. Businesses have been opened, property has been purchased, children have been enrolled in local schools. Many such individuals were denied a voice in the Brexit vote due residency status abroad and / or errors of the electoral committee.",
        "background": "As a matter of urgency we call upon the UK government to unambiguously commit to guarantee any \u2018Brexit deal\u2019 will ensure all rights currently enjoyed by UK nationals resident in other EU states prior to the triggering of article 50 will remain unchanged.",
