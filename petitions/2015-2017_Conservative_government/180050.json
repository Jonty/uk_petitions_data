        "action": "Tougher and longer custodial sentences for those found guilty of animal abuse.",
        "additional_details": "There was a recent case of two people who starved their lurcher dog to death. They were found guilty, with no mitigating circumstances. The punishment was a ban from keeping animals, a \u00a3450 fine, 100 hours unpaid work and an 18 week suspended prison sentence. This is simply not good enough. To make an animal suffer for so long and deliberately starve it, is a disgusting act and deserves a considerable custodial sentence. Nothing less will deter others from committing such vile crimes.",
        "background": "Time and again we see examples of animal abuse prosecutions that lead to minimal punishment for extreme examples of unspeakable cruelty. Animals abused, leading to successful prosecution, but no prison sentence or a suspended sentence. This is not a deterrent and must change. ",
