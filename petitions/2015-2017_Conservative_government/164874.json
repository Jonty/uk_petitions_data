My book will be published in Feb 2017, I will be on ITV news Sept 2016 and a newspaper article will be written. I am excited to promote this condition in the hope women feel they can come forward and talk about their experiences.",
        "background": "I suffered Prenatal/Postnatal depression. When my son was four I was told I no longer had PND because PND clears within a year of a childs life. Six years on, through my own techniques I bonded with my son. Doctors hold no knowledge of the condition so I was left alone to over come my condition. ",
