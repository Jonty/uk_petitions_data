If the Royal Mail do decide to leave and sell off the building, then our Crown Post Office in the centre of Ossett will disappear.\r\nOssett is a market town and a town of this size needs its Crown Post Office and its Delivery Services to be in the town.",

Such a move would create hardship for many people, both customers and employees, as there will be no access via public transport.\r\n",
