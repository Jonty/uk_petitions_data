        "additional_details": "16/17 year old Scots could vote in the 2014 independence referendum, so there is a UK precedence that should have been followed. The response given to this petition (https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/119706) was unfair for that reason, and for the following, which underline some rights of 16/17 y.o, many of which are subject to EU law.\r\n\r\npay income tax/NI\r\nobtain tax credits/benefits \r\nget married/enter civil partnership\r\nbe a company director\r\njoin armed forces\r\nconsent to medical treatment\r\n",
        "background": "16 & 17 year olds can legally do many things. i.e., they have NI numbers and can work. Being directly impacted by EU law, their denial of a vote means the result was not inclusive. As such, the referendum should be re-run so that the eventual outcome is fully comprehensive of the entire UK opinion.",
