        "additional_details": "Human rights groups have confirmed that reports of an anti-gay purge in Chechnya are true, and it is taking place at this very moment in time. Initial reports have suggested that as many as 100 gay men have been detained by local authorities, and up to 3 men have already been killed. It all started after a Russian gay rights group applied for permits to stage gay pride parades in Russia\u2019s North Caucasus region, of which Chechnya is a part. Authorities are using social media to entrap the men. ",
        "background": "These terrifying reports of an anti-gay purge in Chechnya have shocked me to my core. I want to do something, anything, to try to help them. So I am asking that all UK party leaders contact Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, to condemn the purge and ask to release the men. ",
