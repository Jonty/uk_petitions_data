        "additional_details": "The percentage of care leavers in further and higher education is statistically lower than their peers. Being able to manage and complete their education may prove to be a struggle when leaving care.\r\nIn terms of child benefit entitlement, a \u2018qualifying young person\u2019 can be aged 18 and 19 in full-time education. This extends financial support to young people post-18. Care leavers should have their support extended to the same age as they are some of the most vulnerable people in society.",
        "background": "Care leavers aged 18 in full time education should be classed as 'eligible' or 'relevant' until the 31st August after their 18th Birthday, to be entitled to accommodation and maintenance. This ceases at 18, when they become 'former relevant'. It is unfair to have to study whilst setting up a home.\r\n",
