Then nothing to worry about. \r\n With an average of \u00a31000 a week the cameras will not event make a dent in profits. \r\nSign up now...You may be the next one to be treated badly in care.",

Then fit cameras in all care homes now, ideally connected to wifi so that relatives can look in at any time. Obviously beds and bathrooms need to be exempt but accessible by audio. \r\n",
