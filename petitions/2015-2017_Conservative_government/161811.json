        "action": "Remove Boris Johnson from the position of Foreign Secretary.",
        "additional_details": "The news is currently full of stories of Mr Johnson's insulting behaviour towards others. His comments about the Turkish leader are sufficient alone to ask him to step down from public office.\r\nIn his first address at the French Embassy Mr Johnson was booed by the audience.\r\nThe UK needs a Foreign Office Minister who has the intelligence, forethought and sensitivity to guide the UK through what will be difficult times. Mr Johnson is not the role model for this post.",
        "background": "In the light of Mr Johnson's appalling behaviour towards foreign nationals including Heads of State he is not a suitable candidate for the role. In addition his lack of leadership following the EU referendum decision, shows he is not capable of publicly steering difficult situations.",
