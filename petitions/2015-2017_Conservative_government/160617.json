The UK parliament is about to make a historic change to this relationship with our European neighbours and I am concerned there was some misleading campaigning on both sides of the debate and people have expressed a wish to change their vote either way. A register should be taken of these people in order to validate the official result.",

The Referendum result was close and many have spoken on television to say they have changed their minds. I would like an official register of those who wish to change their votes.",
