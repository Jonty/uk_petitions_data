However, local transport authorities (usually local councils) have the power to set maximum fares in some circumstances.\r\n\r\nIf you would like bus fares in your local area to be lower, you could raise this with your local council. You can find out who your local councillor is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\r\nIn order for the UK Government to be able to take action on bus fares directly, Parliament would first need to change the law to give it the power to do this. For example, you could start a petition asking for bus services to be nationalised and fares set at a lower level than they are at the moment. \r\n"
