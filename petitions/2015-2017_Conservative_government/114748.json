        "additional_details": "Only a few years ago the local council recognised that schools required safer crossings as a result of several incidents being reported. Now it seems they have forgotten the reason they employed lollipop men and women in the first place. We cannot rely on young children to have good road sense and we certainly cannot rely on drivers to give way at schools. A lollipop man or woman in highly reflective clothing with a stop sign has authority on the road, drivers will see them and stop.",
        "background": "The council hopes to save \u00a3171,000 by cutting the funding for the crossing patrols. The final decision will not be made until February 2016 but we can\u2019t sit back and allow this to happen. The lollipop men and women are essential to improve the safety of our children while walking to and from school ",
