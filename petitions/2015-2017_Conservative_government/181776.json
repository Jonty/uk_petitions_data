        "additional_details": "It could be argued that if these groups were fully represented in the referendum, an extra 4 million votes would likely have swung the result to remain in the EU. Considering this and the fact that with the UK out of the EU, at least 4 million people face an uncertain and troubled future that they had no say in, the results of the Brexit Referendum should be declared invalid.\r\n\r\nFurther reading: http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/01/31/the-brexit-referendum-was-a-violation-of-human-rights/",
        "background": "We call on Parliament to review whether the Brexit referendum is actually \"The Will of the People\" and even whether it is a violation of human rights as it excluded a number of people who will be most affected:\r\n - British citizens living in the EU\r\n - EU citizens living and paying taxes in the UK\r\n",
