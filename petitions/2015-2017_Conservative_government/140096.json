        "additional_details": "We elected members of parliament to make decisions on our behalf, using their knowledge and expertise to make choices that most of the public would be unable to do without clear guidance, education or understanding of the implications.\r\n\r\nAt minimum, we call on members of parliament to agree a deal to sign the UK up to a Norway style relationship with the EU, that would bring full access to the single market on the same terms as now, in exchange for Britain accepting continued freedom of movement.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call on HM Government to put the question of whether we remain in the European Union to a parliamentary debate before making a final decision. The referendum is not legally binding and therefore should only be used as an indicator of the general public's opinion.",
