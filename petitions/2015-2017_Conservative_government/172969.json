        "action": "Change the rules give children detained by police at school access to legal aid",
        "additional_details": "In the light of police action to pre-plan with local authorities to detain an innocent 12 old child at school, the consequences of the event and negative impact to the child\u2019s future education and misuse of data which may affect the child\u2019s future, the system needs to change. Currently there is no protection for innocent children, due to the unfair system the public authorities\u2019 access public money to engage legal experts to defend their actions. Children\u2019s rights matter, legal aid is required.",
        "background": "Call for change to access legal aid so children can get justice against the actions of the police working in co-ordination with local authorities to secretly wrongfully detain innocent children at school, revoking their rights & right to their parents and misusing their data without any wrongdoing.",
