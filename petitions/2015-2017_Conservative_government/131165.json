        "additional_details": "At present, Young drivers are being extorted off the road with ridiculous insurance premiums that are in cases even higher than their car's value. The fact that insurers have the law on their side requiring that anyone who owns a vehicle must have a policy in place, sees them get away with extortion. Something must be done to ensure that premiums are kept fair and reasonable as a \u00a32000 premium for a \u00a3300 corsa is unacceptable.",
        "background": "We the undersigned, hereby demand that our government limit the amount which an insurer can charge for car insurance as currently, more an more people are waiting to start driving until a later date which is driving up insurance premiums for other age groups.",
