        "additional_details": "Small businesses do not make regular profit or have regular working hours, or can not be run on a larger scale commercial basis due to the need to keep overheads low. There is a definite gulf between the small, artisan or freelancer, and a larger commercially run business, such as a shop. In order for the lone worker to survive tax credits can be a vital resource to keep them afloat. A lone worker may also not be able to produce the proof necessary to back up their business. Relax the criteria. ",
        "background": "Changes to the eligibility for working tax credits for the self-employed will have a devastating effect for the artisan, freelancer, sole trader, cottage industry and other very small, lesser commercial business for whom working tax credits are vital to survival. ",
