        "additional_details": "I believe that gender equality should be across the board, Employers should no longer favour a certain sex in ANY circumstance, we have addressed the fact that women used to get paid less than men, or that women couldn't do certain rolls, we've now also allowed men to share parental leave when they have a child, so surely they should be entitled to earn the same for doing so. Giving fathers less pay for looking after their new born child is sexual discrimination and needs addressing.",
        "background": "To aid gender equality the government recently allowed maternity leave to be shared by the Father this is called Shared Parental Leave. However recently when I took SPL to look after our son while my partner worked I found that my employer paid me the government minimum, whilst paying Mothers more.",
