This will affect those British citizens whose place of birth is one of those listed countries (e.g. high visa cost, length visa processing, potential of being treated differently by officials once in the US, etc.) \r\nhttps://uk.usembassy.gov/visas/visa-waiver-pro",
        "background": "Following recent US/Trump policy to ban Muslims/individuals, many British citizens will be affected adversely due to their place of birth as they face various complications. This is a violation of human rights & an act of discrimination when 2 citizens of same country are treated differently.",
