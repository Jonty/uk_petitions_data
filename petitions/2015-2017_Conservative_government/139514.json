        "additional_details": "There was a clear trend on the recent referendum, the older you were, the more likely you were to vote leave. If 16 year olds were given the vote they would have inevitably changed the once divided outcome.",
        "background": "At the age of 16 you are regarded as responsible and competent. It is completely unjust that those who were 16 to 18 were not given the vote on the recent EU referendum as it will inevitably affect their lives more than most. So the younger generation must of course have a say on their future!",
