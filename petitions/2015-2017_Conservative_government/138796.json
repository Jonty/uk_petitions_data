        "action": "Form a cross-party government to serve in the wake of Brexit",
        "additional_details": "It seems wrong that only one party should rule at such a crucial time, especially as the elected leader of that party has announced his resignation. \r\n\r\nDuring other critical moments in history, such as during wartime or the Great Depression, a cross-party government has been formed in the interests of the country. \r\n\r\nThough we are not necessarily in such a dire situation, our actions now may have serious consequences not only for Britain, but for the rest of the world. \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Britain's decision to leave the European Union is one that will undoubtedly cause great change within Britain and across the world. In light of this momentous decision, it seems fitting that a cross-party government is formed as Britain redefines and negotiates the place it has in the world. ",
