        "additional_details": "Sweden gives fathers upto 12 weeks paternity leave with 80% of fathers full pay for the entire time.\r\n\r\nNorway gives fathers 2 weeks paternity on full pay plus upto an additional 14 weeks on 80%-100% of their pay.\r\n\r\nWe are behind a lot of developed countries when it comes to fathers rights and fully paid paternity leave.",
        "background": "During a time when the mother and newborn need the father around most, we seem to think its okay to dramatically  reduce a fathers pay and to send him back to full time work just 2 weeks after the baby is born - often when the mother has not fully recovered! A newborn needs both parents around!",
