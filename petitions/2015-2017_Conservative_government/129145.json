        "additional_details": "An independently produced booklet, perhaps no bigger the governments already produced booklet on why we should vote to stay, can be quickly produced to present first the facts as they stand and then the general expert views on what are the implications for the country if we vote to stay and if we vote to go.\r\nWithout giving voters a proper opportunity to assess both the facts and the body of opinion for both options in order to make their informed choice, we undermine democracy itself.",
        "background": "The EU Referendum is producing a blizzard of numbers, claims, guesses - it is virtually impossible for voters to assess properly the facts as they stand, or to get a balanced set of forecasts on the implications of either result. Without this information, the public cannot be asked to make a choice.",
