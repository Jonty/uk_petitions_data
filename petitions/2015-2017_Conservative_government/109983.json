        "action": "To end the National Minimum Wage brackets based on age.",
        "additional_details": "The government argues that young people are disproportionately unemployed and it is 'justifiable' to pay them less to encourage employers to employ young people. The Equality Act 2010 allows this however it also states it is illegal to pay women or ethnic minorities a lower wage under any circumstances, even to encourage their employment if they are disproportionately unemployed. This highlights the hypocrisy of different wage brackets based on age. Why is it acceptable for age but not sex?",
        "background": "The National Minimum Wage (NMW) has different wage brackets based on age. \u00a33.87ph - under 18s, \u00a35.30 ph - 18-20, \u00a36.70 ph - Over 21s and from April 2016 \u00a37.20ph - over 25s. This petition holds it is ageist to pay different wages simply based on age when people do the same job.",
