        "additional_details": "Some aspects of the ambulance service have been privatised as have some 'back office' functions. This latest contract being imposed on doctors is another way of taking control and imposing change on an already struggling NHS service. In order to show the governments committed to supporting and ensuring the continuation of the NHS they need to confirm what to date they have failed to do. That the NHS is a vital public service that WILL NOT ever be privatised but will instead be protected against it. ",
        "background": "With the increasing persistent demand that Junior Doctors adopt a new contract that is not viable and will endanger patients health and the slow privatisation of some parts of the NHS. The government need to publically and on formal record confirm they have no intention to fully privatise the NHS. ",
