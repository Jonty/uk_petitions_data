        "additional_details": "The triple lock guarantees that the basic state pension will rise by whichever is the highest out of average earnings, inflation or 2.5 per cent. The Government Actuary\u2019s Department published a report in October 2015, which showed the country spending \u00a36bn more protecting pensioners income due to this policy, and spending spiraling up at the expense of the rest of society.",
        "background": "The pensions triple lock is an unaffordable electoral bribe that will mean an ever greater share of the nation's wealth will go to the retired and more debt for those under retirement age.  It should be scrapped for the benefit of the whole nation.",
