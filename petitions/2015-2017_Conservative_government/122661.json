        "additional_details": "Every child has rights which must be recognised.  Currently the police, social services and schools are removing these rights by detaining innocent children at school who are unaware of their rights and unwilling participants.  In cases of secretive detention at school children are denied the right to have their parents or legal representative present. They are interrogated by people they do not know with no reason given or independent witness. Schools should not be turned into detention centres",
        "background": "Children are at risk of being secretly detained and subjected to interrogation in isolation at School, yet the Government allow Police, Social Services and Schools to misinterpret the existing laws to detain innocent children who have not done anything wrong at school nor committed any office/crime.",
