        "additional_details": "Following the referendum on EU membership it has become clear that neither the current government nor the Leave campaign had any clear plan of action following a Leave result. This unpreparedness has clearly had a massive negative impact on both the country and the economy.\r\n\r\nThe Leave vote was in no small part a protest against rule by unelected officials. We reject the idea that the next Prime Minister could be chosen by an elite few without a fresh mandate from the people.",
        "background": "We the people declare that we have no confidence in either the current government, or its opposition parties. We request a motion of no confidence be debated in the House. If it passes then a general election must be called. This must take place prior to the invocation of Article 50.",
