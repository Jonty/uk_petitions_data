I can cite evidence if required that this has been a topic of much discussion in the UK over many years, although crucially, not recently.\r\nMost pointedly note that the UK Labour Party commitment to votes for 16 year olds in 2015.\r\nThe Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey all lowered their voting age to 16 by 2007.",

The UK Labour Party pledged to support votes for 16 year olds if they won the 2015 general election.\r\n ",
