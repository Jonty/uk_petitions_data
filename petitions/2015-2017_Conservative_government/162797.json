        "additional_details": "CAMHS stands for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, and this is where children and teenagers up to the age of 18 get support and therapy for their mental illnesses. \r\nThere are NO specialist eating disorder services within the whole county; the closest being Middlesborough, which I am currently staying as an inpatient with severe Anorexia Nervosa for the second time due to the immense lack of support and understanding in Cumbria. This is a 2 and a half hour journey. \r\nThis is not fair.",
        "background": "There is a huge lack of resources and staff within Cumbria CAMHS, having just one dietitician in the entire county. The team regularly allows patients suffering from eating disorders to get so severe they require inpatient treatment hundreds of miles away.There are no specialists and a lack of care.",
