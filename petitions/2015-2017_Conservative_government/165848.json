        "additional_details": "The scanners are relatively cheap (\u00a340) and all councils have them already to scan the stray dogs, since they are obliged to do that.\r\n\r\nThe change in law will be easy and inexpensive to implement. \r\nIt will also save a lot of pet owners from the pain of not knowing what happened to their beloved pets. ",
        "background": "Most people assume their cat would be scanned if found dead and collected by the council, and that they would be informed, but this is simply not the case. \r\n\r\nWhen a cat gets killed in a traffic accident, the councils have no legal obligation to scan for a microchip. This need to change.",
