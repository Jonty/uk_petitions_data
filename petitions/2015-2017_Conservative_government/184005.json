        "additional_details": "Performing Arts College courses last 3 years, the same as Universities. At 18 Careers Loan is available. However, this loan is only available for 2 years and once you have finished your training you need to start paying it back immediately. This isn't ideal for a new graduate who is trying to save as much money as they can to start their career. By having the student loan it can help throughout the whole 3 year course and gives the graduate time to start their career before paying it back.",
        "background": "If you've chosen to go to University or Performing Arts College to study a Degree you are able to get a Student Loan. However, if you study a Diploma you are not able to gain a Student Loan however the prices are the same. Performers are struggling or not able to train due to no available funds. ",
