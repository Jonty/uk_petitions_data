However, the pooling scheme assets announced at the July 2015 Budget will improve their capacity to invest in infrastructure, as well as achieving significant cost savings, while maintaining returns. \r\n \r\nWe have recently consulted on proposals to grant the Secretary of State a power of intervention which would further protect members\u2019 and taxpayers\u2019 interests. We expect that the power to intervene would be used exceptionally when there was clear evidence that a pension fund authority was not acting reasonably and lawfully, The Government is currently considering the responses to the consultation. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Communities and Local Government",
