        "action": "Get the M.o.D. to agree to a last minute bid to purchase the ex-HMS Illustrious",
        "additional_details": "The funds necessary to cover all aspects of the purchase are in place, thus all that is required is for the M.o.D. to agree, and this iconic ship - the last surviving Invincible Class Aircraft Carrier, can be secured as an asset for the nation, for present and future generations to visit. Despite having received several high value heritage bids, the MoD instead agreed a much lower value scrap deal, clearly not the best financial option for the taxpayer. She is still en route under tow to Turkey.",
        "background": "There is a new consortium currently negotiating with the M.o.D. with respect to purchasing the ex-Royal Navy Aircraft Carrier HMS Illustrious, which if allowed to proceed, would save her from the scrapyard and instead see her preserved as a heritage attraction for the UK.",
