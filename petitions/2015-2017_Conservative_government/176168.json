        "additional_details": "Being too ill to leave the house means that he cant do simple things like shopping. Carers currently have to pay their own way. I also care for an elderly gentleman, yet i need to pay my way to and from. \r\nSomething should be in place to help carers with free or even discounted travel, as without a carer, who would these people have? I pay more on travel expenses than what i get for carers allowance. it is unjust and has no sense to it.\r\nWe, the carers, also need the help.",
        "background": "Currently, as it stands only the disabled and elderly are entitled to a travel pass or similar. It is only right that carers be treated the same way. My husband suffers from many illnesses and currently, he is the only one that can get the free travel.. BUT.. He is too ill to leave the house.",
