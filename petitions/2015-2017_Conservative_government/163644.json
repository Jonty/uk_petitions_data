        "additional_details": "A stable high-quality early childhood education and care system should be regarded as part of the infrastructure for the country's long-term economic and social development. What it requires is that government takes the longer view rather than a horizon that stretches only to the next election.",
        "background": "A National Childcare Service (NCS) offering free universal childcare to all children from one to fourteen. The NCS would be funded through general taxation. Free universal childcare scares many. It will have a high cost in a time of austerity however the return will more than justify the outlay.  ",
