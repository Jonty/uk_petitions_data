        "additional_details": "There have been a number of attempts to ensure our political sovereignty is respected, and these have all largely been undermined. This is not an attempt to subvert the will of the British people, this is an attempt to ensure the British people have the final say, and that the Westminster Elite are not allowed to run roughshod over the rights of the silent majority. If we don't get the best possible deal for all of us, then we should have the right to turn it down before we crash out of the EU. ",
