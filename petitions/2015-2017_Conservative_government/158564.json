        "additional_details": "deafness is hardest on children. Deaf children struggle with communicating far longer than hearing children, as they must be taught sign language and the ability to read lips. They often can feel secluded and lost. Most small children go through stranger anxiety phases. Imagine the fear of a deaf toddler who, while riding in a stroller, is approached by an admiring stranger. Imagine if all children could sign to this deaf child, how amazing would that child feel? ",
        "background": "Deafness is not recognised enough, especially not enough that it's not taught as a language in schools when there's a huge percentage of people in the U.K. That are deaf! Schools should teach this even if it's an additional subject just like learning French or German in schools! ",
