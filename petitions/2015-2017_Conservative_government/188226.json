        "additional_details": "Whilst Daily Politics, This Week and Question Time are fairly balanced the major News programmes (i.e. six o clock and ten o clock news) are consistently reporting with a strong anti Brexit bias.",
        "background": "Whenever an opportunity arises the BBC reporting on almost any significant economic or social event happening in the UK, or indeed abroad, is delivered with a negative slant against Brexit. This is resulting in the BBC trying to influence the news rather than fairly reporting it.",
