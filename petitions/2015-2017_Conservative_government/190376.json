There should be a referendum in each constituency of England (and Wales) to ascertain whether the majority of the residents identify as Scottish.",
        "background": "The border with Scotland has moved north and south over the centuries, but since the Act of Union of 1707 in it has been largely arbitrary. Indeed Berwick on Tweed has passed over the border on a number of occasions. ",
