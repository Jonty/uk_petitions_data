I feel like success at school is based on how well you remember facts and statistics that you are given in lessons. Why are our lives determined by a set of criteria created by an exam board? Why are we trusted to revise, learn and take our exams when we aren\u2019t trusted to vote for the people who make these decisions? Why does our future come down to a piece of paper that we receive after we do our exams? Why are we put under this massive amount of pressure to do well at the start of our lives?",
        "background": "The pressure of succeeding is too much, children all over the UK like myself are becoming depressed and their mental health is being damaged by the education system, it is no longer education but an initiation system, the education system is flawed. We need change. ",
