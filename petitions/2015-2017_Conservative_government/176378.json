        "additional_details": "The 1995 Conservative Government\u2019s Pension Act included plans to increase women\u2019s SPA to 65, the same as men\u2019s. Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI), agree with equalisation, but don\u2019t agree with the unfair way the changes were implemented \u2013 with little/no personal notice (1995/2011 Pension Acts), faster than promised (2011 Pension Act), and no time to make alternative plans. While my generation will not receive an SPA until we are 68, let us first support our parents and grandparents.",
        "background": "The Government must restore fairness to the women born after 6 April 1951 who have been unfairly affected by the increase of the State Pension Age. Thousands of women are affected. My mother, born in 1954, won't receive hers until she is 65. Her friend, born in 1953 already receives hers.",
