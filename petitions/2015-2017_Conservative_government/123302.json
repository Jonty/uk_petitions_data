        "additional_details": "The UK could be on the forefront of combating this through the introduction of a compulsory course that teaches students how to treat and perceive animals both wild and in our care. Education could take place both in and out of the classroom. Trips to sanctuaries, farms and zoos could be supplemented by an educational talk, allowing the students to see the animals first hand along side learning about their care and how to maintain their welfare.",
        "background": "Animal abuse cases have been on the rise, increasing by over 6,000 in 2014 and potentially more in 2015. Education could be a key factor to preventing the pattern from continuing into the future; reducing animal suffering and also giving future generations an understanding of animal care.\r\n\r\n",
