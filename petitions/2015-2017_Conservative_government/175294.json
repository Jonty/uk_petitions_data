        "action": "End of TV License Raj and government should sponsor news and radio through tax",
        "additional_details": "It is time when government should review taxing TV viewers which is a basic necessity of life. UK has one of the highest taxation rates and still we pay even to watch news which should be a basic right. Even developing countries with lower tax provide license free viewing. TV shows by BBC should be funded from advertisements or making them optional paid channels so viewers have a discretion. We already pay for private channels and license cost on top for entertainment should cease to exist.",
        "background": "Government should waive off TV license charges of \u00a3145.50. Viewers already pay huge sums in the form of Tax and NI and should be entitled to TV at no extra costs. We shouldn't be forced to pay for hefty salaries of casts on BBC which should be funded from adverts. Private channels are already paid.",
