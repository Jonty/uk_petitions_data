        "additional_details": "I have calculated \u00a32.6b a year by using the simple calculation of approx 50m adults (over 16) in UK x \u00a31 = \u00a350m x 52 wks = \u00a32.600.000.000. 16 would be the starting age if not in education. For this to work I believe everyone needs to contribute. It would be easy to start excluding people because of age and income etc but this would put a greater financial burden on fewer people who would resist the charges. The NHS is freely available to all, so a small weekly contribution of \u00a31 seems fair.",
        "background": "I propose an idea to help fund our beloved NHS and Care Services  before they collapse under the pressure. A compulsory contribution of \u00a31pw from all adults, controversially regardless of age and income. This would raise around 2.6b a year.",
