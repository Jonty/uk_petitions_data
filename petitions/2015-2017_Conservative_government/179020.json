        "additional_details": "We British people must send a message that his appalling behaviour and divisive political scheming is not acceptable in any way, shape or form to the British public. Throughout his presidential campaign he encouraged violence against individuals with different beliefs to himself. This racial profiling and promotion of hatred of others different from yourself is against fundamental British values of defending those who cannot defend themselves.",
        "background": "US president Donald Trump has promoted the spread of racial hatred with his order to ban Muslims from countries where his company does not trade already from entering the USA.  We propose the UK imposes financial sanctions upon Donald Trump, his company, key supporters, VP Mike Pence, and cabinet. ",
