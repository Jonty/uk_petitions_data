        "additional_details": "We want an independent body to hold politicians to account.  This body should have the power to impose personal sanctions for misleading statements. These sanctions should be unlimited fines and imprisonment as can currently be imposed by Trading Standards on members of the public.  The punishment should reflect the scale and impact of the misleading statement.  ",
        "background": "Politicians supporting the \"Leave\" and \"Remain\" EU campaigns are now backing down from their campaign claims and promises, with no punishment. A member of the public providing misleading sales information would be subjected to fines/imprisonment. We want politicians to be subject to the same rules. ",
