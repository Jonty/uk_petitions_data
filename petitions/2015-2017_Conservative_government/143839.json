        "action": "Negotiate and hold a new referendum on moving from EU membership into the EEA.",
        "additional_details": "The EEA is the European Economic Area. It includes the EU countries and Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. It allows them to be part of the EU\u2019s single market.\r\nYoung people, who voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU, need hope. 16 and 17-year-olds should have the right to vote in the second referendum.\r\nIreland created strong and democratic precedent for a second EU referendum. Their 2008 referendum rejected the Lisbon Treaty. The government then renegotiated, and a second referendum passed it.",
        "background": "The recent EU referendum has divided the country and caused chaos. To restore stability we propose that HM Government begins immediate and rapid negotiations on the terms of the UK\u2019s possible transition to the EEA, and then holds a second referendum offering three choices: EEA, EU or neither.",
