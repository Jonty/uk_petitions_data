        "action": "Keep the E-Bluey link in the UK military!",
        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition to help keep the ebluey link going. There are still people serving on the front line, and the morale a simple letter can bring is so important. Yes, we now have smart phones etc, but the destinations intended for eblueys aren't destinations you would always want to use your phone. The morale of a simple letter from home isn't to be underestimated.",
        "background": "It has been announced that e-blueys are going to be cut on March 31st as a money saving scheme. Military children and families love writing to their parents serving abroad, the people that have decided to cut this service have no idea how much it means to receive the letters when we are away.",
