        "action": "Direct all companies, to only use packaging materials which are easily recycled.",
        "additional_details": "Most of the country is readily recycling waste materials when able to do so. Unfortunately, council  A. often recycles different types of waste materials to council B. In particular plastic packaging. \r\n\r\nAlmost every council recycles, or should recycle plastic milk bottles and clear plastic bottles. All of which are readily recycled into new products.\r\n\r\nMy argument is, ALL plastic packaging should be made from these types of plastic. \r\n\r\nWere all meat, yoghurt, iced-cream and ready meals etc packed in the most commonly recycled plastics, there would be less confusion, fewer reasons not to recycle, less plastic going to landfill, less energy and resources wasted.\r\n\r\nTo re-iterate, manufacturers packaging materials should be standardised to use the most readily recyclable materials.",
        "background": "This petition is intended as a direct attack on waste of both materials and energy and reduce landfill. ",
