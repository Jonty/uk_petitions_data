        "action": "Make GCSE Food Technology compulsory",
        "additional_details": "The number of children taking Food Technology at GCSE is dropping. Too many kids nowadays are growing up not knowing how about food, with around 2 million children growing up with just one parent-it is questionable that mums and dads just don't have the time to teach their children how to cook/bake. The Department of Education quite clearly is TOO focused on wanting the children of the future to grow up to become more academic.",
        "background": "Im a food lover and blogger and I want to make a change. I have loved food ever since I watched a Jamie Oliver christmas special back in 2006. My love for food and specifically helping younger people have grown over the years and now I want to kick up a fuss and make GCSE Food Technology compulsory",
