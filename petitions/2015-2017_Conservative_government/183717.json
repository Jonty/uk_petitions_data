        "additional_details": "Disabled people are made to feel like criminals during & following the reviews. They're made to apply for this benefit in a totally bias and unfair way on a claim form which asks 10 questions towards daily living but only 2 on mobility, which is the main purpose for disabled people applying for this benefit, in the first place. Maybe, if there must be 12 questions, a balance of 6 for daily living & 6 for mobility would be fairer & maybe provide a better view of a individuals needs?",
        "background": "The current review system is bias & unfair against disabled people who rely highly on access to places that abled people enjoy on a daily basis.",
