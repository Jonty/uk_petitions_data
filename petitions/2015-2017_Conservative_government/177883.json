        "action": "Provide funding for organisations to train psychological support dogs.",
        "additional_details": "I can't even begin to reference the studies carried out on the effects animals have on human health and well-being as there is so much. Studies show that animals can reduce heart rates, blood pressure and cortisol levels (stress) of humans with their presence alone. Imagine what a support dog could do for someone who struggles to leave the house due to mental illness? Having a pet helps, but with pets you are limited on where you can take them. Support dogs could help in these situations.",
        "background": "There is extensive research on the positive effects dogs and other animals have on the mental well-being of humans. Providing support dogs could help people with mental illness carry out activities otherwise limited by their mental illness. It could greatly help in cases of depression or anxiety.",
