Rescue centres are overwhelmed and it is our responsibility to change this trend.\r\n102,363 stray and abandoned dogs were handled  by Local Authorities between 2014-2015, and in 2015 the RSPCA alone rescued almost 119,000 animals",
        "background": "We believe preventing breeding domestic animals for monetary gain will decrease the number of animals living in cages instead of homes. We are calling for a strategy in conjunction with organisations working for animals to reduce the number of homeless animals in the UK by deterring breeding.",
