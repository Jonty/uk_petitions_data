        "additional_details": "We realise that as much attention to security will be given as possible in terms of protecting the hardware and the software protecting this data. This does not mean however that a compromise is not possible and attention needs to be given to what will happen in the event of a compromise and what aid can be given to victims. The framework for this aid should be discussed and a framework formalised in advance so that it is clear to each citizen what help and redress they may seek.",
        "background": "The Investigatory Powers Bill requires the creation of huge datasets of citizens online activity. These datasets will be a very tempting target for criminals. The Government should create a legal aid framework that will help any victims in the case of these datasets being compromised.",
