",
        "background": "The practice of Halal slaughter of animals is unjust and unnecessary as more humane methods are available. It causes pain and distress to the animals and must be stopped in the United Kingdom. Is it fair to promote groups such as the RSPCA to prevent animal cruelty when abattoirs nationwide do this?",
