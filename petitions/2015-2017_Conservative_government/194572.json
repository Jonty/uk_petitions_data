        "additional_details": "The British government has done nothing to help syria so the least it can do is provide full coverage of the oppression and crisis in syria caused by assads cruel regime. It's the least Britain can do after causing the death of Palestine. You don't have to be muslim to help syria you just have to be human. Children as young as newborns are subjet to assads killings and yet nobody knows of this. Why? Because western media has a habit of turning a blind eye when it comes to muslims being murdered.",
        "background": "Why is it that when something happens in western countries it is all over the news all across the world, but as soon as something happens in a eastern country everyone turns their back. The syrian people are under attack like no other. Assads cruel regime backed by Russia needs to be exposed. ",
