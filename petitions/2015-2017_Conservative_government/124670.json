        "additional_details": "https://community.avaaz.org/petitions/save-the-violet-melchett-health-centre-in-chelsea-1 \r\n\r\nChelsea may soon be losing its last remaining family planning clinic in plans being drawn up by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) and the NHS, residents and staff have reported. This is despite sexual health diagnoses running at a three year high.\r\n\r\nIf plans to relocate the Violet Melchett family planning clinic are executed, Chelsea will be left without a dedicated primary family planning clinic.",
        "background": "Not only is it for family planning, the fantastic team also specialises in women's health and have helped me personally on numerous occasions with same day appointments, when I wasn't able to get an appointment with my GP. It would be a great loss to the Chelsea community if this centre closes. ",
