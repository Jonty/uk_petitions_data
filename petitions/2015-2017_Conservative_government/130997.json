        "additional_details": "Stamp duty was paid when the house was originally purchased so how can you pay this again when you are not moving?\r\nWhy does the rule not apply if you were to sell the property?\r\nWhy does being married mean you are exempt?\r\nThe revenue state this is because you are increasing your share of property you own?\r\nSurely the additional stamp duty should only be on the increase in market value/equity of the property over and above what you originally paid?",
        "background": "If you cohabit and separate and want to transfer the main residence to your sole name you have to pay 3% stamp duty on your equity share coupled with your portion of any remaining mortgage when you own a second property.  This law does not apply if you are married so discriminates people cohabiting.",
