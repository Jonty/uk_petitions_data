By reaching 100k signatures this issue will be considered for debate in parliament and hopefully more funds can be put into helping individuals get the help they need before it's critical. ",
        "background": "After waiting for months to be referred to any kind of mental health service as I wasn't 'critical enough', my weight had dropped to less than 5 stone and my depression was at an all time low. I want all suffers of mental health problems to be seen by services before they reach a critical point.",
