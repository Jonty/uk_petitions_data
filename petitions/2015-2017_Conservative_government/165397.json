        "additional_details": "Due to lack of mental health beds, and NICE guidelines stipulating special requirements for the treatment of eating disorders, some patients are being told they are \"too complex\" to receive treatment at the present time, even though they are willing to recover in an inpatient setting. Due to the guidelines and shortage of beds, those with eating disorders are slipping through the cracks of the system, and this is allowing for needless deaths that could have been prevented. ",

However, for a number of people who suffer and want to recover, particularly those who need admitting as an inpatient, some are told they are \"too complex\" for treatment. ",
