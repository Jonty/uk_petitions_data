Prominent proponents of the campaign to leave vastly overstated the number of laws which originate in Brussels and many also reported the number of times the UK's position had not prevailed in European Council decisions without recognising that this was many times fewer than the number of times decisions aligned with UK's.",
        "background": "Both sides on the debate in the EU Referendum made a number of assertions that were misleading, inaccurate or deceptive. In some cases, the electorate was deliberately deceived by campaign teams who received significant amounts of public money, which deserves investigation.",
