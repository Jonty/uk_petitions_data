        "action": "Article 50 should not be invoked until terms of EU exit are agreed in principle",
        "additional_details": "A second referendum is appropriate because the terms of EU withdrawal and the UK's relationship with the EU following withdrawal were unknown at the time of the first referendum. Parliament must respect the result of the first referendum, but has an obligation to the people of the UK to ensure that our withdrawal takes place only with the electorate having a full understanding of the consequences and having agreed to those consequences in a second referendum.",
        "background": "The UK's negotiating position for EU withdrawal will be significantly weakened due to the 2 year fixed timescale following the invocation of Article 50, so Article 50 should not be invoked until the outline terms are agreed in principle and put to the electorate in a second referendum.",
