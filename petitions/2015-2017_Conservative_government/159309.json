        "additional_details": "The Conservative Party's response to the EU referendum result is appalling. The Conservative - LibDem coalition was a much better government. The Chilcot enquiry makes it obvious that Tony Blair's mandate was far too strong. Whether or not you agree with them, some UKIP policies are genuinely important to many people in Britain. It now seems very wrong that Nigel Farage was their only real voice for so long.",
        "background": "The EU referendum has shown both Leavers and Remainers what happens when every vote counts. There is no reason that every vote shouldn't count in every election. A look back through recent governments makes it clear that first-past-the-post serves only the \"Westminster elite\".",
