        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to listen to the voices of young people. If Theresa May truly wants a country that works for everyone, and to unite the nation after Brexit, those aged 16 and 17 must also have a say in the future of our country.\r\n\r\nIf Theresa May can call an election whenever she likes to suit her own political aims, we demand that young people have a say in our future at such a critical time.\r\n\r\nWe ask the Government to respond as soon as possible given the circumstances.",
        "background": "Hundreds of thousands of 16 and 17 year olds were denied the right to decide their future during the EU referendum. We call on Theresa May not to deny their right to vote in the upcoming General Election on 8th June 2017. Our voices must be heard clearly at a time of such great political change.",
