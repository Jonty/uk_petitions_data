Reform is needed.\r\n\r\nThere are 14 privately managed prisons in England and Wales, shared between three companies. Five are in the hands of G4S, four are operated by Sodexo, and five by Serco. Within these prisons there is a lot of reports of violence towards inmates by staff aspecialy where g4s are concerned.\r\n\r\n keeping prisoners for private gain is modern day slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
