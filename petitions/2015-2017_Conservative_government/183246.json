        "additional_details": "As a teenager, I asked my peers at Bacon's College what they would prefer, school to start at the times it is already at or 9am - 4pm. 98.7% of my peers agreed that it should start later because of the fact that they are always tired in the morning and can never concentrate properly.\r\n\r\nBiologically speaking, teenagers don't have good focus or attention until after 10am, this evidence can be read about in this BBC article: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34192371. \r\n\r\nSchools in countries such as Finland are performing better and they don't give their students homework nor do they start school as early as us. You can find this proof anywhere on the internet.",
        "background": "I want action to take place because as an 18-year-old, I understand how majority of students feel about the pressure of getting to school on time.\r\n\r\nI love education and learning but to be threatened to get kicked out because I'm late by a couple of minutes shouldn't be an excuse to stop me.",
