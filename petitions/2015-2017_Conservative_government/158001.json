        "additional_details": "Invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty is the way in which a country can make an irreversible commitment to leave the European Union. It has never been used before in the history of the EU. As a result it should not be done without very careful consideration of the likely consequences and the implications for all the people of the United Kingdom. We cannot and should not go ahead without agreeing  terms and conditions with the other EU countries in advance. Our future depends on it!",
        "background": "People throughout the UK are confused and frightened about what it may mean to leave the EU. There is no clear understanding of the pros and cons of such a momentous decision. Prior to making a final commitment to leave, we deserve a referendum on the terms and conditions that would apply to the UK.",
