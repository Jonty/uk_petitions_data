We now see the Northern Ireland Historical Investigation team bringing charges against servicemen and women some four decades after the event. they appear to be relying on the testimony of the IRA terrorists who have been pardoned, where such evidence can only be biased and untrustworthy.",
        "background": "IRA terrorists were given a Royal Pardon under a previous Government. It is grossly unfair to service personnel to now bring charges against them where the perpetrators of the incidents have been pardoned and where investigations at the time exonerated those service personnel.",
