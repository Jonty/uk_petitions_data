        "additional_details": "Parking is an ever bigger issue within the industry. Besides the points raised above,  spaces are decreasing. Paid and unpaid. Drivers often struggle to find parking within there time. Which brings road safety into question\r\nThese areas would only require basic toilet facilities and cctv. And could be contributed to by operators via a tag system. Which would restrict the use to Hgv's and authorised persons. \r\nThese would be safe but insecure rest areas thus not undermining existing service areas",
        "background": "Hgv drivers are faced with paying up to \u00a330 per night for parking or finding lay-bys or industrial units to park where space is limited, safety is not guaranteed and are often unwelcome",
