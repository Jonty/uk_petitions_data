        "additional_details": "Mexico charge a flat \u00a360 tourist tax, the USA charge \u00a314 for an ESTA to gain admittance, many other states now charge visitors to either enter or leave their country.\r\nThe UK Border, Immigration and Customs agencies face challenging workloads on tight budgets. Likewise our Security and Intelligence services could be better funded to keep our country more secure and safer.\r\nIf a charge of say \u00a320 were applied to all adult visitors the UK would raise substantial revenues which could fund the above.",
        "background": "Many states such as the USA, Mexico and many Caribbean islands apply a visitor charge. If the UK applied a charge to all adult visitors we would raise hundreds of \u00a3millions, this revenue could be used to enhance and strengthen our Border, Customs, Immigration, Security and Intelligence services.",
