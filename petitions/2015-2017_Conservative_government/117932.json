        "action": "Reduce the retirement age for men and women in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Just ask the British public for their opinion. There are many professions which physically could not achieve their retirement age, firemen, nurses, teachers, lorry drivers, bricklayers, dustbin men, paramedics, most manual workers to name a few. Reduce overseas aid, reduce immigration and asylum, invest in our country, and create opportunities for young people who want to work and provide for their families. It's not rocket science, common sense. The rest will take care of itself.",
        "background": "Hardworking people who have contributed to our country are being penalised for their commitment. As Europeans, we should have the same retirement age as our counterparts. By reducing the retirement age it would open opportunities for those unable to find employment and living on benefits.  ",
