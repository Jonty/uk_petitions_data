        "additional_details": "Current Scottish leadership maintain that Scotland should be independent from the rest of UK as do a percentage of their supporters. However as part of UK they still have a say on matters which are only relevant to England, Ireland or Wales. To that end, we believe that it is only right & fair that the entire UK electorate be allowed to vote in any referendum concerning the future of the Union & Scotland's part in it.",
        "background": "Scotland currently forms part of the Union that is the United Kingdom & their independence would affect the whole of the UK. Therefore, the entire UK electorate should have the right to vote in any referendum on Scottish independence.",
