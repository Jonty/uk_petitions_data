        "additional_details": "When a public figure makes a promise they are, essentially, making a contract with those people who employ them, elect them, or pay their salaries.  In response to these promises, we elect them, or allow them to retain their position - it is only fair and right that they should be required to stick to their promises, and yet, time and again, they do not.  There is not, at the moment, any realistic sanction available to us to prevent this, so I am proposing that there should be.",
        "background": "Holders of public office frequently promise to act on behalf of those who, ultimately employ them.  They also frequently break those promises, usually with impunity.  This lessens public trust and engagement, particularly in the field of politics.",
