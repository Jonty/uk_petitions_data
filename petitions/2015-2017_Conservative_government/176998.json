        "action": "Make illegal the stopping of contact by a parent to a child before court",
        "additional_details": "If parents separate they can arrange child contact between themselves. However, a parent can stop a child seeing the other parent, even if there has been consistent contact,without any justified reason,until an agreement is made through mediation or court.A court agreement can take many months. This results in a routine being changed & missed time with a parent. I believe if a routine has been in place & there is no reason to change this it should stay the same until the court decided otherwise.",
        "background": "I am starting this petition to try and make it illegal for one parent to stop another parent from spending time with their child when they have no grounds on which to do it. \r\nMyself and partner had regular contact with his daughter.This has been stopped for no reason & now we have to wait for court",
