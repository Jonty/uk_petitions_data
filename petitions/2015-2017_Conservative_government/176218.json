        "additional_details": "There are many instances where an individual parent income is the only source of income for an entire family.  \r\n\r\nThis tax charge isn't proportionate or fair when compared to a joint couple who's combined income can potentially reach \u00a3100,000 and not be subject to any child benefit tax charge. \r\n\r\nThis tax charge needs to be abolished it's horrendously unfair and discriminates against many families.  A tax system should be fair across the board, this certainly isn't.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/9788481/Abolish-child-benefit-and-give-families-a-tax-break.html",
        "background": "Abolish the Government's high income child benefit tax charge for an individual income exceeding \u00a350,000 introduced in January 2013. \r\n\r\nThis tax charge effects families when a individual parent income exceeds the threshold.  This tax charge means they are no longer eligible for full child benefit.",
