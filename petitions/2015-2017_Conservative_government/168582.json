        "action": "Ban the sale of honey in order to fight the decline in bee populations",
        "additional_details": "Recently, there has been lots of media coverage surrounding the decline in bee populations. It is no secret that if bees go extinct, we are only a couple of years behind.\r\nBees produce honey for two reasons \u2013 to feed their young, and to insulate their hives, therefore by taking their honey from them we are depriving them of their ability to carry out these essential survival functions. It is vital that we stop this practice for the bees' sake, for our sake and for the sake of our planet.",
        "background": "The impact that the honey industry has on bee populations is detrimental - by taking away their honey, we are depriving them of their ability to feed their young and to insulate their hives. We demand a total ban on the sale of honey in the UK to help protect our bees from extinction.",
