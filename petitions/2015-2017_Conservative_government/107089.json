Enough is enough.\r\n\r\nChildren who\u2019ve survived treacherous sea crossings are being bundled into the backs of overcrowded trucks as they continue their desperate search \u2013 and some have suffocated.\r\n\r\nNo more children dying on our doorstep. The EU must act now.\r\n\r\nSee: http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/get-involved/campaigns/shame-on-europe?sourcecode=RC1010005#sthash.CAGt2avN.dpuf",
