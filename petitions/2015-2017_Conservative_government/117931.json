The cap on spending is the same for both sides of any campaign. This cap applies during the official referendum campaign. \r\n\r\nIt has been reported in the press that one side of the campaign will be able to spend more than the other. This does not relate to the limits set down by law, which apply equally to both sides. It seems to relate to the fact that it is possible under the law for one side to have a \u201clead campaigner\u201d, with additional permitted spending, even if the other side does not agree a lead campaigner. \r\n\r\nIf that is what you are concerned about, you could call on Parliament to change the law. You could either ask for the provision for a \u201clead campaigner\u201d to be removed altogether, so that neither side can benefit from this status, or you could ask for the additional spending limit to apply only if both sides have a \u201clead campaigner\u201d. \r\n\r\nIf you would like a different change to the law, you could start a new petition asking for that. \r\n"
