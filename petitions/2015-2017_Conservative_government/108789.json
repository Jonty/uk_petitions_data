Without these important services, older and disabled people may not get the help they need and the stretched NHS faces more pressure.\r\nHomecare is already chronically under-funded and a \u00a3750m shortfall is predicted in 2016 if action isn\u2019t taken now. We are calling on the UK Government to address this issue urgently in the autumn spending review.  \r\n",

            "details": "Government Departments have submitted Spending Review bids to Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury, setting out their policy ambitions for the Parliament, demonstrating how they will deliver on manifesto commitments and bidding for the resources required for delivery. The overall costs of providing social care are being considered as part of the Spending Review. Negotiations and agreement of final budgets are ongoing. The Spending Review process will formally conclude on Wednesday 25 November 2015, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer will announce the outcome.\r\n \r\nThe Department has engaged with the social care sector, including care providers, to understand how the introduction of the National Living Wage will affect them. The new National Living Wage will ensure that care workers are better paid for the vital work they do. It is intended to ensure that work pays and to reduce the need for the State to top up peoples\u2019 wages through the benefits system.\r\n \r\nFrom April 2016, it will be set at \u00a37.20 per hour. The Government\u2019s ambition is for it to reach \u00a39 by 2020.\r\n \r\nSince the announcement in the Budget, the Department\u2019s officials have engaged with the adult social care sector to understand the impact on their business of these pressures and the market in general. We have hosted at least two meetings with a range of individual companies (including the large corporate care providers) to understand more about their perspective on this, supported by other officials from the Department of Business Innovation and Skills and Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury.\r\n \r\nThe financial and market sustainability issues in relation to local authority finance of social care are well known to officials and Ministers in the Department of Health and the Department of Communities and Local Government.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health",
