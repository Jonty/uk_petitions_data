        "additional_details": "In the recent EU Referendum, only 36% of 18-24 year olds actually bothered voting. That figure wasn't much better in last year's General Election, with around 40% of the same Demographic choosing to vote. The number of young voters has drastically fallen since the 1960's, and we cannot let this continue. It is imperative that young people find the passion to vote again, because for a democracy to work effectively, everybody must vote. And to achieve that, there needs to be political education.",
        "background": "There are 12 subjects made compulsory by Law in the British School Sytem, and not one of them is Politics. It is preposterous that in a country run by Democracy, we are not politically educated. How are we supposed to take part in politics if we don't know anything about it? ",
