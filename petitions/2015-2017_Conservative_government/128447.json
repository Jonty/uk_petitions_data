        "action": "Make Commercial Dog Walking a licensed and inspected practice.",
        "additional_details": "Kennels & Boarders are licenced & inspected & must be suitable people, trained and insured to protect OUR pets. I have seen many Commercial Dog Walkers who cannot control the dogs they walk. The dogs foul areas & act as a pack, causing fear/ injury to other dog walkers, dogs, livestock & land users. A license should be a requirement to allow Authorities to inspect vehicles used to transport dogs, check on insurance and the walkers experience. Numbers walked commercially must also be limited.",
        "background": "In recent years, Commercial dog walking has become big business. Seemingly, all people need is a van & a love of dogs. Some provide excellent service helping our dogs to have a better life whilst we work, however there are many who walk up to 20 dogs, do not clean up, & cannot control the pack.",
