Political parties are made up of people that don't represent a majority of the UK public and only want to look after their own interests. How can the Conservatives run a country on our behalf when they don't even agree with each other.\r\n\r\nThe government should be a non-biased, administrative function working on behalf of the British people so we can help make more decisions using modern technology to vote regularly on matters that concern us!",
        "background": "The EU referendum has shown us that our current government and political system is outdated and doesn't work. The whole campaign and outcome on both sides has been a complete shambles. We have seen petty scwobbles, parties turning on each other and a barrage of lies from both remainers & leavers. ",
