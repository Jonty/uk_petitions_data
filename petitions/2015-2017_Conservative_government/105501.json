        "additional_details": " Emigration to United States, Australia and many other countries requires a degree, or a skill lacking in their country and in the US they won't accept anyone for a position that a US Citizen could hold.  Medicals are necessary and the waiting list for a Visa is years.  This is all correct, they are simply making sure only the best got in.  Nothing wrong with that, wish the UK applied the same criteria.",
        "background": "Britain is a small country gradually being overrun.  Immigration is rife made worse by our membership of the EU and lack of effective border control.    The NHS and Social Services are breaking down and failing due to the strain yet still we have this 'open door' policy",
