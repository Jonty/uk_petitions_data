        "action": "Department of Transport to reconsider the travel ban on electronics on flights.",
        "additional_details": "The Department of Transport should define of what constitutes a mobile phone and the acceptable size to ban an electronic device. It should also prove that the same threat has not moved from hand-luggage to holding-luggage and is still fatal. It should also prove that laptops and mobile phones do not have the same technology capabilities, making mobile phones equally a threat. The DoT should also include safe-keeping of content within holding luggage part of airline carriers responsibilities. ",
        "background": "The UK Department of Transport have advised, rather poorly, an electronics ban on flights from and to the UK. This will have a massive impact to the image and economy of the UK. The ban should be backed by logic and proven in the latest threat model before making it mandatory. ",
