Many organisations now offer the gender-neutral title \"Mx\" as one of their pre-set options, including e.g. the NHS and the Co-Op. All government bodies should offer the gender-neutral non-specialist titles (e.g. Mx) or no title as a matter of policy.",

Many people prefer to use no title, or a gender-neutral title: government bodies should offer gender-neutral options e.g. \"Mx\", as well as the option to use no title at all.",
