        "additional_details": "On June 23rd, the UK voted to leave the EU. Since then, the impact of that decision has become clear \u2013 we have created a global crisis that threatens jobs, pensions, the NHS, our collective futures and even the existence of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nOur MPs are the people we elected to represent our best interests and they should be given the chance to do so, deciding whether Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union should be invoked, with a positive vote continuing and a negative vote halting Brexit.",
        "background": "The result of the EU referendum is not legally binding and the question of Brexit can be put to parliamentary debate. Given how close the result was, we request that Parliament debates the issue of the UK exiting the EU and votes on whether Article 50 should indeed be invoked. ",
