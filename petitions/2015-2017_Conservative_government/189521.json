        "additional_details": "The UK people are fed up with being the cash cow of Europe.  The UK is financing the unemployed throughout Europe. Road building projects throughout Europe with Portugal being a prime example.  The Aged care in the UK is a joke beyond belief. Yet the UK sends millions to China for their care system. This now needs to end.  It's the very hard labour of the British tax paying people keeping politicians in jobs that sole structure is to hand out the UK's tax payers cash.",
        "background": "The UK tax payers are fed up with the reckless overseas spending of the British tax payer's money while our own country is in an abysmal decline. Our front line services are failure, our roads are failing, our aged care is failing. Tax is increasing at a rate it is now causing people harm.",
