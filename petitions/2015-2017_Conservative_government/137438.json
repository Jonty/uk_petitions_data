        "additional_details": "Democracy stands for nothing it seems. A long winded campaign on both sides, with mass coverage from all media outlets and people's right to exercise their right to NOT vote, are all irrelevant as the result didn't go the way of the minority. Therefore as they have applied for a 2nd referendum, I wish to apply for a 3rd referendum (hereby called a Neverendum) in that if the 2nd referendum produces a result that the Leave campaign disagrees with, then we get to call another referendum. ",
        "background": "Apply the rule of a \"Neverendum\", whereby if a 2nd referendum is triggered because the losing side are unhappy, then a 3rd referendum must be incurred to allow the original winning side to have another go. Then the pattern can continue until everyone dies. ",
