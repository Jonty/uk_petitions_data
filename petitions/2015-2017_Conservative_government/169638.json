        "action": "To create separate employment laws for big businesses & micro/small businesses.",
        "additional_details": "Because every person counts in a small business, it cannot afford to lose an employee for extended periods and pay cover. But by choosing to work in a micro/small business, employees could opt for shorter paid maternity/paternity leave, fewer paid sick days etc. in exchange for other benefits such as greater flexibility in working time & time off. Plus an environment where each employee is vitally important to the success of the business and there is greater equality between the boss and staff.",
        "background": "Corporate law does not recognise that small business cannot afford to offer the same 'rights' as big business, such as lengthy paid maternity/paternity leave etc. However, it can offer a more rewarding work environment, where every employee is an individual who is vitally important to the business.",
