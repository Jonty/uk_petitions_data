We would then have the reassurance that negotiations were being led by someone who had been democratically elected and not selected by a political party behind closed doors.",
        "background": "This would give MPs who wish to remain in the EU the opportunity to campaign on this ticket. It would also give the voting public the chance to reconsider or confirm their original vote, in light of the global repercussions that have already been revealed.",
