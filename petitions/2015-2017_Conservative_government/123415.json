        "additional_details": "Hinckley Hospital was built in 1899 to commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.  It's a fine example of late Victorian architecture and solidly built.  Since its inception it has been extended, always using local builders to continue to be the hub of Hinckley health care for its residents.  Given its significance & history it is very surprising that Hinckley Hospital is not a listed building.\r\nHinckley residents will inevitably be denied care if they are forced to travel for health care.\r\n",
        "background": "Hinckley Hospital is a small and much used healthcare facility in the heart of the town of Hinckley.  It provides day care surgery and other day procedures to the local community who cannot travel out of town. It provides extensive Consultant outpatient care and all professions allied to medicine.",
