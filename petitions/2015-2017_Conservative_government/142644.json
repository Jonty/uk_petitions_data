        "additional_details": "Since the very close result of the EU referendum result there has been widespread regret at the outcome from both sides. This is largely due to  insufficient information before the referendum about the future of a post-Brexit UK. Invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty should not be based on a decision made without a full understanding of the impact of a Leave vote.",
        "background": "The result of the EU referendum is not a legally binding decision to exit the EU. So, it should not be used to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty beginning the UK departure from the EU. The UK public needs clear information outlining any exit strategy before a public vote on invoking Article 50",
