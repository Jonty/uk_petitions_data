        "action": "request that the government consider 'rewilding' Britain to help save ecosystems",
        "additional_details": "some of the animals considered to be reintroduced are: lynx, beaver, boar, pine martens, many species of birds such as hawks, eagles and owls, marine life including whales and even wolves and bears, although the proposed introduction of these would require consultation with local residents due to ill-deserved stigma and perceived danger (top predators like these usually leave humans alone). when introduced, these animals should be under protection by law from hunting and destruction of habitats.",
        "background": "many animals that are now extinct or endangered in this country have been proven to greatly improve the countryside of other countries, such as beavers being effective flood defenders. to restore the natural balance in our ecosystems, the government should consider proposals from Rewilding Britain.",
