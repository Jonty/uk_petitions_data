        "action": "Negotiate a new EU agreement that can be put to the UK in a second referendum",
        "additional_details": "Based on feed-back from both sides of the debate, I strongly believe that the majority view is to stay in a reformed EU. However, we can't simply ignore the democratic process and have a second referendum. This can only be done if there is something materially different to consider. If the UK and the EU reach a new agreement - that addresses people's concerns - then I believe this would enjoy majority support. Which would be a huge benefit to the UK, our partners in Europe and the EU.",
        "background": "The decision of June 23rd must, of course, be respected. However, I believe that the majority of the UK want to stay in the EU - subject to reform. I therefore call on the UK government and the EU to resume negotiations to reach a new agreement that can then be put to the UK in a second referendum. ",
