        "additional_details": "At the time of writing, Theresa May is in line to be unveiled as our next Prime Minister. A General Election needs to be held forthwith to determine who our next PM will be, as it is our democratic right to vote and have a say who runs our country. To allow someone to step in, as an unelected leader, goes completely against that.",
        "background": "As of the 24th of June 2016, David Cameron announced his decision to step down as Prime Minister. This led to a clamour for other Tory members to succeed him. This must not be allowed to happen, as a democratic vote should be needed to decide who is next in charge of the United kingdom.",
