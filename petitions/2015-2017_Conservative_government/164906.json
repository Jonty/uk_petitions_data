I have been tirelessly trying to make a change in his memory.Grief effects us all differently, there is no wrong or right way to grieve but it should be our way in how we choose to grieve.While many good employers offer compassionate leave, there is no statutory right to leave and this needs to change.In 2014 I worked with ACAS to create guidance but still believe bereavement leave needs to be legislated.Will you Sign?",

You can have \"up to 12 months leave for the birth of a child,but just 3 days to grieve your child\"\r\nMy son Jack was just 23 months old when he tragically died and I discovered this anomaly in law.",
