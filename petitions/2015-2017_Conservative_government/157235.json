        "additional_details": "Plans have recently been announced that after 100 years of continuous use Castle Armoury is to be sold. The occupying Fusilier Platoon is to be moved to a as yet unannounced location along with the Army and Air Cadets. Since before the start of the First World War the building has been occupied by the Fusiliers and stands as the final link between Fusiliers of the present and those who went away to war never to return. The building is still in use and occupied by serving soldiers. ",
        "background": "Castle Armoury is a Grade II listed building and is currently occupied by a Platoon of Fusiliers. For over 100 years the building has been in use by Fusiliers in their home town of Bury. We believe that so long as their are Fusiliers in Bury, Castle Armoury should be their home.",
