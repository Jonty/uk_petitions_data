        "action": "Introduce plain bottles for alcoholic drinks to discourage drinking.",
        "additional_details": "One does not need to Google for long to find that alcohol is the nation's biggest killer, that it - especially in this season - severely strains out emergency response teams and is highly addictive. Not advocating prohibition of any substance, but it is simply not right to villify one drug while leaving another untouched. I cannot imagine how anyone can justify such a move with a clear consciousness.",
        "background": "The government decision to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes while leaving alcoholic brands to market their poison in fancy bottles is hypocrisy. Correct this mistake by forcing them too to get rid of their marketing. If the government is interested in saving people's health, this is obvious.",
