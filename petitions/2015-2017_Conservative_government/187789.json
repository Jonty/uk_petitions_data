        "additional_details": "When my mum first went to pip she ended up taking them to court and my mum won because they never showed up, and she got higher, now she's lower and nothings changed, her condition will never get better, so why should it be any different to the last ones, fibro should be classed as a disability by law and by the government  because it's a long term condition and affects the muscles. They need more support and more awareness of it, because so many people have it nowadays more common ",
        "background": "Years ago I've never heard of this before until my nan got it then my mum got it, and I know so many people that have it now,  my mum worked as a carer for years and had to give it up, to get a sit down job, still hurts, but she needs it to pay mortgage and other bills, they don't get enough support",
