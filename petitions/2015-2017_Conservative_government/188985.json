        "additional_details": "It is ridiculous that, in this day and age, just because a cohabiting couple have not gone through a 30 minute marriage ceremony, the entitlement after a split to the assets they have accumulated together is completely different than in the case of if they are married. Invariably the woman, who often will be forced to leave with her children due to her partner's behaviour, will lose out. Scotland changed its laws in 2005 to give equal protection for cohabiting women, so why can't we do the same?",
        "background": "A married woman forced to leave her husband due to domestic violence is generally entitled to 50% of the couple's assets whereas an unmarried woman is entitled to nothing other than pitiful maintenance payments for her children but nothing for herself. ",
