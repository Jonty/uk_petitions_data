        "additional_details": "Whilst it is undeniable that 52% of the country are currently unhappy with their lives and wish to see change, there will be enough change in the coming months without adding to the political instability by triggering Article 50.  \r\n\r\nWhether or not there is a second referendum, we believe that any new Prime Minister should not implement Article 50 until his or her team have settled into their roles and a clear plan and risk assessment for leaving the EU is laid out before the public. ",
        "background": "The two major political parties in the UK are currently in turmoil. The PM and a number of shadow cabinet ministers have resigned. The climate of political uncertainty means now is not the right time to leave the EU: we should wait until we have new team of leaders who have settled into their roles.",
