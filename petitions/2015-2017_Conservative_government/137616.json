        "additional_details": "Around 75% of 16-17 year olds would vote Remain according to the BBC and YouGov (needs to be sourced). This age demographic is denied the vote because 'it is too expensive', yet arguably it is this generation that will suffer most due to the Leave vote, who's main supporters came from the more elderly. It is this generation that will have to pay off their university debts with awful credit ratings, and take out high interest loans, this generation who will suffer at the hands of the established.",
        "background": "The U.K. Government decided not to let 16-17 year olds have a vote on the grounds of expense. But does democracy have a price? This descision affects US just as much, if not more, than the older generation, so why restrict us from freedom? With calls for a 2nd referendum, let's have a fair one.",
