        "additional_details": "Premium rate number providers can charge up to \u00a33.60 per minute, but once the cost of the call has reached \u00a330, the call has to be terminated in accordance with Phonepayplus.  This results in a call that lasts for 8:20 minutes which does not enable the user to resolve their HMRC query.  As such, it also breaches the Sale of Goods and Services Act, as the service is not Fit for Purpose either",
        "background": "My daughter needed to contact HMRC to deal with her PAYE tax reference and googled to find a telephone number to contact HMRC.  She found a phone number starting with 090 and despite guidance that calls to Government agencies should be low cost, my daughter incurred charges of \u00a3550 in 4 days.",
