This evidence should be reintroduced during a retrial. \r\nHe was recorded joking about breaking the \"Geneva Convention\" however the Sergeant, known as \"Soldier A\", confirms he was regarding disgracing an enemy corpse. \r\n\r\nHe was fired upon by the same operative he \"executed\" so should be released and given a medal for courage. ",
        "background": "During a routine operational patrol during the War on Terror in Afghanistan, Sergeant Blackman was involved in a firefight with Taliban operatives. He was recorded shooting and killing one of them (whom he believed dead) during the ending of the firefight. This isn't murder - that was during war. ",
