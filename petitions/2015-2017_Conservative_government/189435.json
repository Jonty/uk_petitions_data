        "additional_details": "Hyde park is one of the few safe places in London for children and adults to skate. The proposed works will make it impossible to use the Broadwalk. We ask the Royal Parks to first try other cycle speed calming measures, such as speed signs, more prominent cycle lane designations, sign posts and better lighting before resorting to physical intrusive treatments. In other parts of the park speeding cyclists simply go round calming treatments. Please consider all park users in this matter. ",
        "background": "Proposed cycle calming treatments to the Broadwalk in Hyde Park will make it impossible for roller skaters, scooters, wheelchair users and other wheeled recreational users to use the Broadwalk. It will force skaters to use Park Lane to access Serpentine Road with increased risk. ",
