        "additional_details": "The public tend to underestimate the seriousness of eating disorders (Crisp et al., 2000; Easter, 2012; Mond et al., 2006) and may not view them as a \u2018real\u2019 mental illness (Easter, 2012). Despite genetic factors playing an important role in their causes (Jacobi et al., 2004), the general public tend to blame solely social/environmental factors (Bulik, 2004) as causes for eating disorders. The public also tend to believe the person has brought the illness on themselves  (Stewart et al., 2006).\r\n",
        "background": "Eating disorders are severe illnesses, yet are widely misunderstood by the public and often subject to negative and misinformed attitudes. These misunderstandings and negative perceptions may stop people getting the help they need and deserve. A well-funded public education programme is needed.",
