        "additional_details": "Contrary to what the Bew review of assessment recommended, anyone currently working in a primary school, or with any knowledge of the assessment expectations, will know that the system that we are working with does not ensure that \u2018the achievement of all pupils with Special Educational Needs is appropriately recognised\u2019. They will also know that the secure fit approach to teacher assessment does not enable writing composition to form the greater part of writing assessment.",
        "background": "It is almost impossible for children with spelling difficulties to reach \u2018the expected standard\u2019 in writing.Two small concessions would make a big difference-removal of spelling from teacher assessment of writing and reporting on the outcomes of the spelling test,separate from grammar & punctuation.",
