MPs are duty bound to represent the interests of their constituents.\r\n\r\nTherefore, for any vote on Article 50, we ask MPs to act in the long-term interests of all their constituents and fellow citizens - especially our children who will have to live with this decision for decades to come.",

Unlike electing a new government, leaving is permanent. 14 million children and many of the 5 million Britons abroad did not have a vote, despite it changing their lives forever.",
