        "additional_details": "Closing the schools on polling day is another day that our children miss out on education, as parents if we decide to not send our children to school we are questioned, but the government can shut schools for their benefit. Closing schools is also a financial burden on parents and company's, surely the local council can find alternative locations for elections or maybe put on free buses for those who live a distance from the stations.",
        "background": "We signed below believe that the government should stop using our schools for election days. Our children's education is very important and as parents we are fined if we take them out of school, but the government can choose to close the school for there benefit. This needs to stop now !!",
