If The Scottish first Minister fails in her bid to take Scotland out of the UK, but into the EU, then she must immediately resign as a Minister for Scotland.  She must surrender her UK passport immediately.  She must then seek refuge in a comfortable home in a Country of her choice, within the EU.  Which is what she wanted for us.",
