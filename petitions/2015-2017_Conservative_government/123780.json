People with disabilities are not \"second class\" citizens, and do not deserve to be suffering due to a power-hungry, megalomaniac government. They are human beings, just as healthy people are, and they are quickly losing their financial lifelines due to IDS and Cameron. This must stop, and it must stop now. It is breaching the human rights of disabled people nationwide.",
