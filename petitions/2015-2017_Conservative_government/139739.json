        "action": "Lift EU/US sanctions on Russia to increase trade now the UK is leaving the EU",
        "additional_details": "The EU and the US introduced sanctions on Russia over the democratic decision of the people of Crimea to reunify with Russia and Russia's alleged backing of separatists in Eastern Ukraine. The UK had to participate in this as an EU member. Now the UK is leaving the EU, we need not be dictated to by it. Lost trade with Russia costs the UK many millions of pounds. This is trade that we are now at liberty to get back. Russia is a market of 140m consumers British business needs. ",
        "background": "As the UK has chosen to exit the EU, we will be no longer bound by US-influenced, EU sanctions on Russia. We should lift sanctions on Russia as an independent country to regain the millions of pounds of trade we have lost with Russia. We don't need to participate in EU/US sanctions against Russia.",
