        "additional_details": "I was a healthy pregnancy until 25 weeks. My babies movements started to decrease and I let professionals know, but I wasn't listened to. \r\nI knew her pattern, I knew she wasn't moving as much. I soon discovered our hospitals policy along with other hospitals is 28 weeks to be scanned. \r\nMy little girl died 27+5 due to failing placenta which a scan would have picked up and saved her! I now know I am not alone with this. \r\nPlease help lower the policy to viability age and save other babies!",
        "background": "Pregnancy is a difficult and worrying time for any parent and mums are constantly told to watch their babies movements. \r\nSadly some hospitals policies are still that you have to be 28 weeks to be monitored or scanned, only a heartbeat will be checked. This needs to change. ",
