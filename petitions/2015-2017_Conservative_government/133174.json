        "additional_details": "Additionally there seems to be a lot of corrupt assessors out there who are making a mockery of the system. As the only evidence that can prove an assessor lied is the recording of the assessment which they often refuse to allow it leaves the system in their favour. As we are often told if you are doing nothing wrong then you have nothing to hide.  \r\n\r\nSo should we record so the disabled person can remember or not record it so the assessor can lie.",
        "background": "Many people attending disability assessments have memory problems and cannot remember what was said during their face to face assessments. Providing a recording of this assessment is a reasonable adjustment in the same way ramps are for wheelchair users and Braille is for blind people.",
