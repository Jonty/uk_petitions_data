        "additional_details": "Education starts when a child is born. It's a fact that those children using Sure Start Centres have obtained higher educational standards when entering mainstream schooling.\r\n\r\nThe government stated they would not close Sure Start Centres but funding to local authorities has reduced and as a result many have had to close. We need to look at expertise through consultation and secure funding that shows the importance of these Sure Start Centres, increase centres, give a child the best start in life.",
        "background": "During the 2014 election David Cameron made a commitment that his government would not close any Sure Start Centres but they would look at starting a consultation process as to its future. We want the government to start consultation ASAP as centres are in a funding crisis and closing as a result.",
