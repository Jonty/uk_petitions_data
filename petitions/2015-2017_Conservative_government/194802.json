        "additional_details": "Recently media have reported that gay men in the Russian Federation country of Chechnya have been rounded up and taken to a concentration camp similar to that of Nazi Germany. Three people have reported to have died.\r\n\r\nAs a country with good human rights we cannot sit back and do nothing. If we show Russia we don't support things like this then that will hopefully send a powerful message. \r\n\r\nPlease show your support if you support LGBT and human rights. ",
        "background": "In recent year's Putin introduced the anti gay law making it illegal for people of LGBT persuasion to express themselves due to them promoting the \"gay lifestyle\". I am urging the UK to cut all ties with the Russian government over issues such as trade.",
