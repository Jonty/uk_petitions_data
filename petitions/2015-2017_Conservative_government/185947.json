In GCSE Physics, a sheet consisting of all mathematical equations is also given. It would be a gross disadvantage for Reformed GCSE students to not be given said information; especially considering that the reformed qualifications are more challenging for individuals taking the examinations in Year 11 and without such sheets, comparison between Legacy and Incumbent qualifications is difficult.

It would be a disadvantage for Reformed GCSE students to not be given said information; especially considering that the new qualifications are more challenging.",
