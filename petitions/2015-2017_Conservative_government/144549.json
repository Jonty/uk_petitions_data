        "additional_details": "We resent those who would seek to overturn the will of the British people by using media of which the core leave vote are unfamiliar. Their actions are undemocratic the proposed rule changes are an attempt to lock the Nation into being consumed by the EU superstate. Referendums in other EU nations have demonstrated that the Organisation treats countries as being part of their own personal fiefdom. To quote Jean-Claude Juncker \"If it's a yes\" 'on we go' an  if it's a no\" 'we will continue'",
        "background": "We reject this petition as the reasons to stay are outweighed by those to leave. Democracy is more important than material considerations. Non elected representatives of the EU have continually demonstrated  contempt for democracy by ignoring past referendums. The voting rule petition supports them.",
