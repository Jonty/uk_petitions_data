Currently, during a fact finding hearing in a family court, they only need to be 51% sure of their findings to make a decision.  I don't think that is a fair percentage to take children away from their families.",

The standard of proof in criminal cases is \"Guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\", which might be what you mean by \"95% evidence\". \r\n\r\nIf we have understood your petition correctly, you could consider starting a petition asking Parliament to change the law to raise the standard of proof in family law cases to the criminal standard.\r\n\r\nIf it is clear that you are also concerned about the way in which guardians are carrying out their role. You could ask the Government or Parliament to reconsider the role and duties of a guardian and whether any changes are needed. "
