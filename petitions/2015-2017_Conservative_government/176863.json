We're not sure whether you would like sticky labels to be banned, or whether you would like the rules about the labelling of fruit and vegetables to be changed.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nMany of the rules for the labelling of fruit and vegetables are set by international bodies, including the EU. If you would like the rules on the labelling of fruit and vegetables to be changed, you could start a new petition asking the UK Government to work with other countries to change the rules.
