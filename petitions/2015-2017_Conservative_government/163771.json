        "action": "Reduce university fees from \u00a39000 a year to \u00a31500 a year.",
        "additional_details": "Students have to pay university fees and living fees for the entirety of their stay at university which can range from three to seven years, possibly more. It is almost financially impossible for the average household to support this, even worse for lower income households. With the amount of students who attend university increasing (2015 recorded 532,300 students) paying \u00a32000 each, per year should be more than enough to support universities, whilst being financially possible for students.",
        "background": "With fees being so high and possibly continuing to rise, the amount of students who are unable to afford further education is increasing, and any student who continues with further education will leave with at least \u00a330,000 worth of debt, which they have to pay back with interest, which is unfair.",
