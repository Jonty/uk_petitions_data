        "additional_details": "A Government-owned, minimal level of car insurance (e.g. 3rd party, fire & theft) should be affordable - say \u00a315 a month - so that everyone is able to enjoy the freedom that driving brings. \r\n\r\nIt could be linked to the taxing of the vehicle, through the DVLA, to ensure that every car on the road is legal.\r\n\r\nA similar scheme already exists in Australia:\r\nhttps://www.sa.gov.au/topics/driving-and-transport/vehicles/vehicle-insurance",
        "background": "It is illegal to drive without car insurance, yet the cost of doing so continues to climb - making it almost impossible for young drivers and those on low incomes to be able to afford it.\r\n\r\nCar insurance companies can charge what they like, so the Government should step in and create their own.",
