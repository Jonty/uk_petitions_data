        "additional_details": "I have had problems myself with people who have refused to move from priority seats and even seen buses carrying 3 or 4 puschairs at a time before. Then when a wheelchair user wants to get on, they cannot. This isn't about having special treatment, it's about disabled people having the same rights to access public transport as non disabled people. Like the fact that they can just hop on a train or bus whenever they feel like it. ",
        "background": "I would like it to be that wheelchair users have absolute priority of the only space in which they can safely travel and that those who are not wheelchair users, but who have mobility problems, to have absolute priority of the priority seats too. As too often people are refusing to move. ",
