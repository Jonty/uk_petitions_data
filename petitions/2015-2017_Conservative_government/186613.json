        "additional_details": "A Biafran free state is the only place where the Igbo people could live freely. Many Biafrans have been murdered fighting for this struggle.\r\n\r\nIn November 2016, 150 peaceful Biafran demonstrators were killed by the Nigerian army. 11 others lost their lives in December 2015. Between August 2015 and February 2016, the SBCHROs estimates that around 80 members of the IPOB, or Indigenous people of Biafra, were killed by Nigerian security operatives under the order of the Nigerian government.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Ever since Biafra's independence struggle 50 years ago, Biafran people have been subject to horrific acts of violence and oppression by the Nigerian government. All any Biafran will ask for is a free state, independent of Nigeria, to prevent the mistreatment and starvation of their people by Nigeria",
