UK should recruit and lead allies to help the Kurds establish and enlarge a haven around Kobane. A no-fly zone should be imposed. As ISIL retreat,a large territory could be a safe haven. The west could invest in roads,schools, hospitals, oil industry, etc. When peace returns, this zone could provide an engine of growth to the whole country.\r\n     ",

The reason for their flight to Europe is not being addressed, and present action is to accept, and almost ignore, the cause of their predicament.",
