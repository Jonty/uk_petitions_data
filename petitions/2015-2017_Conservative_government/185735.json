        "action": "Give more advice and provide help for free to the parents of obese children.",
        "additional_details": "The number of obese children would change dramatically and fall if further support was given to parents or careers of children. Obesity levels in the UK are really high compared to other European countries and the world. Meal plans, guidance and leaflets with facts on obesity should be given to parents or careers so they can help their child lose weight and decrease chances of breathing difficulty, high blood pressure or a stroke in the future.",
        "background": "Children who are obese have higher risks of heart disease and other illnesses so it would be very important to lower the numbers of kids who are in need of help. Providing more help by making their parents aware of this and sending them free leaflets on how to help their child(ren) would be helpful.",
