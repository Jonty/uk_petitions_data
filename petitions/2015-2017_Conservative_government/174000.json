        "action": "Hold a referendum on whether to accept the deal negotiated with the EU or not",
        "additional_details": "Once Article 50 is triggered, a deal will be negotiated on the UK's future relationship with the EU. If no deal is negotiated, we will default to a \"hard\" Brexit. Both Remain and Leave campaigns acknowledged that the EU want to avoid this. A referendum on whether to accept the deal struck or default to a hard Brexit will actually strengthen our negotiating position and provide a democratic mandate for our future with the EU. It is a \"win-win\" of a better deal achieved via a democratic process.",
        "background": "We have already had a referendum on EU membership, and we have chosen to leave. Having a second referendum between the negotiated deal and staying in the EU will completely undermine our negotiating position. But having a referendum on whether to accept the deal or just leave will do the opposite.",
