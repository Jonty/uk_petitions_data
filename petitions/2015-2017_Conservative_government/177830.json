        "action": "Hold a referendum asking if we want to leave the single market.",
        "additional_details": "NB this does not mean a re-run of the original referendum. The new referendum would instead determine whether the majority of the British people would prefer a 'soft' Brexit, with continued access to the single market but no controls on EU immigration and continuing EU fees/directives, or a 'hard' Brexit, with controls on immigration, full sovereignty and no EU fees, but no access to the single market.",
        "background": "On 17th Jan 2017 Theresa May announced the government decision to take the UK out of the single market. As during the previous referendum it was not clear whether voting leave would trigger a single market exit, allow people to have their say in light of this new information. ",
