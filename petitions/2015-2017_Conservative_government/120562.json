        "additional_details": "In my own case I was assessed through WCA and then separately through an independent psychiatrist.  The WCA concluded I was able to work when the independent psychiatrist did not.  The issue is that to challenge the process is complex and a cause of distress for someone like me suffering with depression.  I found it too stressful to challenge.  A qualified professional should assess whether its the disability that affects a persons ability to work and not a series of irrelevant actions.",
        "background": "Currently anyone unable to work who is claiming benefits such as ESA needs to undertake a Work Capability Assessment (WCA).\r\nThe assessment checks to see what people are able to do and consists of a questionnaire and a predefined assessment.  It does not assess the impact of, e.g; mental health.",
