        "additional_details": "The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) are due to make a funding decision on Vimizim for Morquio disease on 28th October 2015. We the undersigned believe that despite the comparatively high per patient cost of treatment for Morquio and other ultra-rare diseases, that NHS England should provide funding and that it would be unfair not to treat these few children based on the rarity of their condition. ",
        "background": "Morquio disease is an ultra-rare and life limiting enzyme deficiency with just 88 sufferers in the UK. NHS England have been failing those sufferers since the drug Vimizim was licenced in the UK in April 2014 and have now said they will not make an interim funding decision at all.",
