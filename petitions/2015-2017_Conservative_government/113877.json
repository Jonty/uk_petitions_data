This is suppose to be England and our soldiers are entitled to go anywhere in their uniforms. We can't even get jobs in our country and we feel worried to Act on it in fear of being labelled racist. All we want to do is claim back our own country and live by our own rules. We need to toughen up on immigration and only let skilled workers in and make England England again.",

Some hospitals don't allow you to know the sex of your babies incase it offends Muslims, English isn't even the first language taught in schools. We need to be allowed to live in our own country freely and not be told what we can do.",
