        "additional_details": "Volkswagen has agreed to the largest automotive settlement in the history of the US, as it has agreed upon a $14.7 billion (around \u00a311 billion) scheme for US customers.\r\n\r\nVolkswagen have claimed that compensation is not necessary in the UK and the rest of Europe, as the fix is less extensive and customers will therefore have their cars back soon after they have been recalled.",
        "background": "VW has agreed significant compensation for American owners caught up in their attempt to cheat emissions monitoring. However,  they have refused to consider any compensation for UK owners in the same position. I believe this to be unfair and ask the UK government to address this situation.",
