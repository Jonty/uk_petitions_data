The problem is we have to many heartless people who speed down roads, my cat was hit by a speeder, I know this because of the car hit the back of him sending him to get pushed at some force the  impact he had to the head was enough to kill him, the driver drove off knowing what they had done, they will get away with this due to the Road traffic act.",
