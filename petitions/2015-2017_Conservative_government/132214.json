        "additional_details": "Not only do parents have to pay for bank holidays but also for family holidays making it near impossible to go on holiday for some families. Many parents earn nothing after paying childcare fees but yet we are urged to work. With some childcare providers charging in excess of \u00a390 per day, how are we supposed to pay these costs? ",
        "background": "Since my son has been in private nursery, we have paid \u00a314000. My son has been in nursery for 13 months! Over the course of two years, we would have paid \u00a325000 which is enough for a deposit on a house. This is obscene and believe that childcare should be capped to no more than \u00a345 per day.",
