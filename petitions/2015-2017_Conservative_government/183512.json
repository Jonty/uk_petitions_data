        "additional_details": "Are people ready to provide the necessary revenue required to improve our NHS. Yes we can all moan about people using the service who are not eligible, people not turning up for appointments and the common improper use of numerous services. This aligned to the constant pressure on the NHS for 'change' and 'improvement'.  But in reality, we are all living longer, want the best treatment, in a timely and professional manner. Can I suggest that we raise tax by 1p and ring-fence for OUR NHS. ",
        "background": "Our NHS seems to be at breaking point, our politicians are 'scared' to increase a ring-fenced rise in income tax of 1p, isn't it about time the people who own the NHS spoke out? We need to save our NHS before it breaks completely or is pressured into privatisation. Save OUR NHS now.",
