        "additional_details": "Whilst it is down to the government to get the best possible deal for a Post-EU Britain, the public should be allowed to have a vote on the final deal, as many people voted to Leave for various reasons, as well as there being many policies those who voted for Remain liked about the EU, so this will ensure that the majority of the UK is in favour of the final Brexit deal and that it benefits all those in our country, regardless of how they voted in the referendum.",
