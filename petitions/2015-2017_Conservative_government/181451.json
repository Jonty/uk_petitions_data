Pitbulls are statistically the most friendliest of dogs to other dogs and humans. And find it very difficult to be alone. http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/american-pit-bull-terrier#/slide/1 If Pitbulls are only given to good owners, then none of the Pitbulls will be aggressive to others. I have owned staffies my whole life and they couldn't hurt a fly.",
