        "additional_details": "It's reported 7% of U.K. population have a gluten allergy or intolerance, this affecting a few million people. There are a few restaurants that do make the effort and why not many more. For instance some restaurants use separate oil but many don't. This would very easily widen the choice when eating out with family and friends making it a much more enjoyable experience, which otherwise can be quite off-putting. This should also be debated on other allergies and what could be done to help. ",
        "background": "In many restaurants there's often only one or two gluten free options on a menu when could be more. For instance if chips were fried GF, as they would otherwise be GF. Instead often the same oil used for frying breadcrumb/batter based food to save money. There are other instances of this as well. ",
