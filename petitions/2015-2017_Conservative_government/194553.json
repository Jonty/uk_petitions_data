        "action": "Scrap the \"rape clause\" and the \"family cap\" on social security payments.",
        "additional_details": "The Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016 places a \"family cap\" on social security by limiting child tax credits and elements of Universal Credit to two children.\r\n\r\nOne of the exemptions to the cap set out in secondary legislation is known as the \"rape clause\". This allows payments for third and subsequent children when pregnancy has arisen from rape. DWP's plan for implementation of the \"rape clause\" requires women to disclose rape to a certifying \"third-party assessor\".",
        "background": "As the \"rape clause\" exemption cannot be delivered in a way that does not breach women's rights and undermine women's equality and safety, we call on the UK Government to repeal the \"family cap\" measures in the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016, including all of its exemptions.
