        "action": "Introduce Scoliosis screenings into schools to help diagnose it at early stages.",
        "additional_details": "I was diagnosed with Scoliosis at 11, after my parents noticed a swelling on my back. By 13, it had rapidly developed from 1 small curve to 2, both over 50 degrees. I was in constant pain, had breathing difficulties & my organs were being crushed due to my ribs twisting. As a result I had 9 hour spinal fusion to correct it. I believe these screenings can help children catch it during its early stages & alternate treatment methods can be tried in order to slow/prevent further curve progression.",
        "background": "Scoliosis means curvature of the spine, and it is often an 'S' shape. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is commonly found in children aged 10-18. If not found during its early stages, the curve/s can progress rapidly, dramatically effecting their health & causing pain. Early diagnosis may slow it down",
