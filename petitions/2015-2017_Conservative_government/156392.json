Since we have left many Countries are lining up to Trade with us. The Old Commonwealth, China, India, America. We do not need the Single Market. They need us. It is not for us to go to them, with a deal. It is for them to come to us. Mr Farage will ensure we are not STITCHED up. He will let the British People know what is going on. ",
