        "action": "Stop Myxomatosis killing Rabbits",
        "additional_details": "They suffer severe conjunctivitis that results in blindness, swelling in the head, ears, eyes and genitals, thick pus discharge from the nose (which makes it difficult to breathe), and lumps on the body for up to two weeks before they die; longer in many cases. Rabbits are sentient beings, who feel pain and suffer every bit as any other animal. I want the Government to actively discuss all the options open to it to combat/control this disease in the wild rabbit population.",
        "background": "Myxomatosis is cruel disease which millions of wild rabbits in the UK die from each year. It is not acceptable that such a disease is left unchecked due to it being released illegally in the UK in the 1950\u2019s. Myxomatosis is pure torture for any wild rabbit infected.\r\n\r\n",
