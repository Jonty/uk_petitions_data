        "additional_details": "The information above has been taken directly from a letter sent to parents from local secondary head teachers. They have resorted to asking for help from the local community to ensure that they can still meet the needs of their children. I cannot ever recall such a desperate plea before. Education is the corner stone of our society. Let's pull together on this. The cuts will mean larger classes, reduced staff, less support, fewer opportunities and reduced staff training.",
        "background": "In the UK schools are facing a funding crisis. Secondary schools receive the same amount per pupil as they have for several years due to a flat cash settlement whilst running costs have been increasing. There is a real danger that outgoings will exceed income. \r\n",
