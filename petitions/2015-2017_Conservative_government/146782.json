        "additional_details": "Farage has admitted that the promise to spend \u00a3350 more/week on the NHS was a mistake. Johnson is back-pedalling on the claim that immigration will reduce. Millions of people voted to leave on the basis of these lies. Young people voted massively to remain, 16 & 17 yr olds were denied a vote and they, along with those who are younger, and the Scottish and the N Irish, have been sidelined. Billions have been wiped off the stock market, and we are in chaos. It is not too late to stop this madness.",
        "background": "The EU referendum result is not legally binding until the UK government gives its notice to leave the EU under Article 50. The other EU member states cannot make us do this. Our young people, Scotland and N Ireland have been sidelined, and many millions of leave voters misreprepresented.",
