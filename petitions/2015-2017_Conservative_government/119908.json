If we are to achieve a satisfactory result in increasing participation in sport this measure would lower costs.\r\n\r\nhttp://goo.gl/R7sMLV - BBC's Report on footballs decline\r\nhttp://goo.gl/aEdXaj - Birmingham Mail report on pitch fee hike in 2013.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The grass is too long, poorly marked and the drainage is poor often being called off and that leads to weeks of no sporting activity for some children. \r\nIn our situation we are charged \u00a330 per hour.",
