        "action": "Allow grocery stores to donate food to charities without any legal implications.",
        "additional_details": "I work in a supermarket and I know for a fact that products are being marked as wastage at closing time because the product will be no good the next day. According to Sunday trading laws, most stores close at 4 which means stock dated as out of date on that day will be thrown out when that product still has 8 hours of life.\r\n\r\nIt does make sense that a measure like this be put in place so communities benefit. Food wastage should be kept at a minimum and company leniency is the way forward.",
        "background": "Homeless charities and foodbanks are reliant on donations to be able to feed people who cannot afford food to eat.\r\n\r\nI call for a parliamentary debate that states that grocery stores can donate products which they can't sell in store to charities without legal implications if the product is faulty.",
