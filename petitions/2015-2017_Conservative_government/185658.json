        "additional_details": "Many children who have the potential to attain an A or A* in the old style Maths GCSE can not even get a 5 which is deemed to be a pass. Why is this you may ask. The simple reality is the goverment have created the maths GCSE too hard as a result of moving subjects that are normally taught at A level down to GCSE. Moreover with many students, including myself, being taught the old curriculum it has become impossible to adjust and adhere to the demands the new maths GCSE brings forth. Please sign.",
        "background": "Children are finding the new specification maths gcse extremely hard and difficult. Additionally many children have the potential to excel in maths yet are being downgraded and moved to do a foundation tier paper.",
