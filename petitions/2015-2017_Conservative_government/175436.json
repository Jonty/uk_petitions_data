        "action": "Make car insurance more affordable for all persons who have never made a claim.",
        "additional_details": "I think that all persons should have a \"claims background record\" that would be similar to credit history wear all past claims and no claims are noted. I have been driving for 15 years and have never made a claim in my life! How is it fair that I or anybody else should be penalised for not having any proof of no claims. I have had to take out temporary cover costing me \u00a375 for 7 days until I figure out what I can do! If I took the insurance on offer simply paying the deposit would mean my children and myself would starve, no bills would get paid and we would also be without gas and electric, and that is the reality of the situation and it simply needs to change.",
        "background": "I never knew some years ago that my no claims bonus would expire after two years, as a result of this obtaining affordable car insurance is now near impossible! I have purchased a used car for \u00a3500 and my insurance quotes are well over \u00a31000 with a deposit equivalent to my households weekly income! ",
