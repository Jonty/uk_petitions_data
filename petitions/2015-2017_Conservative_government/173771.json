        "additional_details": "The Whitsun bank holiday has become outdated and lost its meaning to the general public. We propose that the Princess Diana bank holiday would be more suitable, as it's closer to the nations heart. Her continued support for Great Ormand Street and other charities has allowed her to become an iconic role model for younger generations to aspire to be like. July 1st marks her birthday and a bank holiday on this day would allow the British public to remember and celebrate her and her achievements.",
        "background": "Princess Diana was a prominent member of British history and deserves to be remembered for her contributions to her charity work and her support of the International Campaign to ban landmines. This bank holiday could replace the Whitsun bank holiday.",
