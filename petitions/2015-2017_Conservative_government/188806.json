        "action": "REFORM THE HOUSING ACT AND LEGISLATION FOR TENANTS IN PRIVATE PROPERTY",
        "additional_details": "The Housing Act, Sections 8 and 21 gives powers to landlords to evict tenants which are often abused.  Landlords invent reasons to obtain evictions under Section 8.  Section 21, gives landlords an incentive to impose huge rent hikes at the break points in a tenancy.\r\nChanging the law to give tenants more protection would save the country fortunes in legal bills, welfare payments and reduce the strain on local authorities.\r\nIt would reduce stress for thousands of people.",
        "background": "There is an unfairness in rented housing between landlords and tenants.  Tenants have little protection against arbitrary and unfair treatment by landlords.\r\nThousands of tenants every year have the upheaval and expense of moving at short notice, pushing them into poverty and deprivation",
