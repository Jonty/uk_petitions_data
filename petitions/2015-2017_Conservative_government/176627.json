        "additional_details": "The European Convention on Human Rights has become a milestone in society. It has developed our law, freedoms & liberties. The government has no real reason to remove us from this convention. The main reason being to avoid embarrassment. In matters of great controversy, the government has gone against the ECtHR, an example being prisoners having a right to vote. The ECHR judged that they do have a right, yet UK law has upheld the status that they will not. This has not been contested by the general public of the United Kingdom.\r\nThe UK does not have to necessarily follow the ECtHR. To remain as a follower of the convention is so important. It enables citizens to feel like they are having their fundamental rights upheld, and further to that promotes a government which has moral values.",
        "background": "\"... a cornerstone of the Good Friday Agreement, and has given confidence to people in Northern Ireland that their rights will be protected equally, whatever their religious or political views. To remove ourselves would be to jeopardise a peace treaty which holds great valued importance.\"\r\n",
