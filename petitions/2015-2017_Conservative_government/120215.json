        "action": "Make childcare funding available quickly and pay directly to childcare providers",
        "additional_details": "As child minders we find ourselves often in the situation where parents build up a back log of fees outstanding because the HMRC haven't approved their funding or stopped it. What do you do in such a situation? We have built up relationships with the child and its parent(s) and its not in the best interest of the child to terminate it. We want the HMRC to speed up the process and pay the child care provider directly to give us security for the hard work we do.",
        "background": "The HMRC can take up to 12 weeks and often longer before they approve funding and pay out to the parents If the HMRC could change their regulations and give child minders guarantee than parents could go back to employment easier and childcare providers would be assured of payment for their services.",
