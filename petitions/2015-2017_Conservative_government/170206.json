        "additional_details": "Any person or family earning over \u00a331k will be taxed an additional 15% tax to stay in their house. \r\nThis is being introduced to all tenants, no matter how long they've lived there and will double many peoples rents overnight. \r\nThere is no lead in period, no special measures.\r\nNot only that, but the mechanisms for achieving this have not even been worked out or communicated to local councils yet and no-one knows how this is supposed to work despite sticking to the introduction date of next April. ",
        "background": "As part of the unfair Housing & Communities Act 2016, the government, not only insisted on much greater uncertainty for council tenants with new short term lease arrangements, but they also introduced the 'Pay to Stay' legislation which effectively taxes single people and couples in council housing.",
