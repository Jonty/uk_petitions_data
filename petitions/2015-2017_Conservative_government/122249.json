        "action": "Stop charging premium phoneline rates for Universal Credit claimants.",
        "additional_details": "The introduction of Universal Credit is likely to be problematic for many individuals, with the introduction of a single monthly payment for people in or out of work, merging together some of the benefits and tax credits currently in existence.  Individuals are expected to apply online, however there are many in the UK who do not have sufficient computer skills or online access to do so.  Premium phonelines could be prohibitively costly to those waiting on payments.  \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Despite the DWP making a pledge to provide free calls for \"all major benefit claim lines\" the helpline for the new Universal Credit will be a 0345 number costing callers up to 45p a minute from mobile networks.  This is a disappointing decision and will penalise those most in need of support.",
