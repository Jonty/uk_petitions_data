        "action": "Put the Investigatory Powers Bill to a referendum.",
        "additional_details": "I urge everyone who reads this to do some extra research on the Investigatory Powers Bill, and other similar mass surveillance programs around the world, such as the NSA's Prism program. Please look up interviews from Edward Snowden and decide for yourself whether he is a traitor or a hero.\r\n\r\nIf the people decide that these programs and losing our rights are a worthy sacrifice for protection from terrorism then so be it, however, as it stands we have not been given a choice.",
        "background": "The Investigatory Powers Bill is a piece of legislation that seriously infringes our right to a private life. The bill has been scarcely covered in the media and I believe that the British people should be given the opportunity to decide for themselves whether we are willing to give up our freedoms.",
