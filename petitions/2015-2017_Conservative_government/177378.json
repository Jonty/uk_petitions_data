        "action": "Introduce US style, legally enforced licensing for all UK estate agents",
        "additional_details": "The most valuable investment in the majority of people's lives is routinely being handled by people with no formal qualifications regarding property, little training and in many cases little experience.\r\n\r\nThis petition proposes that, as in The US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, all agents involved in the sale of real estate must carry a formal qualification or 'licence'. This would serve to ensure only qualified agents handle sales and buyers and sellers are protected by a governing body.",
        "background": "Estate Agents have an abysmal reputation in The UK for quality control, ethics and quality of service. Unethical practices such as over valuation, high pressure sales, misrepresentation and advertisement of properties not for sale are considered standard practice. ",
