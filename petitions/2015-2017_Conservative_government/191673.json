        "additional_details": "The NHS claim that the higher risk factor of blood-borne diseases (for example, AIDS) is the reason for the gay blood ban. However, straight people can and do catch these diseases as well - The blood should be properly screened and all people subjected to the same rule set, regardless of their sexual orientation.\r\nThe current rules suggest that infected blood from straight people could potentially be transfused - which is a huge risk in general. Their efforts are focused in the wrong place.",
        "background": "Currently, gay people are not allowed to donate blood through the NHS, due to higher STD risks. However, these risks are still present in everyone - it should be an all-or-nothing approach.",
