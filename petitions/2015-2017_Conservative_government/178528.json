        "action": "Contraceptive pill boxes to warn of major factors making the pill less effective",
        "additional_details": "The side effects and health risk associated with all medication are contained on a large leaflet within the box. We would like to see the main factors causing the contraceptive pill to be less effective or ineffective printed in bold letters on the outside of the box. Many become pregnant each year believing that this will not happen as they have chosen to use the pill only to find that something else such as a bout of illness has stopped the pill working. ",
        "background": "We would like legislation requiring manufacturers of contraceptive pills to clearly and prominently display a warning on the packaging showing the major factors in the pill being less effective. We would like a warning similar to that of a cigarette packet",
