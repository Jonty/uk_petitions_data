        "additional_details": "As of 1st April, the national minimum wage for adults over the age of 25 rose from \u00a37.20 to \u00a37.50 (an increase of 4%). At the same time, the rate for adults under the age of 21 rose from \u00a35.55 to \u00a35.60 (an increase of 0.9%). The Bank of England expects inflation at 2.7% in 2017. Young adults are significantly affected by this wage gap, which reduces their income in real terms. (BBC) (gov.uk)\r\n\r\nThe Equality Act of 2010 prevents age discrimination. I ask that the government consider their wage law.",
        "background": "Adults under the age of 25 performing similar roles at work receive a lower wage than their older peers. This constitutes as age-related discrimination. It is simply false that young adults do not face similar financial circumstances as their peers; many are expected to pay towards rent and bills. ",
