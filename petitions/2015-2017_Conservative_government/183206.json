        "additional_details": "Weller Wing is not fit for purpose, so fix it, don't get rid of the only emergency mental health service we have. 1 in 4 people suffer with mental health problems, that's around 19,700 people in Bedford who would benefit from this service. All we have now is a promise that it will return, but there's currently no time frame or budget for that. It is negligent to just bin the service with no future plans, as opposed to fixing the service.",
        "background": "Weller Wing (Mental health ward) has been deemed \"not fit for purpose\". The 17 in-patients have been transferred to Houghten Regis, and the ward will be completely closed to out-patients too by March, with no time frame or budget for the services return.",
