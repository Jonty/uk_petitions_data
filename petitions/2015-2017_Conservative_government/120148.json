So terrorists and criminals can communicate anyway.\r\n\r\nBut the Investigatory Powers Bill asks companies to remove any \"protection\" someone has applied. This can only serve to invade privacy of the rest of us!\r\n\r\nSo the question is whether the government wish to allow iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, https, etc, with no intercept, or not?\r\n\r\nYes/No?",
