Fewer people are dying from stroke and treatment has improved considerably: \r\n\r\n\u2022\t82% of stroke patients now spend the majority of their hospital stay on a stroke unit compared to around 60% in 2010;  \r\n\r\n\u2022\taccess to immediate brain scanning has improved considerably with around 92% of patients receiving a brain scan within 12 hours of arriving in hospital compared to around 70% receiving a scan within 24 hours in 2010;\r\n\r\n\u2022\t85% of eligible patients now receive clot busting drugs, giving them a better chance of regaining their independence following a stroke, compared to 25% in 2010. \r\n\r\nThe stroke strategy remains valid and implementation continues. There are, therefore, no current plans to renew the strategy. However, action is being taken to ensure we continue to make progress on stroke. This action includes;\r\n \r\n\u2022\tongoing work across the country to organise acute stroke care to ensure that all stroke patients, regardless of where they live or what time of the day or week they have their stroke, have access to high quality specialist care;\r\n\r\n\u2022\ta cardiovascular disease (CVD) collaborative group, hosted by NHS England, is to coordinate reducing premature mortality in both primary and secondary care settings in relation to people with, or at risk of CVD including stroke; and\r\n\r\n\u2022\tNHS England\u2019s National Clinical Director for Stroke continues to work with the Urgent and Emergency Care Networks, clinical commissioning groups, voluntary agencies and individual providers to support better commissioning and provision of stroke care.\r\n  \r\nMore generally, the NHS Five Year Forward View recognises that quality of care, including stroke care, can be variable and that patients\u2019 needs are changing and new treatment options are emerging. The Five Year Forward View sets out high level objectives to address these issues.   \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health",
