        "action": "Make government publicly clarify the role of the referendum",
        "additional_details": "On the day of the result, Prime Minister David Cameron asked the nation, including those who voted to remain, to pull together in order to make sure the country remains united and strong in the coming years. The aim of this petition is exactly that. Those who voted to leave purely in order to expel non-UK citizens must be clearly informed that this will not occur and those dangerous ideologies which threaten social peace in the UK must be calmed.",
        "background": "Increasing hate speech and racist behaviour, fuelled by misunderstandings on the referendum, are threatening social stability. We need the population to receive a clear message that the referendum will not mean an automatic removal of non UK citizens and that this behaviour will not be tolerated.",
