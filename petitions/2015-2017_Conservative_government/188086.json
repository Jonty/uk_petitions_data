        "action": "Reduce the cost of swimming, particularly for under 5's, at public pools",
        "additional_details": "By doing personal research the average cost of an adult going swimming in south east council run swimming pools is \u00a35. Experts say confident swimmers are usually those that have started to be in the water from a baby or toddler. When my husband and I took our 8 month old daughter swimming to a session specifically for under 5's it cost us \u00a310.  Parents with children under the age of 1 year are advised not to have their babies in the water for more than 1/2 hour. \u00a310 for 1/2 hour is too expensive",
        "background": "With research indicating that 1 in 5 people over 14 unable to swim and 7 people dying in Britains sea over only one weekend in 2016 the importance of knowing how to swim and being confident in the water has never been more paramount.  Research indicates swimming is learnt best from a young age.",
