        "action": "Ask the Government to separately finance Police Forces dog/handlers units",
        "additional_details": "There is evidence showing that reducing Police Dog numbers has created extra work for Officers, this includes drug searches, weapons searches etc. A Police dog can cover these areas within a very short and cost effective time scale, where as a team of Police Officers doing the same searches would obviously cost a far greater sum of money. This way of cost saving is a very short sighted scheme, increasing Dog numbers will reduce Officer costs and will also help provide back up to Officers in need",
        "background": "With Police Forces being pressured into reducing overheads, some of the more specialist roles have been easy targets this includes the DOG SECTION, these vital roles have been reduced, thus creating more work for other Officers trying to do the same searching jobs as the dogs its a false economy.",
