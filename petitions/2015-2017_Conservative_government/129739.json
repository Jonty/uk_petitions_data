        "additional_details": "After going through an ordeal of feeling too afraid to leave this situation, there should be higher consequences for this type of abuse. Women are too afraid to come forward and often there isn't a lot of evidence to show abuse has happened, but there should be higher measures in place to refine abuse and allow women to come forward without feeling like they will be turned away without any physical scars, even if abuse still happened prior to reporting it. Mental abuse is real and needs stopping",
        "background": "I myself went through domestic abuse in a controlling and manipulative relationship which was difficult to escape as all aspects were controlled: finance, food, mental and physical violence.ALL these are still abuse and there should be higher consequences for ALL aspects of abuse, not just physical.",
