        "additional_details": "The UK's Brexit negotiations should allow polities to opt-out and inherit EU membership.\r\n\r\nThis avoids a gap between losing EU membership within the UK and regaining it under Article 49 accession.\r\n\r\nDemocracy (not Scottish nationalism) demands a referendum in Scotland.\r\n\r\nNew constitutional paths should be explored for Gibraltar and Northern Ireland that respect their links to UK, economic ties to EU and (esp NI) complex politics. \r\n\r\nAny changes should coincide with (and depend on) Brexit.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "That the UK voted to Leave whilst 1 territory and 2 nations voted to Remain poses obvious constitutional questions. The government should address those as a democracy, and offer apt constitutional arrangements (eg Scottish independence; others are more complex) which allow them to stay in the EU.",
