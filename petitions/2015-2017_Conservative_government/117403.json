You could start a new petition calling for Parliament to change the law, so that the FCA is required to conduct a review of banking culture.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could ask the Government to commission a separate independent review of banking culture, or to carry out a review using its own resources. \r\n\r\nYou might also be interested in the work of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, which looked at professional standards and culture in the UK banking sector: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.parliament.uk/bankingstandards\r\n"
