Yet FTSE chief executive pay can exceed 180 times their workers' average pay.  High executive pay is bad for people and is robbing business. ",

If you are referring to agreements reached between HMRC and companies/individuals to settle outstanding tax bills, rather than headline corporation tax, you need to be clear. Equally, you need to explain what you mean by executive pay and how you want a reduction in executive pay to operate (e.g. as a multiplier of other salaries in the company). At the moment, your petition is not clear enough for us to accept."
