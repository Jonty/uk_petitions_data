        "additional_details": "Linton Kwesi Johnson's 'Fite Dem Back' is as relevant today as when he wrote it in 1979 - and that is disgraceful. We ask that MPs consider changing the National Anthem in order to better represent the urgent need for resistance to the upsurge of fascist rhetoric and racist attacks in the UK, and to demonstrate our solidarity with BME Brits, migrants, refugees, EU citizens and anti-racist organisers who fight racist violence and abuse every day. Let's send a clear message: Wi wi' fite dem back!",
        "background": "The current UK national anthem, which celebrates nationalist conflict and entrenches divisions between peoples and nations, is no longer fit for purpose. We need a national anthem that can unite us against the horrors of right wing, fascist and racist hatred. We need 'Fite Dem Back'.",
