        "additional_details": "There are more and more building permissions being granted with no road infrastructure to deal with the increased traffic. The A628 Hollingworth/Glossop bypass has been required since the early 70's with inquiry after inquiry resulting in absolutely nothing. It is one if not the busiest A road in Britain for HGV's and something needs to be done to relieve the problem.",
        "background": "The roads around the area are becoming blocked with traffic. There is one main road in and out and when this has any work done to it the town grinds to a halt. The secondary road had recently collapsed and has caused a huge demand on an already overloaded road. ",
