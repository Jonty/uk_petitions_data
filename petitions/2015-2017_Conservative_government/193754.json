Are their pets just meant to wait in pain to die? ",
        "background": "Vet bills are ridiculously expensive, even the minor things like vaccines and checkups are costly - it's not fair that pets have to suffer because their families can't afford the bills at the vets for them at the time they need it. \r\n\r\nSome things need to be free - such as neutering and spaying.
