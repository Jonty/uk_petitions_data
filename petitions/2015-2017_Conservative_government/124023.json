        "action": "Lower the cervical cancer smear test age to 18",
        "additional_details": "So many young women and girls have unfortunately lost their lives to this silent killer all because cases of cervical cancer are considered less likely in women under 25 and are more likely to test and that only 65 out 3000 cases diagnosed are under 25 but they are still cases none the less. Surely the unfortunate deaths of previous young women considered 'underage' have not died in vain. Women's rights have come along way but why isn't this a given right for young women everywhere?",
        "background": "Over the years on the news and media the country has taken witness to many unfortunate undiagnosed cases of cervical cancer. Many girls considered 'underage' losing their lives to cervical cancer because they are deemed a lesser risk... Previous events say otherwise",
