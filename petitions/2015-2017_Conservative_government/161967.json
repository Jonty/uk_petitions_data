        "additional_details": "During the European referendum, we saw a misrepresentation of information and a lack of clear information from both sides of the campaign. The Independent (13/7/16) quoted the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, that we saw \u201cracist rhetoric about migrants and migration from the highest political levels in the UK\u201d. \r\n\r\nMany people were confused about which way to vote and needed greater clarity and materials that spoke directly to them.\r\n ",

It would also set best practice measures to ensure that all audiences have marketing material that explains key issues and context to their level of understanding.",
