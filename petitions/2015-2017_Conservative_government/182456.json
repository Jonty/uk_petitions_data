        "additional_details": "After speaking with parents who have childen with special educational needs in mainstream schools, we all agree our main concern is a lack of in depth training/understanding teachers have in our childrens conditions. This has a negative impact on not only our children but family life and others. We feel we aren't listened to in schools. our children are treated as less important within the school. Some get very little help or like my son who is autistic dyspraxic and dyslexic gets no help at all",
        "background": "Teaching staff are under trained in special educational needs and have a lack of understanding for these children. This impacts not only these children but other children in the school. This downfall in education will follow these children in adulthood in forms of depression. This needs to change ",
