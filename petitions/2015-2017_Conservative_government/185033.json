        "additional_details": "It is usually OBR's responsibility to produce these forecasts, but due to lack of disclosure of all relevant information are unable to do so. \r\nImmigration levels and the economic/statistical information typically provided in the OBR's Economic and Fiscal Outlook reports should be provided.\r\nShould Government feel negotiations will be prejudiced by revealing this information; they should commit to providing it as soon as feasible and certainly 3 weeks before final vote on Brexit terms take place.\r\n",
        "background": "The detailed plan for Brexit and new trade discussions are confidential, so nobody else can reliably forecast the impact Brexit will have over the next 10 years in terms of immigration levels and key economic measures. The Government forecasts should therefore be published as soon as possible.",
