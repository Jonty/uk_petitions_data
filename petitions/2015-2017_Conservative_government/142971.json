        "additional_details": "Only a minority of the electoral population voted to leave the EU - 37.4435%. Therefore, the decision to leave the EU and enact Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty should instead rest with a parliamentary vote, as the people's elected representatives in HM government.\r\n\r\nPrecedence can be found in the 1979 Scotland Devolution referendum; because less than 40% of the electorate voted for devolution, it could not be enacted.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, demand ALL MPs vote whether or not to leave the EU.",
        "background": "In the EU referendum, 17,410,742 people voted to leave, of a registered electorate of 46,500,001. This constitutes only 37.44% of the electoral population. Therefore it is NOT A MAJORITY mandate. Since the referendum is also only advisory, parliament instead should now vote whether or not to leave.",
