        "action": "Allow fathers paternity pay after 26 weeks service at any stage of pregnancy",
        "additional_details": "I started my new employment 16th March 15, my 26 weeks ended 16th September. However, my baby is due 27th October, making the pregnancy currently stand at 35 weeks. As such, I don't qualify for paternity pay.\r\n\r\nIn summary; even though I have completed my 26 weeks continuous service and my child is not yet born (meaning I don't yet need to take paternity leave), I still don't qualify for paternity pay.\r\n\r\nIf i had joined my company a mere 2 months earlier, I would qualify. This is nonsensical.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Under the current law, employed fathers must complete 26 weeks continuous service by the end of the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth, known as the qualifying week\r\n\r\nIt should be changed so that the father can claim the paternity pay provided that his 26th week ends before the birth",
