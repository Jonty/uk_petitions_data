        "additional_details": "The blue badge scheme was designed to facilitate disabled drivers getting closer to their destination due to their disability. Most councils have made concessions for disabled drivers to park free of charge on/off street, however it seems that privately operated car parks (which are most retail parks and supermarkets) are being allowed to waiver the concession rights of disabled drivers. I want this to change so that disabled concession of free parking applies to all on/off street parking. ",
        "background": "I recently received a parking charge notice stating that I had contravened the parking terms and conditions of a car park. Upon investigating the terms and conditions I noted that there were no disabled concessions allowed. I find this unacceptable as disabled drivers often require concession. ",
