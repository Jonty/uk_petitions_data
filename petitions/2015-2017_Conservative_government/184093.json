        "action": "Amend the SOA 2003 so that rape is no longer defined by only penetration.",
        "additional_details": "Approximately 12,000 men in England and Wales are victims of sexual assault each year. The crushingly high standard of masculinity that we hold men to means that around 96% of these assaults go unreported. More needs to be done to shift this heavy burden of masculine expectation which we as a society instil upon young boys, and which remains with them throughout their lives. Lets change this legislation, to ensure male rape victims get the full justice they deserve.",
        "background": "Changes are needed for rape legislation in the UK which, under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, is only defined by penetration. This law does not allow all male rape victims full justice and means that female perpetrators, rapists, cannot be charged with rape and instead face charges of sexual assault.",
