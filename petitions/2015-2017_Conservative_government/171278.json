As the new system is based on percentages, the highest scores will be given a 9. Although the next year, those same scores could receive a different level as they are not in the top percentage.",
        "background": "With the new grading system at GCSE's, employers are presented with grades 1-9 instead of F-A*. It provides an unfair system in which pupils are graded on the highest percentage in their year and not their personal grades. So we're asking you to help us bring our A* back!",
