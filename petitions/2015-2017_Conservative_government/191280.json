        "additional_details": "As somebody who is directly affected by this lack of law and know many other young people in similar situations at school, who have all felt just how devaluing it is to have this basic right refused to us. I believe it is essential that all transgender students are safe to feel respected and valued in our secondary schools across England.",
        "background": "In some secondary schools in England it states in their gender policy that all transgender students should be allowed to be referred to by their chosen pronouns and name. However this is unfortunately not the case in all schools across England.",
