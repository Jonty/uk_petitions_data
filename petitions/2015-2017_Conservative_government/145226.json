        "additional_details": "The course will be a core subject from Year 7 to Year 11 and will function similar to PSHE/Social Studies. The course will cover various political ideologies, methods of government, our countries voting system and parties, the pros and cons of democracy and dictatorship, a look at the historical origins of particular ideologies, key historical figures, important events, as well as regular class debates on current issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "It is time for real political education.\r\n\r\nThe course will give students a clear understanding of where they stand politically and how our country works. This means that when they turn 18, they can make an informed decision, which in turn provides a fairer and more accurate democratic process.",
