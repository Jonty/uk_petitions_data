        "action": "Establish a constitutional convention",
        "additional_details": "Local and parliamentary elections are undemocratic as voters do not get the result they voted for overall, due to the first past the post voting system. The House of Lords is entirely appointed. We have incomplete devolution and our legislature is not set up to deal with this satisfactorily. We need a constitutional convention to address these issues and draft a written constitution. With our exit from the EU having so much impact, this is the perfect time for this initiative.",
        "background": "The UK has no written constitution. We also have a highly undemocratic voting system which consistently results in one party getting majority control with a minority of votes. We need a constitutional convention to address this and other issues like the House of Lords and leaving the EU.",
