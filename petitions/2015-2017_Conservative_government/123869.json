        "action": "Raise the Legal Age for Cigarette Sales to 21",
        "additional_details": "The biggest reason to raise the legal age to 21 is to reduce young people\u2019s access to tobacco when they are more likely to become addicted and when their brains are still developing. Studies have found that nicotine, the main addictive ingredient in cigarettes, can impair cognition among young people. About 90 percent of adult smokers first use cigarettes before turning 19, and almost all smokers start before age 26, according to an Institute of Medicine study published last year. Let's do this.",
        "background": "By raising the legal age for smoking cigarettes, and by bringing this change to our societies we could help prevent many young people from becoming addicted and reduce premature deaths from lung cancer and other tobacco-related diseases.",
