        "additional_details": "To reduce the problems the next generation will inherit, effective progress on the causes of climate change is needed now. It is incumbent on the UK, instigator of the Industrial Revolution, to play a leading role. Events must not be allowed to deflect us from our international commitments, or from energetically raising the expectations on all countries. Our overriding national focus must be to decarbonise our own economy (putting it on a sustainable basis and reducing air pollution).",
        "background": "Climate Change is our greatest challenge, its most serious consequences will be felt by subsequent generations. A cumulative long-term global process, it can only be overcome by sustained international co-operation. Inertia in the system means that further climate change is already inevitable.",
