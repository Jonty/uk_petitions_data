        "additional_details": "TV debates have become one of the main avenues for voters to test party leaders in the run-up to elections and indeed to learn more about politicians ideas and respective party manifestos. We need to ensure all party leaders are held to account in the most effective way, and television has proven time and again to be the best medium through which voters can most readily see for themselves what is on offer in the general election. Ignoring TV debates is simply undemocratic. ",

We must ensure that she is held accountable and is forced to debate her ideas and plans with other party leaders, so that voters get the best chance of making up their mind.  ",
