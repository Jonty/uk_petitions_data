        "additional_details": "I've seen many viral video's of babies/children having their ears pierced which lead to them screaming out and holding their breathe due to excruciating pain felt and caused by the negligence and misguided decisions of the parents choosing to inflict this upon them, leaving them with no choice, all to please the parents' need to decorate a child with jewels. When will this stop? Who will protect their innocence if not their own parents? Protect their right not to have this pain put upon them!",
        "background": "I believe ear piercing of minors is wrong. It shows that a parent is willing to inflict unnecessary pain to a child when doing so serves of no benefit to them, its all for decorative purposes. These children are innocent and unaware of the pain that is to come. Will you help protect their innocence?",
