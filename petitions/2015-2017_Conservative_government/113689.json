Even though the plans have been approved we still need to understand how allocating acres of land will convert into jobs, when we have empty buildings already. The way the council have consulted on this was not easy or transparent. We need the council to open the plans up for discussion and consultation before these plans go further. There is a more positive solution. We need 10k signatures!",
        "background": "Rotherham is in need of some tender loving care. The 15 year plan for Rotherham intends to take our green belt land away. Many individual groups have formed to oppose these plans to the best of their ability. We need to stand together as a full community to be heard and offer a different solution.",
