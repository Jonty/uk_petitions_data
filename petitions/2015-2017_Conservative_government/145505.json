Subject to paragraph 3, the Secretary of State shall exercise the power under paragraph 1 if at any time it appears likely to him  that a majority of those voting  would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom  and  form  part of a united Ireland.\" \r\n\r\nFull copy of the agreement can be found at: \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-belfast-agreement ",
        "background": "We the undersigned demand that the Secretary of State immediately call a border poll, as the test under the GFA* has been met due to the fact that the majority of the people in NI wish to remain within the EU.\r\n\r\nShe will never 'feel' that this test has been met which is profoundly undemocratic.\r\n\r\n",
