Why as a working family can we not claim our heating/food/fuel or even a second home as you don't quite live close enough to your work place? I'm pretty sure we know the laughter we as a people would be met with if we tried to do so, so why allow these individuals to do so and blatantly abuse the system with little to no reprucutions. \r\n\r\nI ask that we abolish MP expenses.",

For too many years now a system has been abused by MP's which shouldn't even exist in the first place. ",
