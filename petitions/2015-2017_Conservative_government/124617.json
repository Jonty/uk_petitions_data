        "additional_details": "I've had a bad back for 24 years.It took 14 years to be diagnosed and i was told that nothing could be done apart from injections for the pain. The waiting list on the NHS was so long that i lost my job. I recently saw a chiropractor who was very optimistic about helping my problem so i decided to give it a go, and i can't believe that after 5 visits i am beginning to feel an improvement,chiropractors need to be enlisted because they can do so much to help bad backs & help the NHS waiting list ",
        "background": "Due to the pain management dept within the NHS being so stretched its about time chiropractors were brought in to sort the problem out and get the waiting list down, because they can.",
