        "additional_details": "Recent events involving refugees fleeing Syria, Libya and other Middle Eastern countries have shown that the desperation people have experienced means they will risk life and limb to escape to a better and safer country. Many people would claim asylum if they could from their country of origin or the first safe country they arrive in to save a potentially deadly trip across unsafe waters. One person I know of is trapped in Egypt with no safe way out. They wish to claim asylum but can not. ",
        "background": "Currently if someone wishes to claim asylum in the UK they have to set foot in the UK to be able to claim asylum. This includes refugees. By allowing people to claim asylum in the country they are in it will help stem the flow of people risking their lives to get to the UK. ",
