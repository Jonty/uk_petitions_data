Migration brings many benefits but we have lost democratic control. This is even more dangerous because there are five more countries in the queue to join. If we Vote Leave, we can introduce a humane and fair points-based system that does not discriminate against people based on the country they live in.  \r\n\r\nVERY CLEAR ON WHAT PEOPLE VOTED FOR",

Yet this seems like part of the democratic result might be ignored - immigration",
