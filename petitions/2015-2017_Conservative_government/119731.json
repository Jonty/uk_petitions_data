        "additional_details": "Nursing is unlike any other university course because you have to work clinically and study full time. The nature of the course and the demands placed on students makes it very difficult to secure part time work to help fund studying. If nurse bursaries aren't reinstated they must be paid for their work. \r\n\r\nThe Government's stance on apprentices:\r\n\"As an apprentice you'll work alongside experienced staff, gain job-specific skills, earn a wage and get holiday pay, study towards a qualification.\"",
        "background": "Student Nurses have to work at least 2300 hours clinically over three years. Whilst supernumerary, they work 12.5 hour shifts (including night shifts and unsocial hours) and learn in practice. \r\n\r\nThey do this whilst studying full time; completing assignments and practical examinations.
