        "additional_details": "Motorcycles help in bringing down congestion and ease the strain on public transport during peak times in London. imagine how bad public transport would be if everyone that rode a scooter or bike suddenly stopped and got the train/tube or bus to work? Why should motorcyclists  have to pay an extra \u00a310 per day to ride into London?!? they hardly create any pollution compared to a car or bus. that \u00a310 charge will more than double the cost of most peoples commute and i think its wrong! \r\n",
        "background": "The government want to start charging motorists another tax from 2020 (even though they're talking about bringing this forward!) it's called the ULEZ charge (Ultra Low Emission Zone) and will affect anyone that commutes or rides into London on a daily basis. Motorcycles included!!",
