        "additional_details": "Since my daughter lilly started school in reception class in September, she has had head lice 9 times. I check all my childrens hair every evening & take preventative measures such as using nit repellent shampoo & using nit repellent spray every morning as well as plating my childrens hair to go to school with. Despite my efforts my children are still catching head lice due to irresponsible parents who choose to leave their children rife. I believe that by bringing back the 'nit nurse' into schools will help prevent the constant spread of the little pests! ",
