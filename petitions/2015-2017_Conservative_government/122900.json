The referendum is about the will of the people not the will of parliament or the will of individual politicians.  Everyone has an equal vote.  The mud slinging and manipulation of the media and civil service has to stop as politicians are clearly demonstrating how disconnected they are with the electorate.  Issue a document clearly stating the arguments for in vs out by the end of March and issue it to every household in the UK",
