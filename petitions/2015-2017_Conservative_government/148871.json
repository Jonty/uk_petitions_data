        "additional_details": "Regardless of potential effects on the outcome, students and workers aged 16+ should be allowed to have there voices heard in a national referendum. Referendums are rare occurrences and as someone who was unable to vote in the EU referendum due to being a meagre 5 months too young, and aware of some who missed the vote by mere days, it is a truly effective way to disenfranchise young people with politics at a time where falling turnout in elections is a poltical crisis.",
        "background": "Young people are affected by politics and not allowing young people, who will be most affected by constitutional change or a change in membership of international bodies like NATO, the UN and the EU, to vote on referendums of this nature, flies in the face of democracy.",
