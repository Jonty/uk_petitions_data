        "action": "Stop testing products and conducting \"research\" on animals. Start using machines",
        "additional_details": "We are able to use machines as limbs, vehicles, sources of information and to power what we know as society. It would be cheaper long term to use machines to conduct research instead of using animals who take up more time and money in maintaining cages, supplying food, and a general standard of health. Testing also causes detrement to the animals and damage to health. These experiments wouldnt ordinarily be tested on a small child would they? Alternatively, human VOLUNTEERS could be the subjects",
        "background": "Technology has been developed enough to do things like send humans into space, but we continue to conduct research on animals. It is a breach of The 5 Freedoms (animal equivalent to a human rights act). This is cruel, forced upon the animals and also more expensive long term to look after them. ",
