        "additional_details": "I'm sure many of you would have seen on tv or on the news cases of bad neglect to animals, and then hear that nothing much was done after to stop the owner doing it again. A caution simply isn't enough, it doesn't act as enough of a deterrent. They should face tough and just punishment for their crimes. If a human was left to die that person would be put in jail, I'm calling for the same if they were to do that to an animal. They can't speak out so we should gather together and do so for them!",
        "background": "The neglect and mistreatment of animals is all to common, and there is not a tough enough law in place to stop this happening. It should be that if an animal has been suffering in the hands of their owner then they should face tough sentences and time in prison. Animals don't deserve mistreatment ",
