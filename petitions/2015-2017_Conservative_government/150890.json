        "additional_details": "A lot of people say that, if you don't want to elect any of the candidates, spoil your ballot. But then how do we know how many people actually made an error and how many just didn't like any of their options? 'None of the above' would allow such a protest to be heard.\r\nSimilarly, an 'Abstain' option would allow people who want to be counted as part of the turnout but don't know which way to vote to do so without potentially skewing the result with a throwaway vote.",
        "background": "In today's democracy a lot of people put pressure on voting to make your voice heard, but sometimes people don't have a strong opinion or disagree with all options. 'Protest votes' and spoiling your ballot skew the vote. Additional options would allow more accurate opinions and better analysis.",
