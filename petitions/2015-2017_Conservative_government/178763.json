Trump is not welcome here. We need to explain that to him.\r\n",
        "background": "Donald Trump is now President of the USA. This has not stopped his racist and sexist behaviour.  His restriction of Muslims in particular is not acceptable in the UK. There is significant evidence that he has incited violence at his public rallies. This is not a man we want in our country.",
