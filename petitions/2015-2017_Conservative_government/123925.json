        "action": "Change the criminal justice on Domestic Violence and Common Assault.",
        "additional_details": "Legislation states that any common assault reported after 6 months will be dismissed. People can suffer DV for years, yet they only have a 6 month time frame to report to thw police. CPS will dismiss it which means that the perpetrator can abuse a person for years, yet the victim only has 6 months to do anything about this. This is diabolical. When a person has proof and finds the strength to report this, it should still be dealt with with the same level of importance.",
        "background": "Many people suffer Domestic Violence for years and often need time to recover from this and may not contact the police for several months due to being scared. The law unfortunately states that a common assault taken to CPS will be dismissed if the last assault was longer than 6 months ago.",
