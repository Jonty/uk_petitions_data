        "additional_details": "Please help us to eat better by making healthy food more affordable to those of us on low income. \r\n\r\nWe're not talking about low fat processed foods laden with hidden sugars. We're talking about real food like fruit, vegetables, lean meats, nuts, beans and fish. \r\n\r\nHealthy foods that are full of vitamins and antioxidants. \r\n\r\nHelp us to help others to help themselves. \r\n\r\nBy reducing the cost of real food we can feed our children better. This will contribute to healthier minds & bodies for the future.",
        "background": "In the UK it costs more to buy real healthy good quality nutritious food than it does to buy junk processed food. \r\nThe obesity epidemic in the UK is partly to do with not being able to afford proper food and relying on cheap processed food to fill us. \r\nWhole food shopping can cost around double.
