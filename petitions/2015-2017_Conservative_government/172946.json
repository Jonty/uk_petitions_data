        "additional_details": "Feminism is already on the rise: our education system should be at the forefront of the movement. Not just #heforshe and #equalpay trending on Twitter; but opening the minds of all students male, female and LGTBQ to believe in total equality for their generation, both at home and in the work place - so no matter what gender you are born, you can dream just as big, and command the same respect.\r\n\r\nI am aware that teachers have to cover what is on the exams but one week will not interfere too much.",
        "background": "As a fully qualified teacher I know first hand that some schools rarely teach about feminism at all. For just one week of the academic year, if we could teach not just the history of feminism, but celebrate the achievements of females today in every subject, we could inspire true equality in the U.K",
