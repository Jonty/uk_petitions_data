The first one is not legally binding on Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe full petition wording is: -\r\n\r\n\u201cWe ask the House of Commons and the House of Lords to legislate for a second EU referendum because voters were misinformed by the leave campaigners and in particular Vote Leave and UKIP and were misled concerning the consequences of a decision to leave the EU. The referendum needs to be held before the Article 50 notice is given.\u201d",
        "background": "Now the results have been published and the leave supporters\u2019 campaigns are revealed for what they are, which is to the most part very misleading to say the least, I ask you to legislate for a second referendum. ",
