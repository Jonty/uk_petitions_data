        "additional_details": "Further to the questionable nature of Cameron's decision to call a referendum, the Brexit vote is not legally binding, and was only ever called as an advisory referendum, meaning there is no legal obligation for Brexit to be carried out.  The following Independent article sums up the situation: http://tinyurl.com/j4xphp9  As signatories, we want the legal status of the referendum as an advisory vote to be recognised, and due consideration given as to whether it should stand.",
        "background": "David Cameron chose to call a UK referendum because of divisions within his own party, and not in the interests of the UK public.  The Conservatives are only in power on a majority of 35% so it is questionable that he had the right to call the referendum on behalf of the electorate.",
