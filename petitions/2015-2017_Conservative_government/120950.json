The average older driver is priced at \u00a31,006. ",

            "details": "The Government is aware that the cost of motor insurance can be high for new drivers and understands the concerns that have been expressed about this. The average cost of motor insurance for the 17-22 age group was estimated to be \u00a31277 as at January 2016 (MoneySavingExpert.com).\r\n\r\nIt is important to bear in mind that motor insurers have to provide unlimited cover against the risk of personal injury to third parties and cover of up to one million pounds for property damage.  \r\n\r\nThey use a wide range of criteria to assess the potential risk a driver poses and this includes the age of the applicant, the type of vehicle being driven, the postal area where the applicant lives and his/her driving experience.\r\n\r\nFigures from insurers show that as many as one-fifth of newly qualified drivers make a claim within the first six months. \r\n\r\nWhilst Government cannot intervene directly in the setting of premiums, what it can do is help to establish a situation where young and newly qualified drivers are better equipped for a life of independent driving.   \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Government has taken forward a programme of measures to strengthen the way people learn to drive and are tested and to provide opportunities for additional training for newly-qualified drivers.  We have also engaged insurers in this process, so that they can have confidence that additional measures will make a real difference that can be rewarded.\r\n\r\nWe are focussing our efforts on encouraging learner drivers to do more practice and to practise in a wider range of driving conditions; on ensuring that the driving test assesses the skills needed for today\u2019s roads and vehicles and those of the future; and on identifying the most promising behavioural, educational and technological interventions that can reduce young driver casualties. The Government\u2019s Road Safety Statement, published on 21 December 2015, announced a \u00a32 million research programme to identify the best possible interventions for learner and novice drivers.\r\n\r\nThe Road Safety Statement also conveyed the Government\u2019s wider commitment to addressing concerns about motor insurance premiums for all drivers. It says:\r\n\u201cWe will support innovation in the motoring insurance market so premiums become more responsive to safer driver behaviour and vehicle choice. This could include extending the \u2018reward based\u2019 insurance approach pioneered through young driver telematics products to the wider motoring community and fleets.\u201d \r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport\r\n",
            "summary": "Responsibility for setting premiums rests with insurers. The Government is strengthening the learning to drive process so that drivers can present themselves as a lower risk and obtain lower premiums ",
