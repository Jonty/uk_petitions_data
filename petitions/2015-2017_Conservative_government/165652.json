        "action": "Consolidate mobile telephone infrastructure networks under one umbrella company",
        "additional_details": "If the network infrastructure were to become owned by one umbrella company, then we could have excellent coverage no matter with which provider we were customers. The providers would then have a similar business relationship with the umbrella company as train operators have with Network Rail, or broadband providers have with BT Openreach. In attracting customers, providers could no longer rely on coverage, but would need to find innovative ways to be competitive.",
        "background": "Many of us consumers choose a mobile provider based on coverage in the areas where we live and work. But when we travel we often find connectivity is poor (or non-existent) in certain areas if we are customers of the wrong provider.\r\n",
