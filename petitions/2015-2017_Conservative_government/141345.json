The FCA requires adverts for financial products to be \"clear, fair and not misleading\". Similar rules should apply to political advertising where factual claims are being made.",
        "background": "The EU referendum campaign was marred by misleading presentation of data, most notably the \"\u00a3350m a week paid to the EU\" which the   ONS publicly refuted. There should be a requirement that data presented as fact should be capable of objective verification, and this should be enforced independently.",
