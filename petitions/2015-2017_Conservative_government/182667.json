        "additional_details": "The sentence is excessive for anyone let alone someone who has never murdered anyone, he has spent a good 80% of his sentence in solitary confinement. This man has served more then his fare share of prison time and should be released immediately. There is no question he may not have been an role model prisoner in the past, but just a simple Internet search will reveal that this man is reformed and draws and sells on his artwork for many charities.",
