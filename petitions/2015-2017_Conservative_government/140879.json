        "additional_details": "The UK voted to leave the European Union by a margin of 52% to 48%. Those voting Leave had varied reasons, including desire for more immigration controls, the cost of EU membership, the undemocratic nature of the EU, and UK sovereignty. No single reason was backed by all Leave voters.\r\n\r\nThe referendum result gives no mandate for us to leave the EEA, no mandate to end freedom of movement between the UK and Europe, and no mandate to abandon international agreements made while a member of the EU.",
        "background": "The UK has voted to leave the European Union, which should be respected. However, such a close result gives no mandate for us to leave the European Economic Area.\r\n\r\nNo majority backed ending free movement, breaking trade agreements with the EU, or abandoning commitments we made while EU members.",
