        "additional_details": "The e-petitions website was created in November 2006 and the created petitions cover everything from tax to immigration, moral and ethical concerns, education, science and the very direction of the country. \r\n\r\nIn 2015, the BBC reported \"an unnamed government minister branded the site an own-goal thought up by a \"prat\"\". \r\nPeople still don't feel the issues they are passionate about are taken seriously. We create and sign petitions because we want to see change, we want our voices to be heard. ",
        "background": "In late 2006 the government set up the e-petitions website as a way for people to engage with politics. Millions of people have signed petitions, but we still don't feel like these petitions are given any real attention or importance. Petitions having the chance to become laws would change this.",
