        "additional_details": "Dementia is an umbrella term for a range of cognitive impairments, that progressively get worse over time.\r\nAccording to Alzheimer's Society - \"There are 850,000 people with dementia in the UK, with numbers set to rise to over 1 million by 2025. 225,000 will develop dementia this yea; that\u2019s one every three minutes!\" And most shockingly \"There are over 40,000 people under 65 with dementia in the UK\".\r\n\r\nYet, many people do not have basic understanding of the signs and symptoms for Dementia.",
        "background": "I currently work in a dementia and complex needs hospital for the mental health service in the east of England. As we are aware, mental health has a stigma; and many don't realise dementia does too! Basic dementia awareness is not known to the general public. This needs to change and quickly.",
