            "details": "The UK Government shares the deep concern of the international community regarding the deteriorating political, humanitarian, and economic situation. The UK has reiterated to the Venezuelan Government the need to respect basic human rights and democratic freedoms, including the fundamental right to peaceful protest. In particular, we have raised our concerns with the Venezuelan Government about the disproportionate response by security forces, including the extensive use of tear gas and repeated use of lethal force. Since April, there have been more than 80 deaths during protests. It is crucial that all parties refrain from violent acts, which have resulted in multiple deaths.\r\n\r\nForeign Office Minister Sir Alan Duncan met the Venezuelan Foreign Minister, Samuel Moncada, on 26 October and raised our concerns at the deteriorating situation in Venezuela. We encourage both the Venezuelan Government and Opposition to focus on results-based negotiations in the interests of all Venezuelans.  It is vitally important that democratic processes and the Venezuelan Constitution are respected. This includes the right for all Venezuelans to decide their future in free, fair, and universal elections.\r\n\r\nIn March, the Minister hosted a delegation of Deputies from the Venezuelan National Assembly and stressed the importance of an independent and empowered legislature. He echoed these views in a statement issued on 31 March, following the Venezuelan Supreme Court\u2019s attempt to wrest power from the National Assembly. \r\n\r\nIn her previous role as Minister for Human Rights, Baroness Anelay visited Caracas in early May and delivered clear messages to senior government and opposition figures, expressing our concern at the political and humanitarian situation and the need to respect freedom of speech and the right to peaceful protest. \r\n\r\nFollowing the 5 July attack by pro-Government supporters on the National Assembly and democratically elected Deputies, Sir Alan Duncan issued a strong statement condemning the attack and calling for the Venezuelan Government to uphold the constitution and show respect for its democratic institutions.\r\nIn Caracas, the British Ambassador continues to raise the situation with the Venezuelan Government, the Opposition, and with member states of the Organisation of American States (OAS).  This is a critical time for Venezuela, and UK concerns over the situation have led Venezuela to be designated a Foreign and Commonwealth Office Human Rights Priority Country. This approach has resulted in close Embassy work with the Westminster Foundation for Democracy to help build the Venezuelan National Assembly as an institution and to strengthen Venezuelan democracy in the longer term.\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office",
