False claims were made and widely repeated.\r\n\r\nOne of the most disturbing themes of the campaign was a mistrust of expert opinions and academic/scientific evidence. Evidence available was largely ignored. That big decisions should be made on the basis of good evidence is not debatable.\r\n\r\nClearly, this needs to come from campaigners themselves. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36574526",
