        "additional_details": "Under UK Immigration Law, only partners of British nationals/settled persons facing domestic violence (DV) can apply for settlement.This law forces people with abusive immigrant partners to stay on in the marriage.I have worked in the UK as a legal adviser for 5+ years but endured intense DV.I spoke out a month before my immigrant spouse would have acquired settlement.Now, I cannot apply for settlement for myself/2 kids born in the UK, just because I did not endure violence for yet another month",
        "background": "In June 2016,I finally sought help about the Domestic Violence against me. It was just 1 month before my husband would have obtained his Indefinite Leave to Remain(ILR). He now has a criminal record and may not get ILR. I am not eligible to apply for DV ILR because he is neither British nor Settled",
