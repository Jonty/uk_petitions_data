        "additional_details": "The Science museum, who control the National Media museum, are trying to concentrate on scientific subjects at the cost of other cultural media. The National media museum should encompass a broad range of media, rather than emphasise scientific media. This will also shift tourism away from the north and further concentrate it in London.",
        "background": "Plans have been announced to relocate the Royal Photographic Society's collection from the National Media Museum in Bradford to the Victoria and Albert museum in London. This will endanger the long-term viability of the Bradford museum.",
