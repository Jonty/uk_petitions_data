        "additional_details": "Britain can solve the \u201cageing crisis\u201d and boost local communities by putting older people to work.  Every local service eg. education, health ,  child care, social services, could benefit but red tape and old attitudes get in the way.",
        "background": "Many older people 60-75 currently in retirement have energy, experience and wisdom.  Many wish to contribute to the local community and the economy.  They are a lost resource.  But while the private sector is aware and taking steps, the Government sector largely ignores this army of talent.",
