        "action": "Police to ask African heritage DV victims if they require specialist support",
        "additional_details": "Issues undeniably ours such as reduced likelihood of equal treatment, inappropriate reference points, increased likelihood of not being believed or taken seriously, repeated need to explain our cultural norms & language which result in us constantly educating and consoling others before we receive support.  We are petitioning for it to be mandatory that African heritage women are offered the chance to speak to a domestic or sexual abuse specialist from the African heritage community. ",
        "background": "In 2014 Valerie Forde and baby daughter died as a result of a vicious attack by an ex partner/the child's father. A Domestic Homicide Review report found police made mistakes which may have contributed to their deaths. Research has shown that African heritage people are less likely to report abuse.",
