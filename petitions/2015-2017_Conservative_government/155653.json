        "additional_details": "The BBC Reality Check clearly lays out the evidence that a wide range of LEAVE campaign claims misled the British Public.  Full details can be found at:\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35603388.\r\nAn example is the claim we send \u00a3350m a week to Brussels, which could be spent on the NHS. After the Referendum the LEAVE team have admitted this was a mistake and we will not be able to spend this money on the NHS.\r\n",
        "background": "Giving misleading evidence can be considered contempt of Parliament.  In the EU Referendum the LEAVE campaign gave misleading information to the UK public.   A Referendum that is critical to the future of the United Kingdom cannot be allowed to stand when it is based on misleading information.",
