        "additional_details": "A learner driver is prohibited from using a motorway, and their first use of a motorway will only be after they have passed their driving test. Drivers need to be tested on their practical competence and application of the rules before being allowed on motorways alone. \r\n\r\nOn a daily basis I witness motorist's breaching rules 264, 267 & 268 of the Highway Code which cover lane discipline and overtaking. DoT report of road traffic accidents shows an increase of people killed or seriously injured. ",
        "background": "Motorists lack of knowledge of the Highway Code is creating a culture of dangerous driving, which is likely to be the cause of many accidents.\r\n\r\nI would like to see the current driving test revised to introduce a new \r\n2nd part that tests a motorists practical competence of motorway driving.
