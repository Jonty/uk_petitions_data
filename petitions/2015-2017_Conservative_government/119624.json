        "additional_details": "Thatcher was responsible for deregulating the markets which in the end lead to market instability and the great recession of 2008. Thatcher provoked the Miner's Strike and closed the coal pits in a traumatic fashion which still leaves scars today. Thatcher tried to bring in a poll tax which disproportionately affected the least well off. This sparked a riot in the centre of London. For these reasons she is divisive as an historical figure, and should not have public money honouring her.",
        "background": "Thatcher was a divise figure. She does not command the respect of the country. Rather she left deep scars of pain in many quarters. The current Government are forcing extreme austerity. Welfare cuts are justified by the slogan \"We are all in this together\". \u00a315m should not be spent on this.\r\n",
