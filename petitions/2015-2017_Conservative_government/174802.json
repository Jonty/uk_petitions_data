        "additional_details": "As it has become obvious that the rate of the sterling pound has gone down extremely this may go down further as the time goes along. The costs for importing and exporting goods not only from the EU but from around the world is going to increase.\r\nThis brexit vote could also mean that UK citizens that are in the EU (primarily it is students)may have difficulties to remain there and the same goes for EU citizens in the UK. Now that you have seen some of the results of brexit so PLEASE THINK AGAIN.",
        "background": "Earlier in June, Britain had a referendum, in which UK citizens had to vote to decide whether they wanted UK to remain a part of the European Union or not. The results were as such 48% voted to remain and 52% voted to leave, this 4% difference has/is caused/ing many major changes. We need a re-vote.",
