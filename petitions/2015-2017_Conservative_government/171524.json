        "action": "To limit fireworks to organised, licenced events before 9 at night.",
        "additional_details": "One of my dogs who had had dental surgery began to bleed again due to her being stressed..repeatedly. People who have to get up early,  young children and the elderly cannot sleep. I'm a nurse who has witnessed elderly dementia patients think they're back in world war 2 because the loud bangs remind them of bombs going off. At least if fireworks were limited to set days and times we could prepare for it better. You can't give animals calming medication continually just in case.",
        "background": "I feel that nervous animals, the elderly and young children suffer when fireworks are set off at all hours on any day. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 1  o clock in the morning last night for example. ",
