        "additional_details": "Each container costs 2p more but the plastic and polystyrene ones cost in landfill which is problem that needs facing. As a people we need to change our views on looking after this planet and the swap across to these products is a big step in the right direction. I feel that the takeaway industry is a major contributor in regards to plastic and polystyrene waste and should be addressed like the plastic bag issue was. We are running out of time to turn this world into the wonder it should be. ",
        "background": "I would like to place a charge on every plastic and polystyrene container used by the food industries and takeaway industries like the plastic bag charges brought in. Hopefully this will push people to use the eco-friendly products that are on the market but that are over looked due to the prices. ",
