        "action": "Delay the date of the EU Referendum to allow as many people to vote as possible",
        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister himself has admitted that the likes of referendums like these only come around once every generation. It is the younger generations who will have to live with the outcome of this referendum for the majority of their lives, potentially all of it. I will turn 18 just 4 months after the referendum is rumoured to take place: denied a voice for the sake of 4 months. If the referendum were to be delayed until 2017, thousands more young people will have a say in their own future.",
        "background": "The attempt to extend the franchise for the EU Referendum to 16 year-olds was unsuccessful, meaning thousands of young people and future voters will be denied a voice in this constitutionally significant referendum. By delaying the referendum, as many young people as possible will be able to vote.",
