        "action": "Make PIP and Atos assessors understand how eplipsy effects someone day 2 day.",
        "additional_details": "The Atos assessment do not want to accept that it causes long term mental damage. Even if they did a bit of research on epilepsy they would understand how each type of seizure affects the person's brain in the long run. PIP won't go to the specialists only want the Atos assessors' view, which is discriminatory of the applicant as they are not trained in that field. Many Atos assessors are just GP nurses with no advanced medical training in this field.",
        "background": "As epilepsy is a internal mental condition they can't look on the outside of patient and see how it effects their mental state. This is a digressive condition and effects people differently, due to type of seizure they have. Only a specialist (neurologist) can tell them how it affects that person.",
