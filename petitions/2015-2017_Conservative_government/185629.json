        "background": "The inclusion of this ingredient is offensive to vegans and vegetarians and to people from a wide range of religious backgrounds.\r\n\r\nAs consumers, we can choose which products to buy based on our deeply held personal beliefs, but the currency of the land needs to be for everybody.",
