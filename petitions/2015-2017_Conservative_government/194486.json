        "action": "Put the teaching of life-saving skills into the curriculum for schools from 8-18",
        "additional_details": "Outside of hospital only 6% survive CPR in the UK whereas in parts of Europe, Scandinavia and USA the figure is up to 56%.  The key difference is that those countries train their junior school children and keep training them through their education.  I am proposing that we change the curriculum to improve our ability as a nation.  Adults do not feel confident in life saving situations because they have not been trained as children. Training our children will change the future of the UK.",
        "background": "To put life saving skills on the school curriculum from 8 years old until 18 and train students in CPR, Defibrillation, Recovery Position and Choking will vastly improve our ability as a nation to save lives outside of hospital. Adults will then have the confidence and skill to be effective.",
