        "action": "Stop the spending of \u00a31.9million taxpayers money on a pointless wall in Calais.",
        "additional_details": "The UK government and Calais mayor want to build a 4m high border wall around the ferry port at Calais to the tune of \u00a31.9million of UK tax money. This would drastically affect the safety of refugees trying to cross into the UK who would have to face further devastatingly dangerous situations. The wall would also present the first border wall to be erected in Europe since the Berlin wall.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you agree we should be seeking better solutions than building pointless walls.",
        "background": "The UK government invested over \u00a320million of tax payers money reinforcing UK border security at the port of Calais in 2014. Stop them investing a further \u00a31.9million on a pointless wall.",
