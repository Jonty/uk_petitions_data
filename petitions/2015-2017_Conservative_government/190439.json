        "additional_details": "We voted to leave the EU but did not vote upon the terms of our exit, which were never debated during the run up to the referendum, only speculated upon. HM Government's current policy seeks to appeal to only a small number of ardent Leavers and does not represent the more moderate desires of Remainers, moderate Leavers and \"Regrexiteers, who by many estimates now make up the majority of those who voted. We would ask HM Government to debate if the current policy suitably represents their wishes.",
        "background": "Remainers accept the Referendum outcome, but many feel that this government's current hard Brexit policy does not represent the 48% who voted Remain and the moderate Leavers who hoped for a softer Brexit. We want Parliament to debate if the current proceedings truly represent The Will of the People.",
