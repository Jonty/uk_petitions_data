        "additional_details": "People are rarely prosecuted for such offence yet regularly ticketed for parking on yellow lines and loading bays. Private landowners also turn a blind eye to inconsiderate people parking in disabled bays and it should be mandatory for these people to be prosecuted. Make it the law for people illegally parked on public land to be fined ( like they would be in any other situation) and make it more straightforward to prosecute those illegally parked on private land.",
        "background": "\r\nIt should be an offence for a non disabled driver to park in a place designated for a disabled person. The same should apply to parent and toddler spaces. These spaces are provided for a reason and should only be used by the appropriate person.",
