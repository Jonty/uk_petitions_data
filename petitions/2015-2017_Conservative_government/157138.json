        "additional_details": "This referendum and outcome has created a divided society that is leaping into an economic and social unknown. The Prime Minister has rightly resigned over this victory, but we fail to see a concrete plan emerging from the spilt Conservative Party. Having taken control of the decision to leave, the British people do not want an unelected Prime Minister creating the terms of our departure and future. A Brexit PM needs the mandate of the people, only this can reunite our broken wounds.",
        "background": "The referendum has narrowly spoken and we will leave the EU soon. However, the terms are not yet clear; the British people deserve the right to now choose the party that has the best exit strategy and the Prime Minister most capable of leading us there.",
