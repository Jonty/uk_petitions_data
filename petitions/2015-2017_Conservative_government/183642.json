        "action": "Make it an offence for a candidate to broadcast a falsehood for electoral gain.",
        "additional_details": "The recent successful action for libel brought by three MP's against an MEP from another party illustrate the problem perfectly: they were able to seek redress in a civil action for libel after a political opponent broadcast a falsehood. However, a deceived electorate cannot seek this type of redress at the High Court if it finds it was duped during an election. To provide that redress, 'Knowingly and deliberately broadcasting a falsehood for electoral gain' should be a criminal offence.",
        "background": "Many feel that candidates for elected office have overstepped the boundary of what is fair or proper in campaigning. Presenting your beliefs in a favourable light is one thing, but there have been accusations of deliberate and knowing misrepresentation of fact in recent elections and the referendum.",
