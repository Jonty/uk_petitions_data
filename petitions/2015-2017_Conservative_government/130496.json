        "additional_details": "It is very difficult for ordinary people to reduce the amount of CO2 that they produce. I have to heat my house in winter, drive to work and I like to go on holiday somewhere warm. Although I can reduce my consumption a bit, I can't reduce it enough to make a difference on my own. However if I work with other people I can make a difference.\r\n\r\n \"Carbon offsetting\" allows me to pay other people to reduce their CO2 emissions and \"offset\" my own. Here are some examples of offsetting projects https://www.bptargetneutral.com/uk/our-projects/a-global-portfolio/",
        "background": "Driving my car contributes to global warming because burning fuel produces CO2. I would happily choose to pay an extra penny or so to offset my carbon, for example, by planting a tree. We will empower every driver to make a difference and show that Britain can lead the world in CO2 reduction.",
