        "action": "UK Government to rescind fracking licences to Shale Gas companies in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Scotland and Wales have already banned fracking yet the UK Government have granted licences across huge swathes of England in many old coal mining areas. This is despite irrefutable evidence of the dangers of fracking in old mining areas. Many countries across the world and Europe have banned fracking due to public health concerns. The state of New York also banned fracking on grounds of serious risk to public health following a rigorous six year study. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Fracking is harmful to the environment, human health and wildlife. The technique of fracking requires millions of gallons of water, sand and hundreds of chemicals harmful to human health and is done at very high pressure in vertical and horizontal wells to fracture solid rock deep underground.",
