        "additional_details": "Charliesfight.org has made me realise no parent should have to try raise money to save their child's life. Giving a working class family one month to raise \u00a31.2million or they switch of their babies machine is heartbreaking. With a readily available fund curtesy of the UK tax payer cases like Charlie's could be funded and sent to America for the life saving treatment needed. 50p a month from every UK tax payer would raise millions of pounds and save lives whilst costing the government nothing. ",
        "background": "It should be a requirement of the government to take 50p a month from every tax payer and start a fund for life saving treatment that is not available in the UK. No one should have to try to raise money to save their child's/family members life, it should be readily available as and when it's needed",
