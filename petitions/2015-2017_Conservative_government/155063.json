        "additional_details": "Regardless of our opinion of the man, his actions gave the British people a chance to decide their future. We honour celebrities for their 'service' to the nation. What greater service to a people can there be than to give that people an opportunity to make a decision for themselves, a decision since shown to be opposed by the same people who are supposed to represent the people. The more that media deride the decision of the people, the more the significance of his contribution is made clear.",
        "background": "The right to decide on our future would have remained a decision decided solely by those in London clearly aligned with Remain. It is only by his long determination to see a vote by the British people that the issue was put to the British people and vindicated by a clear vote for Leave.",
