        "additional_details": "A painted bay, or a designated parking space outside a sufferer's home would make a great difference.\r\nIt's not just IBD, there are thousands of people within the UK that suffer from chronic illness that would benefit from a parking space outside their home.\r\nLocal councils will not help as some sufferers cannot register as disabled, and therefore are not legally obliged to help and in may cases won't.\r\nWe're not asking to park in disabled bays, just the ability to park outside our own homes.",
        "background": "There are an estimated 300,000 people living with IBD in the UK, and not all of these people can register as disabled. This means that those who don't have a driveway or a designated parking space outside their home can struggle to park and get inside quickly when suffering a flare up.",
