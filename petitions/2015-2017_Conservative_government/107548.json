        "additional_details": "The Cancer Drugs Fund was an emergency budget introduced to save or prolong lives while the National Institute for Clinical Health ponders on whether to agree funding. In a crass, hurried review of the drugs on the list massive cuts were made both in May then again September 2015 which denies potentially thousands of people remission from cancer, They quote the drug manufacturers' figures based on average extension of life but these figures do not represent a huge number of people who gain years from these drugs as they include people who immediately fail to respond to them.",
