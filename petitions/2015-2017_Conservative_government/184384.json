        "additional_details": "It is time for all citizens of the UK and politicians of all parties to face up to the fact that the NHS and Social Care system in all parts of the UK needs substantially greater funding. Replacing Trident is estimated to cost between \u00a3100 billion and \u00a3200 billion \u2013 scrapping the system would allow \u00a35 billion (more than double the current annual increase) to be available every year for the next 20-40 years.",
        "background": "Ask politicians to think again and divert funding from nuclear weapons systems (replacing Trident) to pay for much larger annual increases in funding for the NHS and our Social Care system in order to provide the efficient, properly staffed and well equipped system that we all need and deserve.
