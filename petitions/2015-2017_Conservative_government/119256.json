        "additional_details": "Up until now broadband providers could use the excuse that you need the phone line for the broadband to run down. But there\u2019s a gaping hole in this argument if you have fibre broadband, rather than your old-school ADSL copper line.\r\n\r\nThe way we use our landlines and make our calls has changed beyond recognition in the past decade \u2013 so perhaps the way line rental is charged for broadband should change too? And, in some cases, maybe the charge should be dropped altogether.",
        "background": "Why should we have to pay for a service we\u2019re not using? It seems a little unfair to say the least, and for many, a landline phone falls into this category. If you only use broadband, why must you pay for line rental?\r\n",
