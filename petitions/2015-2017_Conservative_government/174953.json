This kind of fine is issued by local councils, not the Government or Parliament. \r\n\r\nIf you are concerned about this happening in your local area, you could raise your issue with a local councillor, who represents you. You can use this page to find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\r\nIf you want the Government or Parliament to take action, you could ask them to change the law, so that local councils no longer have the power to issue fines to homeless people in this way."
