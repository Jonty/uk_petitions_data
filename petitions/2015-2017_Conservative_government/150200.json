Let us make sure that the political leadership for this next, crucially important phase have a watertight democratic mandate.\r\n\r\nNot all the people who voted Tory in the last election will be supporters of the new Prime Minister.  \r\n\r\nIt appears that a number of people who voted for the Labour Party in the last election do not agree with the current Labour leadership on the EU.\r\n\r\nVoters for other parties may also wish to chose new leaders.",
        "background": "The result of the referendum and the resignation of the Prime Minister has created a new political situation for the UK.\r\n\r\nGiven the impact of the exit negotiations on all UK citizens, it is essential that the process is led by political leaders who have a specific democratic mandate for this role.",
