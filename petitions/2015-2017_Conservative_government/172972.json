        "additional_details": "Care homes/Residential homes charge an extorionate rate for the care they provide, ranging from \u00a3800 to \u00a31000+ per week. Some places are locally funded, whilst others are privately funded, meaning the person living there has to pay full price, for the care they receive. Locally funded places, will take into account someones pension, and will only pay some of the cost,leaving the person very little \"pocket money\". But atleast they have some money! All care homes/Residential homes, should allow for the fact that someones money will run out eventually and should make provisions for this, allowing the elderly person to go over to locally funded monies, without moving them on,so the elderly person, will be secure in the place they live, to live outtheir final days.",
        "background": "Why should the elderly have to lose all their money, sell their property to pay for their care when they have to go into a care/residential home? Then when the money runs out, they have to move on?",
