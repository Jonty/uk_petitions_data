        "additional_details": "More and More homeless are appearing on the streets of the UK, some have lost everything and have nowhere to turn so do the best they can by sleeping on the streets and begging , some are war veterans who have fought then been cast to one side as they as if a person is expendable, so turn to drugs and alcohol to fade out the pain. Homelessness is not normal and these people need support and not to be cast aside, ignored, left to freeze to death on the street or forced into crime to survive.",
        "background": "I want the government to make FREE temporary housing provisions available and accessible throughout the UK and give our homeless support to find permanent housing, lifestyles support such as counselling so they can regain a functioning position within society again ",
