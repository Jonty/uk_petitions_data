We all have the responsibility to use it wisely, support those working in it & keep it public. \r\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies already warns that taxes will need to increase to 'combat the UK's persistent budget deficit' (P. Inman. The Guardian. 07/02/2017) If we, the general public, are willing to voluntarily ask for this increase, we must make it incumbent on politicians to ensure that it is RING FENCED for NHS & Social Care only.",
        "background": "Given the increasingly urgent reports of crisis in the NHS & Social Care sectors, with rise in demand and lower budgets, we urge all politicians to take immediate steps to allow the increase of Tax or NI contributions by \u00a31, to provide PROTECTED funds for NHS & Social Care at point of delivery.",
