        "additional_details": "The current system has not successfully addressed the problem of delay. This is partly because the way in which fact finding hearing are approached by the courts and practitioners means there is often a great delay before applications for contact and residence are ultimately determined. It is the mantra of every child law practitioner that delay is inimical to a child\u2019s best interest. In cases where domestic violence is alleged, delay translates as delay in a parent",
        "background": "Mothers are using false allegations of domestic violence to stop any contact or resident orders through the courts knowing it will go straight to a fact finding hearing.  All contact is stopped with the child until the investigation is over which could be 12 mnths.  If innocent it is very unfair. ",
