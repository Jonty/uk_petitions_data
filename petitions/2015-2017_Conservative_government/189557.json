        "action": "Make companies prove equal pay for women",
        "additional_details": "We were inspired to make this petition due to Iceland announcing today the decision to enforce companies of 25 or more staff to prove that they pay all employees the same regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexuality or nationality. If the UK Government is as dedicated to equality as they say they are, then they should force all companies to do the same. ",
        "background": "Women can expect to earn significantly less than men over their careers as a result of differences in caring responsibilities, clustering in low skilled and low paid work, the qualifications and skills women acquire, and outright discrimination. The overall gap is 13.9%.",
