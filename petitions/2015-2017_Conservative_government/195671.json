It's my job to speak up for young people living in my constituency and across the country, and ensure their voices are heard. Through my work as MYP I've seen first hand how passionate and informed young people are about politics. I think it's criminal that 16 and 17 year olds were denied the right to vote in the EU referendum. This election can and should be the opportunity to set that right. We cannot be silenced.",
        "background": "16 and 17 year olds were denied the right to vote in the EU referendum in 2016, despite the success of lowering the voting age for the Scottish Independence referendum in 2014. A snap election has been called to give the government a Brexit mandate. 16 and 17 year olds need to be a part of that. ",
