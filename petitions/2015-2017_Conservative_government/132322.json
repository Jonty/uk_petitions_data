        "action": "A review of the British High Comission Visa Department in Pakistan.",
        "additional_details": "Currently, the British High Commission charges fees from Rs14,000 to Rs100,000 for visas of different categories and durations. In some cases Pakistanis have submitted a number of a applications to the BHC for visas, and paid the fee a number of times, only to be turned down without a justifiable reason. This could be in fear of terrorism, which is understandable at the current time, however this does not highlight why thousands of applicants are being tuned down without a justified reason.",
        "background": "The British High Comission has been rejecting thousands of UK Visa applicants from Pakistan in a unsophisticated way. So I plead to the British Government to review the ongoing in Pakistan's visa department, as rate of rejection is currently higher than ever, and this is not humanly right.",
