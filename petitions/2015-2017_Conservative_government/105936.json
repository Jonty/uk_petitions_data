        "additional_details": "The UK law states it is illegal to modify a vehicle exhaust system which makes it noisier than when the vehicle was type approved. Additionally the police can take action if the vehicles silencer does not work in the way it was designed for or the vehicle is driven in such a way as to create too much noise but there is an unchecked growing trend of modified noisy vehicles on our public highways causing nuisance.\r\nreference- https://www.gov.uk/noise-pollution-road-train-plane/vehicle-noise-limits",
        "background": "Certain groups of vehicle owners are modifying exhaust systems on vehicles which makes them noisier than when the associated vehicle was type approved for use on UK roads. Current MOT tests and police methods for removing such vehicles from the public highway are not fit for purpose.",
