        "additional_details": "On 23rd June 2016 the UK decided to leave the EU in it's current form. \r\n\r\nWhat happens next is up to our democratically elected politicians to decide.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain though - we should not allow a minority to keep asking the same question in the hope they will somehow game the system and overturn the result.\r\n\r\nAs well as wasting time and resources it is also a transparent attempt to subvert a fair democratic result.",
        "background": "This petition exists to counter the petition calling for a 2nd referendum.\r\n\r\nIf you believe the result of the referendum on the 23rd June was democratic and fair and that it should stand then please sign this petition show your support for maintaining the existing result.",
