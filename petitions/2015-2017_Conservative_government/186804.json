        "additional_details": "Also ticket sites like Ticketmaster seem to be actively encouraging it, even selling what they call 'Premium tickets' which are no different to seats available on other ticket sites. \r\n\r\nWe call on the government to insert a new clause into the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act to make it illegal for concert tickets to be sold at inflated prices, whether by touts or ticketing sites themselves and to make it illegal to purchase tickets with the sole intention of making a profit.",
        "background": "The buying and reselling of concert tickets at inflated prices means that genuine fans are unable to purchase tickets at face value or even at all in some cases. Fans are losing out because touts are buying tickets in bulk and reselling them on secondary websites at hugely inflated prices.\r\n\r\n",
