        "action": "Ban smacking children in the UK",
        "additional_details": "There are many other, more effective, ways to discipline children that do not involve inflicting physical harm on them. \r\n\r\nSmacking should not be regarded as merely a form of discipline; it is assault and it must not be tolerated in this day and age. It is unacceptable that assaulted adults can go to the police, but assaulted children have no form of recourse.\r\n",
        "background": "Britain is now one of just four countries in Europe where smacking remains a legal way of disciplining children. Many studies have demonstrated that smacking has no long-term positive impact on children.  Please sign this petition to defend the basic human rights of our children.",
