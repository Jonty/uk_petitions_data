Furthermore, it is often less than 70% of eligible voters who actually vote. \r\n\r\nIn the general election 2015, 43% of 18 to 24s voted and only 66% of all eligible voters cast a vote. This is not good enough. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3575/How-Britain-voted-in-2015.aspx\r\n",

So let's do something about it",
