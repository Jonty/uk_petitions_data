Even a simple emergency stop risks crushing injuries between the adult and the seat in front.\r\n\r\nCoaches and large minibuses must be held to the same legal standards as cars or taxis.",
        "background": "Children are protected (with few exceptions) from travelling unrestrained in vehicles such as cars, vans and small minibuses.\r\n\r\nThere is no such requirement for large minibuses or coaches. The law only applies to those over the age of 14.\r\n\r\nChildren under the age of 14 are being put at risk.\r\n\r\n",
