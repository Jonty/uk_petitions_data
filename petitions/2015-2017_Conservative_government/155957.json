We propose to abolish such mandatory\r\npayment to the state, and instead to take back control of this money\r\nand fund the NHS with an additional \u00a33.1billion per week.\r\nIn order to comply with the rules of democracy we suggest that no less than the majority (i.e. 23,299,988 people) of eligible voters must be in favour. We can entrust the voters to make the right decision for\r\nthe Country.",
