        "additional_details": "I have experienced this as a parent of a yr 6 child this year and am very concerned about the pressure on the children. Let teachers teach and children learn. Teacher assessment is far more accurate a measure than a stressed tested 7 or 11 year old's test results. Moderate teacher assessment at local and national levels or shorten all tests to half hr reading and maths. See grammar applied in writing instead of testing the jargon . Sign this petition to see this addressed in parliament.",
        "background": "Testing has reached an all time high this year, the level expected for children to achieve in grammar and maths is higher than ever before. Low ability children are being labelled as 'below expectations' for their age. Stress levels amongst the children are high and self confidence is low. ",
