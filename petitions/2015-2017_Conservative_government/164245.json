        "additional_details": "They use a very loose interpretation of this exemption to support these rejections, as everything they do can be linked back to one of these three categories.\r\n\r\nThey make frequent use of the Act to interrogate other public sector organisations in their journalistic research, yet use the JAoL clause to shield themselves from similar investigation.\r\n\r\nWe therefore request that these exemptions be deleted from the FOI Act, leaving them open to the same level of scrutiny as other public bodies.",
        "background": "Schedule 1, Part VI of the Freedom Of Information Act 2000 lists a number of organisations granted special exemption, where the Act only applies to information \"held for purposes other than those of journalism, art or literature\". This is misused to reject ANY FOI requests they'd rather not answer.",
