        "additional_details": "During the Iraq war most tabloids took the 'for war' side.\r\nAt every general election newspapers tell readers which Party to vote for.\r\nBefore the EU referendum misinformation was printed in the press countless times - ending migration, \u00a3350m being sent to Brussels, it will stop immigration are a few examples.\r\nNo one it seems can hold the press to account - they can print what they wish so long as no one is being defamed. We need to legislate to ensure newspaper reporting is fair and balanced.",
        "background": "The EU referendum, elections, the Iraq war. These are just few of the pivotal events when misleading reports in the press has led to people making the wrong decisions. We have a free press but we don't have a FAIR press. And one is pointless without the other as it makes a mockery of democracy. ",
