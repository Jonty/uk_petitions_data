Debating this issue in Parliament would be a waste of time and would only cause more divisions.\r\n\r\nA Second EU Referendum would be a waste of resources and would cause more instability. Democracy has already been served.\r\n\r\nA turnout greater than 75% is higher than the average turnout for a General Election. Implementing additional rules on referendums that do not have high turnouts is absurd.",
