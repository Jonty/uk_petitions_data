        "additional_details": "As part of the LGBT community myself, I find going to a gendered public toilet a scary experience and I'm sure I'm not alone.\r\n\r\nI have experienced harassment in both male and female toilets and find its becoming more frequent. I believe myself and others should be able to do their business in peace without being questioned.\r\nI feel 'neutralising' the gendered signage of all public toilets would provide a more comfortable and safer environment.",
        "background": "The UK should scrap gender segregated public toilets by replacing them as gender neutral. \r\nAllowing people of any gender or gender identity to use the facility without the feeling of any fear, harassment, judgement, discrimination or abuse.",
