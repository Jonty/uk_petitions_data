        "action": "Limit the sale of pornographic \"Top Shelf\" magazines to licensed sex venues.",
        "additional_details": "Often these magazines come with XXX dvds which contain full blown pornography. They create an environment that is highly offensive to women.\r\nThe fact that the magazines are 'above children's eye level' becoms irrelevant when it is considered that a buyer of pornography can take it down from the shelf and stand in a queue next to children.  \r\nWe believe that these explicit magazines (showing full intentionally pornographic nudity) should be limited to sale in licensed sex establishments only.",
        "background": "There has been much debate over the harm of 'Lad's Mags' in recent years. But what has been missed is the sale of explicit pornography in general stores. \r\nThese 'Top Shelf' publications may  have modesty covers to some degree, but many more show text and images that are undeniably indecent.\r\n\r\n",
