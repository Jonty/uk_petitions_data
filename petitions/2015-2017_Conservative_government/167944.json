        "additional_details": "There are several articles circulating with people's stories and how it will affect them. I believe the threshold is far too low, as a family earning \u00a33/40,000 a year would not be able to buy a home on this income. Moreover, there are no controls on the current market so prices are ridiculously high. Families will split to avoid exceeding the threshold or the stress/strain of paying 150% more in rent. This policy will make people homeless or push 1000s into extreme poverty. ",
        "background": "The pay to stay policy is part of the current Housing Bill that is going through parliament. This policy will mean social housing tenants who's household income exceeds \u00a330,000 (\u00a340,000 in London) will be required to pay market rents for their home. This will have a devastating affect on families. ",
