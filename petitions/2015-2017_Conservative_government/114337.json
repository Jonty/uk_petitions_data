        "additional_details": "The number of deaths attributed to alcohol use in the UK was 8,664 in 2009 and 8,790 the next year. There has never been a single death caused by cannabis, and overdose is literally impossible.\r\nUnlike alcohol, cannabis has research to back it up as a legitimate treatment for many illnesses and conditions, and to ignore this is to deny justice to those suffering.\r\nIf alcohol and tobacco are legal, it's time to grow up, take the evidence on board and work to change the laughable cannabis laws.\r\n",
        "background": "Despite a debate taking place on the issue after a previous petition was put forward a few months back, the government still fails to actually address the facts about cannabis and health. The hypocrisy of a government which itself contains alcohol users banning a much safer substance is a disgrace.",
