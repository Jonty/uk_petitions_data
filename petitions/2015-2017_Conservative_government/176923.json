Nor a junior sacrificial lamb (eg Chris Philp). We need the Minister with overall responsibility.",
        "background": "With self-evident crises (like the NHS or Southern Rail) the Minister with that brief should be directly answerable. \r\nI have lost count of the number of times I've heard phrases like 'we asked for a comment but no one was available.' \r\n",
