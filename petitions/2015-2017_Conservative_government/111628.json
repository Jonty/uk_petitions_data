        "additional_details": "Whether it's for ethical, health or environmental reasons, veganism is far more than just a dietary option. It is a lifestyle choice, no less valuable than that of Jewish people's kosher food or Muslim people's halal meat. It is also a great way to prevent allergens as it automatically eliminates three very prominent allergies- seafood, dairy and eggs. This would be a way of moving forward as a nation, to prove we in the UK are accepting of all lifestyle choices.",
        "background": "Veganism is becoming extremely commonplace all over the world, and the UK is no secret to this. With roughly 140 million vegans worldwide, it would only make sense that our school canteens offer a menu suitable for the lifestyle. ",
