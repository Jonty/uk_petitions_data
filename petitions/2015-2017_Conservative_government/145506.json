I have a UK pension, I am expected to pay inheritance tax upon death and who knows where I might retire.  This decision affects people like me too and we need to have a say in the process.",
        "background": "British people living abroad were NOT allowed a Brexit vote and are hugely impacted by it.  We form a constituency of people who live a special way of life in the EU - the life that experiences free movement of labour and we well understand free trade benefits.  An important voice was not heard.",
