        "action": "Pay student veterinary nurses whilst on their years placement.",
        "additional_details": "Every student veterinary nurse at degree level is expected to undertake 2100 hours of full time work placement with out any pay. This expectation is outrageous. Student finance does not cover the cost of living day to day, childcare and the cost of running a car. A diploma level student veterinary nurse gets a wage, however a degree level veterinary nurse doesn't. This is simply slave labour and a way for veterinary practices to have full time staff members at no cost to themselves. ",
        "background": "By not paying student veterinary nurses on their year placement this profession is discriminating against less wealthy individuals from pursuing this career. Student finance is not enough to cover the cost of living. It is essentially slave labour to expect any one to work for free for a year. ",
