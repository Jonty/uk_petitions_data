My family are about to apply for Further Leave to Remain and we now have to fork out \u00a31500 for the IHS. I understand the need to charge for the use of the NHS, but what I fail to understand is why we can\u2019t claim this back as a tax refund at the end of the year when we are paying \u00a37872 pa into National Insurance.
