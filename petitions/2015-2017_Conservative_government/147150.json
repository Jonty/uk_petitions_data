        "action": "Protect the will of the people, supervise a Brexit and block it's opposition.",
        "additional_details": "However, in the proceeding days after the independence vote, there have been expressed intentions on sabotaging the democratic will of the British people. This includes a petition calling for another referendum as well as individual politicians saying that Brexit should be blocked. E.g. Tottenham MP David Lammy pushing for a vote in commons to block Brexit.\r\n\r\nHopefully this petition will be a compendium on anti Brexit events and intentions within the UK parliament.\r\n\r\nThe people have spoken.",
        "background": "On June the 23rd the British electorate voted on the question of whether they want to remain part of the EU or leave it. A clear majority of over 1,000,000 votes were on the leave side, therefore parliament should execute the will of the people and activate article 50 of the Lisbon treaty.",
