        "additional_details": "The  Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties gives the UK ample grounds for repudiating all EU Treaty obligations on the grounds of bad faith by the other treaty members and  the failure to apply the rules of the EU, for example, the repeated failure to produce  accounts which  satisfy the auditors, the multiple breaches of Eurozone rules and  the failure to enforce government aid rules against the likes of Germany, France and Italy -  see  https://englandcalling.wordpress.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The EU can spend two years  giving the UK the run around whilst pocketing  two years of further UK contributions  and obliging the UK to honour all EU laws and regulations including freedom of movement.  At the end of the two years the UK is unlikely to have an agreement which will effect Brexit .",
