        "additional_details": "Income Tax raising powers are in the 2015 Spending Review despite the fact that the UK Coalition Government agreement had stated that a Calman-style Commission, which later resulted in the Silk Report, would be established in the event of a Yes vote.  Politicians loudly denied that a Yes vote would lead to tax powers, while the Holtham Report on fiscal devolution was treated as some dirty little secret to be kept under the Assembly mattress till the referendum campaign was over. ",
        "background": "To get the last Welsh referendum through, income tax powers were specifically excluded.\r\nNow despite a No vote in Scotland, more powers are being devolved to Wales without asking the people if they want them.",
