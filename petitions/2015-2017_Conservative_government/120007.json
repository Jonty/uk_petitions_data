Last week over a thousand appointments were not attended at the QE hospital in Birmingham. If each appointment is for 20 minutes, then that is 333 wasted hours in a week at what cost? It is time for people to accept responsibility for wasting funds and they should be fined for not attending unless they have a verifiable reason, it does not take long to call to cancel. ",

This is a situation which needs to be dealt with pro-actively and people should be fined for non-attendance.   ",
