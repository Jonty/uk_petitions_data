        "additional_details": "With many voters expressing 'regrexit' now faced with the reality of what the Leave vote will mean, how can we act on this result with good conscience. At the very least with such a close result, the only way to get a clear view would be to hold a second referendum and make sure the campaigns made are completely honest in their claims so that we can obtain a result that truly reflects the will of the public.\r\nThe people have spoken, and what they've said is - this conversation is NOT over.",
        "background": "Many of the things the public were told about what would happen if we left the EU have now turned out to be false. The referendum was supposed to allow us to make an informed decision, and we have not had the opportunity to do this. Therefore the result must be invalid and a second one is required.",
