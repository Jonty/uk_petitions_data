        "additional_details": "Without the grant it could inevitably hold back these students knowing they would be faced with a higher debt once they finish their studies. It will effect the lives of future students who have worked hard to receive the grades needed for university and now they won\u2019t know if they can even afford to go. We need to maintain this grant to allow equality in students; education is for all walks of life not just those who financially can afford it. \r\nN.B- If this was debated we need a fair debate.\r\n",
        "background": "Those students whose parents earn under \u00a325,000 - \u00a342,620  as a combined income receive a maintenance grant which is dependable on their income bracket. It allows for students who come from a background of low income to be able to fulfil their ambitions and be supported while at university. ",
