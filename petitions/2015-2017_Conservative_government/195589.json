I think this is not only emotionally disruptive for a young child but it can also have an affect on there education if they are not happy! If they attend the infants they should automatically secure a place in the juniors or at least have first refusal!  our children's lives our dictated as a parent it should be my choice where my child attends school and is brought up ",

It's ridiculous that taking a child out of school for a family holiday is seen as disruptive to their education but apperntly removing a child from there friends and school they know isn't seen as an issue.
