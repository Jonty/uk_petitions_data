Those who do not often leaver those who are dissatisfied  with no legal recourse as the contractual relationship is often with another party e.g. estate agents and have no contractual relationship and arguably no duty of care to e.g. prospective purchasers. There is some limited statutory regulation for e.g. property misdescription but otherwise legal regulation is limited.    ",
