        "additional_details": "Each year the charity commission investigates a large number of charity's for fraud. Forces charity's have been worst hit in recent years with the likes of Afghan Heros, 1st Knight, Support our heroes, soldiers off the streets and Local Heroes all being investigated yet very little action is ever taken. \r\n\r\nIf the public can clearly see what percentages the charity will receive from their donation, the public can then decide if they still want to give or to choose another charity.",
        "background": "The charity sector has been infected by greedy promotional companies and business run charities taking well over their share of administration fees. If it was the law to display on promotional signs the actual amount used on charitable activities, the public and the charity would now be protected.",
