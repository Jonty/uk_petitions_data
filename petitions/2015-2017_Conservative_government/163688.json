        "additional_details": "The DDA 1991 bans four types of dogs based on the myth that they are inherently dangerous. This is not the case. Also, the vagueness of the current law means almost any UK dog could be seized and put to sleep.\r\n\r\nDog attacks have tripled since 1991(source: NHS), and most have been blamed on dogs that are not 'illegal'. Rather than putting down friendly dogs like Francis the pitbull, replace the DDA with a new law placing responsibility for a dog's behaviour on the owner, as suggested by the RSPCA.",
        "background": "The 1991 law banning the pit bull terrier, tosa, Dogo Argentino and Fila Brasileiro is now 25 years old. The RSPCA are against it, it is not fit for purpose, and doesn't even state how to identify a pit bull! It should be replaced with a law targeting irresponsible owners, not individual breeds. \r\n ",
