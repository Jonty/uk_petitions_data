This isn't democratic. Why are local councillors told not to talk to us?\r\n\r\nWe objected to the development but nobody listened. The Council recommended approval. We had no voice. We were silenced and invisible. We had to move: we had no option. Help us change this. One resident should have the same voice as a developer: we should be allowed to raise our concerns with the planning department and our councillors. Everyone should have the right to be heard.",
