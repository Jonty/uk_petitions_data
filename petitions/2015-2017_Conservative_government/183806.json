        "additional_details": "Women who suffer often face criticism from their employer and sometimes can lead to them leaving employment. Women endure so much when they are suffering and may even be faced with infertility. The last thing they need is to worry about their work life. Endometriosis needs to be formally recognised under the equality act  2010. In other countries it is recognised as a disability.",
        "background": "This is a debilitating illness that affects 1 in 10 women in the UK. It's a chronic condition that causes painful and heavy periods. It has a significant impact on a woman's life in a number of ways including chronic pain, fatigue and depression. The cause is unknown and there is no definitive cure.",

            "details": "The Equality Act 2010 defines disability as \u201ca physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on a person\u2019s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities\u201d.  \u2018Long-term\u2019 is described as having lasted or likely to last for at least 12 months, or likely to last for the rest of a person\u2019s life.  \u2018Substantial\u2019 is defined as more than minor or trivial.  \r\n\r\nIf any person has a condition whose effect falls within the definition of a disability, the Act will confer on them a number of protections, such as protection from direct discrimination or benefitting from the requirement that an employer or service provider make reasonable adjustments for that person.  This will apply to women with endometriosis in the same way that it would apply to people with any other condition that would meet the criteria for a disability.  It is not necessary to have an official medical diagnosis in order to meet the criteria under the Act, although this may help, as long as the person can demonstrate the substantial and long term effect of their condition.  Official guidance on factors to be taken into account when determining what illness could fall under the definition of disability is available at: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/85038/disability-definition.pdf.  \r\n\r\nEmployers and service providers alike are required to ensure that disabled people are not treated less favourably compared to those who are not disabled and must make reasonable adjustments for them to avoid placing them at a disadvantage.  In the case of service providers, such as shops or restaurants, they have the additional duty of having to anticipate the reasonable adjustments that their disabled service-users may require.  This could include providing a shelf or a table in disabled toilets, on which users can place their equipment and accessories or step-free access to the premises to enable wheelchair users to enter and exit more easily.\r\n\r\nThe Act does not, except in a few specific instances (e.g. cancer, HIV & MS), mention by name any medical conditions that constitute a disability within the meaning of the Act, as it is, in most cases, the impact on the person\u2019s life that is the qualifying criteria rather than the condition itself.  \r\n\r\nGovernment believes that this is a more effective way of protecting those with impairments since the severity and duration of many conditions can vary so greatly between individuals, as would the impact on the individual\u2019s day-to-day life.  \r\n\r\nFor further advice, people can contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS), which provides free bespoke advice and in-depth support to individuals with any discrimination concerns.
