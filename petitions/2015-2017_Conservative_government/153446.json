        "additional_details": "Current UK legislation allows for an early general election to be called only by invoking the provisions detailed in Section 2 of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011.\r\nGiven the current confusion in the country, with the Government and all significant opposition parties defeated in the recent referendum on European Union membership, not to mention the marginal result and widespread calls for a 2nd referendum; it would seem a new government with a fresh mandate is the best way to move forward.",
