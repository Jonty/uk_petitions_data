        "additional_details": "The uncertainty of Brexit is creating not only an economic uncertainty, it is directly affecting EU residents in the UK at this present moment. Due to the uncertainty employers are hesitant hiring or promoting, landlords refuse applications or asking extra deposits, banks are hesitant in providing mortgages, many are unclear if they would get permission to stay, and unfortunately it's emboldening certain elements in society in their hate crimes, aggression and discrimination.",
        "background": "Such law should be all inclusive and not be based on level of income, hours of work, health insurance (CSI) or any requirement which would effect separation of (UK/EU) families, or (the threat off) removal of EU residents. Cut off date should be Brexit date or the creation of such law date.",
