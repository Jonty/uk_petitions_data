        "additional_details": "Further, the Leave campaign used 'potentially misleading information' (Source UK Statistics Authority 2016) like the 'Let\u2019s give our NHS the \u00a3350 million the EU takes every week'. This could deceive vulnerable electorate members into believing that a leave vote would improve NHS services. Lastly the majority remain vote in Scotland & NI and calls by SNP leader & Sinn F\u00e9in for own referendums may lead to UK breakup.  The principle of parliamentary sovereignty should be invoked to void the result.",
        "background": "The leave result does not represent the majority of the 46.5m eligible electorate members.  17.4m (34.7%) voted leave. 16.1m voted remain and 12.9m didn't vote (62.3%). The majority were in favour of remain or undecided. Statistics from Electoral Commission website.This is not a mandate for Brexit. ",
