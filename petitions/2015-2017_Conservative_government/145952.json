        "action": "Call an immediate second referendum requiring all citizens aged 16 plus to vote.",
        "additional_details": "Many of the promises fundamental to the Leave Campaign are already being reneged on (NHS, freedom of movement etc). Some postal voters have been disenfranchised. Scotland and Northern Ireland are voting on whether to leave the UK. We note also the horrific upsurge in racist abuse and are reminded of the Europe of the 1930s. Bearing all this in mind we feel it is advisable for the electorate as a whole to vote again. If Brexit really is the will of the people, the result will surely be the same.",
        "background": "Given the closeness of the recent referendum result and the demographic breakdown of votes cast,  in order that the UK government has a clear mandate for the future, a second referendum in which all eligible citizens 16 and over are strongly, repeatedly and publicly advised to vote is essential.
