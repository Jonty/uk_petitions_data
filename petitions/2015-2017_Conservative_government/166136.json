        "action": "Remove from doctors working within the NHS the right to strike.",
        "additional_details": "Three reasons:\r\n1) In May of this year the BMA representative described the new contract as a deal \"All sides can sign up to\" and that \"Doctors can be confident in this new contract\". They now say the contract is so bad there have to be massive damaging strikes.\r\n2)There has been a large drop in support for the BMA's militant stance. Of the 54,000 members only a minority 21540 voted to reject the new contract. This is down from 98% at the start of the dispute. A responsible union would re-ballot its members.\r\n3) The BMA have consistently refused to take action such as legal action which would not damage patients and would win their dispute. ",
        "background": "I am a patient with two incurable deteriorating brain conditions. I have waited for six months for three appointments all of which are likely to be cancelled. I have followed the negotiations  closely and have very reluctantly come to the conclusion that the BMA  are being highly irresponsible.",
