I feel so alone and like no one will help me in this journey to be a Mum. Every month is devastating and feel so depressed each time we are unsuccessful.\r\nIf the reason I felt like this was because I had small breasts I would be entitled to bigger ones on the nhs. But I'm not entitled to help for a baby.",

We have been trying for a baby for 2 years and due to my husband having a child we are not entitled to full fertility tests or treatments on the nhs. I feel as though I am being punished for his past relationship failing.",
