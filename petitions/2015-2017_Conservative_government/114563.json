        "additional_details": "There are so many focus groups online I.e Facebook and YouTube where children who are now grown discuss their experiences of being a victim of parental alienation, these now adults discuss how their parent would turn them against their other parent. It is clear that this is happening so widespread yet here in the UK very little is done about it by the authorities. Social services, the police, the courts and the education system need to recognise the abuse and make it part of legislation.",
        "background": "Parents who seperate will often turn the children against the other parent, grandparent etc. They do this by saying things about the other parent or allowing the child to be part of adult conversations. This causes harm to the child and creates an issue with the child and the alienated parent.",
