        "background": "The price of football kits has risen steadily over the last 20 years and they are now at a level which is massively inflated from the actual cost to make and ship the kit.\r\nThe average shirt costs \u00a34.79 to produce and ship, yet they sell for around \u00a350+. This is for home, away and 3rd kits.",
