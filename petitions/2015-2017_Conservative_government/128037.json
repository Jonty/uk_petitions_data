        "additional_details": "They\u2019re online. They\u2019re in newsagents. They\u2019re being handed around on our campuses. They\u2019re even on the London Underground! Advertisements for \u2018Essay Writing Mills\u2019 are appearing everywhere as this industry grows bigger and bigger. More and more students are paying these \u2018companies\u2019 to do their work for them. Profiting from selling essays in this way should be illegal. We need to hold our students and our society to a higher standard.",
        "background": "I believe there are important values that hold human society together: If you work hard, act with integrity, be creative and solve problems then you should get ahead in life. In my opinion, \u2018Essay Writing Mills\u2019 are not in accordance with these values. They should be made illegal.",
