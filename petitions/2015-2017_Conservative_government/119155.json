        "additional_details": "I do not mean to be rude but from 65+ older driver's start to suffer with their eye sight. \r\nI understand that it is their only freedom but, what is more important?\r\nTheir freedom or the safety of roads users?\r\n\r\nWhen there is a News report showing a car that has managed to join a Motorway on the wrong side, It is always an older driver. I have not once seen it done by a young driver.\r\nSome people driving on our roads, have never even sat a test! Or did a test 40 years ago when their was less traffic",
        "background": "I fully understand how people agree that the worst problems on our roads are Young Driver's. I am a young driver and i face these insults everyday.\r\nHowever, i believe that some older driver's are not up to the legal standed to be safe on the road.",
