        "additional_details": "The current parliament has graphically demonstrated it's inability to lead the UK, been demonstrably expedient with the truth and have descended into personal infighting at a time when the population of the UK needs leading towards unity, by example. All confidence in the current parliament has been lost. It is with a heavy heart that we call for the dissolution of parliament and the opportunity for a new government to be selected through a general election.",
