        "additional_details": "These rights include hunting, shooting and fishing rights and the right to extract minerals underground.\r\nScotland abolished them in 2000. We want parliament in Westminster to do the same. Protected interests of the landed gentry have NO place in today\u2019s socially and culturally diverse Britain. We must get rid of these outdated rights.\r\nWe need your vote now to get this issue debated in parliament.\r\nThere was an e-petition set up but it has been archived as it was setup under the last Govenrment.",
        "background": "Manorial rights are an important issue across England & Wales. They are outdated laws that give lords of the manor rights to over 100,000 properties in England and Wales. They allow wealthy landowners to make claims over farms, commercial, local authority and residential property they no longer own.",
