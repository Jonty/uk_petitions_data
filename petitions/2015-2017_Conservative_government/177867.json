        "additional_details": "With a 30 mph national limit, motorists knew where they stood legally\r\n\r\nSouthwark council consulted less than 400 people in their scheme to make the entire borough a 20mph zone (over 200,000 voters live in Southwark.\r\n\r\nIslington cannot provide data to show the 20 mph borough has improved safety or reduced accidents\r\n\r\nMost councils will use these artificially low limits as a revenue raiser, Traffic speed is slow enough in London without a 24hour 20mph limit being imposed unnecessarily.",
        "background": "Since setting of speed limits was relaxed, local councils have set inappropriate limits on main roads (sometimes across entire boroughs) without proper consultation (typically 20% or less of residents) and not used \"LOCAL KNOWLEDGE\" as suggested in Gov guidance. 20 is NOT PLENTY (in most cases)",
