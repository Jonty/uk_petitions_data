The EA provides for people with disabilities to have the same right to services supplied by shops, banks, hotels, libraries, pubs, taxis and restaurants as everyone else. It is against the law for service providers to treat people with disabilities less favourably because of their disability, or because they have a guide or assistance dog with them. this should be the same for emotional support cats & dogs.\r\n\r\n",
