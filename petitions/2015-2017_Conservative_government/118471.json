        "action": "Impose Nationwide moratorium on basement applications and change planning rules",
        "additional_details": "Local councils, who they count on to represent their interests are increasingly unwilling to fund legal appeals against their own refusals of planning consent - so give in.   Now, not only are homes and businesses put at risk but the quality of life of entire neighbourhoods is vandalised.  Innocent property owners should not have to mortgage their livelihoods to fight off the life-style expansions imposed by their neighbours and absent developers.  This is wrong and needs to change nationally.",
        "background": "The threat to neighbourhoods and businesses suffering this plague of development show planning rules to be far too heavily weighted in favour of developers.  Local residents and businesses, ambushed by ambitions plans, are now often locked out of any consultation process - their rights ignored.",
