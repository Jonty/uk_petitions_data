        "action": "Ban installation of Sound Limiters in all wedding venues (or increase the limit)",
        "additional_details": "Most limiters have a noise restriction of 90-95 Decibels.\r\n\r\nAt this limit, loud applause can trigger the sound limiter.\r\n\r\nWhen you consider a 5 piece wedding band will normally be in excess of 100 Decibels. A Big Band or Orchestra will be louder still. On top of this, if you consider the loudness of an audience or wedding party, accompanied by alcohol, the sound limiter limit is far too low. \r\nPlease sign this petition to support the removal of Sound Limiters or a increase in sound level allowed",
        "background": "More and more venues are fitting (or are being forced to fit) sound limiters in a bid to appease local council noise restrictions. Whilst this can be good news for local residents living near the venue, it can wreak havoc on a live bands performance.  ",
