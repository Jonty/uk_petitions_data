        "additional_details": "Martin van Creveld has said that the British Army is unique in Northern Ireland in its success against an irregular force.  The violence was reduced to an extent which made it clear to the PIRA that they would not win through violence. This is a major achievement, and one with which the security forces from all three Services, with the Army in the lead, should be entirely satisfied. It took a long time but, as van Crefeld [sic] said, that success is unique.",
        "background": "More than 300,000 members of the British Armed Forces served in Northern Ireland over a period of 38 years, over 1000 lost their lives.  The contribution made to maintaining law and order in the province by members of the Security Forces needs to be recognised in perpetuity.",
