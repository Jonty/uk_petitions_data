        "additional_details": "After speaking to Staff and fellow commuters, the following differences are apparent due to being run as a business and are unacceptable.\r\n\r\nOutside of timetabled services, commuters are no longer a priority over freight.\r\n\r\nWhen service is disrupted, trains are cancelled rather than run late as it saves the company money, but at the expense of running trains for the commuters.\r\n\r\nPriority is given to sections of infrastructure where there are competing franchises or services.\r\n ",
        "background": "Our National Rail infrastructure not run as a service since it was privatised, it is run as a business, and as a result passengers are forced to endure price increase after price increase and worsening services.",
