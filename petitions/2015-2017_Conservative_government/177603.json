        "background": "Concert tickets frequently sell out far too quickly for most ordinary fans to have a chance to buy. \r\n\r\nThen, they immediately appear on the secondary market at inflated prices.\r\n\r\nClearly they have been bought with the sole purpose of being resold.\r\n\r\nI suggest a price cap of 50% over face value.",
