        "additional_details": "I refer to Rotherham, Rochdale, Telford. A few of MANY where Political Correctness allowed/s the systematic rape and trafficking of THOUSANDS of children. Decades. Officials & fear of being called \"racist\" FACILITATED/S this. In the name of \"tolerance\". The obscenity sickens me. PC has also lead to the removal of Christmas festivities in MANY towns. Obscene. I, myself, AM Muslim. REAL BRITISH Muslims, HATE, your PC Concessions. They're wrong. It Must be made an offence for PC to dictate actions.",
        "background": "We see over and over again, instances where Officials and PUBLIC SERVANTS allow the destruction of communities and lives in the name of bending over backwards to a horrible thing called: Political Correctness (PC). Where Councils, Police etc, turn a blind eye as to not \"Offend\". This MUST end.",
