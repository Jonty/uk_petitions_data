        "additional_details": "This is one of the biggest moments in UK history - we voted to Leave the EU. This was democracy, a representation of Britain's rebelliousness against status quo. Nearly 55% of the country voted to leave. This demonstrates that the majority want Leave. Therefore, to Remain in the EU is an abolition of our liberal values and our Parliamentary Democracy.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are people in this country who want just that. They want a 2nd referendum. Stop them. Sign this petition to denote your support.",
        "background": "Democracy has decided that the United Kingdom shall leave the European Union. A majority nearing 55% have told us that we no longer have a place in the EU - therefore we must negotiate our exit. However, there are people in this country who do not respect democracy. Please block their petitions.",
