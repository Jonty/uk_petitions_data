        "additional_details": "Since it was a referendum that has triggered Article 50, it would only be correct to have another after the negotiations on the exit deal from EU have concluded. It is the British people who should decide whether to accept the deal (Exit the EU) or accept the status quo (remain in the EU). It the people who must directly ratify the deal.\r\nThis referendum should be before the Scottish Referendum and before the parliament votes on the final bill to help them make an informed choice.",
        "background": "The Referendum to Leave the EU was based on principles and ideas.\r\nAs those ideas begin to become a reality, vested interests are attempting to have a voice and influence its outcomes. The Scots want another independence referendum and the parliament has won the right to vote on the key outcomes.",
