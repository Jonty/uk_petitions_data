        "additional_details": "The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Nils Mui\u017enieks, has stated that 'asylum seekers returned to Hungary run a considerable risk of being subject to human rights violations.' Also, as there are systemic flaws in the asylum procedure and in the reception conditions in Hungary, the UK is not permitted under international law to deport asylum seekers to that country. The only other option for Ahmad and his son is to return to Syria and face the risk of being killed in the conflict.",
        "background": "Faisal, 18 years old, and his father Ahmad are Syrians who arrived in the UK to seek asylum in June 2015. They are both facing deportation to Hungary where they were forced to claim asylum under duress. A considerable proportion of those returned to Hungary were detained in asylum detention centres.",
