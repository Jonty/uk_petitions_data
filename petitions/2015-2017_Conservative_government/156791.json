        "action": "Add an option for \"Protest / No Confidence\" to all ballot voting options.",
        "additional_details": "There is a large number of the voting public who feel disenfranchised by our political parties and representatives, who feel like they have no representive or political voice. Spoiled ballot papers are not always clearly counted, and in the case of a referendum can be ignored completely. Having a specific option that allows the voting public to voice their desire to be involved, but that they are excluded from the current political parties, leaders or campaigns is essential for democracy.",
        "background": "Rather than depending on spoiled ballot papers to count protest votes, introduce an official way for the voting public to express their democratic right to show that they have a political opinion, but they disagree with all the views of a campaign or political parties.",
