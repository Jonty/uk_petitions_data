        "action": "Set a national 'child' age in the UK especially for buses and trains #UnFare",
        "additional_details": "Companies such as Arriva and First Buses are charging children as young as 14 extortionate, adult prices for fares. A small consensus of those effected and adults agree that this is not an appropriate adult age. Children under 18 do not get a fair adult wage, the right to vote or cannot even buy certain video games but are expected to splurge adult prices on fares. Furthermore, the services are not sufficient and as personal experiences show there are rude drivers and consistent lateness.#UnFare",
        "background": "At the moment, national services are exploiting young people by not setting a national child age. Therefore, it should be set that until you are 18(a respected Adult) you should be entitled to child fares. As under 18s do not get an adult wage or the right to vote so they should not pay adult fares.",
