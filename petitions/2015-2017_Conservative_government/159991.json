        "additional_details": "If Parliament are not willing to allow a general election at this volatile and very confusing time, then at least pay attention to the facts surrounding the EU Referendum, that the results were largely due to flawed campaigns, lies and manipulations.  Many people, an estimated 7% according to one survey would vote differently 'now they know' the facts.  A referendum should not be actioned on results garnered through false information and scare tactics.  Election, or another referendum is needed.",
        "background": "Considering the very misleading campaign to leave the EU, the fallout we have witnessed since the now obviously flawed results and the fact that nobody in power seems to be acknowledging these issues, we the undersigned demand that the fixed term rules of Parliament be put aside and call an election",
