Could you imagine if this happened to one of your loved ones like it did to me, fortunately I was lucky and have had 4 extra amazing years with my two children, many people aren't so lucky! I propose that we change the law to automatically place all UK residents on the organ donor register with a CHOICE to opt out. I strongly believe that this will save many lives!",

Currently three people a day die waiting for an organ transplant in the UK due to a shortage of donors! I propose we change the law.",
