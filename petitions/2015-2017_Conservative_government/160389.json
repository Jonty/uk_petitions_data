Since the war six Prime Ministers have taken the post unelected and three of them (Alec Douglas-Home, James Callaghan and Gordon Brown) never ever secured a mandate from the voting public. Sign this petition if you believe all voters should have the right to vote for the next Prime Minister. If it reaches 10,000 the government has to respond to you. If it reaches 100,000 your views may be debated in Parliament - 1m votes and you simply can't be ignored. ",

Support any or no other party and you have no vote on who leads the UK until the next Parliamentary Election on Thursday 7th May 2020. This petition calls for direct elections of Prime Minsters.",
