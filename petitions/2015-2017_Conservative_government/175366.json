        "action": "Guarantee a minimum standard of contraceptive availability across the UK",
        "additional_details": "Access to a full range of contraception prevents pregnancy (abortions and raising unplanned children are both more costly) and is vital for managing many health problems (thyroid malfunction, severe migraine/period pain, endometriosis). Government must a) require ring-fenced, guaranteed contraceptive funding (and reinstate provisions where cut) b) enforce minimum provisions: amount of options discussed with patients and available within a certain distance, and availability of long-acting methods",
        "background": "The Independent and BBC report that funding cuts have caused some GPs to stop providing the contraceptive coil, IUD and contraceptive implant. It makes no sense to reduce access to cost-effective, proven modern contraceptive innovations; local authorities must receive adequate funds to provide this.",
