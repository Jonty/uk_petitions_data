At first everything was fine, despite us no longer being together we still had regular contact regarding the pregnancy. Unfortunately it didn't last and at about 22 weeks into the pregnancy the contact seemed to stop. On numerous occasions I tried making contact with my daughter\u2019s mum but to no avail. I later found out through a 3rd party about my daughter\u2019s birth and despite numerous further attempts, I\u2019ve still had no luck with contact.",
