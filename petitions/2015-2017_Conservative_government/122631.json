        "additional_details": "I propose that either special arrangements are made so the attendees can vote or the vote is moved.\r\n\r\nMaking sure people are aware of the upcoming vote and ensuring the postal voting system can cope with the influx of votes would be a prudent move.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, work with the organisers of the festival to communicate with attendees the importance of the vote and communicate how to register to vote via post.",
        "background": "The date for the EU Referendum is on the 23rd June. This date falls within Glastonbury Festival.\r\n\r\nHolding the vote on the same day as around 150,000 will be otherwise occupied is a disgrace to democracy.",
