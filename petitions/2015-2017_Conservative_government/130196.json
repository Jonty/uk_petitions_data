I feel that many don't and if this became law, the politicians could effectively loose to \"non of the above\". It means that disillusioned members of the electorate can vote, giving a message to candidates and parties rather than being marked as \"spoilt\" that there are voters who prefer non of them. In the event of a win by NOTA, a non aligned body (ERS?) should appoint a \"voters guardian\" until the next election",

I'm saddened that the ultimate price that has been paid for the right to vote but despair of politics and its practices. I want to vote \"for non of the above\"",
