One only needs to look outside when driving along the roads to see the growing problem.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Supermarkets and producers should be held accountable for the amount of waste that is produced. \r\nMost items in stores have more than one type of package covering the product. This needs to change, there needs to be stricter packaging laws and more recyclable packaging.",
