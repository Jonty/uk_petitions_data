It doesn't take 10 minutes to check your child's hair each night/morning and to make sure their hair is free of lice. As some parents clearly can't be bothered I would like to get nit nurses back into schools to ensure all children have  their hair checked and free of the lice they are not so kindly sharing with others.",
