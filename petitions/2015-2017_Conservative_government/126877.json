        "additional_details": "  The hospital will not remove the DNAR.  Are the patient\u2019s wishes no longer of paramount importance? You have to ask what's the point of a living will? The consultant says the decision is due to Dad\u2019s age & the fact he has heart failure which will only get worse.    \r\nHow many people are going into hospital & have DNAR put on their records against their wishes? This practice must be stopped, people's wishes are not being respected.  It's like euthanasia in disguise. ",
        "background": "My father was admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham on Monday with heart failure and fluid overload. My father has a living will that he wants life to be maintained. The hospital has put a DNAR onto my father's records, my father has objected but the objection has been ignored. ",
