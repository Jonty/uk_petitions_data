        "additional_details": "David Allen Green, Financial Times 14.06.16; (extracts)\r\nThe referendum is advisory rather than mandatory. \r\nWhat happens next in the event of a vote to leave is therefore a matter of politics not law. \r\nThe UK government could seek to ignore such a vote; to explain it away and characterise it in terms that it has no credibility or binding effect. Or they could say it is now a matter for parliament, and then endeavour to win the parliamentary vote. \r\nWhat matters in law is when and whether the government invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.",
        "background": "48% of the UK population, or 16 million people, voted to stay in the EU on 23rd June.  Some of the 17 million 'leave' voters are now regretting their decision given the repercussions.  \r\nThis is our opportunity to stop the UK leaving the EU and to give our children the future they deserve in Europe.",
