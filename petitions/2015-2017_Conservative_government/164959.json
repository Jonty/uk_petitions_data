        "additional_details": "I have experienced this in public places such as restaurants, pubs, people looking at you disapprovingly, saying derogatory remarks loud enough for you to hear, but the worst thing I have ever experienced so far, was being 8 months pregnant, visiting my doctors surgery and no-one standing up and offering me a seat.  Instead they looked at me with what I can only describe as pure disgust.  Is this any worse than being a racist ?  Surely we are still talking about the colour of someones skin.  ",
        "background": "For many generations tattooed individuals have fallen victim to discrimination and negative behaviour directed towards them.  In the workplace particularly this appears to be an issue.  Employers decline some applications due to the individual having tattoos; some people have even been fired.  ",
