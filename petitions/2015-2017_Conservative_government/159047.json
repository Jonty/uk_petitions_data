        "additional_details": "We believe it is vital Britain\u2019s government gives a guarantee to expats, many of whom have set up businesses and put down roots with families in their adopted country.\r\nWe pay taxes here, yet, for example in Spain, we cannot vote in regional or national elections. If we\u2019ve been here more than 15 years, we can't vote anywhere.\r\nWe urge the next UK prime minister to ensure British expats do not have their rights \u2018negotiated\u2019 away. It's vital we're represented in the critical coming months.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "There are 1.2 million British expats living in the EU.\r\nDespite these numbers, we don't have an official voice, a local MP or parliamentary body, to fight our corner.\r\nDespite being strongly pro-Europe, we will suffer the most from Brexit. We need representation to protect our interests.\r\n\r\n ",
