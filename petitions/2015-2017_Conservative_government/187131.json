        "action": "Remove the 5% surcharge on Direct Debit Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) payments.",
        "additional_details": "The administrative costs should be relatively consistent between the monthly, 6-monthly and yearly options. In fact, administrative costs may be lower for the monthly option as there will be less requirement for part-refunds when people sell their vehicles.\r\nThe surcharge should reflect fair administrative costs and, as it currently stands, it doesn't seem to. The current structure feels like a throwback from the old paper based system.",
        "background": "It's possible to pay for vehicle tax (VED) via Direct Debit monthly, 6-monthly, or yearly. The monthly and 6-monthly options induce a 5% surcharge. Any surcharge should fairly reflect the administrative costs, but in this case the administrative costs should be very similar between the options.",
