        "additional_details": "There is a great deal of information available on the advantages of reforestation. An early study in the USA (Effect of Reforestation on Streamflow in Central New York) made a detailed study of hydrological data. Three areas were reforested with a mixture of pine and spruce and compared to a non-forested control area. After 26 years, data was gathered and it was found that peak discharge into local rivers had reduced by an average of 41%, and up to 66% in November.",
        "background": "For millennia, Britain's uplands were forested, the trees and underbrush acting as a natural sponge, absorbing heavy rainfall and releasing it gradually into watercourses. With climate change bringing heavier rain, restoring the forests will prevent flooding in our northern towns and cities",
