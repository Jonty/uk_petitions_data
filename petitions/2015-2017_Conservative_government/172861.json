        "additional_details": "They seem to be the same guys locally to Derby that were doing it thus time last year! \r\nAnd are approaching the same vans and cutting the same wires and leaving families with hundreds of pounds to pay to replace all the stolen items. \r\nIt's seems to be more and more difficult for the police to get any sort of convictions. \r\nI understand that these individuals are extremely careful to not leave a trace. \r\nThey are quick also and are using fake reg plates. A bigger deterrent is needed",
        "background": "As a community and probably many others around we are completely enraged with the continued theft of tools/power tools out of vans overnight...\r\nThe numbers are increasing dramatically..\r\nSomething needs to be done to protect the hardworking, grafting community just trying to make an honest living!",
