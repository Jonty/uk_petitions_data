        "action": "Create Legislation Making Saturday & Sundays Clearing Days for Banking Purposes",
        "additional_details": "Banks state that payments can take days to register into an account excluding weekends. Credit Card Companies and Debit Card Companies advise refunds can take up to 5 days excluding weekends. Internet payment processors also exclude Saturday & Sunday from their clearing cycle, when in real terms it takes only a button to be pressed to action a payment and the computer does the rest. Most businesses operate 7 days a week and consumers live 7 days a week so why is our money regularly held by Banks",
        "background": "Banks, card companies and payment processors delay consumer and customers payments using Saturday & Sundays as Non Clearing days for payments. In modern society and in the age of computers and automated systems, this is unacceptable and causes consumers and the economy delays in the money chain ",
