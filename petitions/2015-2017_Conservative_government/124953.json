        "action": "Move the Westminster Government at least 100 miles further North, permanently.",
        "additional_details": "Presently even the leadership of the Northern Powerhouse is 97% in London (Guardian, 7/3/16).\r\n\r\nThe forthcoming, very costly refurbishment means the Westminster government will need at least a temporary home. Other worthy petitions call for it to be 'outside London'. This one calls for permanent relocation, a clear and 'pychological' distance to the North of London. The physical Houses of Parliament could be refurbished with a view to some other use.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Moving the seat of government out of the UK's richest enclave would make MPs think differently about all of the country.  It would put thousands of highly-paid supporting jobs where costs are lower and whose local economy would benefit from a boost, and impact London House prices favourably. ",
