        "additional_details": "What is Pre-Charge Bail?\r\nPre-charge bail is a legal loophole in which an individual who has been arrested, but not charged, can be placed on bail while police gather evidence. \r\n\r\nPrime Minister (then Home Secretary) Theresa May has said:\r\n\"I have been clear that it is simply not acceptable for individuals to spend months and in some cases years on pre-charge bail, with no system of review, only for charges never to be brought against them.\"\r\n",
        "background": "The current use of Pre-Charge Bail is unacceptable. Firstly, restrictions are imposed upon individuals who have not been charged with a crime, and imposed without evidence. Secondly, there is no maximum duration for this imposition, therefore suspects can be held in legal limbo for years.      ",
