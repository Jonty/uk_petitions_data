        "additional_details": "Solving this would be to enforce that people who recieve benefits would be required to undertake 10hrs free work a week to recieve their benefits. It would help the community and also give experience to the people whom recieve them. The people whom claim benefits would have to be accessed to see if they are capable and fit to undetake the tasks of the community.",
        "background": "As the government keeps on cutting money for councils, they have an ever growing problem of finding additional funds to do community projects. Therefore some tasks are no longer undertook by the council like they once were. This can be seen from local parks to general litter picking.",
