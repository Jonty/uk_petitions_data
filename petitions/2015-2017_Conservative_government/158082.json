No government funding is provided to any service for male victims of domestic abuse, some money is given to the men's advice line. There are approx 10 000 refuge beds specifically for women, there are around 20 for men. 2 out of every 5 victims are male 40% men need 40% of the budget allocated to services to fund refuge beds, outreach support etc. This is not a gender issue this is about victims not gender. ",

Nothing is spent on male victims.1/3 of all victims are male. 1 in 6 men experience abuse. The government needs a minister for men and boys, there is a minister for women. ",
