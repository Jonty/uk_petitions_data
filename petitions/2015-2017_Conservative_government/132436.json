        "additional_details": " For example,  when Chappell was asked how much profit he made from BHS he did not have the answer and said he would provide it 'as soon as practicable ', this would not have happened if there was a proper process in place.  This absolutely crucial information should have been required by the committee in advance.",
        "background": "Having recently seen the parliamentary select committee for Dominic Chappell regarding BHS, it seemed all too easy for him to make unsubstantiated statements in defence of his conduct, and hide behind documents not being readily available.\r\n",
