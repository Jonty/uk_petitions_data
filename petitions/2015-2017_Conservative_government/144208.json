        "additional_details": "According to Peter Catterall of the University of Westminster speaking with Business Insider, that no legal provision was included in the EU referendum legislation that requires the UK Parliament to act in accordance with the outcome of the referendum and is therefor not legally binding. Instead, it is merely advisory, and, could be totally ignored by UK government. ",
        "background": "It is now obvious that the UK voting to be out of Europe in the recent referendum is bringing and will only bring, further turmoil to the UK, Europe and the world. For Britain to begin withdrawing from the 28-nation bloc, the government would need to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.",
