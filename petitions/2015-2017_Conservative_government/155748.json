        "additional_details": "Many people have publicly asserted that they voted to leave, but have now changed their minds just days after the referendum.  There have been no similar reports of people who voted to remain wishing they could change their vote. In most other major decisions it is recognised that there should be a cooling off period to allow people to recover from any pressure or influence an unscrupulous sales man may have put them under.  We should have no less protection in this world changing vote.",
        "background": "In most contracts there is a cooling off period allowing you to change you mind and void the contract.  So many people who voted to leave have come forward to say they have cooled off and changed their minds that parliament should void the referendum given the narrow margin involved.",
