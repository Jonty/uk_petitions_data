        "action": "Please don\u2019t let the UK leave the EU as a result of very misleading slogans.",
        "additional_details": "We ask that neither parliament nor any individual politician invokes Article 50 until the UK electorate has had a far more considered and caring debate than happened prior to the EU referendum. We also request that these extended electoral and parliamentary debates should now include more honest facts on both sides, and have their sources stated and independently verified where possible. MP's still have a constitutional duty to act in the UK's best interest. Over 48% of people voted to remain.",
        "background": "Based on a most questionably led referendum it will be the UK Parliament, and not voters (who in their referendum vote have quite likely been seriously misled by both campaigns), who will decide whether or not to invoke Article 50. If Article 50 is invoked the UK will be asking to leave the EU.",
