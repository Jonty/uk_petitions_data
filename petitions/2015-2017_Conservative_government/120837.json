        "additional_details": "In addition to my statement above, I have recently complained to a restaurant who did not fully advertised serving halal meat. In Reading within 1 mile of each other supermarkets and restaurants are selling halal meat without advertising it to the public, this is against human rights of those who do not want to eat halal meat. It is also against individuals religions. Halal meat will be stopped in England. ",
        "background": "I am starting this petition as the produce of halal meat makes me extremely frustrated/upset as I feel this is an extreme and unnecessary way of killing animals for meat produce. I feel that not everyone is aware of how halal meat is slaughtered and I am determined to ban halal meat in England!",
