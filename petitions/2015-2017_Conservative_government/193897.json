The Government is launching the procurement process now to ensure there is sufficient time to produce and design UK passports from 2019 when the current contract ends. The contract covers design, print, assembly and personalisation of passports. \r\n\r\nWe're not sure whether you would like the UK passport not to be redesigned at all, including to protect against counterfeiting.  You could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more about the procurement process for the new contract here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/ed7d8332-74cd-4e83-a41c-01472667348b?p=@NT08=UFQxUlRRPT0=NjJ\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n"
