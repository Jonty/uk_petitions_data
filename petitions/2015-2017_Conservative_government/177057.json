        "additional_details": "Dronfield Against Fracking oppose seismic testing & fracking for various reasons including:\r\n1. Long term damage to countryside from an aesthetic point of view.\r\n2. Risk of structural damage to property from damage to old mine workings from both horizontal and vertical drilling.\r\n3. Large increase in traffic from HGV's on country roads.\r\n4. Falling property prices.\r\n5. Invalidate some household insurance policies from fracking damage.\r\n6. Polluted waste water entering our water course in future years.",
        "background": "Ineos (owned by an offshore parent company) has been awarded the fracking rights by the Government for Dronfield and its surrounding areas. \r\nWe believe fracking is unproven technology, environmentally damaging in numerous ways, presents a health risk to both the general public and its workers.",
