        "additional_details": "It it proven that when civilians have the opportunity to vote on serious topics within our country they often don't take the chance to because they cannot be bothered which in my opinion is quite unfair! Unfair that unreasonable changes are being made when not everybody has agreed or had their say. Why wouldn't you want us to be happy ? See us enjoy the world we live in even more than usual ? All you have to do is sign this petition , please , many thanks .",
        "background": "I believe that you should lower the voting age in the country , due to the fact that many young people complain about how certain things are ran in the UK. For example if we were able to vote maybe we would be more satisfied on how things are delt with making us young people happier with how we live",
