        "additional_details": "My name is Kasey & I own a raccoon named Cody. We recieved a lot of attention in both national & social media this year: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3560498/A-racoon-helped-animal-lover-Kasey-conquer-crippling-social-anxiety-takes-walks.html \r\n\r\nNow that the IAS legislation casts Cody as an Invasive Animal Species, he is no longer allowed outside for walks. This means he is lacking exercise & socialisation. It will also effect his health & life span. Please help us to change this rule.",
        "background": "I would like to change the current rules in the Invasive Animal Species legislation that states any animal on the list is no longer allowed outside for walks. I believe if the animal is of good nature, neutered and on a secure harness with a responsible owner then there should be no risk of escape.",
