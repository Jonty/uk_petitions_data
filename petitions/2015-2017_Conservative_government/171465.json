        "action": "End the 'Special Relationship' with the USA in the event of a Trump presidency.",
        "additional_details": "In a campaign mired in racism, xenophobia, extremism, and sexual assault, Donald Trump has outlined plans which, due to the US/UK 'Special Relationship', may endanger British citizens and interests. This includes nuclear proliferation in Korea and Japan, the abandonment of NATO, forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall, ground troops in Syria, torture, opposition to China, and potential war with Iran and North Korea. If Trump wins, the UK must take a stand against his administration.",
        "background": "After 580,000 petitioned to ban his entry into the UK, Trump may become president. Our Special Relationship means the British people may be dragged into economic, political and military conflict by a hated man. In this time of vulnerability, the UK must distance itself from Trump's America. ",
