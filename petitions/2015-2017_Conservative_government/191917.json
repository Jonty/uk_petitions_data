The blame at the moment is always on the driver when he has limited vision but the cyclist does not have limited vision.",
        "background": "A cyclist will always see a truck but the driver of a Heavy Good Vehicle will not always see a cyclist. Blame should therefore be on the cyclist for putting themselves into a dangerous area of a blind spot. Truck drivers know there is a blind spot but can't react to something they can't see.",
