        "action": "Make it law that holiday insurance can not be ageist or pre medical conditions",
        "additional_details": "People are living longer and are more active in later life and retirement.\r\nThe government urge the older generation to become more active, this in turn makes health issues less with a faster recovery rate.\r\nWith this in mind why should insurance companies be allowed to discriminate against the older generation to create extra revenue.\r\nI would like the government to make a law that stops discrimination against the elderly. Some are refused cover and have to travel without insurance cover.",
        "background": "Make it law holiday insurance companies can not be ageist and discriminate health issues by charging extortionate premiums. Once over 65 yrs of age premiums increase dramatically without just cause. Medical conditions pre or existing are charged regardless, as they may be cured or controlled etc.",
