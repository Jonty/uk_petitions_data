        "additional_details": "In the UK you're required to renew your licence when turning 70 and every three years after. Yet it's not compulsory to take a driving assessment to prove they're fit/well enough to drive.\r\nI'm not saying they shouldn't be allowed to drive, but make them more aware of the dangers.\r\n\r\nBeing a new driver I'm much aware of the rules of the road and I'm a very cautious driver. From my personal experience having an elderly person driving on the other side of the road frightens me. \r\n",
        "background": "As many of us know the high way code is constantly changing and some drivers aren't aware of this. \r\nElderly people are not aware of the dangers they put themselves and others in because of this, which is why I feel it should be compulsory for anyone 65+ to take a driving assessment every 3 years.
