        "additional_details": "Our children are being failed by the Tory government. \r\nStudents are being forced to do the Ebacc and have their choices limited as a result of the narrowing of the curriculum.\r\nSchools are being forced to be Academies which statistics prove are no better than when we had LEA schools. \r\nSchools need money to implement new changes and syllabuses yet are given no extra money. What's worse is that leaders of Academy Chains are paid ridiculous sums. Sir Daniel Moynihan takes over \u00a313,000 per Academy!",
        "background": "I would like a vote of no confidence in the Government's Education policies. There is now a crisis in teaching. Too many teachers are leaving the profession and the children and young people of our country are being let down by narrow minded Tories. \r\nThey are failing children, parents and Britain.",
