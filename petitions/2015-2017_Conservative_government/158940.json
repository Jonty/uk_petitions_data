In a country where the equality of individuals is recognised and enshrined in so many of our laws, we must not take the gross backwards step of making people feel they are less valued because of where they are from or how much they earn. ",
        "background": "To deport someone on the basis, for example, of earning less than a certain amount is inhumane. The pressure on people and families resulting from such a threat would be very damaging, could cause families to break up and damage vital social links. Such a deportation policy would be HEART-BREAKING. ",
