        "action": "Reinstate the Dubs Amendment to continue allowing refugee children into the UK.",
        "additional_details": "The Immigration Act 2016 was amended to permit unaccompanied refugee children into the UK, as proposed by Lord Dubs.  It was to allow approximately 4000 children (out of an estimated 90000 refugee children in Europe) into this country, and there was a nationwide appeal for foster families to receive them.  However the Government has decided to terminate the scheme in March having taken in a mere 350 children. This is unacceptable and does not live up to British values of generosity and honesty.",
        "background": "The refugee crisis in North Africa and the Middle East has led to millions of refugees, many of them children, fleeing war and persecution and travelling great distances to reach safety in Europe.  Many children are unaccompanied and endure horrendous conditions in camps, at risk from trafficking.",
