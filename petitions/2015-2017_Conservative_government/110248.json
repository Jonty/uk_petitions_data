        "additional_details": "After fighting for my life back from anorexia, I feel more passionate than ever to change ridiculous ideologies of society that in order to look beautiful or good in clothes, that we have to look a certain way; thin. The average size of UK women is 14. So why when I walk around high street shops do I see manikins with size 6 clothes on, with 2 inch tucks. This is not right. The magazines and modelling programmes we see are all full of severely underweight models. Why? It's unhealthy and harmful.",
        "background": "Why are we cementing into our population that in order to look beautiful you have to be thin? True beauty is our differences; our differences are what make us, us. We need to embrace our bodies, and stop brainwashing society with the use of anorexic models and severely underweight manikins. ",
