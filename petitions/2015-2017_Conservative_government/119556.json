        "additional_details": "Southern water and local authority should be treating this as an urgent matter that needs immediate rectification. 2 hours to what is usually 20 minutes every day at rush hour then to be told it wont be opening for the immediate future by the kent messenger is unacceptable!",
        "background": "The a249 is the only main road to sittingbourne and sheppey without using smaller roads. When they closed under the sittingbourne exit for repairs everyone has to exit onto the slip road which causes tailbacks as far as the m2. There are no crews working nights or weekends to repair this quickly.",
