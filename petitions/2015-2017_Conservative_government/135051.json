        "action": "Request all Conservative MPs who voted remain to cross the floor",
        "additional_details": "According to the BBC on June 22nd 2016, 479 MPs declared they wanted to remain in the EU, 158 wanted to leave and and 13 stayed neutral. That's 74% of elected representatives wanted to stay. It's time for those who believe in that to put aside party politics and temporarily join the opposition to stop this current government doing an act they may regret. Over 16million UK voters wanted to stay - lets give them that chance by letting our informed leaders decide. ",
        "background": "The recent referendum on remaining in the EU did not represent the proportional views of the elected representatives in the UK Parliament. We are asking those MPs to cross the floor to the opposition to create a minority government and force a general election before we leave the EU.",
