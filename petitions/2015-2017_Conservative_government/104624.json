        "background": "The commonly held belief is that Ministers are out of touch with society and don't realize the true cost of living, it would be great for a whole year remove the salary they are given and replace with the proposed \"Living Wage\" from the 2015 budget on the hourly basis most Brits will live on.",

IPSA conducted a public consultation after 2012 and decided what the salaries of MPs should be after the election.\r\n\r\nIPSA also oversees and regulates MPs\u2019 business costs and expenses.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contact IPSA with your suggestions, here\u2019s how to contact them:\r\n\r\nhttp://parliamentarystandards.org.uk/About%20Us/Pages/Contact-Us.aspx\r\n"
