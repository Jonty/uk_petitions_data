        "action": "Stop the scrapping of the parent governor role in schools",
        "additional_details": "An \"online parental forum\" has been put forward under the same proposal to replace the parent positions on school governing bodies, but an online forum will not have the same impact as the physical position on the school's governing body which enables parents to have input into the school. Who are these professionals if not the teachers (with some of the right skills already), and the parents who actually know their children?",
        "background": "The government wants to scrap the requirement for elected parent positions on school governing bodies, in favour of them prioritising \"professionals with the right skills\" instead. This risks the end of parental input into their child's school and related parent-teacher collaboration.",
