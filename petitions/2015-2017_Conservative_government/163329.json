        "additional_details": "The national minimum wage for under 18s is \u00a33.87. An annual train pass is around \u00a31 000 for a 16 year-old (National Rail Enquires) and an annual bus pass is around \u00a3500 for the same age (Lincolnshire County Council). Over 16s by law must stay in full-time education or an apprenticeship until the age of 18. Student rail cards and other discounts are sometimes available but are not widely promoted, especially in rural areas.",
        "background": "Bus and train fares can be difficult to pay for under 18s with a low minimum wage for our age group and high prices. Even though we are legally recognised as children, we have to pay the same price as an adult with a full-time job. Students attending university don\u2019t have to pay the full adult fare.",
