        "additional_details": "This action, which is currently being challenged by the ACLU in the USA, is counter to the values that many in America and the world hold dear. The UK Govt. must clearly and unreservedly condemn this action by the US President. It is the responsibility of those in power to speak up when those with whom they are closely allied act unjustly. Those who believe in freedom and justice for all must not stand by and watch this happen. They must act. ",
        "background": "President Trump has used his executive powers to immediately stop refugees entering the USA for four months, and Syrian refugees indefinitely. The order also prevents individuals from a group of predominantly muslim countries, including those with Green Cards and valid visas, to enter the USA.",
