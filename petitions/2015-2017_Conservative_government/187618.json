        "additional_details": "We need this because going through the job process is very hard, people with mental health issues get help while in the deep of their situations, then when they are finished get shoved away onto job seekers and left to deal with their life. There is no support in North east Essex which stands with an individual to the moment they are excepted for a job. There is no obvious help which extends the skills to fight mental illness while the job process happens. Sometimes we all need a little help. ",
        "background": "I know a number of individuals who suffer ill mental health, and getting a job is hard enough for the people who don't. We need to come up with the sort of help that doesn't just include how to survive, but a course which helps continue skills to fight ill mental health while getting back to work. ",
