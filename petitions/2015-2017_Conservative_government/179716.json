        "action": "Start aid drops for starving men, women and children in Syrian cities",
        "additional_details": "It is my dream that this petition be the catalyst, the driving force that ushers in a new ideology that instead of causing division and hate people will spread unity and peace. This ties in with British values. We are told to \"love thy neighbour as thyself\". In schools we are taught to have \"mutual respect for and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs and for those without faith\" this petition emulates that value and by sending aid we embody that value into an action.",
        "background": "In light of the Trump Muslim ban Muslims, especially Syrians, have been alienated and will feel as though the world is against them. I believe that Great Britain should give aid to the Syrian people in order to spread peace and unity in the international community.",
