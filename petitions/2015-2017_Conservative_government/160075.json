        "additional_details": "During both the Scottish Independence referendum and the recent EU referendum both sides made statements which were exaggerated or simply untrue, and in some cases knowingly untrue. \r\nTV debates do not help present the truth or facts which voters need to make an informed decision.\r\nDemocracy only works if voters are given accurate information on which to make their decision. An outcome which has been affected by dishonest campainging cannot reflect the democratic will of the people.",
        "background": "Many people feel they cannot trust what polititians tell them in election campaigns and referrendums. This undermines democracy. They should be made to take an oath then should be required to say whether whatever they say is 'factual' or just their opinion. If factual they should disclose the source",
