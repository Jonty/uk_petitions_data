This caused a pro-hunting firm to call him a \"self confessed nutjob\" in a tweet, a tweet which was then retweeted by Nicholas Soames.\r\n\r\nHow can Nicholas Soames accurately and sensitively support members of the public if he also supports the use derogatory slurs to describe them? I have no confidence that this man can help the people who look up to him for that help.",

Diversity is part of what makes Britain great, and autistic people are part of that diversity. Therefore, it is absolutely unacceptable for MPs to brand autistic people as 'nut jobs'.\r\n\r\n",
