        "action": "Appeal to PM Theresa May not to \u201cshut the door\u201d to vulnerable refugee children",
        "additional_details": "As the 6th wealthiest nation in the world we cannot turn away from our moral duty to care for some of the most vulnerable children. Our tradition of offering sanctuary to the needy and vulnerable must be maintained.\r\nRescuing vulnerable children is well above party politics. We urge the Conservative government to reverse this shameful decision and co-operate with local authorities, charities and local communities to rescue these vulnerable children from hardship and exploitation by traffickers.\r\n",
        "background": "The Dubs Amendment was to take in 3,000 of the most vulnerable child refugees and was agreed last year by PM David Cameron. After just 350 children out of the promised 3,000 arrive in UK the government has shamefully decided to shut the door on some of the most vulnerable children in the world.",
