        "additional_details": "The UK has a long history of enshrining the rights of it's citizens in law, from the Magna Carta in 1215 onwards we actually have a proud history of attempting (if not always succeeding) to insure human rights are protected in law.\r\n\r\nIn the interests of empowering the people that they should know their rights, and thus aid the government in insuring the public trust it's promise to uphold human rights, giving (not selling) every household a copy of the new document is essential.",
        "background": "In anticipation of the UK government's desire to replace the Human Rights act with a British Bill of Rights, it seems vital that every citizen have available to them a hard copy version of the new document thus insuring they can know, with complete transparency, exactly what their rights are.",
