        "additional_details": "In order to provide a democratic mandate, this is needed before notice is given under Article 50.  Remain should be one of the options. There might be a single Leave option, corresponding to what the UK can realistically hope to negotiate, or else two options, one that includes access to the European Single Market and one that includes control of migration of EU nationals.",
        "background": "The choice presented was between one Remain option and several incompatible Leave options. Although only 48% voted for Remain, it may still have had more support than any single Leave option.  Therefore a second referendum is needed when clear options have been established.",
