Please accept our condolences.\r\n\r\nWe can't accept your petition in its current form as it does not call for a clear action from the UK Government and Parliament. It is not clear from your petition what specific rights you would like the UK Government and Parliament to grant to the parents of children who are stillborn. You could start a petition outlining what specific action you would like the Government and Parliament to take."
