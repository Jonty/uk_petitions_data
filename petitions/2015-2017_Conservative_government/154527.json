        "additional_details": "Immigration was a hotly contested aspect of the EU referendum and the government is likely to bring in new legislation covering immigration as part of its response to the referendum. Nonetheless, many EU citizens have made a home in the UK in good faith and potential change to their status is destabilising to them and to the communities they contribute to. Stabilisation of this situation is urgent",
        "background": "There are over 3 million EU citizens currently living and working in the UK. They make a substantial contribution to the economic and cultural life of our country. The EU referendum has thrown their status into question. We need to reassure them that they will always be welcome.",
