        "additional_details": "The argument against assisted suicide seems to be that people could be coerced into taking their own lives. Frankly if other countries can put in measures to reduce this possibility, I cannot think it is beyond us. To die, at a time of ones choosing, painlessly and with loved ones around you is surely what we all wish for.\r\n My situation is far from unique and 1000's of people are condemoned \r\nto an end of pain and suffering which could so easily be avoided. Is this not what true compassion is?",
        "background": "As a veterinary surgeon I have euthansed many animals and consider it an honour and priviledge to have been able to end their suffering and give them a swift and painless end. \r\nAt aged 47 I was diagnosed with breast cancer, and despite it being caught early 18 months later it is now terminal",
