        "additional_details": "It is clear that the large majority of MPs elected at the last General Election supported remaining in the EU. They are now unable or unwilling to continue expressing these views. They therefore no longer have a mandate to represent their constituents and it is highly desirable that they submit themselves for re-election or withdraw from parliament, before any further action is taken towards leaving the EU.",
        "background": "UK is a parliamentary democracy. We elect MPs to take important decisions-frame laws/negotiate treaties. We are not constitutionally run by populist sentiment. Majority of MPs did not support leaving EU, yet we are on the brink of withdrawing, without formal debate or vote in the House of Commons.\r\n",
