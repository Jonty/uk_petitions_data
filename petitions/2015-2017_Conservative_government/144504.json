It (and other seemingly false statements eg Re Turkey) were relied on by the electorate.\r\n\r\nIf untrue there may be conduct contrary to S.2 of the Fraud Act 2006. \r\nThe electorate has made a momentous decision of  the greatest importance in the public interest. \r\n\r\nIf that decision was, or may have been, procured by fraud or merely lies it must be a nullity.\r\n",

If untrue a false statement, made dishonestly, knowing it is or might be untrue or misleading, with intent to make a gain for himself or to cause loss to another is a fraud.",
