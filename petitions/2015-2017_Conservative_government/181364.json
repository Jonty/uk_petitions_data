        "action": "Reduce cost of cancer drugs supplied to the NHS using Nonprofit organizations",
        "additional_details": "Academics say the prices of some cancer drugs have increased by between 100% and nearly 1,000% over the past five years in the UK. These are all generic drugs where the patent has expired, which means they can be made for little more than the cost of the raw ingredients. Profiteering drug companies have continued to raise prices of out-of-patent cancer medicines that cost just pence to make, inflating the bills of the cash-strapped NHS by hundreds of millions of pounds.",
        "background": "By using nonprofit organizations and philanthropic foundations in the actual manufacture (or importation) and delivery of lifesaving drugs will help to make them available at a much lower cost.",
