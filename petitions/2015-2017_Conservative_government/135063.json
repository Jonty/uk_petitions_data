        "action": "A second EU referendum including EU nationals living and working in the UK",
        "additional_details": "A similar petition was dismissed on the following grounds: \r\n- \"historical ties with Irish and Commonwealth citizens resident in the UK\". There are also historical ties between the UK and the EU. The UK joined in 1961, 4 years after the Treaty of Rome (free movement of workers).\r\n- \"usual practice for referendums in other EU states\". True - however at \u00a31,000 the cost of applying for UK citizenship is out of line with other EU states (e.g. cost of applying for French citizenship = \u20ac55).",
        "background": "3 millions EU nationals live and work in the UK, contribute to the UK economy and social fabric, pay UK taxes. The results of the EU referendum matter a great deal to them, their (often British) spouses and children. Yet they have been effectively muzzled by voting laws. This needs to be put right.",
