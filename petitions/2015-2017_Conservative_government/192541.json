        "additional_details": "With an ever growing population in the Greater Manchester area and more people using public transport, it seems stupid not to use this station as either a temporary solution or a permanent one. With the electrification project behind schedule towards Preston and Blackpool and more paths needed this will be a massive relief for Manchester piccadilly which is possibly at full capacity.",
        "background": "Reopen the Old Mayfield Train station in Manchester for Virgin Trains and stop wasting money on Hs2. The capacity problems around Manchester could be solved for many train services with this additional station which is in close proximity to Manchester piccadilly train station.",
