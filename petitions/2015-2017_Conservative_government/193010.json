        "additional_details": "WhatsApp describes End-to-end encryption here: https://www.whatsapp.com/faq/en/general/28030015\r\n\r\nThis means any terrorist activity can not be found and therefore allows terrorists to communicate with each other, coordinate attacks and avoid detection. We cannot risk another attack because WhatsApp refuses to end its policy of protecting messages from ANYONE. If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about- Ban WhatsApp in the UK until they begin complying with the UK government.",
        "background": "With the recent attacks in London, the usage of WhatsApp has come into the public eye again as a way for terrorists to avoid detection because of 'End-to-End encryption'. Ban WhatsApp in the UK as it is a National Security threat, unless they begin to comply with the UK government.",
