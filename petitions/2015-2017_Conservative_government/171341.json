But any change to the speed limit would have to be based on a full and sound understanding of the wider safety, environmental and other impacts of such a change.  \r\n\r\nAn initial assessment of the possibility of introducing trials of 80 mph limits was made in 2012-13 but we currently have no plans to do so. \r\n\r\nThe ability to set speed limits, including the national limits, in Scotland and Wales has been devolved to the Scottish Government and the Welsh Government.  Northern Ireland is responsible for its own road traffic legislation.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport",
