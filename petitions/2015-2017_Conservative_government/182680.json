        "additional_details": "My mother was born in May 1953, she worked for 35 years and paid married women's reduced rate NI contributions during her married years. Divorced after 30 years, due to that divorce does not qualify for a full state pension leaving her over \u00a35000 a year worse off. She has had to top up her personal contribution to get \u00a344 per week pension instead of \u00a3119. She was not notified of this change until trying to claim her pension. Women who fall into this catagory should retain full pension. ",
        "background": "Pension rules were changed in April 2016, these changes affected some women who had previously paid married women's National Insurance contributions making their pensions reduced or not able to claim a state pension at all. \r\n\r\nMy mother, along with many others will have fallen foul of this change.",
