        "additional_details": "As a BILL(May's proposals of implementing EU laws) is ridiculous, Parliament should have a say.\r\n\r\nThe Government, including our current administration cannot handle Brexit.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey have got no idea of what the European Union is and have no plan.\r\n\r\nThey would basically betray the people's will as leave voters are stereotyped as racist twats. \r\n\r\nThe will of the people is to look after those in need, not to exclude ourselves and commit suicide or follow even deluded ideas.\r\n\r\nThe people want change.",
        "background": "On 23rd June 2016 the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in a referendum provided for by an Act of Parliament. We are committed to implementing the democratic outcome of the referendum.\r\nWhat the Government does not know is that this is a constitutional democracy, not a fake democracy.",
