        "additional_details": "Recently, with the EU referendum, 75% 18-24 year olds voted to stay and 61% of 65+ year olds voted to leave. 16 and 17 year olds had no say in the future of their countries. Can you imagine what the turn out would've been if there 16 and 17 year olds? My peers and I all have strong opinions which we should be able to voice. Why do other generations get to decide things that affect us equally? Is this just? ",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, call upon the HM Government to allow 16 year olds to vote.The average lifespan for a UK citizen is 81.50 years. That means, as a 16 year old, we have decisions made for us that can affect our lives and futures for the next 65.5 years. ",
