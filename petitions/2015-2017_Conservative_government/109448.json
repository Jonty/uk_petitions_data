        "additional_details": "Each year around two million cats and hundreds of thousands of dogs are killed for their fur in China. This may occur on the other side of the world, but it is fuelled by the demand for fur in many European countries, including the UK. Fur bought in the UK is often falsely labelled as \"Asian jackal\" or \"Rabbit\" fur, which is why cat and dog fur finds its way into the EU. See the following link for more information: http://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-clothing/fur/chinese-fur-industry/",
        "background": "Rabbits, minks and foxes are animals commonly killed for their fur to be used on a piece of clothing. But, what if I told you that cats and dogs, just like the beloved pets in your home, are also tortured and killed? Banning all animal fur in the UK will help to decline the demand for animal fur.",
