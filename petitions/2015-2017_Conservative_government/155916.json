        "additional_details": "In light of the brexit vote an incoming Prime Minister would not have a mandate from the people to proceed with the removal of the UK from the EU.\r\n\r\nAlthough convention is that the ruling group can replace it's leader without a general election, it is also necessary in the interest of democracy to change convention to reflect the needs of a modern democratic society.",
        "background": "For many years it has been common practice for the Prime Minister to be replaced by another person from within the ruling group. The situation has changed, general elections now focus so strongly upon the leader it would be undemocratic not to call a general election.",
