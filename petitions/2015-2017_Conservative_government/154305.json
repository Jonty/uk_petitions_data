        "additional_details": "In the recent EU referendum the Leave campaign bus said we pay \u00a3350m a week to the EU let's pay it to the NHS instead.  This had been shown to be false by the Office of National Statistics but there was no legislative power to force them to remove it.  Numbers are often given to make political points without the necessary caveats and context which make them meaningful and useful.  This is bad for democracy.  A law which forced campaign information to be accurate or be withdrawn would help. ",
        "background": "Politicians can use figures which are misleading or false without consequence.  e.g. there was no requirement for Leave campaigners to repaint their battle bus, the Remain campaign's \u00a34300 worse off was based on GDP not income.  Figures without context misleads and undermines faith in politics. ",
