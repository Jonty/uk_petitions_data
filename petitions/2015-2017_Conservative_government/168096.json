        "additional_details": "The referendum is only advisory. All those who brought it about have left their positions. We now have an un-elected PM and no opposition to question her actions. There were so many untruths and mis-directions given, that the result cannot be allowed to stand.\r\nKen Clarke, with many years experience in Parliament and Europe is the only person still in Parliament who is suitably qualified to steer the UK in a direction that will benefit us all.",
        "background": "As we now have an un-elected Prime Minister who is struggling with the advisory referendum on UK membership of the EU, we, the undersigned, ask that Kenneth Clarke MP, immediately  replace Theresa May and stop the UK from destroying its' place on the world stage.",
