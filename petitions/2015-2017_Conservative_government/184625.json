It's setting a crazy standard for our daughters. \r\n\r\nLet's persuade the stores to show our girls something more realistic in all their advertising. Tall, short, thin, not so thin, white, black and everything in between. \r\n\r\nThe stores should reflect the reality of the world we live in. I don't want my daughter dieting her entire life to try and \"look right\".",
