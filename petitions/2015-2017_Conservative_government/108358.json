        "additional_details": "Having worked with children who have been sexually abused it is so very harrowing listening to them tell you what has happened.  The majority of child sex offenders are from within their own family.\r\nIt is critical that action be taken now to ensure that the men and women, whose sole desire is to abuse and harm our children, are given mandatory treatment programmes before they are released.  \r\nAny paedophile who abuses babies, some only a few days old, keep in prison for life and mean life.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Paedophiles cannot be cured, but with a full special treatment programme, they could re-offend less or not at all than without the treatment.  \r\nBeing castrated does not work as child sex offenders would just use other methods of sexually hurting children with their evil fantasies.",
