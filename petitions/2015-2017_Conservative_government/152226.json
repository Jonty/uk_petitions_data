        "action": "Allow a debate on a General Election by repealing the Fixed-term Parliaments Act",
        "additional_details": "Once the Act is repealed a debate on a General Election can be petitioned for and the government would also be free to decide to call an election. The political landscape has changed so much since the last election that the people of the U.K. deserve the opportunity to elect new representatives to decide how to take the nation forwards.  This is not currently something that Parliament will accept a petition to debate, due to the rules under the Act, which it is bound by.",
        "background": "In the wake of the resignation of the PM, the result of the advisory EU referendum & the disarray of the main opposition, the political landscape has changed immeasurably & justifies an election. A petition to debate a General Election failed because of the Act. The Act should be repealed.",
