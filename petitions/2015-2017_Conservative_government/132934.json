        "action": "Government fund Boot Camps for teenagers instead of children's homes and units",
        "additional_details": "We want to prevent children and teenagers from enduring this type of situation. They also regularly go missing from homes resulting in more police resources. Police have confirmed that missing children is a regularity which is often a waste of police time. If we were to introduce teenage bootcamps it would prevent a lot of future crime and saving expenses on services such as police, social work, alcohol addiction, drug rehabilitation, psychologists, prison sentences, teenage pregnancies and more",
        "background": "More and more children and teenagers become worse off after being referred to care homes and units. The reason being is that they end up establishing new relationships with others who have considerably worse issues. The result of this can have a severe negative impact rather than help the situation.",
