As a result while maybe 80% are enjoying bank holiday on 26 as normal, 20% miss family as Boxing Days classed differently",
        "background": "The whole country understand Boxing Day is the 2nd day of the Christmas holidays, the day after Christmas Day. Time used to visit family. Business use bank holiday rules to shift it to a day of their choice & force people to work. The country take it on the 26th, those forced to work, do another day",
