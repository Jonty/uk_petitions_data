        "background": "Some state schools are charging parents up to \u00a31.80 per child daily to eat a packed lunch on school premises. This is as much as the cost of a school meal.  Parents are paying twice to feed their children. The cost is disproportionate to the effort expended by the school to supervise lunchtimes.",
