        "additional_details": "Those aged 16 & 17 voted in the Scottish referendum where they engaged passionately with ~75% turnout. \r\n\r\nThis decision may not be reversed after the next election or in our lifetimes so it's vital those aged 16+ can vote.\r\n\r\nWe are not the first to petition on this topic (http://tinyurl.com/pxc3khs).\r\nHelp young people have their say by supporting the House of Lords amendment and allowing those aged 16+ to vote: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2015-2016/0060/amend/am060-d.htm",
        "background": "Everyone aged 16+ should be given the right to vote on their country's future in the EU.\r\n\r\nThe referendum will be pivotal in shaping these young people's future, who are free to travel, study & work within the EU. They deserve a say in whether these opportunities will be available in years to come.",
