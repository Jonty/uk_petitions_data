It still stays on their report for six years.\r\nSix years of adverse reports against a persons name is oppressive and stops people from being able to set up a business or get a mortgage.    \r\nThey should especially be removed if the CCJ or Default concerned is under \u00a31000.  \r\nOnce a debt is paid it should be removed off a persons credit file immediately.
