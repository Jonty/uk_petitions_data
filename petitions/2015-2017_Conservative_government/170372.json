        "additional_details": "Men across the world are taking their own lives because of the unfair justice towards them. Fathers are willing to go to jail for protesting for equal rights to see, and be, part of their children's lives. \r\nFor many fathers the thought of not being allowed in their children's lives, (because of the biased justice system), is too much to bare, and they commit suicide.\r\nI urge the UK government to become the world leaders in changing the laws concerning family law, and fathers rights.\r\nThankyou ",
        "background": "Many men are in the same position as myself, where a relationship has ended and the mothers of our children make it as difficult as possible for us to see our children. Women petitioned for equal rights many years ago, yet in 2016 fathers don't have equal rights to be in their children's lives.",
