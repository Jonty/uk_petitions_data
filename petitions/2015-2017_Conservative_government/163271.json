        "additional_details": "Working in hospitality for the last 6 years I've seen people been put at risk on their way home from work. Due to the nature of the job, working hours and the social climate within our city centres walking home alone can be threatening and potentially dangerous . Employers should value and take a degree of responsibility for the fact that their employees are looked after at all times - this shouldn't end at the door of work.",
        "background": "Employers should be held responsible for making sure their staff get home safe when working late shifts, especially young staff working in city centres. Hospitality staff in particular work late hours in at risk areas  & shouldn't be put in positions which make them vulnerable to attack.",
