        "additional_details": "The practice of travel companies not paying for hotel accommodation/flights/transfers after they've been paid by customers should be made illegal. It's a company based within the EU but there is little or no EU protection for its citizens against this poor practice or when a travel company goes into administration. Why?",
        "background": "Lowcost Holidays has gone into administration owing thousands of pounds to over 110,000 UK customers also without a holiday many of which were booked months in advance. Lowcost Holidays used to be ATOL and ABTA protected but moved to Majorca at the end of 2013. ",
