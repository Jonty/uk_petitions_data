        "action": "Make it illegal for cyclists to use the road if there is a cycle lane available.",
        "additional_details": "Rule 61 of the Cyclists Highway Code states that Cyclists can 'Use cycle routes, advanced stop lines, cycle boxes and toucan crossings unless at the time it is unsafe to do so.' However, it also states that 'Use of these facilities is not compulsory' but can 'Make your journey safer'. \r\nIf cycle lanes can make journeys safer, Cyclists should be using them by law for the reason that cycling on a road that has been narrowed to accommodate a cycle lane is a larger hazard than using the lane itself. ",
        "background": "Due to the increase of cyclists on the road, local councils have been funding millions of pounds to develop cycle lanes which cyclists aren't using. This is potentially causing hazards on roads which are already narrow, which could be prevented by cyclists using the designated cycling facilities. ",
