        "additional_details": "Following the referendum, it is necessary to replace the void of legislation and consitutional law that will arise from leaving the EU. At present, the Tories will have full control over the formation of these laws. However, the Conservatives were not elected for these decisions in the last GE. For the sake of democracy, a new GE is essential, so that the parties can present their manifestos for independent Britain, and the public can vote for the future laws that need to be ratified. ",
        "background": "Ahead of us lies the colossal task of writing replacement legislation and reforming the British constitution, following the Brexit. There was no manifesto set by the parties for this scenario. We need a GE to vote for these changes, as the Tories were not elected to make these future decisions.",
