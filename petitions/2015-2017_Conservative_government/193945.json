        "additional_details": "Below are websites of the two anti-choice groups who hold vigils at the clinic. As you will see, their websites have worryingly misleading information - information that they use in their materials to give to patients.\r\n\r\nhttp://helpersuk.org/help-in-a-crisis-pregnancy/ \r\n\r\nhttp://www.goodcounselnet.co.uk\r\n\r\nThis petition has been started due to Sister Supporter, a group of local residents of all religions, races and genders who could no longer tolerate the situation on Mattock Lane.",
        "background": "Ealing's abortion clinic is targeted daily by anti-choice protestors holding vigils, standing at the entrance gates intimidating women & sharing medically inaccurate information. Council land is being religiously politicised, targeting vulnerable people accessing legal health care and it must stop.",
