There is no legal requirement to enact the results but having heard the voice of the British people and seen the political fallout, which will only get worse if nothing is done to stem the flow of tidal disorder, is it now the right time to call for a general election? I believe it is. All parties can then canvass the Brish electorate on the actual details of how to enact the results of the referendum on the EU. ",
