        "additional_details": "What I propose is if the seller offers a tracking service and the buyer declines that service, then the risk should pass from the seller to the buyer (PROVIDING THE SELLER CAN PROVE DISPATCH. ie Royal Mail Certificate of posting) and no claims will be accepted for non-delivery. This will make no difference for goods damaged in transit claims.",
        "background": "There is loop hole being exploited by a small number of online buyers, where if the seller cannot prove delivery (ie sent WITHOUT ONLINE TRACKING) the buyer claims non-delivery getting money back and the goods (theft). This is costing traders a small fortune in claims.",
