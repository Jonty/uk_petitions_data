        "additional_details": "Because the cost of the new carriers currently in production and plans toward new equipment, our Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has wanted to cut the 3 front line roles of 3 main Royal Marine Detachments, that's Mad knowing that we have the Fifth biggest defence budget in the world! And it's gotten so bad that he actually ADMITTED that the future of the Marines is \"uncertain\" meaning that the Marines itself might not exist! And with Gibraltar at stake we need our Finest ready for the Invaders.",
        "background": "Since 1775 the Royal Marines have been the Major Spearhead for the British Army, and have had vital roles since, including both World Wars, Kosovo, The Falklands, NI, Iraq and Afghanistan, and have played a majorly important role ever since. And the U.K has to stop over-cutting them for foreign aid.",
