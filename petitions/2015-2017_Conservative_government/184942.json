        "additional_details": "It seems unfair to expect this of parents, for whom a moderate household income does not always equate to an abundance of 'spare' money. It is important that the system helps those from low-income families (who sometimes claim that the support or bursaries they receive are, \"much more than I need,\"[1]) but there are a group of people 'caught in the middle' of this system, under more financial angst than others at University. 1: http://www.savethestudent.org/money/student-money-survey-2015.html\r\n",
        "background": "In 2015 the average student\u2019s loan was \u00a3265 too small per month with 8 in 10 worried about making ends meet [1]. For many, student finance does not cover rent and although loans are based on parental income parents are often unable to make up their child\u2019s loan to the full \u00a38,200 enjoyed by some. \r\n",
