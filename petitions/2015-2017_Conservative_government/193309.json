        "additional_details": "Bidders on HS2 could be directed to modernise current rail networks by provision of dual lines & upgrading rolling stock to bring faster, cleaner, faster journeys and to make available to all UK citizens and not just few who may use the HS2 route.\r\n\r\nFast journeys are already possible on Pendolino trains, this should cover the current network before HS2.\r\n\r\nThink of stations including Euston and Paddington with zero diesel fumes!\r\n\r\nhttps://academic.oup.com/jnci/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jnci/djs034",
        "background": "Electrification of all UK rail infrastructure would allow diesel trains to be phased out. \r\nElectrification will reduce emissions in UK cities; huge diesel's run whilst sat in stations & emit whilst travelling. \r\ndiesel stock doesn't have effective  emission control and emits NOx and particles. \r\n",
