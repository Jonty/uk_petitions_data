        "additional_details": "We petition to:\r\n\r\nClose all remaining legal loopholes that facilitate the laundering of illegal ivory as \u2018antique\u2019 (pre-1947) and pre-Convention (pre-1975) by introducing a total ban on domestic ivory trade.\r\n\r\nProvide additional resources and funding to bring enhanced security to human communities that live alongside wild elephants. \r\n\r\nIncrease efforts to disrupt the illegal ivory supply routes used by criminal syndicates. \r\n\r\nSupport demand reduction strategies in destination countries.",
        "background": "Africa is currently losing c. 30,000 elephants per year to poachers. The illegal ivory trade is out of control, with legal domestic ivory markets providing opportunities for illegal ivory to be laundered. Current legislation aimed at controlling the UK\u2019s domestic ivory market is not fit for purpose.",
