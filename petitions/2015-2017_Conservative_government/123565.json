        "additional_details": "With large numbers of staff leaving the profession & many children suffering stress & depression, let's take a more evidence based approach to education.  In a culture which pushes mothers to return to work, home schooling isn't an option many can afford.  Let's give children a better start in life. Let them play & be kids not test them & force them to act as walking calculators & dictionaries. Let schooling from ages 4-7 be ALL about learning through play, not the 3 r's. They are our future. ",
        "background": "Children in the UK are some of the youngest to enter formal education & some of the most tested in Europe with no associated benefits. Other countries in Europe have better long term academic outcomes starting formal education at 7.\r\nA radical overhaul of education is needed to protect our children.",
