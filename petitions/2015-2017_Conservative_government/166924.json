        "additional_details": "If people are suffering with accident/illness it is fairly common that may have  to reduce their hours to help them through. Therefore, it would be better to no longer use the time limit of twelve months to check NI Contributions when calculating if they qualify for Employment Support Allowance. It think its fair to say it would be better to look at what has been paid for all the years they have worked. This ruling needs to be changed to support workers who are going through difficult times.",
        "background": "After being signed off work due to Mental Health problems, I was extremely disappointed to find out that after DWP checked my last twelve months National Insurance contributions I didn't qualify for Employment Support Allowance. In the past 18 months I have reduced my hours due to health problems. ",
