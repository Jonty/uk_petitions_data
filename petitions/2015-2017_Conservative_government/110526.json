Key absentees often fail to pass on their findings and recommendations too.\r\n\r\nChildren's Services and other professionals can improve their communication if they have a secure online portal to forward reports and recommendations (as is available in Leicester).  Being electronic, it is instant; saving time and money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
