        "action": "Upgrade all of the M27 to 4 lanes before further major housing developments.",
        "additional_details": "The current real time situation is twice daily seizures for most of the M27 corridor rendering it unusable as a major transport link. Local councils are allowing developers to flood the area with housing without regard for transport infrastructure. The government needs to impose controls until an in integrated strategy is implemented. This demonstrates serious flaws in the planning process. They claim to promote alternatives to the car but have no realistic solutions how this will be achieved",
        "background": "The M27 apart from a small section at portsmouth has not been upgraded since its completion over 40 years ago during which housing stock has increased at least 4 fold. Further major developments are planned which will render it unusable as a motorway. Pollution effects from this will also impact.",
