        "additional_details": "If a politician lies to the electorate, or even to his colleagues, there is no legal course of action to take, outside of a general election. In 2007, an MP, Adam Price, drafted The Misrepresentation of the People Act: a bill that would force politicians to tell the truth - or face criminal prosecution. It was voted on and a shocking 37 out of 646 MPs voted in favour.\r\nDuring the Brexit Campaign, both sides inflated statistics and lied, secure knowing they would not have to act on their promises.",
        "background": "Introduce legislation to hold politicians accountable for the truth of their statements. This would apply when they are in the House, campaigning or addressing the public, and if they deliberately lie or misrepresent facts they should face legal consequences.",
