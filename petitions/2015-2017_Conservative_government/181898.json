Companies that operate using this logo should be able to demonstrate the high standards and accountability associated with it. Some companies fail to do this and even pull out of these contracts, due to either lack of profit or proven negligence. We the public should be able to clearly see who is actually providing healthcare services, so that we can hold failing private providers to account where necessary.",

They are allowed to do this whilst using the NHS logo. ",
