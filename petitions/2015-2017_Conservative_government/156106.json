        "additional_details": "EU leaders will not begin to take UK out of EU until article 50 is issued by our new PM, soonest in October. \r\n \r\nThere is still an opportunity now to verify these questionable claims and assess changes caused by the Leave vote.\r\n \r\nIf the claims prove to be misleading, affecting votes on a marginal outcome result, and damage by Leave vote proves to be worse than generally expected, this significant circumstantial change for the UK calls for a 2nd EU referendum before issuing of article 50.",
        "background": "Some keys campaigners may have made misleading claims and seem to be backtracking now. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36641390\r\n \r\nVoters may have been misled by these claims or did not appreciate the extent of damage by Leave vote as they were considered scaremongering.\r\n",
