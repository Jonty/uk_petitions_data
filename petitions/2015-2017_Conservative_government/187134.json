        "action": "Have a referendum for the legalisation of cannabis in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "With no recorded deaths in the history of the drug and many medical uses such as cancer treatment, muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis, seizure disorders and Crohn's disease, Cannabis is a clear answer to treat many who suffer form these illnesses. As well as this it would see an economic boost with serveral new jobs for the industry and a potential near \u00a31 billion increase in tax revenue with the savings of policing too. The overall impact on the economy would be more than beneficial.",
        "background": "This is a highly controversial issue yet to be settled. There is a clear misrepresentation of many throughout the UK of many whom believe the drug should be legal. As someone who has seen clear benefits of the drug medically it is bizarre to have it illegal for the sake of many nation wide.",
