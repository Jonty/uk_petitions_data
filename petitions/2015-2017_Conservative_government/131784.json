        "additional_details": "Less than a year on,i'm in college and aim to be back in full time education in September. I also have a part time job and I'm now providing for myself at 16 years of age. I am amazed at how the staff always responded calmly to fellow patients regardless of how much we might have tested their patience. I am inspired by their ability to stay calm in stressful situations. I appreciate the long and hard hours they put in to ensure other people's well being for a ridiculous excuse of a salary.",

My admission went on to last eight months and I have made tremendous progress in ways that I couldn't have foreseen in those first few days and months but I couldn't have done it without the incredible support network off staff!\r\n",
