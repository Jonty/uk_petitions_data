        "additional_details": "HS2 is an ill-conceived and fundamentally flawed design for a high speed rail line linking London, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. Originally costed at \u00a330 billion, it is now estimated to cost \u00a356 billion or more. The project is highly controversial because of HS2 Ltd\u2019s failure to evaluate cheaper & better alternatives, its exorbitant cost, insufficient new capacity, poor connectivity, demolition of 500+ homes, serious damage to the Chilterns AONB & Ancient Woodlands and failure to reduce CO2\r\n",
        "background": "HS2 cannot meet its stated objective of delivering \u201c..hugely enhanced capacity and connectivity between our major conurbations\u201d. \r\n\r\nWe call on HM Government to commission an independent technical review of every aspect of the HS2 scheme to determine how and why this failure has happened.",
