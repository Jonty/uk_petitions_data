        "action": "Make it a illegal to breed dogs without a licence.",
        "additional_details": "Many people are choosing to buy a dog from a breeder or pet store, instead of adopting a dog that needs a home. This is causing a surplus of dogs, many who are given up after a short while due to the amount of care a dog needs. Many dogs will die in shelters or be put to sleep before a home is found. If breeding was regulated, this would rapidly decrease the amount of homeless dogs, and the cost of a license could go towards help for dogs that need it, such as healthcare or shelters. ",
        "background": "Currently, over 110,000 dogs remain homeless in the UK. This is due to overbreeding and people breeding dogs for  profit. Shelters are overcrowding and many dogs will be put to sleep due to insufficient space. Licences would decrease the amount of dogs being bred, and the amount of homeless dogs. ",
