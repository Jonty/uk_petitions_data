        "additional_details": "Any referendum vote is only advisory to Parliament.\r\n72.2% voting turnout, 51.9% who opted for leave, they only represent 37.5% of the voting population.\r\nLeave will significantly affect the young, 75% of 18-24 year olds voted remain.\r\nLeave are going back on significant 'promises' (e.g. monies to NHS).\r\nSignificant negative response by the markets and the rest of Europe. \r\nUK exit agreement with Europe will not be good since it would be used as a deterrent to others thinking of leaving the EU.",
        "background": "Exiting the EU is such a highly significant event for the UK & the rest of Europe. The 37% of the eligible voting population opting for leave is not a mandate for HM Government to act. All Members of Parliament should vote to determine the future direction of the UK in the EU\r\n ",
