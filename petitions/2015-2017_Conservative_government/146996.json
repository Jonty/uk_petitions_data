We further believe that it is incumbent on the parliament whose function it is to work for and consolidate the integrity of the union, to override any decision that could damage Great Britain as a whole, or in part. Since the recent referendum result on membership of the EU is highly likely to do this (by leading to a referendum that could split Scotland from the Union) we the undersigned believe that parliament should not ask for implementation of the article 50. And should seek to block by any means necessary an attempt to divorce us from the European Union. \r\n",
