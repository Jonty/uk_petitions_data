        "additional_details": "As you are probably aware, gluten free products are very expensive in supermarkets or online. For a loaf of bread you can be looking at \u00a32.99 in supermarkets yet someone without coeliac disease can go with a normal loaf of bread for as little as 50 pence. This is the case for many alternative alternatives for coeliac disease sufferers, from biscuits, to bread, to  tortilla wraps, cereal, the list goes on. Coeliac disease is a autoimmune disease that affects our daily lives.",
        "background": "As the NHS prescription service for gluten free foods is affecting so many areas across the UK, we would like you to review and lower the pricing of all gluten free products across the UK to help us afford to eat and not feel penalised on prices for products for a disease they have live with daily.",
