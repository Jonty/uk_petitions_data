Our government must respect public opinion and up-to-date scientific evidence on matters that warrant enough attention to gather over a hundred thousand supporters, and encourage debate on these matters rather than dismissing them.",
        "background": "A number of petitions on the Government's petition website that have reached over 100,000 signatures have been dismissed with nothing but a few paragraphs of explanation without explicitly cited evidence. The public feels that this approach undermines the meaning of democracy.",
