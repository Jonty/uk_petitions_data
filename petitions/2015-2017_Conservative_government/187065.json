        "action": "Create legislation for public toilets to be available at all public open spaces",
        "additional_details": "A local recreation ground in Poole has 4, 11 a side football pitches. Just players alone would come close to 100 people which is not taking into account spectators. Because public toilets are not a legal requirement our local council has decided to save money by closing the public toilets. There are no other facilities available anywhere close. This is now becoming common throughout the country and it should be a legal requirement to ensure people can use and enjoy open spaces. ",
        "background": "Due to government cuts to local authorities, Councils are currently closing down many essential public toilets, even at recreation grounds and parks. Areas that are open to the public for health & well being should have public toilet facilities provided and this needs to be law. ",
