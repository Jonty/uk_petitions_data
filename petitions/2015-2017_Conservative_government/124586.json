        "additional_details": "His unpatriotism has no place in the UK. He loathes democracy if he supports the EU with this intensity as to suggest that the UK Parliament should simply be a \"council chamber\" in Brussels. Shame on you, Mr Clarke",
        "background": "For his whole career, Kenneth Clarke MP has been ridiculing this country and the people in it. He is quoted as saying \"I look forward to the day where the Westminister parliament is simply a council chamber in Europe\" I would like to propose to deport him just there- to his spiritual home.",
