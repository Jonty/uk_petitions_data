        "additional_details": "The medicinal benefits of cannabis must be recognised under UK law (as it now is in a number of countries worldwide) and access to medicinal cannabis must be granted to citizens of the UK. The current government holds a monopoly over this market and withholds access to patients telling them according to a 9 year old report  that \"cannabis is bad for them\" while allowing medicinal cannabis production in the UK for yet another pharmaceutical giants profit. ",
        "background": "The current government responded to an online petition saying that cannabis has no medicinal value, yet allows the production of 200 tonnes of medicinal cannabis in the UK by GW Pharma. Either allow open access to medicinal cannabis or cease all production of cannabis in the UK.",
