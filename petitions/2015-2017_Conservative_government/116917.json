        "additional_details": "We would ask the Government to change its proposals for introducing 30 hours of free childcare and revert back to a universal offer of 15 hours for every 3 \u2013 4 year old across the country, and the extra 15 hours to be means tested and offered to low-income families as many nurseries will struggle to implement its policy without proper funding in place.",
        "background": "The pre-election pledge to provide 30 hours \u201cfree\u201d childcare is unsustainable unless nurseries are properly funded to provide the high quality childcare the government wants.  There is a huge gap between its financial proposals and the real cost to the sector.    ",
