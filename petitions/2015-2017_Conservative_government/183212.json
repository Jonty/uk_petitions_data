This is compared to the \u00a35.60 minimum wage for 18-20 year olds. Many young people are finding that most expenses they receive from jobs is being spent on travel and not obtaining any money to help them become independent. \r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jun/22/rail-fare-doubles-for-my-16-year-old-son shows that this is an issue affecting young people across the whole country and not in one area.

As two 17 year olds ourselves we believe that the fact that we are required to pay adult travel fares when we are not legally classified as adults ourselves is unfair and we are trying to make a change.",
