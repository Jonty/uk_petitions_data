We would like to see tank raised seahorses classed as wild caught and be legally described as such, this would help to differentiate from true captive breds.  ",
        "background": "The aim is simple,to supply the hobby industry with guaranteed captive bred fish not taken from the wild.We believe doing this can help to lessen the stress on wild populations and give them a helping hand to re-establish themselves. ",
