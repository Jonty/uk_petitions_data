        "action": "The EU flag be flown from parliament on alternate days with the Union Flag.",
        "additional_details": "Flags are matters of high symbolic importance. In most EU member states, the EU flag is routinely flown alongside the national flag. This practice should have been instituted in the UK long ago. \r\nThe most prominent flagstaff in the land is that on Parliament itself. For practical reasons it may not be possible to hoist two, thus the proposal is for flying the UK and EU flags on alternate days.",
        "background": "This petition grows out of national frustration with the referendum, and at how various governments, over the decades, have failed to promote the benefits of the EU to the public at large.",
