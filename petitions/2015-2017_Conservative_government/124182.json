        "additional_details": "A few years ago Airlines used common sense and so included a Case per Ticket, now they rip their passengers off through the backdoor with Add ons, some charge around \u00a330 to \u00a345 per small case per person which adds a large amount to a family Holiday.\r\n\r\nAirlines 'Use' this practice a great deal by seat charges, meals, legroom.\r\n\r\nYes it goes on weight of the Plane, but when you consider that most people are mainly slim with a few large they must know the weight on a full plane of just passengers.",
        "background": "As most people take Cases with them for Holidays with Children it is common sense that they need Clothes to take with them, Airlines should now this instead of a backdoor money making scheme as now, they should price Tickets with the above included as it used to be.\r\nStop ripping the Holiday maker.",
