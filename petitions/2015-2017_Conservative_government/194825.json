        "additional_details": "Every month foreign rescues are bringing around 500 dogs/cats into the UK to be re-homed. They are driven from all across Europe in 3.5 t vans nonstop into the UK. To often strange dogs and cats are forced to share cages for profit reasons. Such overcrowding ignores the existing law (EC 01/2005), increasing the risk of spreading disease, fighting about over food, sitting in their or their cage mates excrement and their overall welfare. True pets have this protection - re-homed animals not. ",
        "background": "As pet type animals are the most imported species into the UK their protection during transport should be enforced. \r\nRegarding rescue dogs being imported I call for the 1-human-to-5-pet type animal rule to be enforced like true pets (overcrowding) , driving hour rules etc.",
