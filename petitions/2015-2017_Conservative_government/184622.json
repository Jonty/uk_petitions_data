Trans-Atlantic slavery created the modern economic world as we know and understand it.\r\nYet how are race relations expected to improve?... if our collective history....or 'race' as a topic...or even a TV drama are pushed to the side-lines? They won\u2019t; especially if people remain uninformed and unaware.\r\n\r\nIt's not 1619... It\u2019s 2017.\r\n\r\nAnd we'd all benefit from finding new ways to relate.\r\n\r\nChange comes through representation, awareness and education... the BBC could and can do 'more' with licence payers money. ",
        "background": "Why was episode 1 of Roots aired on BBC4?? Nobody watches BBC4. I believe the rest of the 'Roots' episodes should be aired on BBC ONE. What's my licence fee for? Eastenders, Football and The News?? You have to really question why the BBC didn't see Roots fit for BBC One .all-star cast & big budget. ",
