        "additional_details": "The law currently states that all foods sold in the UK must clearly state any of the most common 14 allergens present in the food or the staff selling/providing the food must have the allergy information to hand when asked for it by the consumer. Staff often won't have this information or get it wrong when asked, which is why this needs to be clearly shown so the consumer can make an informed decision for themselves, not rely on information from someone who is untrained.",
        "background": "Many people in the UK suffer from food allergies, not just intolerances. These can vary from mild to severe, including causing anaphylactic shock. Staff in cafes and stores will not always know the allergen information when asked and can get this wrong, causing a potentially dangerous situation.",
