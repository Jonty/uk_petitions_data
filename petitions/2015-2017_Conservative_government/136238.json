Since BREXIT would have serious consequences for many of us, this represents a breach of our human and democratic rights. Our views should also be heard.\r\n\r\nMany who COULD vote were ill-informed about the consequences of BREXIT - especially regarding the likelihood of a break with Scotland and the problems it would cause in Ireland. Everyone should have the opportunity to reconsider their vote in the light of these issues and in the light of world reaction to the result of the vote on 23 June.\r\n\r\n",
