        "additional_details": "The asylum system is open to abuse and must be tightened up. For example, a Sudanese man who caused immense disruption by walking through the Channel Tunnel has been granted asylum in the UK. That is a complete disgrace, it rewards criminality and it sends completely the wrong message to those who eschew sanctuary in the first safe country, because they view the UK as a soft touch. The UK Government must legislate to bar asylum to all those who use illegal means to gain entry to our country.",
        "background": "The asylum system was created for the best of all possible reasons in reaction to the horrors of WWII. However, it is now clear that the asylum system is badly broken, is open to abuse and is being exploited by economic migrants. The asylum system requires deep reform or else it should be scrapped.",
