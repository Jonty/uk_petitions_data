        "additional_details": "As we now buy tax online it would be easy to ensure that it is valid for the full year. When requesting a refund it should be valid for the exact number of days and months that it is still valid for. \r\nOur insurance is issued from the day required regardless of what date in the month it is issued so why not car tax?\r\n12 months is 12 months NOT 11 months and 14 days.",
        "background": "When we buy a car, before we can legally drive it on the road, we have to buy car tax. That car tax is issued from the first day of the month regardless of when in the month it is purchased. The government are guilty of deception. If I buy something which is valid for 12 months I expect it to be so",
