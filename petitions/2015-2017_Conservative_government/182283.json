        "additional_details": "It is impossible for the UK to advocate for an end to child marriage when we still allow child Marriage in the UK. \r\n\r\nThe minimum age of marriage is 18 and young people aged 16 and 17 can be married with parental permission. However the UN define Child marriage as a formal marriage or informal union before age 18. \r\n\r\nThe UK is in breach of international laws prohibiting child marriage, making it more difficult for campaigners to prohibit child marriage, both in the UK and internationally. \r\n\r\nRemove the caveat that 16 and 17 year old young people can marry with parental consent from British law.
