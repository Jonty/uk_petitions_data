However, I do not and cannot believe that this prevention of MSM from giving blood is truly about AIDS/HIV, because they test the blood for disease. It's about men having sex with men. \r\n",
        "background": "The NHS tells me that I cannot donate blood 12 months after sex with another male (regardless of whether or not protection is used).\r\nSurely the NHS test all the blood that they receive for AIDS/HIV and surely they don't re-use needles and other equipment.",
