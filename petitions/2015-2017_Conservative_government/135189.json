        "additional_details": "We need to have a counter petition showing that the results of the referendum should be adhered to, without further posturing.\r\n\r\nTo make it clear, leave won the referendum. There should be no further debate as we have been debating this since February. That is long enough. We need to move forward to settle the markets. We do not need further instability being caused by this mischief making by sore losers.",
        "background": "Having lost the referendum, the remain side now wish to invoke the usual EU posture of having further referendums until they get the result that they want. They already have well over 100,000 votes and the government have reacted speedily to say it will be debated next week. ",
