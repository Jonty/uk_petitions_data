        "action": "Introduce National Fasting Day to donate food costs saved to fight hunger",
        "additional_details": "If the government can introduce National Fasting Day as a recognized day of voluntary fasting it will hopefully gain momentum where millions of healthy adults can sacrifice the cost of a main meal and thereby potentially raise in the region of 50 million pounds for example in a single day through their own small sacrifice. This could even spread to become a worlwide movement.",
        "background": "Millions of people worldwide face hunger and possibly death. Introduce a National Fasting Day for Great Britain. On this day healthy adults voluntarily fast. Through fasting they will understand hunger for one day and hopefully donate the cost of a day's food to charities fighting world hunger",
