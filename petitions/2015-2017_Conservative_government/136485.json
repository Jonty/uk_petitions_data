There are an estimated 1.2 million UK citizens living in the EU, many have been deprived of the right to vote in the \"Brexit\" referendum. The outcome of the 23/06/16 referendum has a direct impact on these expats and so it is fair that they too have a voice in determining Britain's relationship with Europe.",
