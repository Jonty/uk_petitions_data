        "additional_details": "We call upon the Speaker of the House to suppress the childish behaviour of MPs; for MPs to be aware that they are models for the whole country; for sanctions to be able to be imposed (ie a yellow/red card system) to ensure that debate is polite, ordered and does not deteriorate into antisocial behaviour and that MPs can be removed if offenders. This https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZPTZuwwHng is unacceptable and prevents proper debate. It does nothing to ensure the dignity of the House.",
        "background": "The behaviour of Parliament is detrimental to our Society: the cheering, braying and interruptions during debates & especially during Prime Minister's Question Time is shameful & does not permit serious debate. If this behaviour occured in a School setting there would be behaviour sanctions.",
