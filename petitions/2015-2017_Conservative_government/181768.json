        "additional_details": "I was born in N.Ireland and as I grew up I was told I was N.Irish, Irish, British and European. I had a choice on who I affiliated myself with and I had a choice to be a part of something smaller, or something bigger; I chose the latter.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore, with precedent and just under half the country having voted to remain, that the government should not ignore what is a large minority and give everyone the rights that others in these islands already have.\r\n\r\nChoice on citizenship! \r\n",
        "background": "Given that there is precedent for dual nationality in N.Ireland I feel it is only fair, and morally right, that as just under half of the country didn't want to leave the EU that those who wish to stay should have the option to keep European citizenship when Brexit negotiations begin.
