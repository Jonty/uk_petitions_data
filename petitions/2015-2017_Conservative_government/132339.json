        "action": "Call for a referendum to make the medical and recreational use of cannabis legal",
        "additional_details": "Even the scientific evidence on this drug has been very controversial, some argue that its legalisation would be a net improvement, others argue it would not. This is not an issue for a small group of people in parliament to decide on. There have been countries where this drug has been legalised and others where it has not; these countries give us insight as to what legalisation of this drug leads to. We, the people of the UK, should have our say as to what sort of country we wish to live in.",
        "background": "We believe that it should be up to the people to weigh out the sociological, psychological and economic benefits and drawbacks of this drug. Since this country is a democracy our voices should finally be heard and as such we should have a referendum as to whether cannabis should be legalised.",
