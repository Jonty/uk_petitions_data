        "additional_details": "People have incorporated EU citizenship into their lives. A right they were born with or entered work with. Whether it is a parent encouraging a child to speak an EU language, a student with the ambition to study through ERASMUS, an adult making career choices in our globalised world or a retiree fulfilling their dreams they have worked so hard to make happen.\r\n\r\nPoliticians need to respect people\u00b4s plans, not just their own.  Stripping or bargaining with people\u00b4s EU citizenship is wrong.",
        "background": "People, young and old, live life with a plan. That life plan is made with the rules given to them and one of those is EU citizenship. It is immoral & unforgivable to take this away, almost without warning, when a person has done nothing wrong but have ambition. Plans are for life, not just 2 years. ",
