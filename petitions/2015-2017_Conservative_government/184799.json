        "additional_details": "If your partner is earning your not intitled to sick pay or any sort of help. I think it's wrong, i have zero income on my behalf and we now have overdrafts to pay for, owing people money because we didnt have enough money for electric or gas, going cold because the gas went and its winter. You'd only get a bit of support if you have children but how do people expect others to get better when we live on nothing and can't afford percriptions to get any better! Sign the petition and help the sick!",
        "background": "Most people that have been signed off by the doctor have no choice but to go on the sick, it even harder when you live with your partner and that source of income isn't there anymore and you have to relie on one income. Why should we go in to debt because weve become sick?",
