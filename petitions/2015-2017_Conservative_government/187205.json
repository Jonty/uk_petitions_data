        "additional_details": "I suffered an early miscarriage before the stage of a first scan. The only thing we have from our baby is pictures of positive tests. It would have brought us so much comfort just to have something to prove that our baby existed.\r\n\r\nSome mothers have to give birth to their perfectly formed child. There is then no paper proof of their baby existing. \r\nNo matter what stage of pregnancy, these babies are loved and a loss is a massively traumatic experience. Something so easy could help ease this pain.",
        "background": "The parents of every confirmed miscarriage, before the viability age of 24 weeks, should have the option to a certificate of death.\r\n\r\nI honestly believe this small change could massively help with the grieving process of many mother and fathers that sadly lose their babies so early.
