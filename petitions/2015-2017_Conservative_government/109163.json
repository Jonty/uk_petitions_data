        "additional_details": "At its peak the UK ivory trade was killing over 44,000 elephants a year to meet its own demands. The UK was also the global trading centre for ivory.\r\n\r\nThe UK should acknowledge its role in the slaughter of 20 million elephants over the last 200 years and introduce an immediate ban on the domestic trade of all ivory from elephants.\r\nThis is a pledge made by in current government in their manifesto and they should work promptly to introduce the ban.",
        "background": "With 30,000 elephants a year being poached for the ivory trade it is important for the UK to make a clear statement on protecting elephants. \r\nThe UK has a historical association with ivory and during the 1800's was the worlds biggest killer of elephants for ivory.\r\n",
