        "action": "Set up a National Commission for the Funding of Police in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Some forces are chronically underfunded and this impacts on the quality of policing which the public are entitled to expect.\r\n\r\nThat is why I am today calling for a National Commission on Funding of the Police, teamed by experts, who will consider the proper funding for police forces around the country, the effect of lack of adequate police funding and the education of the public on what the chosen level of police funding means for their safety.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to support this call. ",
        "background": "It is the basic right of every citizen in the United Kingdom to be safe from harm in their homes and in the street.  Effective policing is integral to this and to be effective, the police need to be properly resourced.  But, the funding of the forces vary and the funding rules are complex.  \r\n\r\n",
