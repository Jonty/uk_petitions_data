        "action": "Dont ban Donald Trump from the UK for expressing his views on muslim migrants.",
        "additional_details": "Im not saying all Muslims are terrorists but when the US is on high alert of another major terrorist attack then surely stopping Muslims from entering period or without being properly screened is the way to go. The US and the UK are simply too Politically Correct on issues like this and i think Donald Trump is finally adopting an approach that the people of the US are crying out for and the people of the UK are yearning for. GET SIGNING PEOPLE AND STAND UP TO POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.",
        "background": "Donald Trump has expressed his views on Muslim migrants entering the US so why should it bother us? He has a right to excercise the freedom of speech act and to be honest i think he has a point, why let others in when the US are struggling to keep tabs on the 3.5 million muslims they already have.",
