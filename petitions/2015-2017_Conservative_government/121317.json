        "action": "Give suspects of sex crimes anonymity until conviction",
        "additional_details": "If a particular offender is suspected to be a serial rapist, a Judge could waiver his anonymity to allow more victims to come forward. However in many cases the openness of the information allows innocent people to have their names tarnished, their careers ended and to experience psychological trauma. \r\n\r\nVictims are given anonymity due to the particular stigma associated with sex crimes; this stigma also applies to the suspect.",
        "background": "Innocent men can have their lives and reputations completely destroyed by getting falsely accused of sex crimes, as the experiences of Mark Pearson, Lord Bramall and Louis Richardson have recently shown. Suspects should be given the same right to anonymity that their accusers enjoy.",
