        "additional_details": "quoted from Excite Travel.\r\nThe explosions caused by fireworks have been known to give some domestic pets heart problems, nausea, tremors, debilitating fears and light-headedness. We all know that animals have far more sensitive hearing so you won't be surprised to read that firework displays can leave pets with \u201cacoustic stress\u201d. \r\nPeople of the town of Collecchio in the province of Parma in Italy are doing something about it. The local government has introduced new legislation forcing citizens to use silent fireworks as a way of respecting the animals and reducing the stress caused them. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Guy Fawkes can last 3 - 5 consecutive nights, fireworks are also used for weddings and celebrations. Farmers & householders usually have little or no warning to protect livestock/ pets from the trauma caused,  using only SILENT fireworks would benefit EVERYONE in towns, cities, countryside.\r\n",
