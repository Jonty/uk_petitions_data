        "additional_details": "The same Israeli then taunted the child and repeatedly asked the soldiers to shoot him again. The ambulance crews, that were present on scene, refused to take Ahmed to hospital. Since when the Israelis care about our lives? The child tried to sit; his fear was blatant; no one tried to calm him down. Hardly did he manage to sit before an Israel policeman came and kicked him. He is now held in an Israeli prison for life. FREE AHMAD...he has just had all his life taken away from him :(",

An Israeli started filming in the background, shouting at Ahmad in Arabic, \u201cdie, son of whore\u2026 die son of 66 whores.\u201d",
