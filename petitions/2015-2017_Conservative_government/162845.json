        "additional_details": "The property let to the family I visited was filthy, I have photos to prove this, there was no wallpaper on the hall and stairs leading up to the flat. Instead it had graffiti on the walls, plaster that looked liked it had been put on with someones fingers, holes in the walls, mould on the floors and walls, dirt inside kitchen cupboards. Surely properties should be in a better state than this? More money needs to be given for local authorities to give homes to people in a fit state.",
        "background": "More and more people are living in poor quality social housing. I visited a family recently who were given a 3 bedroom flat to live in temporarily until a permanent home was found for them. I have photos of the appalling condition of this property in Rochdale. This is happening across the UK.",
