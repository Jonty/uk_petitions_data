        "action": "Delay use of article 50 of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty until mandated by election.",
        "additional_details": "The referendum on membership of the EU is advisory and not necessarily binding though undoubtedly democratically significant. Many promises given prior to the vote have begun to unravel providing more clarity on the actual consequences of this decision. Given the closeness of the vote it is consevable that this referendum may not actually reflect current opinion. The suggestion is to confirm this decision via mandate provided in a new general election before moving beyond the point of no return.",
        "background": "As the result was very close and now there are clear and significant  consequences, a period of reflection before committing is sensible. \r\n\r\nAs such delay activation of article 50 of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty until the recent advisory referendum has been given a clear mandate by general election.
