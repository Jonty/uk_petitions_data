        "additional_details": "My mother recently suffered a stroke and is now wheelchair bound. As a strong independent woman, she has lost alot yet loves to enjoy a nice meal or coffee on a day out. However many times we will enter a restaurant or cafe to find that their isn't a spot or enough space. This means a simple journey to a cafe can lead to looking through 3 or 4 different ones. \r\n\r\nIn 2017, this should not be an issue, parking is supplied for the less abled, this should be a legal requirement.",
        "background": "It should be a legal requirement for large chain restaurants and cafes to have a blue badge table, where wheelchair bound citizens feel as though they can be comfortable and not in the way.",
