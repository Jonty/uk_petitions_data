        "additional_details": "The 10% off fuel is the suggested incentive for a massive increase in car sharing and in doing so, surprisingly the government can save money year on year not by building more or bigger roads [1]. Car share apps provide high levels of safety for driver and passenger and an alternate lift home if the driver or passenger has to leave work early or later at short notice [2].\r\n [1] A study from INRIX   https://tinyurl.com/hbhed4b\r\n [2] Detailed article on smart mobility  https://tinyurl.com/kb54z8d",

This petition is to ask the government to take a fresh look at solutions that are available today that can dramatically reduce congestion such as high tech car sharing. Using roads sensibly will save everyone money.  ",
