        "additional_details": "About 800,000 new voters will be eligible on June 8th 2017 and about 500,000 voters have left the register since June 23rd 2016.\r\n\r\nThis election has been called because of issues around Brexit, but a General Election has a much wider impact and voters have to weigh up who will best represent them across a range of issues over the next five years. \r\n\r\nTo serve the national interest it is important to separate Brexit from the balance of policy proposals.",
        "background": "The EU referendum was based on uncertainties and misinformation which may have affected the way people voted/abstained. The narrow win is not a clear mandate. The country now has greater clarity on the consequences. A significant number of new voters in this election should have their voice heard.",
