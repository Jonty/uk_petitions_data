        "additional_details": "I'm 16 years old and personally I want a tattoo my mum found no reason as to why I shouldn't have one as it's not something inappropriate that I will want to have removed or covered up and i believe that a parents opinion matters as if I was to get a tattoo without my parents consent I'm more likely to get an unsuitable, unacceptable or regrettable tattoo I understand some parents don't want their child being tattooed thats why I think it is fair to have parental consent beforehand",
        "background": "I believe that as long as there is a parent present or on the phone when the child wants the tattoo then that is acceptable because I'm sure a parent wouldn't let their 16 year old get something tattooed that they will obviously regret in the future and the parent will want to know what it is before",
