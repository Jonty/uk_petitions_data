When incidents block the M1, M40 or A43 our town is gridlocked.\r\n\r\nResidents, visitors & workers suffer the air pollution, noise & heavy traffic.\r\n\r\nWe will have to wait until 1016 new dwellings are occupied before enjoying a functioning residential single-carriage \u2018relief road\u2019.\r\n\r\nThis is no relief for Towcester. Current & future residents, visitors & businesses deserve better.\r\n\r\nWe need a safe, dual-carriageway bypass with sound & pollution buffering. ",
        "background": "With current levels of traffic our market town is in desperate need of a bypass.\r\n\r\nQuality of life measures, such as health, safety, sleep & stress are negatively affected by traffic volumes.\r\n\r\nWe are set to see a massive increase in traffic volume as TOWCESTER FACES MORE THAN 2500 NEW DWELLINGS.",
