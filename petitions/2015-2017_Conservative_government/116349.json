        "additional_details": "The BTEC qualification is very different and means that a lot of students, who want to do traditional A-Levels and GCSE's in this subject will not be able to.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why these subjects can not be reformed in line with other subjects. However the government has completely discontinued this subject at GCSE and A-Level, with only a similar BTEC on offer.\r\n\r\nStudents need to be offered a range of different type of qualification styles, a BTEC only route for an entire subject area is poor.",
        "background": "The Health and Social Care A-Level is being discontinued from Sept 2016, with the GCSE to follow suit in Sept 2017.\r\n\r\nThis decision will drastically narrow the curriculum options for ages 14-18. A BTEC route is offered, but is very different and students will be very restricted in their choices.",
