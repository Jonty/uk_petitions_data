        "additional_details": "The explosions caused by fireworks have been known to give some domestic pets and people heart problems, nausea, tremors, debilitating fears and light-headedness. \r\nWe all know that animals have far more sensitive hearing so you won't be surprised to read that firework displays can leave pets with \u201cacoustic stress\u201d\r\nFocus SHOULD be more on visual colours & effects instead of noise! Many people  do not want bangs, screeches or whistles but still want to enjoy the fun that only fireworks can bring.",
        "background": "Any large celebration that involves fireworks is fun, but while we enjoy the sounds and sights of colourful explosions overhead, our animals, old people and people of a noise sensitive disposition feel very differently.",
