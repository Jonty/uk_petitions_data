        "additional_details": "Since the referendum, in which a small percentage and not an overwhelming proportion of the electorate in the UK voted to leave, we have since learned that certain representations against the EU membership were, in fact, untrue. \r\n As a parent, it is my responsibility to state when there are dangers of certain ill-considered actions to my children. I ask the parents of the UK to demand that the UK government too, considers making the right decision and not leave the European Union. ",

I am an International Teacher and similar to several million expats that work within the European Union, our livelihood and way of life is threatened by the decision to leave, and as we now know based on misinformation.",
