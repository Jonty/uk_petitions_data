        "additional_details": "On the established basis that not voting means by default keeping the status quo, the right of British subjects to remain European Union citizens has been taken away from us by just over a third of the electorate. Not of the UK population, but of those eligible to vote.\r\n\r\nA change as fundamental as the destruction of our constitutional identity should be made only on the basis of a clear majority (50%+) of the entire electorate. Not by a miserable minority of thirty-odd percent. \r\n\r\nWe require Parliament to respect the will of the electorate of the United Kingdom and declare INVALID the conclusion that the referendum has provided a mandate to leave the European Union. ",
        "background": "51.9% of those voting in the referendum to determine the UK's membership of the European Union supported Brexit. But only 72% of the electorate actually voted. So 51.9% of 72% = 37.4%. Only THIRTY SEVEN POINT FOUR PER CENT of those eligible to vote made a positive choice to vote to leave the EU.\r\n\r\n",
