        "action": "Not to invoke EU Article 50 until the UK people have approved exit negotiations.",
        "additional_details": "The British people have narrowly voted to leave the European Union. However, until exit negotiations with the EU have concluded it is impossible to know what life outside the Union would be like. We have only the vague promises of politicians.\r\n\r\nThe British electorate were consulted on some fairly unimportant changes negotiated by David Cameron. We must surely now be consulted on the far more critical terms of exit from the EU.",
        "background": "The UK has voted to leave the European Union but has not yet negotiated its exit terms with the EU.\r\n\r\nHM Government should not invoke the irreversible Article 50 (Withdrawal from the European Union) until the UK people have approved, in a referendum, the outcome of crucial exit negotiations.",
