        "additional_details": "Not just Brexit but also the proposals to introduce grammar schools and change the education system so it is clearly more difficult for students sitting GCSE's suggest that 16 and 17 year olds are becoming much more frustrated with their voices being muted in Parliament. Allow us to vote in this snap election, So we can have our say in how our young lives are determined.",
        "background": "16 and 17 year olds are still being denied representation the UK, even in the 21st Century and the growing responsibilities and pressures put among the youth suggest a weakness in democracy as we are constantly being denied a choice in how our education system works.",
