This decision does not need to wait for EU negotiations to begin, or await a new prime minister \u2013 it can be enacted with immediate effect, as this right will be the responsibility of the British People\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "There are many EU citizens who have been living and working in Britain for many years, and built lives here\r\n\r\nOnce Clause 50 is enacted, nothing will definite their status.\r\nHowever, the British Parliament can define immediately what rights these people have once we are no longer in the EU.\r\n",
