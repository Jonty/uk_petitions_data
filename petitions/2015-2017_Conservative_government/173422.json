The ground conditions were dangerous.  It was very difficult to use wheelchairs and pushchairs - due to the extreme muddy conditions\r\nThe event was a total washout.  The committee have been requested to issue refunds, but have declined.I would ask that you read the comments on the facebook page.  Where you can also see supporting photos showing the disappointment of hundreds of people who have attended this very poorly organised event\r\n",
