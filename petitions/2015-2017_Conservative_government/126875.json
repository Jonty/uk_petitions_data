        "action": "Increase preschool and nursery funding entitlements.",
        "additional_details": "The amount currently paid for a preschool funded place is far lower than the actual cost of providing the care, especially with other government changes meaning their costs have gone up significantly and will do again if the NLW rises as planned to \u00a39 per hour, and with the introduction of 30 hours free childcare places from 2017.\r\n\r\nWe would urge the government to carry out a full review of the amounts paid to ensure the continuation of our much needed preschools.",
        "background": "Nurseries and Preschools are coming under increasing financial pressure due to the low amount paid by the government for the funded places for 2,3 and 4 year olds, coupled with increased costs due to rises in the National Living Wage and Pension rule changes.  A full review of the funding is needed.",
