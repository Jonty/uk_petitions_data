        "action": "Introduce mental health education at schools to help prevent and protect",
        "additional_details": "If I had had an education on mental health I would've recognised the signs of my illness and would have sought help earlier instead of being afraid due to the stigma surrounding it. I could've been prevented from reaching a critical underweight status. Education on mental illnesses such as eating disorders, schizophrenia and borderline personality disorders that are not very well known are just as important as ones such as depression which is widely known. ",
        "background": "After suffering from anorexia myself, I believe education on mental health at school can not only protect vulnerable people to recognise problems earlier but prevent some cases which would stop it reaching to the extreme. This education can help break the stigma on mental health which is necessary",
