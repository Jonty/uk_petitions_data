        "additional_details": "Many will argue their anonymity will be breached through transparency, however this very anonymity has the potential to be used, to manipulate the general public to remain in a closed and unknown voting system, where the possibility of corruption of votes will remain. Transparency removes uncertainty and creates trust, a notion that perhaps will restore a small portion of much needed faith in our countries politics.",
        "background": "We call for an updated voting system, British people register once, when the time comes to vote they take a unique identifier with them to a local polling station where they can log onto an electronic terminal and submit their vote. The public should be able to view all the votes for transparency. ",
