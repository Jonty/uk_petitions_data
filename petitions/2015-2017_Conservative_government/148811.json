        "additional_details": "\"We sent the EU \u00a3350 million each week\u2026 this is enough to build a new, fully-staffed NHS hospital every week\u201d. This referendum statement has been publically refuted but continued to be used. Aside from the amount being too high, it is like saying that we send Sainsbury's \u00a3xx a week which could be used to buy \u00a3yy. Whilst not false it completely ignores that Sainsbury's give us food in return. There must be consequences for lies to the public, to restore trust in democracy in the United Kingdom.",
        "background": "One of the things this referendum has shown is that politicians and campaigns can lie, or misrepresent the truth with no consequence. That can't continue to be acceptable in a democracy. There should be significant consequences for politicians and people signing off misleading campaign statements.",
