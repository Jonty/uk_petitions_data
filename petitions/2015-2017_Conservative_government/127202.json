        "action": "Make all public schools academies if all state schools have to be.",
        "additional_details": "Academies open up a path for headteachers to be fully in charge of budgets; headteachers are not accountants and should not be given these duties. They open up a path for teaching staff not to need PGCE qualifications, which are prerequisites for a reason. There's no evidence that academisation necessarily improves teaching quality, so this policy is an enormous waste of time, money and effort. If this policy is enacted, we ask that public schools aren't exempted- for the sake of equality.",
        "background": "Osborne's budget has set out a plan to make all state schools into academies. This petition objects to this in the strongest terms and, to equal the playing field, calls on the government to subject all citizens to the same rules should the worst case scenario happen. \r\n\r\nWe're all in this together.",
