        "additional_details": "The classic arguments against increasing the minimum wage for those under 25 are null. \r\n\r\n\"To encourage young people to stay in education\" - Most people finish an undergraduate course aged 23 or under. Are they not worthy of a 'living wage' ?\r\n\r\n\"Younger people may be under skilled\" - So could a 50 year old. Replace this broken system with an \"introductory wage\" forcing employers to raise the wage  a certain amount of time on lower pay, while the employee gains the skills needed.",
        "background": "Britain's youth are being exploited, with the cost of universities also rising there needs to be a viable alternative to higher education. This is a petition to give people the wage they work for without prejudice against age. A modern society should be free from institutionalised agism.",
