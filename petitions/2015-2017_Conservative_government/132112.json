        "additional_details": "Being a manager of a dementia care home I hear a lot of staff and others refer to the carers as ONLY A CARER I feel this is degrading and demoralising. Their are a lot of good passionate caring carers out there that are not being recognised for this only recognition is bad recognition.Dementia is becoming more progressive and affecting the younger people as well as the elderly. More and more people may be affected by this condition due to people living longer, better awareness and research",
        "background": "It is a requirement for all staff working within dementia to have specialised training and qualifications so I feel they should be recognised for their hard work, passion and dedication in providing high standard of care for people suffering with dementia by making it a specialised career choice\r\n\r\n",
