        "additional_details": "Politicians individually, have claimed that the result of the referendum must be followed by invoking Article 50. Leaving the EU will not solve any issues of immigration, may provide unspecified savings, may invoke unspecified costs, and could lead to the break-up of the UK. \r\nParliament must act to ensure the greater good of maintaining the UK as a unit, despite the result of the referendum. Failure to do so would be a failure of our Parliament and our Union.\r\n\r\nThis must be debated further.",
        "background": "The result of the EU referendum may lead to the break up of the UK. Scotland has indicated that they may seek to leave the UK now that exiting the EU is possible, though not legally mandated.\r\nThe misinformation given by the remain and leave campaigns could not allow fair choice by the population.",
