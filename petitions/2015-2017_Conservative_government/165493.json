        "additional_details": "It is stated that around one unaccompanied refugee child is accepted into the UK every 18 days. These children have a perilous journey and only some are lucky enough to make it to a camp. \r\n\r\nMany of these children are being used as sex slaves and even have their organs sold. 50% that were tested in Italy had sexually transmitted diseases. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this petition, is to demand the government act immediately to bring these children to the UK in far greater numbers than just TWENTY per YEAR!",
        "background": "Save the Children originally asked for 3000 unaccompanied refugee children to be allowed into the UK. After an amendment, which changed this to an \u201cunspecified\u201d number of children, was added to the bill, it became part of the Immigration Act in May 2016.",
