        "action": "Abolish the national debt.",
        "additional_details": "The British National Debt is 90.6% of GDP now, according to Eurostat. At 100% it is impossible to repay. The national debt does not include the unfunded spending promises which have already been made. And GDP is already a poor measure of true economic activity. The government has no more right to put the British people into debt, than I have the right to max out a credit card in the name of my infant child. We must be ready for the future & not spread so thin that we can't deal with emergencies.",
        "background": "The national debt is a guarantee of future tax hikes and inflation. It is incurred by MPs overspending, and passed on to future generations to deal with. It is immoral to force debt on our children without their consent. Ban parliament from spending more than they take in revenue. Balance the books.",
