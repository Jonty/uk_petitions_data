        "additional_details": "Having signed numourus petitions myself, I've received emails from the government stating they don't believe the issue is credible.\r\n\r\nThe replies often completely disregarding the concerns raised in a petition & ilastrating their own reasons & opinions why things are so. Not that of the concerned people who have taken the time to sign the petition. \r\n\r\nDebating every petition that reaches 100,000 signature would allow for those signed to gain better understanding from those who represent them.",
        "background": "It's all well & good government responding with their own opinions on issues after 10,000 signatures.\r\n\r\nAfter 100,000 signatures government MUST agree to debate an issue,\r\nnot CONSIDER debating.\r\n\r\nGovernment shouldn't be able to pick & choose issues to be debated that don't line their opinions.",
