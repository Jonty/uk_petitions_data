        "additional_details": "It has been made 'Legal'  to undermine the equality act 2010's section on age discrimination with equal pay, as experience may be assumed in place of evidence. This has been seen before in history with race, sexuality, gender and disability. Now all have laws in place to prevent pay discrimination. The same needs to be done with age. Marrying the youth and adult minimum wage is the first step as a person of age 20 and higher qualified can by law be paid less then a older, less qualified person.",
        "background": "In many jobs staff under 21 work alongside adults performing the same jobs to the same ability receive different wages, this is a form of age discrimination currently permitted. Jobs should have a constant pay across all age rather then the pay being determined by the employee's circumstances.",
