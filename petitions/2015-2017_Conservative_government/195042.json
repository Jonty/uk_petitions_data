        "action": "Legalize Cannabis for personal use and solve the 'Spice' epidemic.",
        "additional_details": "Prohibition has only driven cannabis into a black market which has no regulation on age, purity or ethics and as a result has re-percussive effects on society as a whole. This restriction leaves the black market looking for stronger, cheaper and less detectable alternatives. The governments response to the last petition on cannabis law reform was that under the current law numbers of users are dropping but this doesn't take into account the rise of use in new psychoactive substances.",
        "background": "Synthetic cannabinoids known as 'Spice' were marketed to bypass the current laws on cannabis. We need to legalize cannabis to protect inexperienced cannabis users from being duped into using 'Spice'. We should also stop urine testing for cannabis in prisons to prevent prisoners turning to 'Spice'.",
