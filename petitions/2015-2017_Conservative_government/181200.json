        "additional_details": "Donald J Trump has already made very extremist remarks, regarding banning Muslims from entering his \"Fortress\" and exclaimed things which may provoke other countries. Which clearly hint he is not in great interest of making relations to other foreign countries. He would not be in best conclusion of making such a relation with the UK, and therefore we should not join him in his far right wing foreign policy and Milatary actions which he may declare later in his presidential run. ",
        "background": "The USA are a highly militarised country, with an aggressive, ignorant and misleading president. Their actions in war, would be influenced by Donald J Trump and therefore would be misleading for the UK, And not co operating in war with the USA would increase trade chance and foreign relations.",
