        "additional_details": "There are multiple cases where the insurer is voiding policies after a claim is made.  My argument is that they are collecting \"Golden Tickets\", where they let you pay a policy until they are liable for something, so removing all risk\r\n\r\n- They have a responsibility to check the details when it is free to do so.\r\n- They shouldn't void insurance for trivial date mix-ups on policy, but rewrite/update instead.\r\n- After non-fault incidents insurers shouldn't be allowed to throw the claimant to the wall.",
        "background": "After a non-fault road traffic accident where my spine was injured, I received notice that my insurance was to be voided due to inadvertent (or innocent) non-disclosure of material fact.  The insurer could have checked the details for free at any time, but waited til I claimed.",
