",
        "background": "I think pitbulls should be allowed to be owned in the UK because they are the most kind and gentle dogs you could meet. They are great around children and other animals depending on how they are raised. The only reason pitbulls are seen as a vicious breed is down to the owners that raise them wrong.",
