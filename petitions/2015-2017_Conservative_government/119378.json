I am currently running my own business, its in its third year and doing quite well.\r\nMy business is a video production company, as you can imagine, without a car I am forced to use public transport, and have many a time been let down, the public transport companies have lost me clients and money many a time due to the atrocious service.\r\nMany a time I do not even get a seat on a train, even though Ive paid \u00a350 to travel a few miles",
        "background": "The public transport in this country is a horrid affair. \r\nOverpriced, overcrowded, dirty, old and not efficient enough. \r\nIn many area's of the UK people cannot afford a car, and rely on public transport daily. ",
