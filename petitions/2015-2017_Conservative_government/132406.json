        "additional_details": "BES operate in a way where they buy 'change of tenancy' data and make unsolicited calls to unknowing new business owners/tenants under the facade that they are 'meter registration' executives or 'central network' employees, they then adopt a hard-sell approach (harrassment) citing all sorts of claims (lies) e.g claiming they need to agree 'the best deal on the market' through BES Utilities for up to 5 years. These contracts put SMEs out of business - they are as far from competitive as you get.",
        "background": "Whilst I do understand that profit & commission are the main draws of the business energy sector - their way of trading should not be to the complete detriment of the customer and their small to medium enterprises. I have seen SMEs go out of business due to BES practices.  ",
