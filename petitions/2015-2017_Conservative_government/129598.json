        "action": "Sell the Palace of Westminster. MPs to vote on where to relocate Parliament.",
        "additional_details": "The Scottish Parliament and The Welsh Assembly have modern buildings, purpose built in the twenty first century. The Houses of Parliament which serve the whole of the UK were built in the nineteenth century. Repairing the structure while the day to day business of Parliament continues there, would be difficult and expensive. Our MPs deserve modern facilities. Once the new location has been selected and the new venue created, the Palace of Westminster could be sold off to be properly restored.",
        "background": "The iconic Houses of Parliament are in urgent need of repair. Moving parliament to a modern purpose built site would create much needed economic stimulus elsewhere in the UK. The existing Palace of Westminster would prove to be a popular tourist attraction.",
