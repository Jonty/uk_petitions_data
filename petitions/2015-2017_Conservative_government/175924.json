        "action": "Make student loans interest free.",
        "additional_details": "Where students loans are unlikely to be rid of in the near future we must look to other ways in reducing the burden on our students. However this application is mostly directed at students of the Islamic faith who have been made to compromise their beliefs in order to access higher education. Taking interest based finance is contrary to the creed of the Islamic faith. The student loans currently in place have restricted these students' access to higher education.",
        "background": "The student loan is a burden in itself and off putting to many wishing to study at university. This petition was sparked by knowledge of students of the Islamic faith not being able to go to university without infringing upon their religious values.",
