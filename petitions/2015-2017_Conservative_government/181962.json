        "additional_details": "Young Secondary School children are being forced into another ridiculous and unreasonable new GCSE system. It is atrocious that children from the previous year had controlled assessments in English and this years dont. The government have added more higher grades and less lower grades (9-1) which is aggravating and overwhelming for most students who want to get into collage to do A levels, putting pupils under pressure, which is very unhealthy.",
        "background": "This is unjustifiable and stressful for adolescents .Students from ages 15-16 years old are being made to do a much harder GCSEs in Maths and English. What was considered a C back then is now a 'lower C'. Why did the previous students get to do easier GCSEs?",
