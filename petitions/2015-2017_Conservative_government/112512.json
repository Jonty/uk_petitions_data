Using research evidence, pilot programmes and economic evaluation, it assesses the evidence for programmes against a set of internationally recognised criteria. \r\n\r\nThe UK NSC is currently looking at the evidence to asses if the introduction of a test that combines biochemical and ultrasound markers would be able to help to reduce stillbirths. The review will consider research which looks at a number of strategies to predict stillbirth which are thought to be related to problems with the placenta.  The Committee hopes to be in a position to consult on the review in winter 2016.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health",
