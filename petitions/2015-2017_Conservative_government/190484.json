        "additional_details": "The SNP are always moaning about being part of the UK, despite having more per \u00a3 spent per head than the rest of England.\r\nEvery few years now the SNP will find something new to justify yet another referendum so I suspect most English are fed up of the uncertainty and we should be asked if we want Scotland part of us or give them what they want (or at least the party they voted in the SNP) and force then out once and for all.",
        "background": "It is clear that the SNP will stop at nothing until Scotland leaves the UK after having a once in a generation vote and losing she wants another 2 years later - so the English should have a vote on getting rid of Scotland from the UK and giving the SNP what they want.",
