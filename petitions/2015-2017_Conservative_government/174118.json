        "action": "British Government should express regret to Palestinians for Balfour Declaration",
        "additional_details": "The Balfour declaration of 1917 clearly prejudiced the rights of Palestinian people by not fulfilling its intended goals. HM Government bears responsibility for the plight of Palestinians and has a duty to ensure proper restoration and reparation for its historical failure.\r\n\r\nOur government should take the moral stance to acknowledge its past colonial crimes. The victims of British colonialism are owed recognition for their suffering and HMG should ensure that justice is attained.",
        "background": "We call on Her Majesty\u2019s Government to openly apologise to the Palestinian people and be held accountable for the crimes committed with the British Mandate. The colonial policy of Britain between 1917-1948 led to mass displacement of the Palestinian nation.\r\n\r\n",
