        "additional_details": "In many abuse cases there is a significant amount of quality supporting evidence, but yet not enough to corroborate every element and thus the case cannot proceed. Crimes of domestic abuse and sexual violence,in the main, happen in private and without witnesses so corroboration is simply not a fair way of determining if a case should proceed further.",
        "background": "The current requirement in Scotland for corroboration in reported abuse cases does not give victims a fair chance of getting the justice they deserve. Therefore, the Scottish Government should remove this law.",
