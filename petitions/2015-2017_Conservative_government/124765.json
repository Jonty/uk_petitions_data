        "action": "Stop the compulsory move to Academy status for all English schools.",
        "additional_details": "The best performing schools are Local Authority funded community, voluntary aided and foundation schools. (41% of secondary schools and 82% of primary schools in England are not academies.)\r\nThe most efficient means of providing services for schools is through Local Authorities.\r\nAcademies may not reflect the needs of local communities.\r\nAcademies do not have to employ qualified teachers so the quality of teaching and learning can suffer.",
        "background": "There is no evidence to suggest that forcing schools into Academy status will bring improvements to children's education. The Local Authority model is very successful and should be retained. The government should not remove the 1998 Education Act and should keep Local Authority maintained schools.",
