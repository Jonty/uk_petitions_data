        "action": "Acknowledge the democratic flaws of the EU referendum and not action the result",
        "additional_details": "In light of democratic injustices this petition proposes that withdrawal of European citizenship against one`s will is a violation of human rights, siting Article 27 right to freely participate in the cultural life of the community, Article 13 right to liberty of movement within the territory of a state.  Injustices are: misinformation presented to voters; furthermore withholding 16 and 17 year old`s right to vote on that which cannot realistically take effect until they are of legal voting age.",
        "background": "This petition proposes that democracy is not served through lies and misinformation. And that to act on the result of a democratically unjust referendum would strip individuals of their European citizenship against their will, and their human right to freely participate in their European community.
