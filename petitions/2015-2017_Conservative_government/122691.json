It\u2019s unlikely to be introduced in 2016 but, with 4 years to prepare, in 2020 it could prove to be an impactful and meaningful day. Suggestions for the day can be found as at www.make29matter.org and can added to via hello@make29matter.org. The campaign originated from the CJAM Group, a marketing agency in Essex but it is a not-for-profit project",
