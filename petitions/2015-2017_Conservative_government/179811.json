        "additional_details": "Whether one likes the President's policies or not, is no reason to mount an attack, simply because anti-democratic stirrings within a small minority. The MAJORITY, often silent, are the ones that politicians represent and President Trump is doing just that: representing the people of the USA, acting on mandate, with the majority. Just because a small minority don't like this, does not give them the right to dictate, as this is more akin to fascism, than democracy. ",
        "background": "Democracy is simple: the voice of the people, equally aired.The USA has a new President, and he was voted into office by the majority of US people, in a democratic election. As President of the USA, he has the right and invitation to visit the UK & is doing so as part of international protocol. ",
