        "additional_details": "Once article 50 of the Lisbon treaty is invoked the decision to leave is irrevocable.\r\n\r\nHowever the promises made on the Leave side are already unravelling. A leading Leave campaign figure stated within 24hrs of the result that the \u00a3350m/wk was not true, and reduced it to \u00a3200m/wk with no assurance it would be used for the purposes he expressly campaigned on. Another has already said leave voters cannot expect an end to migration, despite this being a fundamental promise and issue on which votes were cast. \r\n\r\nGiven that key promises are already being denied, and the importance of the decision, we should have to opportunity to re-confirm the result before we definitively and irrevocably act upon it.",
        "background": "The decision to leave the EU will affect us for better or worse for decades to come. Yet the key promises in support of the leave decision are already being rescinded (\u00a3350m/wk for NHS, end to EU migration). \r\nThe British people should be given the chance to re-confirm this far reaching decision.",
