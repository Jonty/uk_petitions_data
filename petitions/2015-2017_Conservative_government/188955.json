        "additional_details": "A lot of people don't feel a human can help them with their mental issues. However, they feel an animal can. A dog, cat, horse. Any animal but because assistant dogs for sight and hearing are already an active help in this country I feel we should start from there.\r\nDogs will listen and give the best hugs. They are compassionate animals. They love their owners. To give a mental health asstant dog all the privalges of a sight/hearing dog we can help loads more mentally ill people.",
        "background": "I myself, like thousands of others around the UK, have mental health issues that bring our every day lives to a hault. But people don't always help, but dogs can. My dog calms me down and makes me happier. She calms down my rages, gives me something to smile about when I want to die. She is my life.",
