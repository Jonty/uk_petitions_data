        "action": "Ban the sale of single use platic carrier bags in the UK.  Use paper instead.",
        "additional_details": "Plastic is poisonous to all life, attracting harmful chemicals, which when ingested leach into the organism and food chain, disrupting cellular function. Plastic debris causes the death of thousands of marine mammals which are vital to maintaing ocean ecosystem function - a function that makes life on earth possible. Enforcing the substitution of plastic carrier bags for  paper carrier bags which can compost or biodegrade would make a much needed impact on maintaining the health of the planet.\r\n",
        "background": "The UK government has recently introduced a 5p charge on single use plastic carriers - however this does not stem the flow of plastic to ocean in any way.  To ban the sale of these in favour of paper and card carrier bags would be a supremely beneficial move.",
