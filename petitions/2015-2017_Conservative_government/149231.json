        "additional_details": "The Twitter hashtag #PostRefRacism has already documented countless frightening instances of digital and physical hate crimes, and amount to only a proportion of the problem. The extreme-right elements of the country have wrongly interpreted a Leave vote to legitimise these terrible acts of aggression and bigotry. The UK should not allow this intolerance and should act strongly to bring safety and security to all residents of this country, regardless of creed, colour or nationality. ",
