This would prevent drivers from needing to monitor doors and remove any chance of track related accidents.\r\n\r\nModern technology can implement signalling without affecting sub-surface lines which consist of complex arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe Victoria line currently has automated technology in place showing it can be done.\r\n",
