It is obvious, this is the easiest and quickest way to earn cash, but can this be stopped? Shouldn't\u200b there be a discretionary period for parents to bring and collect their children, to and from school in restricted streets & controlled zones near schools? Can we have the appropriate grace time when sensibly parked with safety at heart for our children?",
        "background": "Car surveillance, Traffic wardens like 'Predators waiting to pounce' on parents dropping off & picking up children.This is a form of victimising & punishing parents for bringing children to schools. Grace time of 10/15 mins will allow safe drop off and pick up in controlled zone before enforcing PCN",
