        "additional_details": "Many people buy products from high street shops and have no idea that they are tested on animals. This includes popular makeup and hair care brands. Legislation should promote cruelty free brands and unnecessary harm to animals and those that wish to continue should display a logo on the front of their products to expose what they try to hide from the public. Do not  continue to take money from us  - no animal's painful life in a cage is worth your 'silky' hair. ",
        "background": "Many products sold within the UK hide the fact that they use animal testing for non-medical purposes. I propose a legislation that all companies that test on animals should have to display a logo on the front of their products so the public can fairly decide what to buy. ",
