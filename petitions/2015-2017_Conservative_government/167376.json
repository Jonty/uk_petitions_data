        "additional_details": "Currently children are only eligible for early years funding from the term after their 3rd birthday. There are some children however, who fall into a category where they are eligible from the age of two. \r\nNursery fees are increasing, currently nursery fees range between \u00a360per day to \u00a380 day which is outrageous! \r\n\r\nThe government needs to do more to ensure that parents are not left in debt at the end of each month like many parents are due to these ridiculous fees.\r\n",
        "background": "Childcare is an extortionate expense for parents every month and increasing at an alarming rate.\r\n\r\nGet the government to fix fees and make them more affordable for working parents and non working parents or offer early funding for all children not just a select few.\r\n",
