        "additional_details": "FOBTs are dangerously addictive, allowing users to place bets of up to \u00a3100 at once, which lasts all of 30 seconds. With these machines operating at a return of 97.3%, bookmakers are making millions of \u00a3s from these machines every week, at the expense of those who are unfortunate enough to have become addicted to FOBTs. Something has to be done, and a complete ban is the only solution",
