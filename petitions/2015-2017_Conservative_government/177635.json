        "additional_details": "This is despite Egypt vigorously and successfully fighting international terrorist threats. This is unjust and blatantly inconsistent with the pursuit of a pragmatic and impartial foreign policy. \r\nEgypt is home to a third of the world's historical heritage. It is unfair to deprive British citizens of the countless contributions it has made to civilisation.\r\nEgypt also needs tourism revenue. And also to ensure it remains open to the world and is empowered to overcome the toxic radical ideology. ",
        "background": "Despite the fact that horrific terrorist acts have become endemic Europe, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has not issued restrictions with respect to British citizens travelling to affected countries except Egypt.\r\nPlease remove all advice restrictions with regard to travel to Egypt.",
