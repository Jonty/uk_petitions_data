        "additional_details": "NGO-supported hospitals have repeatedly been targeted by Russian and Assad regime aircraft, resulting in the death of patients and medical staff and leaving entire towns without medical care. \r\n \r\nThe Assad regime and its allies have broken the Cessation of Hostilities agreement just as they have flouted every UNSC resolution on Syria. Endless peace talks and words of condemnation are meaningless so long as Assad continues to murder populations with impunity. Civilians must be protected.",
        "background": "The deliberate, systematic and on-going targeting of civilians, medical facilities and humanitarian workers in opposition-held areas of Syria by Russian and Assad regime airstrikes constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
