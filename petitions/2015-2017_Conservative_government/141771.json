        "additional_details": "We cannot start negotiations with Europe if we are a country do not know what we want / cannot agree on what we want instead.  The 1st Referendum was a Vote of No Confidence, giving the government permission to detail a specific alternative to Europe.  The people must approve this alternative (by a 60% majority) BEFORE we invoke Article 50 and start the negotiations with Europe to leave.",
        "background": "Given that the Brexit camp cannot agree what Brexit looks like -- e.g. will immigation be reduced or merely controlled, will \u00a3350m be spent on the NHS or not -- the 1st Referendum should be viewed as a Vote of No Confidence in Europe, not as an instruction to invoke Article 50.",
