We should also have the same for any political statements or publications. \r\n\r\nIt is understood that this would not work in PMQs, the house or in TV interviews but it would allow those MPs that get their facts checked an upper hand in debates.  \r\n\r\nWith limited views in media, the British public could do with a dedicated source of \"spin free\" facts and statistics\r\n",

All published or broadcast (party political broadcasts) statements must pass through the independent fact checking panel. Any statement found incorrect or  a deceitful way of twisting the stats needs to be retracted.",
