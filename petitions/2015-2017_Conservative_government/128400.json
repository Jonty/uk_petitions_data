        "additional_details": "We welcome the new 30 hour free childcare proposals, but the amount funded to settings needs to be significantly increased. The additional hours, as well as the rise in the national living wage puts more stress on already stretched settings. Small settings and childminders in rural, poorly funded areas are most at risk. Please support us!\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/help-with-childcare-costs/free-childcare-and-education-for-2-to-4-year-olds\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-32928117 \r\n",
        "background": "All 3 to 4-year-olds (and some 2 years olds) in England can get 570 hours of free early education or childcare per year. However, the amount the government pays early years settings is well below what it costs in real terms, meaning settings are under threat of closing or raising fees sky high. \r\n",
