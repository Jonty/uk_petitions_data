        "additional_details": "The campaign to leave the European Union was full of misrepresentation of the facts  by the media, leading to an increase in racial hate crime. It has also led to poor relations with other countries.The vote to leave has led to a 10% devaluation of the pound and chaos in both the major political parties. Also, the referendum result has led to financial insecurity for many British people, because of the possible loss of open borders, which has led businesses to consider other employment markets. ",
        "background": "The government should not invoke Article 50 and stay in the European  Union. We believe that enough members of the public are unhappy with the result, that the referendum should not be valid. Similarly, many leave voters are expressing regret. Furthermore, the referendum is not legally binding. ",
