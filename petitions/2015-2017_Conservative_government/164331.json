        "action": "Introduce a compulsory \u00a30.05 deposit on all  recyclable bottles and cans",
        "additional_details": "The deposit is automatically added onto the cost of the product, and the refunding of the deposit could be done at supermarkets and automated reverse-vending machines like those used in Scandinavia. \r\n\r\nThis would also be beneficial to local authorities, who would not only see a large reduction in the amount of kerbside recycling which is needed to be collected, but the deposits paid could be reclaimed by the local authority for any containers which are collected.",
        "background": "The 5p carrier bag charge has been a huge success, reducing the amount of plastic bags given out by supermarkets by over 90%.\r\n\r\nIn response to this, I propose a compulsory 5p deposit on all recyclable aluminium, steel and plastic containers to encourage recycling.",
