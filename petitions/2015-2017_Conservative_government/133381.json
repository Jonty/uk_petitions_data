Vote in changes should be made, vote out changes will be made and it should be up to the British people to decide who has the best plan of action and who will govern us after such a decision. A general election should be held in order to determine who has the best plan of action. No party has come up with a POA for the British public to back.",
        "background": "If we vote in or out of the EU no government party has outlined the plan of action in either situation. It should be our right to determine who leads after a social and economic decision like this. A general election should be held, either way, with each party outlining a P.O.A after the voting.",
