I really hope you consider this.",
        "background": "The House of Lords has 26 bishops, representing Christianity as a religion. Even though the House of Lords is unelected and less powerful than the House of Commons, it is still of importance. Therefore, it is only right to add in other religious representatives, such as: Islam, Judaism, Sikhism",
