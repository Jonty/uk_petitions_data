        "additional_details": "Various extremists are barred from the UK: white supremicists, Islamists, criminals, etc.. \r\n\r\nDonald Trump, now President of the United States, continues to make inflammatory remarks attacking people on religious and nationalist grounds. Discrimination against Muslims and Mexicans may be enacted in law and legislation may restrict options of women and LGBT people.  He supports the use of torture, and his anti-intellectual stance, particularly climate change, may be detrimental to the entire world.  He is not a fit person to enter the UK and his polarising influence may lead to unrest.",
        "background": "While the free movement of people is generally good thing, the Government has a responsibility to protect citizens from individuals who seek to foment religious or racial disharmony, or whose speeches or behaviour may incite or provoke others into violent acts.",
