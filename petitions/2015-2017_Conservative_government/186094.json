        "additional_details": "People who fail to turn up or miss appointments at hospitals and local GP's, without valid reasons, should be fined or sent a bill. It is increasingly difficult to get appointments at GP's and the waiting list in Hospitals gets ever longer. By fining these people who waste these appointment not only would you raise revenue which can be invested in the NHS but would make people think twice before avoiding appointments and potentially keeping people out of A&E.",
        "background": "Hundreds of patients miss appointments at local GP's and Hospitals without valid reasons, who then go on to take beds in A&E when they could have been treated at their Doctors or pharmacies. For missing these appointments, without valid reasons, i believe people should pay a fine.",
