        "additional_details": "We have an unprecedented situation currently, when MPs are voting to trigger Article 50 against their own consciences, because they are told not to usurp 'the will of the people'. The country is facing a massive decision and they are powerless to act.\r\nI say ok, since this is such a huge decision for the country, let's confirm 'the will of the people', before it's too late and we discover that in reality, the U.K. sleepwalked into something that it really didn't want.\r\nThere is too much at stake.",
        "background": "As Brexit has enormous consequences for the UK, what is wrong with asking the people to confirm that is what they still want before Article 50 is triggered?\r\nSurely that will give a true reflection of 'the will of the people' and not a half-baked one as of now. It is not a case of 'best of 3'.",
