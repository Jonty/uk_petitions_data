        "additional_details": "House prices force people out of areas & make more expensive commutes. Where workers live & where companies are located could be positively influenced by such a move.\r\n\r\nIf all workers had the opportunity to claim tax relief on their annual commute this would ease the housing market, create job mobility and employment in more regions. \r\nIt is unfair, unreasonable & damaging to the mindset of all employees that they are taxed to go to work. It is an unfair burden on hard working people.\r\n",
        "background": "Allow commuters to claim income tax relief on the cost of travelling to work. \r\nCommuters spend their own money to travel to work. Fuel & public transport costs rise and it costs more per year to get to work. \r\n\u25bcMore details \r\n\r\n",
