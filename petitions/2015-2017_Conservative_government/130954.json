        "action": "Make older homes comply with new building regs if proven harmful to occupants",
        "additional_details": "For 10 years I have owned a shared ownership leasehold apartment that suffers from insufficient ventilation, it has been proved to have very poor airflow but as it was given a completion certificate by the local authority I have been unable to persuade the Housing Association or the Freeholder to allow me to change the windows. \r\nFor 6 years I was poisoned by excessive levels of CO2 that built up in my property while I was sleeping, 4 years ago I left my home and I am still waiting for resolve.",
        "background": "In the past new homes were built to conserve energy, one way to this was to make them airtight. A side affect of this was insufficient ventilation, regulations have been changed in recent years to prevent this but older homes continue to harm their occupants with high levels of indoor pollution.",
