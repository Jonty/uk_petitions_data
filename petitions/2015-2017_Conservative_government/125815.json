        "additional_details": "Sunday 20th March 2016 - Attended an event at the 02. Parked for 2 and a half hours and was charged \u00a331.\r\nThursday 24th March 2016 - Attended an event and had dinner at the 02 first. Parked for 6 hours and was charged \u00a331.\r\n\r\nThis is not consistent. Despite spending money on refreshments in the venue I have still had to pay \u00a362 for 8 and a half hours for parking 1 vehicle in 1 week, after having no option other than to drive from Kent, in addition to the tube strikes. Totally unacceptable. ",
        "background": "It is completely unreasonable to expect any person to pay \u00a331 to park their vehicle at the 02 arena in London having already paid to see an event. Usually people only drive to the venue because they do not have easy access to public transport and it therefore gives them no option other than to pay. ",
