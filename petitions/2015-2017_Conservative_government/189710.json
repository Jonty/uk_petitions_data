        "additional_details": "As an individual who's been permanently & indefinitely resident in the UK 22years to date and has lived in the UK for a total 33years to date it's been frustrating missing out on British Nationality, it's benefits and it's sense of pride all these years simply because every time I have approached the issue and contemplated the lengthy forms & the processing time, the costs etc., I am left shocked and put off each year by the ever increasing fees, which has gone from \u00a360 in 1997 to \u00a32357 in 2016.",
        "background": "For a foreign national who's lived lawfully and permanently with indefinite residency status in the UK for 15years or more, it's unreasonable to charge them \u00a32357 in fee for Naturalisation and for a British Passport.  This wrongly discourages good & long established residents from becoming British.",
