        "additional_details": "Recently the new five pound note was found to have tallow in the initial process of manufacture. This has caused outrage not just with vegan groups, the Church but also Muslims. This 'small' problem is now going to be resolved. Why then as vegans in our thousands have we not been given a choice in where our tax money goes. The meat/animal/war industries supported by a huge proportion of our earnings is entirely against our ethics. We therefore wish to question this as it is unacceptable.  ",
        "background": " Veganism is the number one factor in saving the planet, resources, water shortage. Vegans are increasing every day and we feel strongly that our tax is used to fund an industry we find unacceptable. Vegans have the right as Article 9 of the EHRA states, for our views are to be taken seriously.    ",
