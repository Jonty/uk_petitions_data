        "additional_details": "My mum was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma 2 yrs ago after 6 yrs of symptoms and numerous misdiagnoses. she was given 2 Weeks to live a yr ago but still fights on.Mums diagnosis came\r\ntoo late for her to have life lengthening surgery,and at every turn we are told there is nothing that can be done. Many Drs haven't even heard of the illness.No trials are ongoing for a cure because \"drugs companies won't make enough money due to the relatively small number of people with the disease\" ",
        "background": "The government must raise awareness of peritoneal mesothelioma so health professionals and the public are aware of the signs and symptoms of this rare disease,thus leading to earlier diagnosis and better prognosis for patients.they must also support clinical trials to help find a cure.
