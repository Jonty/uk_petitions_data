        "additional_details": "Roy Hodgson has done a good job as England manager, with the nation qualifying unbeaten and some excellent performances in friendlies.\r\n\r\nHowever in recent warm up games, against Portugal, Australia and Turkey there have been signs of this old mistake.\r\n\r\nVardy on the left wing. Kane pushed out to the right and taking free kicks from the wings. Alli pushed deeper to accommodate Rooney.\r\n\r\nAs a nation we need to tell Roy to pick the strongest and most cohesive team with everyone in the right position.",
        "background": "England has a long history of underachieving at major football tournaments. Mainly due to our managers constantly playing the \"best\" 11 players rather than selecting the strongest team with all players in their optimal positions. ",
