        "action": "Require Ofcom to update the market classifications of telephone exchanges.",
        "additional_details": "I have done market research and many exchanges all over the country are still market 1. The criteria for a market 1 exchange is that BT Wholesale is the sole Local Loop Provider. Many exchanges now have three or more LLP on site and operating from these exchanges. There appears to be collusion between BT and Ofcom to keep many hundreds of exchanges in market 1 and not to upgrade then to market 2 or 3. This is forcing thousand of customers to pay excessive charges for their broad band service.",
        "background": "The Ofcom classification of telephone exchanges was first done in 2010, and is out of date. Thousands of people are being forced to pay inflated prices for broadband because their local exchange is classified as market 1 with BT Wholesale as the only LLP when there are 4 or more active LLP on site.",
