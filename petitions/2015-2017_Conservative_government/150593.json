Less than 52% of 72% of the population want to leave - I make that only 37% of the total voting population!",
        "background": "Less than 52% of voters in the EU Referendum voted to leave, a vote many are now regretting. This % figure is not a mandate for change, especially in light of the lies told. \r\nA referendum is only an opinion poll, it does not mean you need to follow this very marginal result. Discuss and vote as MPs",
