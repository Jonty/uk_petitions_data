        "additional_details": "I personally wished to stay in the EU, however the decision has been made and now we must look forward and work towards the future.\r\nCameron has resigned, which was expected, but the UK should not be saddled with a new PM they have not chosen. \r\nThe referendum saw highest voter turnout for sometime and with people in this mood, I believe a snap election should be called so once again the public's voice can be heard and a government of choice elected for this unprecedented situation. ",
        "background": "The EU Referendum decided (rightly or wrongly) the UK is to leave the EU. Cameron has now resigned. \r\nThe public should be allowed to decide who and which party is right to lead the UK forward rather than gaining an unelected PM. \r\nA snap election should be called. ",
