        "additional_details": "I suggest that high sugar foods are labelled in the style of cigarette packets to show patients what damage these foods can cause.\r\nThere is not enough 'in your face' public information to make people take notice and see which foods cause these problems. \r\nI had a patient last week who was consuming 8 litres of cola a day, and another who brought polos into the surgery with her. There is no labelling on these products to warn of the risks and there should be. ",
        "background": "I am a dentist. I spend a lot of time mending patient's teeth, then they come back several years later riddled with more decay and I have to do it all again. They often have associated medical complaints such as obesity and diabetes. They have no idea what foods are causing these issues.",
