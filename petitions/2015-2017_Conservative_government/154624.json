        "additional_details": "I have attended WFIA mosque plenty of times in the past, and there has hardly ever been a time where I have not been shocked or upset by some of the ongoings taking place there. Muslims from around the country have witnessed the corruption and outrage caused in this place of worship, intended solely for Allah, however there seems to be more worship towards power, money and greed in this pirtucular case. YouTube has video evidence of just a small number of incidents that have taken place. ",
        "background": "As most of the local Muslim community in and around Waltham Forest will know, the committee members of WFIA (Lea Bridge Road Mosque) have caused countless problems and issues dating back almost 3 decades now. In order for us to enjoy a wholesome, non corruptive environment we should eradicate them.",
