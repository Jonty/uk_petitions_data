        "additional_details": "My Lola was run over,left with her organs out of her body. If we can't put speed limits in these roads,why can't we have a law just like the Road Traffic Act 1988 for dogs. Cat's are just as domesticated as dogs, don't families deserve closure? It's so traumatic for an owner. The least someone could do is report what happened.Please help by signing this petition, it could really make a difference.It has to reach 100,000 signatures to even be considered by the government,every name counts. ",
        "background": "Leaving them is simply saying cats aren't important. I suffer with PTSD Witnessing a traumatic event like this can be extremely overwhelming. I was surprised the law meant the driver didn't have to stop. Our cat was chipped,they could have taken her to a vet rather than leave for our family to see",
