        "additional_details": "Islamic calendar follows Lunar calendar cycle.  Traditionally, beginning of an Islamic month is marked after visual moon sighting.  Also, it is acceptable to have different days to begin an Islamic calendar month depending on the geographical location.  However, having difference of opinion on moon sighting within a single locality is not acceptable.  Moon sighting is not to be left to religious leaders alone who may be unaware about advancement in astronomy and the calculations of moon cycle.",
        "background": "Leaders in the same localities are announcing different dates for the beginning and end of Ramadan and causing members in families to celebrate Eid on different dates.  Government must take over moon sighting and announce a single beginning and single end based on scientific and religious input.",
