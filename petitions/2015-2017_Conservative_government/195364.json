        "additional_details": "The current tattoo age restriction is part of the Tattooing of Minors Act 1969 which can be viewed here:\r\nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1969/24 \r\nThis act is outdated and does not even give a valid reason as to why there is an age restriction so high. If this was reduced to 16 or 17 this would allow more young adults to enjoy their body art sooner.\r\nMany also choose to have tattoos for special events; one of the biggest for young adults in today's world is getting their results for their GCSEs or A Levels.",
        "background": "Many young adults are considering getting tattoos but are unable to due to the current age restrictions are therefore going abroad to get them. This is resulting in them getting ill from the tattooist not sterilising their equipment or not following normal safety procedures like in the UK.",
