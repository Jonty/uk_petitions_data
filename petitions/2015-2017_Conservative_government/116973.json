        "additional_details": "Brightness of lights on the road has historically been controlled by wattage. However with the advent of LED and HID lights, the same wattage creates an incredibly brighter light. This light is blinding and therefore incredibly dangerous. ",
        "background": "Technology has allowed the brightness of vehicle lights to increase enormously. Now, driving along an unlit road, oncoming headlights are blinding and are therefore hazardous. The same can be said for lights on emergency vehicles, which pose the risk of further accidents on the road. ",
