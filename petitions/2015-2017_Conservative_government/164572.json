        "additional_details": "Britain was offered a substantial number of trade deals that negate the need for an EU deal to access the single market. Furthermore, to shelter more migrants (in exchange for free market access) would invariably result in premeditated terror attacks and a further increase in sexual assaults.\r\nBritain is already a multi-cultural country in desperate need of a Ministry of Immigration to stem the flow and the majority of the population are against compromising their safety for free market access.",
        "background": "Britain has been consistently informed by the European Union that if we wish to access the single market, we must accept free movement, incl. post-Brexit immigration of a specified number of refugees. Additonally, Theresa May promised to reduce migration in exchange for access to the single market",
