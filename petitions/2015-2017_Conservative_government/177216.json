        "additional_details": "We believe that this is important as sixteen year olds are unable to vote even though they will be affected by the results of the vote more so then those of the older generation. We believe that sixteen year olds are intelligent enough to make an informed decision on what they believe is politically correct.  As well as this we believe that society will become a fairer and more equal place due to the more equal change in society.",
        "background": "We believe that this is important as the younger generation are more likely to live through the results of a vote that they are not involved in. We would like to recieve support for this cause as we believe that the public agree with this opinion and would also like to show that they agree. ",
