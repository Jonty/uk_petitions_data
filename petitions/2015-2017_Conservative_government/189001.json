        "background": "Employers, such as my own, are increasing profits by cutting company sick pay, arguing that employees are entitled to statutory sick pay.\r\n\r\nStatutory sick pay. A mere \u00a388.45 a week. Not even close to the amount needed by most to make a rent payment, never mind live.",
