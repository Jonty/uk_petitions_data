        "additional_details": "HS can affect your life in many ways, from just having to wear dressings, right up to hampering your ability to work. Due to the areas that it can affect, the ability to lift or walk could be an issue, making everyday tasks such as shopping, housework or cooking quite difficult.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that around 1% of the population suffers from HS.\r\n\r\nHS is only recognised as a skin condition. yet its so much more.\r\n\r\ncurrently no cure, or effective treatment for HS, so unfortunately it is life long.",
        "background": "Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a chronic skin disease, which appears as a boil-like abscess in the apocrine gland-bearing areas, such as the armpits, breasts and groin. This recurrent inflammatory, and often painful disease is often overlooked, as not much is known of the actual cause. ",
