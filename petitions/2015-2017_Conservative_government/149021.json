        "additional_details": "The recent EU referendum is not legally binding, and failed to provide a sufficiently clear mandate to leave. Almost half of all voters want the UK to remain part of the EU, and those who will live with the decision the longest voted overwhelmingly to remain.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that triggering Article 50 will lead to the break up of the UK. Parliament has a duty to protect the interests of all UK citizens, and not knowingly implement legislation that will damage the UK.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call on parliament to pass a motion clarifying that any attempt to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, and begin the process of the UK leaving the European Union, will be rejected.",
