        "additional_details": "Sadly we may never be able to fully end child abuse, however we do have a chance to punish those responsible. Are you happy knowing that your hard earned money is going towards sheltering these people in our prisons? Getting three meals a day, a bed to sleep in and a warm shower. These children are currently suffering an injustice by letting these people live. They took an innocent life, why do they deserve to keep living theirs? \r\nIf you think the justice system needs a drastic change, to give children who's lifes have been stolen from them some form of justice, then please sign this petition. ",
        "background": "There are currently around 57,000 children in the UK who require protection against abuse. Unfortunately hundreds of these children dont receive the protection or the care they need and are murdered every year. And there are thousands more who suffer daily from physical/sexual abuse and or neglect.",
