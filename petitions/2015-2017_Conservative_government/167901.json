        "additional_details": "Another reason for me wanting a return of the pound note is convenience. Notes take up less space and can be easily folded into a wallet or purse, they are far less cumbersome than a pocket full of coins.\r\n\r\nI also feel that a return of \u00a31 notes has the potential of being a sign of good in the wake of the Brexit. With many people feeling uneasy at how the economy will turn out, this could be a symbol of returning to \"the good old day's\" and reminding them that everything will work out in the end.",
        "background": "The British pound note had been part of our country for over 150 years, until it was phased out in the mid 80's.\r\n\r\nMy main reason for wanting it's return is that the pound is one of the key features that defines the United Kingdom to the rest of the world and should be more than just a simple coin.",
