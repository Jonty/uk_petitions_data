        "additional_details": "There is a very strong argument for totally reforming our Parliamentary system not just the old fashioned system of patronage but ,whilst it remains, it should at least not become even more undemocratic and expensive. David Cameron has already created Lords at a faster rate than any other Prime Minister since 1958. At the same time the Tories want to cut the number of elected MPs from 650 to 600. We are already the only country where the upper chamber is larger than the lower house.",
        "background": "There are already 816 unelected Lords and we don't need any more.  Whilst he has been arguing in favour of austerity David Cameron has  created 244 new Lords (56 since May 2015) who can claim up to \u00a3300 per day. In 2014-15 the Lords members' allowance and expenses totalled over \u00a320 million.\r\n",
