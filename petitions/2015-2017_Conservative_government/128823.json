        "additional_details": "This will benefit employers, who will have invested in training women, to utilise their skills for much longer. There will be a more gender balanced workforce which has many advantages.\r\n\r\nThe public sector offers many such opportunities (e.g. for teachers and doctors) but they are very rare in the private sector which is why the law needs to change.\r\n\r\nWe understand and acknowledge that some roles can't be done part time or as a jobs share, but we believe a large proportion can. ",
        "background": "After having a child many women are often unable to return to their profession as only full time work is available and they want the option to work part time for a variety of reasons. \r\nThe law needs to change so large employers have to offer professional level part time or job share work.",
