        "action": "Review the KS2 writing assessment criteria regarding spelling (before 30.06.16)",
        "additional_details": "We, as Y6 teachers, feel this will impact negatively on children's motivation to write and their self-esteem. This petition has been set up on behalf of such children who have worked hard all year, as well as parents who may not understand the consequences of this aspect of the education policy.\r\nThe government may say that children are allowed to use dictionaries, although this can stunt creativity and would not help children with spelling difficulties like dyslexia.",
        "background": "This year Y6 pupils have to meet criteria to reach the government's expected standard. All of it has to be met, as well as spelling, regardless of specific learning difficulties, including dyslexia. No matter how creative children are, they will not achieve the expected standard for their age.",
