Since the Referendum the economy has gone into free fall, the pound continues to fall and jobs are being put at risk. A Brexit deal needs the consideration of the British people before it is accepted. It is unlikely the terms will be as good as the ones we had as part of the EU so the option must be put on the table. ",

Regarding the deal we must have a say on whether we accept it or at that point wish to remain within the EU. ",
