        "action": "2nd EU referendum as the changes a leave result would enact were not defined.",
        "additional_details": "Before this second referendum such claims like \u00a3350 million a week should be cleared up as I believe that the people who were under informed voted based of that number alone. Already the pound has plumited before slowly recovering and the price of gold has risen 7% this shows that people who are wealthy no longer trust the British Pound and are instead buying gold as it is a more stable currency currently, this is bad for the British economy if we have some of the wealthy leaving.",
        "background": "There should be a 2nd EU referendum as the public weren't given a full definition of what leave would mean.  This has led to a result based on unclear claims made by both sides, and therefore we should have a revote once this has been defined and made clear to the public.",
