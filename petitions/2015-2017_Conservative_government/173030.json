        "additional_details": "The Government of Sierra Leone cracks down heavily on peaceful protests. It has become illegal to protest the injustices in the country without a police clearance. This is contrary to democracy and free speech. We, the people, hardly ever get the police clearance to voice our concerns. When we do, our voices are highly censored. We face hot water canons, live ammunition and police batons if we dare to protest without a police clearance. \r\nThe UK Government gives a significant amount of aid to the Sierra Leonean government on the basis of it practicing democratic principles. Denying us the right to protest is undemocratic in every aspect. Cutting aid funds until they revisit those provisions that suppress free speech will force them into a civil dialogue with the people they ought to serve.",
