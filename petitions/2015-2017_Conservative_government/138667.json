        "additional_details": "Facing with a national crisis that could be the end of the united kingdom, more autonomy must be given to countries, counties and regions of the united kingdom that opt to stay within the EU. Every step must be taken for these parts of the uk to be able to make their stance clear wether they want to be part of the eu or not. By deciding and petitioning the government, these regions would still stay within the uk but would be a special region of the EU with EU laws and regulations still in place",
        "background": "With all the stress that a departure of the UK would bring to those who realy did not want to leave the EU, i hereby petition her majesty's government to allow countries, counties and regions of britain to stay within the EU without leaving the UK. I hereby ask for a law to be written that allows it",
