        "additional_details": "I am paying \u00a31400 a year for a 16 year old Vauxhall Astra that costed \u00a3900. In what world is this acceptable? All young people driving are having to pay this.\r\nExample:The average price for someone in their 30's is just over \u00a3400, which is reasonable. Then someone in their 50's is just over \u00a3200. But when you look at an 18-25 year old it is nearly \u00a31300. I do understand that experience is very important in this issue, but paying well over \u00a31000 a year to be able to get to work every day is a joke",
