        "additional_details": "Many of the core arguments used in the campaign have been proven to be false or admitted to being incorrect post referendum. These include the immediate impact on the UK economy;  the weekly UK cost of EU membership; and promises that all retained money would be spent on the NHS.  Other persuasive misconceptions were also peddled during the campaign, such as a separate UK being certain to significantly limit immigration and the European parliament being unelected.",

We are outraged by this dishonest campaigning, and believe it should be treated in the same way as election fraud, and the result disregarded",
