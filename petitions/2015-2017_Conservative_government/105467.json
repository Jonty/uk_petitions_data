        "action": "Cover mental health prescriptions through medical exemption certificates",
        "additional_details": "Mental health issues often require ongoing prescriptions to help manage symptoms & enable individuals to function in day-to-day life - to get & keep jobs, study, & properly care for themselves. Often individuals need to try many different drugs before finding one that works, & need to continuously take the drug for months or years. This is very expensive for those that may already be struggling with money due to their mental health. There should be help for those facing these continuous costs.",
        "background": "Medical exemption certificates are a way to allow those with specific ongoing health issues to acquire free prescriptions. However, prescriptions for mental health are not currently covered. Those struggling to cope with ongoing mental health issues should be able to access this support.",
