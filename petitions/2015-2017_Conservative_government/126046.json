        "additional_details": "I've heard a few stories/seen in the local paper of a 'cat ripper' going round the streets decappitating cats or chopping off tails etc, this had made me physically sick and whoever is doing this needs locking up for life because they are killing innocent animals for no reason which is also somebody's pet! Imagine a child finding the remains of a poor helpless cat somewhere! \r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35598232\r\nIf life inprisonment was set in place it may help stop animal abuse.",
        "background": "Stricter sentencing needs to be enforced for animal abusers! The punishments that are currently in place are pathetic and worthless. A fine to be paid (which most people probably don't even pay) and maybe a ban from keeping an animal which isnt worth the paper its written on because no one checks!",
