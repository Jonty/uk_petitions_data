        "additional_details": "This has worked in Portugal, helping heroin users drop by 50% in 16 years of legalising drugs. It is also wrong to make somebody who has used a substance a criminal; there are many different circumstances that make people start using drugs, and they shouldn't all be treated the same. Diamorphine (Heroin) is used medically to relieve pain, and people that are given that don't become addicted, yet recreationally it is a Class A drug, which clearly doesn't make sense.",
        "background": "Illegalising drugs is the wrong way to stop use, overdosing & death. Legalising drugs (not advertising them) but not making an offence, will have a positive effect on users. Drugs could be regulated, to stop contamination, and taxes from them could be used to help addicts reconnect with society.",
