        "action": "Make Holocaust denial illegal in the UK",
        "additional_details": "In Germany the law states: \"(3) Whosoever publicly or in a meeting approves of, denies or downplays an act committed under the rule of National Socialism of the kind indicated in section 6 (1) of the Code of International Criminal Law, in a manner capable of disturbing the public peace shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding five years or a fine.\" This is the type of ruling I believe should be put in place in the UK.",
        "background": "In a number of European countries Holocaust denial is an illegal practice including Germany, Austria, Belgium and France. To deny the Holocaust is to deny the suffering of millions and minimise the gross wrongs done against Jewish, disabled, homosexual and non-white people in the 1930s/40s.",
