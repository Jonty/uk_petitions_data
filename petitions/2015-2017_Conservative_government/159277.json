        "additional_details": "The two architects of Brexit should be celebrating.  Instead Farage has resigned and Boris has declined to stand for party leadership.  Both have distanced themselves from Brexit and left many Brexiteers disenchanted.  If we ran the vote again, it is extremely unlikely that Brexit would get the same support.",
        "background": "We are a parliamentary democracy.  Parliament should vote on whether we leave the union.  If we leave the EU, it will almost certainly bring an end to the UK / Great Britain, and we will leave Europe to be totally dominated by Germany, something we fought two world wars to avoid.",
