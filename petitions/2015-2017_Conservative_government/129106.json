        "additional_details": "Prices vary from \u00a32 a day to \u00a324, with some Hospitals not even charging at all. The money collected is beneficial (like being used for maintenance) but only because the Government made cuts. In the 2016 budget announcement, George Osborne announced plans to cut \u00a31.1 billion from the NHS Repair Budget. Even the shadow Health Secretary stated \"Tory neglect has left many hospitals with ageing equipment and a growing bill for urgent maintenance\". Stop the cuts and increase NHS funding. ",
        "background": "For those who have to visit the hospital daily or regularly, the long term cost of visiting is unsustainable and unaffordable as many already pay enough tax which should cover all NHS costs. Car parking charges can be seen as something of a lottery, with varying price ranges. ",
