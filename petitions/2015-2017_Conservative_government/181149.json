        "action": "Petition to increase the lowest acceptable broadband speed from 2Mbps to 10Mbps",
        "additional_details": "From experience, I know it is easy for Openreach to achieve speeds of 2Mbps through the UK's existing infrastructure (predominantly still copper wiring from the 1950s/60s). If the lowest acceptable broadband speed is not increased to 10Mbps, Openreach will focus on improving broadband in built up, high profit areas - areas that largely already have good internet access. The 5G roll out plan typifies this. If the focus is not shifted, many areas will never receive a decent internet connection. ",
        "background": "The Government definition of 'basic broadband' is 2Mbps. At 2Mbps many internet services do not work. Internet usage must be limited to 1 person per household and it is difficult to load the government's own HMRC site - making life difficult for SMEs and the self employed. ",
