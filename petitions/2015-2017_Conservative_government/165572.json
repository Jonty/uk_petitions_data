        "additional_details": "- Most episodes of YuGiOh show that duels lead to enemies becoming friends (there are sometimes beings born of the Shadow Realm, but that's not real). This would be most useful for helping people work together, instead of the divide and conquer method of control you currently use.\r\n\r\n- On the global stage, this would significantly lessen the amount of deaths caused by most world governments, who would learn to distribute resources by sharing, rather than fighting.\r\n\r\n- Duel is pronounced 'dool'.",
        "background": "The UK political process is broken. There is no opposition, media fuelled hatred is growing, causing conflicts between people who should be working together. With a Yu-Gi-Oh duel, our leaders could fight without collateral damage, and randomise the left-right spectrum, giving us a political centre.",
