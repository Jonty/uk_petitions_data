The local government refuses to recognise their rights saying that in their eyes such people 'do not exist'. These gay communities have received little or no support in a country where homosexuality is still strictly taboo. ",
        "background": "Hundreds of gay men are missing in Chechnya. The leader of Chechnya, declared gay men 'do not exist' and a spokesman declared 'their own relatives would have sent them to where they could never return'. We are calling upon the British government to take action on this violation of human rights. ",
