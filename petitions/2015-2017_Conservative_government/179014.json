        "additional_details": "One thing to remember is that many people believe that Princess Diana did much good for charity however what many people seem to not be aware of is that she was a very wealthy woman in her own right and despite this she would often knock on government ministers doors demanding that her globe trotting in connection with her charity work should be financed from the public purse. She left nearly \u00a320 million to her sons so maybe this money should be used to fund their memorial to her !",
        "background": "A statue of Princess Diana has been commissioned by the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, 20 years after her death. Again the public purse will be called upon to fund yet another royal vanity project despite the fact that the Royal Family (and the in-laws) neglected her final resting place.",
