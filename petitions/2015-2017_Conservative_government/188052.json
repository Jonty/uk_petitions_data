        "action": "Keep the freedom of movement for EU citizens into the United Kingdom",
        "additional_details": "We have to take into consideration that currently around 55,000 of NHS staff are made up of citizens from other EU countries. Furthermore, this could greatly impact on UK citizens who want to live/stay for a long period of time in any other EU country. If we limit immigration of EU citizens it is likely that most other EU countries will do the same for us. EU citizens are hugely valuable in this country and by ending the freedom of movement less of these valuable people will either want or have the ability to live in this country.",
        "background": "When Theresa May triggers Article 50 she intends to end the freedom of movement for EU citizens. It is believed she will introduce a cut-off date where EU citizens who come over to this country would not be entitled to live here permanently. ",
