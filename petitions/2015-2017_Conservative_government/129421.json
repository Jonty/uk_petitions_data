        "additional_details": "whilst our military spending rises due to our warmongering and being a puppet state to america our public services are getting no extra funding. for the last couple of years the government said that they will fix the NHS and increase the police force but they have done they have done is decrease the spending. The north welsh armed police have to help Cheshire to cut costs because they don't get enough funding. Only 3000 police were at hand to stop the riot in London 2011,an entire city to cover.",
        "background": "2% of our GDP is spent on our military, a statistic from 2014, that figure has gone done by 0.3% over the last 4 years but our GDP has been rising, meaning more is spent on the military, but public services like the NHS and the police force spending is decreasing.We want more money spent on services",
