Sadly, they are having their futures decided by the older generations, to whom the vote will not affect.\r\n\r\nBy signing this petition, you are allowing the younger generation to decide on their own future.\r\n\r\nSource: 'BBC News: EU referendum: The result in maps and charts'",
        "background": "The EU referendum is a vote for over 18 year olds to decide whether to stay or leave\r\n\r\nThis vote affects the futures of young people, and not the elderly, who are responsible for 60% of leave votes in the 65+ category. This raises the question of: Why shouldn't youths get to decide on their future?",
