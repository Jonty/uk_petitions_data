        "additional_details": "They are from all walks of life but have one thing in common down on luck. I have started siting down and talking to some who I see reguarly over the last year or so. From the ex-soldier with no where to go, to the college student who had quit her course when she became homeless. All tell the same story, living on sofas, looking for a job, 1 night on the street turns into 2 which before long is 367.",
        "background": "When you walk through any city, today you will see numerous homeless people, many of us have probably looked down at them as wasters but if you stop, sit and talk to them you will realise that misguided. The time for action is now, Government needs to give the councils the money to help the homeless",
