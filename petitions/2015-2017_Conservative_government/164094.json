As British citizens, we have as much right to vote on matters regarding OUR future within both our country and Europe! The Scottish youth population were given the right to vote on independence back in 2014, therefore, we should be able to vote on a matter just as big. The UK government owe us this vote, we care about this more than anyone could imagine. ",

This means the world to us, we want control of our future! ",
