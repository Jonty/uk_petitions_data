        "additional_details": "Between 7:30 up until 9:00, most trains are the same, passengers are packed in like sardines, this is a terrible way to have to travel to work after paying for the service. The risk factor is also very high, if a passenger has any issues or serious problems for which they need to exit the train, it would become a difficult task to get around the number of people blocking pathway to the exit.",
        "background": "Each day the peak time trains are crammed full, people are squashed along the carriage, this leaves people hot and claustrophobic during their journey to and from work. It is extremely uncomfortable each day and also very dangerous if a problem was to arise within the carriage.",
