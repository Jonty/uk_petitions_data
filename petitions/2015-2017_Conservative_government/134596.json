        "action": "Hold a General Election by May 2017 to ensure UK not governed by unelected PM",
        "additional_details": "Parliament needs to act to call a General Election before May 2017 to ensure that key decisions are taken with a true mandate. As part of this, no action should be taken by any interim prime minister to activate Article 50 of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty.",
        "background": "During the referendum the Leave campaign continually stressed that a key issue was not wanting to be governed by unelected representatives (even though EU has elected MEPs). Therefore, now there is such key work to be done, we must have a nationally elected Prime Minister, not a nominated one.",
