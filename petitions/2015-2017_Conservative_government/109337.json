        "additional_details": "It is currently believed that nearly 100,000 children are living in temporary accommodation, with 66,980 individuals or families registered as having no home of their own. The waiting list for Social Housing is often several years long, with families forced to pay high rent to private landlords. These high prices leave many families struggling to stretch an already small budget, increasing their need for food banks and financial aid. Our government has a moral obligation to end this. ",
        "background": "The lack of Social, Affordable Housing has reached crisis point, with a generation of children growing up without a safe, stable, permanent home. Right to buy has depleted the amount of social housing available without adequate homes being built to replace them. ",
