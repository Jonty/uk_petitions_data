        "additional_details": "The public should be able to inform parliament if they agree or disagree with a petition. Without this information parliament is unable to take into account all citizens' views.\r\n\r\nBy allowing signatories to agree or disagree with a petition, parliament would be better informed of the general public's view.\r\n\r\nIf this was to be introduced parliament may wish to consider whether the thresholds should remain as they are.",
        "background": "Under the current petition system 10,000 signatures get a response from the Government and 100,000 signatures means the matter is considered for parliamentary debate.\r\n\r\nThose who disagree are unable to indicate this to parliament. This should change, by allowing the public to disagree to a petition",
