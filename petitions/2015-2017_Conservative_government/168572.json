        "additional_details": "I ask this because my daughter\u2019s school believes that the annual school play is to showcase only Y6 children on stage, while it is perfectly justified for Y3, Y4 & Y5 children to be relegated below the stage, on chairs,getting up to sing collectively,for only 8-14 minutes in a 60-70 minutes long production, for 3 successive years, before they are allowed to perform on stage,largely in unsuitable,tasteless plays that validate outdated, objectionable attitudes and behaviours insidiously, in kids.",
        "background": "Introduce a mandatory KS2 theatre arts policy that prevents schools from putting up annual plays that are age inappropriate with adult, sexist humour,that promote jaded stereotypes like flapper girls & have little or no educational merit.Is it fair, for only Y6 to perform on stage & not Y3,Y4 & Y5?",
