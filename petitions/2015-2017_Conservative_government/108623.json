        "additional_details": "Around 600,000 people die every year from passive smoking.\r\nWhy should we have to be murdered by these individuals?! Yes, they have the right to smoke, should they want to kill themselves, but they are also murdering other people if they do this in public. \r\nSmoking should be deemed an archaic activity by now, with our knowledge about the effects of the 'cancer sticks', yet, still, people choose to subject others to the horrid, murderous, odious layer of more than 4000 chemicals.\r\n(BBC News, NHS)",
        "background": "Having to walk behind someone smoking, producing a vile concoction of harmful chemicals, and not being able to pass them or move from the path of the deadly cloud is a terrifying experience. UK citizens should not have to be exposed to this archaic practice, or its devastating effects.",
