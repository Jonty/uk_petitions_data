A new practice direction is expected from the Lord Chief Justice soon. This will provide more guidance for judges about when it will be appropriate to require people to uncover their faces in court. We cannot accept a petition relating to this practice direction, however, because the Lord Chief Justice is independent of both Government and Parliament. If you would like to raise your concern about face coverings in court with the Judicial Office, you can do so by writing to:\r\n\r\nJudicial Office \r\n11th floor, Thomas More Building\r\nRoyal Courts of Justice\r\nStrand\r\nLondon WC2A 2LL\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could start a new petition about face coverings in court which asks for clear and specific action from the Government or Parliament.
