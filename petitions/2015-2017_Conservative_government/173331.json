The programme that looked into this a few years ago, clearly showed the people who work for these sites with books or credit cards ready to purchase the tickets to then sell for massively inflated prices.

They were billed as sites for fans to 'resell' tickets if they could not go, presumably in order to sound less like a tout.",
