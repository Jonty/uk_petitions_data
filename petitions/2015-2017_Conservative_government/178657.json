        "action": "Ban the use of wild animals in circuses in the U.K.",
        "additional_details": "Reasons why a ban is needed :\r\nWild animals do not jump through rings of fire, balance on balls or stand on their front legs voluntarily.\r\nCircuses travel nearly all year round so the complex needs of wild animals can never be adequately met. \r\nMany undercover investigations have revealed evidence of circuses mistreating their animals.",
        "background": "In 2012 the Government made a commitment to ban the use of wild animals in travelling circuses before the end of 2015, it is now 2017 and there is still no ban.\r\nWith 94.5% of the public wanting to see this practice relegated to the history books, is it not time the U.K. followed suit?  \r\n \r\n",
