        "additional_details": "According to the Sexual Offences Act 2003, rape is defined as such\r\n\r\n\"A person (A) commits an offence if\u2014\r\n(a)he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis\r\n(b)B does not consent to the penetration\r\n(c)A does not reasonably believe that B consents.\"\r\n\r\nA woman can only be charged with Sexual Assault or Assault by Penetration, which is wrong and discriminatory. Besides cancelling out male victims, this also completely erases victims of female-on-female rape.",
        "background": "Currently in our country, only men can be legally classed as rapists. By law, women cannot rape. This is wrong and untrue on many levels, and female rapists must be held accountable for their actions. The law must be changed so that both sexes can be convicted equally as they should be. ",
