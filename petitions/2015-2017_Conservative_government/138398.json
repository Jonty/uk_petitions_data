        "additional_details": "To suggest that more than half of the UK voters are uneducated and didn't understand what they were voting for is extremely degrading.\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely nothing racist or xenophobic for being concerned about the pressures on housing, schools, the NHS, our roads, public transport or our country's saftey. \r\n\r\nThe choice to leave wasn't taken lightly. Leave voters were brave, passionate and determined to secure what they believe will be a better future for themselves and their families.",
        "background": "We can't just keep having referendums (on any issue) until people get the results they want.\r\n\r\nIt's a democracy and it was fair. Respect the result and now make it work. We must stand positive, come together to lead by example and show the world that the UK can become a true global player.",
