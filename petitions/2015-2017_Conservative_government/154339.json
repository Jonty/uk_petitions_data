        "additional_details": "EU citizens are currently permitted to vote in Local and European Elections regardless of how long they have been resident and paid taxes for, but have been blocked from voting in Parliamentary Elections. There are many EU citizens who have lived in the UK for longer than 15 years, as are there Briish Citizens who have lived elsewhere in the EU. Both groups were discriminated by not being allowed to vote on their future on June the 23rd 2016 in the Referendum to Remain or Leave the EU.",
        "background": "British citizens who lived in the EU for more than 15 years were not permitted a vote. As such parity should exist for EU citizens who have lived and contributed to British society for more than 15 years.\r\nOn these grounds the referendum to leave the EU should be re-run to allow a fair vote for all.",
