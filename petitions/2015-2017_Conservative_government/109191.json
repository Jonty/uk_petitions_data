There are many 18+ year olds who are not politically educated but are able to vote, and yet there are many 16-17 year olds who ARE politically educated, such as myself, but cannot vote. We want to be able to have a say on who runs our country, and not have our views disregarded simply because we're not deemed old enough to have informed opinions.",

However, apparently we are educated enough to pay taxes? To get married? To start families? To give medical consent? Let us have a say on who runs our country.",
