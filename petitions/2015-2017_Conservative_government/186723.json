        "additional_details": "Rexie came to the UK after a hellish start in Romania.  He was an elderly dog, 14 years old, but in good health.  He had a painful limp due to an earlier break in his leg that had gone untreated.  On his arrival in the UK, his new foster parent took Rexie to her vet to be assessed.  It was decided to amputate his leg after several assessments and x-rays and Rexie came through this operation well.  He adapted to his 3 legs quickly and was able to lead a normal and enjoyable life.",
        "background": "A potential adopter made enquiries to adopt Rexie, a golden retriever, from Safe Rescue, a dog rescue charity. After a homecheck, she collected Rexie on Sat 11 Feb 2017, initially staying in contact with the fosterer to say how well Rexie had settled in.  On Monday Rexie was put to sleep.  ",
