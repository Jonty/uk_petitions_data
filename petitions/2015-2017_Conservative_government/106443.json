        "additional_details": "Every week at least 12 young people die unnecessarily from undiagnosed heart conditions including arrhythmias. This number doesn't include deaths which may have been wrongly attributed to other causes. Many commonly prescribed and over the counter drugs increase the risk of sudden death for those at risk. The agony of loss and grief is enormous and families are left knowing that their loved one's death may have been preventable. A routine ECG goes a long way to helping us protect our families.",
        "background": "Every week at least 12 previously fit and healthy young people die unnecessarily from undiagnosed heart conditions including arrhythmias.  An ECG is recognised as an effective way of identifying young people at risk and should be administered before leaving school.",
