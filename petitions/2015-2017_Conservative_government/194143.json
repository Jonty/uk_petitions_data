That Act reflects the principle that citizenship should be acquired on the basis of a close, current and continuing connection with the UK. \r\n\r\nA person can qualify for naturalisation following a period of lawful residence in the United Kingdom - of three years for spouses and civil partners of British citizens, and five years for others. The residence requirements also specify that the person must be settled in the UK and not have excess absences during their period of residence. \r\n\r\nThey must also: \r\n\u2022\thave sufficient knowledge of English, Welsh or Scottish Gaelic\r\n\u2022\thave sufficient knowledge of life in the United Kingdom\r\n\u2022\tbe of good character.\r\nIn addition, those who are not married to or the civil partner of a British citizen must intend to continue to live in the United Kingdom, or to continue in relevant service overseas, and be settled in the United Kingdom for at least 12 months before applying. \r\n\r\nAs such, there are already provisions in place for Commonwealth citizens who have lived lawfully in the UK for more than five years to acquire British citizenship.\r\n\r\nHome Office",
