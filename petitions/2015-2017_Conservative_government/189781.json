        "additional_details": "Eg,\r\nin 2012 i was ill and fell behind 3 month mortgage payments,on a second property, i sold the house paying off my missed payments in the sale, yet i was put on a delinquent list, this is now on for 6 years, this is ridiculous. the same would apply to a your post grad who made teenage mistakes, and now may have to wait 6 important years of his life to fix.\r\nthere are no ways to resolve these problems early, even criminals in jail can get time off for good behaviour, please review the rules. ",
        "background": "Credit agencies have set rules which can be unfair and damaging to many a young person, punishments can often be more harsh than court rulings,  also trying to sort out a problem is very difficult due to conflict ions between credit companies, and information providers,  \r\ni give one example below.",
