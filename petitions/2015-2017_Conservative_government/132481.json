        "additional_details": "I'm calling on the government to bring in a legislation that serving millitary families do NOT go to the bottom of the NHS waiting lists when they move. \r\nby the time you get the service you NEED you then get a posting order to only start the process again, meaning your at the bottom of the list! Meanwhile it has had a detremental effect in their development.\r\n\r\nput something into place to protect them.  Our families already sacrifice so much, yet recive no support in this matter which is needed. ",
        "background": "My husband is in the military and we found out 2/3 of our children have SEN meaning they need services provided by NHS.\r\n\r\n we waited over a year for services, we finally get seen to then only get posted. We find out this means we go to the bottom of any list! Starting the process all over again.",
