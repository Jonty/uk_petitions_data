        "additional_details": "Following the surprise announcement earlier today (Tuesday April 18th 2017) from the Prime Minister to hold an early general election on Thursday June 8th 2017, No. 10 has said that there will be no TV debates this time around. https://www.channel4.com/news/by/gary-gibbon/blogs/election-2017-no-tv-debates-this-time\r\n\r\nIt's concerning that the Prime Minister is choosing not to hold any this time around; it not only suppresses information on political parties, but shows the PM as afraid of debating.",
        "background": "A great deal of the British electorate rely on the debates to inform themselves and decide who to vote for in the elections; it is imperative that at least one televised debate is held in the runup to the election to give the voting public the opportunity to compare and contrast the major parties.",
