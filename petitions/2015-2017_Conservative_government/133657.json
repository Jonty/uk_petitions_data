        "additional_details": "Overnight, the pound has already dropped 8%, the lowest in 30 years. 3 out of 4 young people who were allowed to vote, voted for remain. Why would we deny access to the vote on an issue that sixteen and seventeen year olds have to live with for possibly 70 years. This is undemocratic and we need change now. ",
        "background": "As of June 24th 2016, the UK voted to leave the EU. However, 16 and 17 year olds were denied the vote and it is clear that these votes would have been vital in the result. So many of us are terrified and we have to live with a mess we didn't get a say in. Lower the voting age to 16.",
