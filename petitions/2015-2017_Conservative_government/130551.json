        "additional_details": "This is all due to lack of education or understanding. The Government should make workplace training about disability mandatory to raise awareness in the whole company. Schools should also have disability training as part of the national curriculum. This could change people\u2019s attitudes towards disability.",
        "background": "Personally due to my own experience, I feel employers need an overview of how disabilities can affect someone. Also when a manager doesn\u2019t know how to deal with someone with health issues, the easy route out is constructive dismissal instead of supporting. ",
