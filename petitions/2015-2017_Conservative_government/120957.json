        "additional_details": "There have been many instances of unequal treatment of travellers passing through UK border controls.  A well known case at Gatwick Airport (as reported in the Daily Telegraph on the 26 Feb 2012) was typical. A passenger who was required to remove his scarf queried why it was that another female passenger who had her face and head completely covered, was not required to remove her head gear. He was then delayed for an hour because of his comments. This is clearly unacceptable",
        "background": "Most travellers are required to remove their outer clothing, shoes, scarves, hats when passing through security at airports to ensure there is no possibility of concealment, yet other passengers are allowed through security with their heads and faces covered. ",
