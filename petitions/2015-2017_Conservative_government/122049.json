        "additional_details": "The channel was closed without proper consideration for the 350,000 person petition presented to the BBC. 90% of content was from the UK with 70% original. All genres were covered and it was a broad, well watched channel considering its broadcast hours were only 1900-0400. The BBC Trust's own consultation found that the 'large majority' were against the switch. 9 million people watched the channel each week. The channel was more popular than E4, ITV2, Dave & even Sky1.",
        "background": "On 16th February 2016, the BBC ceased broadcasting BBC Three on terrestrial television and moved the channel online. Despite a petition of over 350,000 people and open letters from actors, writers & celebrities, the BBC Trust refused to back-down. ",
