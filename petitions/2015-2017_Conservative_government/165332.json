        "action": "Invoke NATO Article 4 consultation on establishing a \"No-Fly\" zone over Syria.",
        "additional_details": "A \"No-Fly\" zone would force the Syrian and Russian regime to take the peace talks seriously, stop the scheduled and intentional murder of innocent civilians and allow for the implementation of much needed humanitarian aid. It would also be an effective first step in allowing Syrian refugees to return home.\r\n\r\nSecondly we respectfully request that her Majesty's government petition the International Tribunal in the Hague to prosecute those who planned, ordered and willingly executed said warcrimes. ",
        "background": "Syrian and Russian airstrikes target civilian population centres, schools and medical centres, weaponising refugees and making living in non government areas untenable. This not only constitutes a warcrime but effectively endangers NATO and EU cohesion, as a planned and desired secondary objective.",
