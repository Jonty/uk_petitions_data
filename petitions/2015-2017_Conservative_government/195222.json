        "additional_details": "To clear this mess up costs \u00a31.50 per square metre or approximately \u00a360m a year.    This cost can be reduced by having chewing gum that will naturally biodegrade quickly fully mitigating the need to clean up as the gum would degrade in the rain, but this requires manufacturers to be responsible, invest in research and change their ingredients and manufacturing process.    \r\n\r\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/14/chewing-gum-manufacturers-should-contribute-towards-cost-clearing/",
        "background": "Pavements, high streets, roads, shopping areas and other public areas are covered in the unsightly stains from trodden in chewing gum.    This not only looks disgusting but is a health hazard, sticks to items of clothing particularly shoes and also sadly to pets paws which causes distress to remove.",
