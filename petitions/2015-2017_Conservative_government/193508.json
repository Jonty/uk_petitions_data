        "additional_details": "School Crossing Patrol Officers or \u201cLollipop\u201d Ladies and Men need to be recognised for the invaluable service they provide in protecting the nation\u2019s children from injury or fatality. At present the School Crossing Patrol is a non-statutory service; and is therefore under attack from local government budget cuts.\r\nThe first duty of government is to keep its citizens safe.  \r\nChildren\u2019s lives should be paramount; therefore, the School Crossing Patrol service should become a statutory requirement.\r\n",
        "background": "As a matter of urgency, the School Crossing Patrol service needs to be put under review by government to ascertain how effective it has been in saving children\u2019s lives for the past 70 years. Until a full debate by parliament has occurred there should be an immediate halt to any cut to this service\r\n",
