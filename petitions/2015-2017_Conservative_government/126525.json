        "additional_details": "The 11 million documents leaked from Mossack Fonseca, Panama, highlight a deep-rooted and corrupt system of global tax-avoidance schemes & shadow banking networks. Proportionally, the richest people in the world are paying less tax than middle and lower-income earners and that is totally unacceptable. Every year, Treasuries across the world are missing billions of pounds in revenue because of these tax-avoidance schemes. It's time to shut down the loopholes & invest the money in public services.",
        "background": "In light of the recent Panama Papers leaks, we demand the government takes urgent steps to:\r\n\r\n1. Shut down ALL tax avoidance loopholes in the UK.\r\n2. Expand HMRC team which investigates tax evasion.\r\n3. Call urgent meeting of G20 countries to thoroughly investigate shadow banking systems. ",
