        "additional_details": "Parliament's position on e-petition 167596 was that \"it is ultimately for businesses to decide what packaging materials they use\".  \r\nThe Government needs to lead from the front.  It took a mandatory 5p charge to achieve the drastic reduction in the use of carrier bags.  \r\nLoose items are cheaper per weight than packaged items.  There is no cost to the consumer in making certain items only available loose.  Where there is a viable argument for wrapping, then recyclable materials should be used.\r\n",
        "background": "Supermarkets sell both loose and packaged fruit and vegetables.  The thin plastic bags used for loose items are recyclable, yet most prepackaged items are in non-recyclable plastic.\r\nThe sale of loose fruit and vegetables must be increased and all other items packaged in recyclable material.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
