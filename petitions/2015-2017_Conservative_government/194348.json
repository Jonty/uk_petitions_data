        "action": "Put in place a percentage figure of \"regular\" attendance at school.",
        "additional_details": "The pressure on head teachers and Local Authorities is too extreme when considering absence requests. It is not fair across England and Wales. It is not fair from one school to another. There should be clear guidelines as to what is regular attendance and if a child's attendance is above that figure then the Head Teacher should have the ability to authorise a leave request.",
        "background": "Recently the Supreme Court found that it is down to the relevant department to set what is classed as regular attendance at school. If this is not 100% (that is perfect attendance) then what is Parliaments interpretation of regular? A figure should be put in place to prevent confusion in future.",
