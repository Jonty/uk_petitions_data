        "additional_details": "This amounts to intrusive and dangerous State censorship of legal content online.\r\n\r\nWhile the Government may claim that the aim is solely to protect children from viewing adult content, the reality is that these measures are unnecessary - when ISPs already provide optional filters for such content, bring severe privacy risks, and establish the precedent and framework to allow the Government to censor legal online content of which it simply does not approve.\r\n\r\nThese measures must be rejected.",
        "background": "The Digital Economy Bill has passed its third reading in the Commons. It includes measures to force Internet Service Providers to block pornographic websites which don't verify the age of users via intrusive means, and to censor legal content depicting sexual acts classified \"non-conventional\".",
