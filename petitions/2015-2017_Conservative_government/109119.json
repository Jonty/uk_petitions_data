        "action": "Governor to hold inquiry into the prosecution of child sex abuse in Montserrat. ",
        "additional_details": "I and many others have been victims of this very crime while attending secondary school on island, but nothing was ever done to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice. No one believed us, or nothing was done, because the offender may have held a position of power within the small community, etc. There are several other victims who are now speaking out because of a current charge against a known offender on island. It is time this abuse stops and our children are protected. ",
        "background": "In the small dependent territory, Montserrat, sexual abuse of children (girls and boys) by adult males are not been prosecuted due to either police, or those in authority being too familiar with the offender, or parents of children being paid to keep the crime a secret, thus destroying young lives.",
