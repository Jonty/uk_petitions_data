        "additional_details": "Potential new recruits, who have all the skills, including good English and maths, to be excellent Early Years Educators, will be barred from the sector. Its only a matter of time before we do not have the practitioners to fill the much needed roles which will have catastrophic impact on the Early Years sector, and in turn on parents and children. 30 hours free Child care is on its way.",
        "background": "I am concerned that in 2014, the government altered the requirements for those taking Level 3 in EYE and now, all Level 3 EYE's must have at least a C grade in GCSE English and maths to count in the ratios - with equitable alternatives such as Functional Skills no longer considered as an option.
