        "additional_details": "Action needs to be taken on this issue as individuals do become suicidal due to the lack of support from authorities and police. It is not widely documented how much of an effect anti-social and noisy neighbours can have on people. While environmental services can investigate the issue, this can take a long time and people get desperate. The police need powers to tackle the situation right there and then. If their music is too loud, seize the equipment instantly. Harassment, take them into custody.",
        "background": "On two occasions now, my family have been victim to noisy neighbours, playing music and shouting throughout the night. The severity of this needs to be addressed and police need to be given powers to immediately seize equipment or enforce other methods to give the victim some respite.",
