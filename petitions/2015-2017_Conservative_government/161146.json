        "action": "Standardise travel and holiday prices across school term and non-term time",
        "additional_details": "It is clear, following the recent petition for the govenment to reassess its position on authorised and unauthorised absence from school, that the stance is strong and that the figures are certainly moving in the right direction in terms of attendance and academic performance. The only anomaly is the cost prohibitive nature of holidays when in the school holidays. This  motion understands that school attendance is paramount but asks that holiday prices are regulated and standardised further.  ",
        "background": "This petition calls for the government to request that relevant trade bodies in the travel and tourism sector standardise their pricing across term and non-term time holidays in an effort to minimise unauthorised absence from school and also the potential levels of requests for authorised absence.",
