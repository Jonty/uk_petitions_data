        "additional_details": "The UK is facing multiple crises at once - Brexit, Northern Ireland, Scotland, social care, and so on. In the face of these huge challenges, campaigning for money to be diverted to buying a royal yacht is a frivilous gesture. The money would be much better spent on directly addressing those crisis.\r\n\r\nSources - http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/11/spend-some-of-the-millions-from-the-aid-budget-on-a-new-royal-ya/ \r\nhttps://twitter.com/christopherhope/status/841367111104626688",
        "background": "Since Theresa May took office, senior Conservative MPs and ministers - including the Foreign Secretary - have advocated for a new royal yacht to be purchased. We believe this would be a waste of taxpayers' money, and that the government should focus on more important issues facing the UK.",
