        "additional_details": "The British People took power on whether we wanted to leave the EU in the June 2016 referendum, we have now become the silent voice in the debate over the terms of our departure. \r\n\r\nThis petition is about ensuring that after having made the decision, the British people continue to be consulted on the type of future they want for their country. \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Since Britain voted to leave the EU we have heard from politicians, the media, and industry on their wants from future negotiations. \r\n\r\nA responsible Government should immediately begin a public consultation with the people to ensure their views are heard as part of any future negotiations. \r\n",
