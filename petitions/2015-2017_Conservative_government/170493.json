Training is 3 hours a week on minimum wage before the actual job starts, leaving people with no money. More discrimination here because if an interpreter was not required, a person can claim ESA during training as they are not working enough hours per week to come off it. \r\n\r\nI want to make an official complaint via email and receive a quick response but the DWP only provide telephone numbers.
