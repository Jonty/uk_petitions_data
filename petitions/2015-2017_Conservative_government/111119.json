So a change needs to happen to help protect an individuals personal data when a loss or theft occurs.\r\n\r\nWhat is personal data?\r\n\r\nPersonal data means data which can identify an individual, for example, your name, address or account details..., the Data Protection Act (DPA) 1998, describes it as \"...data which relate to a living individual who can be identified - (a) from those data...\"",
