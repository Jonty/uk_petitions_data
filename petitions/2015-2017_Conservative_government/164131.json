We should use the British Construction Industry to create the Severn Tidal Barrage to harness wind, wave, solar energy and generate reliable and predictable Tidal Energy to provide 7% of UK future energy requirements. Instead of the biggest Energy White Elephant we can build a Green Energy Giant.\r\nhttps://youtu.be/OJ3eA5AaHos\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severn_Barrage",
