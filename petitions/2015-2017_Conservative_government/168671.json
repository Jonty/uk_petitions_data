        "action": "Preserve current opt-outs should the UK decide to rejoin the EU in the future.",
        "additional_details": "Opt-outs are when EU Member States decide not to participate in European legislation or treaties. As a member since 1973, the UK opted out of both the Euro and the Schengen Agreement on passport-free movement of people. However, countries wishing to join in future may not opt out of such agreements permanently. Therefore, preserving current opt-outs for a future British application to rejoin the EU would make the terms of future membership more favourable. ",
        "background": "The UK's recent vote to leave the EU saw young people vote overwhelmingly to remain, making it possible that future public opinion will favour rejoining. To make this process smoother we hereby call upon the government to preserve the UK's current opt-outs for potential future membership. ",
