        "additional_details": "Davies has a voting record that opposes sex and gender equality in law. By presenting the views he has he has clearly shown he will not be equally representing half of his constituents as it is counter to his view to afford them equality. He should therefore no longer serve as a member of parliament and the Conservative party should withdraw their support from him and call for his resignation ",
        "background": "Philip Davies MP has clearly demonstrated he is not able to represent his constituents fairly with his speech to the international conference on Men's issues. 1/2 of his constituency are women and if he demonstrably does not believe in equality he will not be representing them equally in parliament ",
