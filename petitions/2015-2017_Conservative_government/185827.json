        "action": "Ensure the British fishing waters are returned to the UK post Brexit",
        "additional_details": "Much of the EU referendum was based on the idea of reclaiming the fish stocks in British waters. It became a key aspect of sovereignty. It would be an absolute failure for the government and parliament to allow the CFP to continue when the chance to rebuild the coastal fishing communities of Britain are so close.",
        "background": "In the 1970s Edward Heath betrayed our fisherman and our coastal communities with the Common Fisheries Policy. A leaked report now shows that the EU wants to retain control over the fish stocks in British waters.\r\nWe call on Parliament to ensure these waters and fish stocks return to Britain",
