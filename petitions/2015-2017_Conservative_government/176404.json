        "additional_details": "The U.K. gives 12 billion pounds a year (0.7% GNI - source BBC - 2015) in overseas aid. I am not suggesting that this is stopped, only that as cancer is now so prevalent in our country ( one in two people are now affected - my husband's consultant quoted this) that temporarily this money is used to help the people in need in this country. Walk down the main corridor at The Christie (cancer specialist hospital) in Manchester at 9.00 am on any weekday to see how many people have this illness, and this is only one example of a hospital in the UK.",
        "background": "One in two people are now affected by cancer. Since 2010 six of my relatives/ friends have died from cancer. Eight people I know currently have cancer, two with terminal cancer. A close relative is one of the two.",
