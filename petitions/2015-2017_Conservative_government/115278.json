        "additional_details": "World War I was regarded as the \"war to end all wars\" as it was believed there could never be another global conflict of such magnitude. World War II proved that to be false. The Cold War and the adoption of nuclear weapons, the possibility of a third global conflict became possible. \r\nRecent events around the world are significantly increasing the chance of either a mistake, error of judgement or desperate measures.  WW3 is quite survivable but the public need Government support. \r\n\r\n ",
        "background": "We must acknowledge the fact the end of the Cold War only brought a temporary reduction of the risk of Nuclear War. It is essential to reinstate an active media driven Civil Defence plan in case of the unthinkable.  Emergency planners must also make suitable preparation - just in case. ",
