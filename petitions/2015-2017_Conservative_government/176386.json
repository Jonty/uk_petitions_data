        "action": "Keep the UK a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights",
        "additional_details": "The ECHR gives you the freedom from torture, slavery, discrimination and gives you the freedom to life, liberty and security, freedom of expression, association, thought, conscience and religion. Many of the fundamental freedoms we enjoy today in the UK is because of the lawyers in the 1950s who wrote this convention. This is what defines the UK as separate from other authoritarian regimes. \r\nIt's vital we put public pressure on Theresa May to not pull us out of the ECHR - no good can come of it.",
        "background": "It has been revealed that Theresa May has plans to remove the UK from the ECHR, a convention designed by British lawyers after WW2 to ensure that atrocities like the Holocaust could never happen again on European soil. The Convention IS NOT the European Human Rights Act, and is not part of the EU.",
