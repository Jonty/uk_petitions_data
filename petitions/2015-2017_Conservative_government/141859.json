        "additional_details": "Now that the British people have voted to leave the EU, the official Vote Leave campaign are backtracking. \u00a3350 million a week will not be spent on the NHS. Daniel Hannan wants to maintain 'free movement of labour' with the EU. Douglas Carswell has stated that Nigel Farage wasn't part of the official Vote Leave campaign so cannot be involved in the negotiations. This is not the time for petty bickering. We need a cross-party team, INCLUDING Nigel - not a team of Tory chums stitching us all up. ",
        "background": "Nigel Farage has fought with determination and conviction for the UK to exit the EU for 25 years. Now that the British people have spoken, it is imperative that he is included in the exit negotiations. This is a cross-party issue and Nigel represents 4 million UKIP voters. Douglas Carswell does not.",
