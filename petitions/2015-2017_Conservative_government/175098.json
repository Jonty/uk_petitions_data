        "action": "Build a Train Station at the Terminal Building of Cardiff International Airport",
        "additional_details": "Many people in Wales feel that the airport is not within easy reach of the general public unless they have access to a private vehicle. The remote station in the village of Rhoose is an impractical substitute, and straightforward, competitive alternatives are limited.\r\n\r\nThis affects local passengers as well as visitors.\r\n\r\nRail infrastructure is not currently devolved to the Welsh Gov\u2019t, and any new stations would be a decision for the UK Gov\u2019t & Network Rail.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call on the Government to implement the above, accordingly intersecting the railway line which runs adjacent to the airport, and urge the relevant train operators to incorporate it into their regular timetables.\r\n\r\nCardiff Airport is in need of investment in order for it to grow.",
