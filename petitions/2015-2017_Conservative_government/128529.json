        "action": "Give 100% tax relief on pensions when care home costs exceed the pension income.",
        "additional_details": "There was a plan to cap the care costs but that has now been scrapped.  In any case it was not a true and honest capping but a sneaky way to make political capital out of addressing care costs without actually spending any money.  It would have benefited only a tiny minority. To allow large corporates to pay paltry amounts of tax whilst levying income tax on pensions paid to paupers is morally and ethically wrong and we should address this totally unjust state of affairs.",
        "background": "My elderly mother-in-law has Alzheimers Dementia and lives in a care home. Total pension income is around \u00a316K PA.  Total care home costs are \u00a333K and rising.  Why is it necessary to pay several thousand pounds income tax which erodes the reserves faster and will lead to her needing government help?",
