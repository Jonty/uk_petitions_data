        "additional_details": "Linking tax income with health and care spending would give people the opportunity to see how their money is being spent, and allow a legitimate debate about what is an appropriate level of taxation required to ensure a sustainable funding settlement for the NHS and social care system in the years to come. \r\n\r\nThe Treasury has estimated that a 1p rise in income tax would raise \u00a33.9bn this year, rising to \u00a34.5bn next year and then \u00a34.6bn in 2018-19. Without major reforms to how care is provided, the NHS in England is facing a \u00a322bn gap in its finances by 2020-21.\r\n",
        "background": "The truth is that the UK is falling further behind other European countries in how much is spent on health. It is time to examine a dedicated ringfenced health and care tax.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury has estimated that a 1p rise in income tax would raise \u00a33.9bn this year, rising to \u00a34.5bn the year after.
