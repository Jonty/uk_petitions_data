        "additional_details": "This renders the scheme technically useless to those that need it most - budding homeowners unable to get onto the property ladder due to the large deposit required.\r\n\r\nGeorge Osborne last year, promised to provide \u201cdirect government support to anyone saving for the deposit on their first home\u201d.This was a clear misrepresentation. \r\n\r\nThe excuse of the government is that some purchases fall through. The simple answer is for a solicitor to give an undertaking to send the money back if this happens.",
        "background": "It has recently come to light that the 25% bonus available under the government's Help To Buy ISA cannot be used towards a deposit and instead is only granted once the house purchase is completed. The scheme has been widely misrepresented as a product to help first time buyers save for a deposit.",
