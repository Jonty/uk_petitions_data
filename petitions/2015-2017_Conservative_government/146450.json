        "additional_details": "Political parties are split, communities are split, the referendum vote split the country more or less in half and regions differ markedly in their preference. Party politics will risk more division. Politicians need to work together, seek ways forward that are non-divisive and are as fair and inclusive as possible to all views and social status. The basis of using the 2015 election as a basis is chosen as the closest recent evidence of the views of the population as a whole.    ",
        "background": "A Government of National Unity, based upon the votes cast in the 2015 General Election, needs to be formed to serve until May 2020. This government should employ the best talents on a non party political basis to take the country forward and further the healing of the deep divisions in our society. ",
