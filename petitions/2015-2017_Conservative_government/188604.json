        "additional_details": "Many politicians have won a prize for enforcing the Kalergi plan since the 1950's.  These include Tony Blair, Bill Clinton and Angela Merkel plus EU elites such as Donald Tusk and Herman Van Rompuy.\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne_Prize\r\n\r\nThey all have one thing in common they helped to expand the EU and/or allowed uncontrolled mass migration. It was even in the speech of Angela Merkel during her acceptance speech that the EU should be the model for other regions of the world.",
        "background": "Kalergi described his dreams for a One World Government with its foundations in the European Union. He hoped that the European project would go on to become the blueprint for a society run entirely by the global elite over a powerless population. He would achieve this by uncontrolled mass migration.",
