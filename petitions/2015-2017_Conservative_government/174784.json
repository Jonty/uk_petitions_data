The outcome was a shock to all political parties and big business alike. Since the referendum there has been continual propaganda and manouverings by certain \"interested parties', business and MPs alike. Their aim is to ignore the wishes of the UK voters. Using Parliamentry democracy to do this shows that this form of democracy is now not fit for purpose.",

The present widespread belief that MPs are self seeking and controlled by big business shows that the country as a whole has little confidence in the present system.
