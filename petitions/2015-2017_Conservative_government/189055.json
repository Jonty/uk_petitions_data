The only way China and other country's will take any action to reduce this unscrupulous cruel farming is if they are penalised. By buying goods from these country's, we condone how they do business. I do NOT and I want my Country to act in the name of compassion! ",

They are beaten and skinned alive and yet Britain is happy to continue trade dealing with a country with such an appaulling animal welfare record.
