        "action": "Take action against France for enforcing the Burkini ban",
        "additional_details": "The Burkini enables women who wish to cover their bodies access to beaches and public spaces. The wearing of the outfit is completely unrelated to the attacks carried out against France. We feel that the Burkini ban infringes on women's freedom to access public spaces and to wear what they desire. The burkini ban also goes against the UDHR (Universal Declaration of Human Rights). \r\nWe urge the British government to advise the French government to seriously reconsider the ban on Burkinis. ",
        "background": "The Burkini is a full body Swimsuit which covers everything apart from the face, feet and hands. So far authorities in 15 French towns have banned the wearing of Burkinis following completely unrelated terrorist attacks. \r\n",
