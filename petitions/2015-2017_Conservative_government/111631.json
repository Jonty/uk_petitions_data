        "additional_details": "It's evident from little pop up shops arriving as early as September, licensing would go some way to helping and it should be a criminal act to set fireworks off unless at an organised display, they are used as weapons and contribute to anti social behaviour and if only used at organised events would help to cut the numerous calls to the emergency services, fire, ambulance and police which waste resources, this wastefulness could be cut by acting now ",
        "background": "Every year war veterans affected by PTSD are affected by the random and frequent setting off of fireworks, some have even had fireworks thrown at them!! This is disgusting, fireworks also affect our pets and are used as weapons, it's about time we acted, fireworks should only be at organised events.",
