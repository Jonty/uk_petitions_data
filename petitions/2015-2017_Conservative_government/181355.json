        "action": "Make anti homeless spikes and other measures of equal effect illegal",
        "additional_details": "We have to transition from criminalising poverty, to criminalising behaviour that punishes poverty. The government's lack of action in tackling the problem has led to establishments assuming responsibility and taking measures such as these spikes. Parliament however must act in not furthering the suffering of those living through difficult circumstances. In certain instances individuals have frozen to death and these spikes have forced the displaced to sleep in lethal conditions.",
        "background": "\"Anti homeless spikes\" have been used in public places, especially outside businesses, to prevent those without a home from sleeping there. It is an inhumane means of dealing with the issue and to subject them to further inconvenience, deprives those living in extreme poverty of any dignity.  ",
