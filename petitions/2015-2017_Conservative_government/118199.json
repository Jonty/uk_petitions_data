        "additional_details": "Childhood obesity figures are the highest they have ever been so all children should be supported to do exercise. Children with poor sight are being discriminated against. Prescription swimming goggles cost from \u00a325, prescription sports goggles from \u00a375 and contact lenses from \u00a315 a month. Low income families can not afford this.",
        "background": "Children who wear glasses get no financial support for prescription sports goggles. Children who swim or do contact sports have to participate without glasses which can be dangerous and limits their participation in some sports.",
