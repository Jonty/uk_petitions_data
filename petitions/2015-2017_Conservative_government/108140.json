        "additional_details": "After reading yet another report in the papers about a student being sent home for an \"Extreme\" haircut, and thus being denied eductation for the time spent outside of school until the hair grows out of the style. Covering it was deemed insufficient, as the style still remained beneath the bandana she wore. The School demands she cuts her hair to conform to their uniform policy. They are saying she doesnt have control of her own body, and must do as they ask to be educated. (A Basic human right)",
        "background": "The ability for schools to stifle the individuality of a student should be removed. A student must wear a Uniform under school rules, which is acceptable for monitoring the abscence or attendance of students within school grounds, however, this shouldn't apply to decisions about their own bodies.",
