Petitions need to call on the Government or Parliament to take a specific action.\r\n\r\nIn any case, we cannot accept petitions regarding criminal investigations or prosecutions, because the police and Director for Public Prosecutions are operationally independent.\r\n\r\nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission, not the Government or Parliament, conducts independent investigations of the police. You can find out more about the IPCC, including how to make a complaint, here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ipcc.gov.uk/complaints\r\n\r\nThe Government and Parliament are also not responsible for releasing people from prison. You could ask the Government to advise the Monarch to exercise the prerogative of mercy."
