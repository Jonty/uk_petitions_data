I looked at the selling websites to show how much people are selling tickets for:\r\n\r\nGumtree: 2 x tickets in Dublin for \u00a32,000\r\nSeatwave: 1 x ticket in Glasgow, ranging from \u00a3190-\u00a3515\r\nGetMeIn: 1 x ticket in Manchester, ranging from \u00a3132-\u00a3550\r\n\r\nPeople are not getting the opportunity to go to an event due to ticket touts making it impossible to buy. It needs to be made illegal for any profit to be made. \r\n",
