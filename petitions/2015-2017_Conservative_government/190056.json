        "additional_details": "Both India and Pakistan are this year celebrating the 70th anniversary of independence. Pakistan and Britain have a much stronger historical bond than India, as Pakistan has always been an ally of UK. A unique fact is Her Majesty was once the Queen of Pakistan. There are 2million British Pakistani tax payers in UK. In the interest and fairness of justice, no one single country or community should be given preference over any other community.",
