        "additional_details": "I have written to MPs who, after enquiring, have come back to me saying that glucose tablets cannot be prescribed at present. The cost soon mounts up, which for families on a low income could mean missing out on certain things in order to provide this life saving 'medicine' \u2012 especially if there is more than 1 Diabetic in the family.\r\n\r\nThis all reminds me of a situation we had years ago when drug addicts were given syringes and needles on prescription BEFORE Diabetics were allowed to have them!",
        "background": "When a Diabetic has a low blood sugar level they need to consume glucose to stop the progression to unconsciousness and possibly death. Glucose powder is on prescription, but has to be mixed with a drink before use, which may not be possible in emergencies. Tablets are ready to use at once.",
