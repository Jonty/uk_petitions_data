        "additional_details": "Cars currently being sold are being purchased by most people who are trying to keep the cost down by purchasing cars with a low tax band e.g a car that currently cost between \u00a30 and \u00a330 a year will now either be free or \u00a3140 a year. This is a big increase from what people have agreed to when they made the car purchase. With this increase it will put people's lively hood in danger of being unable to afford the running of the vehicle or increase the chances of being fined.",
        "background": "I understand that prices go up but for them in some circumstances are going up by more than double. This means that people who already just about get by will now struggle even more so with the hike in prices.",
