This is the \"shortest day\" and should be considered the middle of winter.\r\nThe astronomical definition of winter should CENTRE around the winter solstace rather than beginning on that date.  \r\nStarting winter towards the end of December is clearly detrimental to our sanity.  \r\n",
        "background": "The official astronomical winter is defined as the winter solstice until the spring equinox.  That means that even half way through December it is classed as Autumn.  This is clearly stupid.",
