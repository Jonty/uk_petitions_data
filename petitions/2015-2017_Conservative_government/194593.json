        "additional_details": "The recent Supreme Court judgement in the case of IoW v Jon Platt upholds government inflexibility about holiday fines. However, it is based on faulty logic - recent analysis of data suggests that, a holiday absence can improve a child's performance, not diminish it as the DfE suggests (www.fullfact.org). There is uneven coverage nationally, with some authorities refusing to issue fines and the system criminalises many of our poorer parents. It is unfair and socially exclusive (Hansard 19/5/16).",
        "background": "Fining parents for taking a child on holiday in term time without any allowance for circumstance is morally wrong. It is also wasteful of school resources and court time. By allowing parents up to five-days' holiday leave when their child has at least 90% attendance will simplify matters for all. ",
