I'm sure anyone looking at this petition will have support... Just look at his views and words he has spoken about the Armed Forces, our veterans, immigration in its masses and many many more!",
        "background": "Jeremy Corbyn is making a complete mochary of Parliament, let alone the Labour Party. To be perfectly honest it seems that he's just a deluded man that is purposely making decisions and motions that are the exact opposite of the Party in power just to stir and cause uproar around sensitive issues.",
