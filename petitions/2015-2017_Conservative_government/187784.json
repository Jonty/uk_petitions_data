        "action": "Introduce politics as a compulsory subject in NI secondary schools",
        "additional_details": "Following eight months since the previous election, the political system in NI is in turmoil, with another snap election having been called. This is hurting the country's recent economic strives and putting the political institutions in NI at risk of collapse. In order to achieve political stability and economic progress, it is essential that we must end the 'fear politics' used on the electorate. Voters must be informed on policy and the institutions to stop being fuelled by scare mongering.",
        "background": "In Northern Ireland there is a culture of tactical voting when it comes to assembly elections. This is halting the peace process and holding us back from political progress. NI students should be educated on the institutions and political parties to encourage political change in NI.\r\n",
