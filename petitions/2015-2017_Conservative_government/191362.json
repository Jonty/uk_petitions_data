        "additional_details": "This is especially a problem for the elderly who either do not understand comparison sites or do not have access to the internet in the first place. A personal example which concerned my elderly parents was their current energy supplier increased their monthly DD from \u00a380 to \u00a3120pm. I stepped in to compare the market and they are now on a \u00a360pm tariff. I have to again review this in July. If you are with a supplier they should automatically be responsible to provide the best tariff for all ages.",
        "background": "Petition for ALL energy companies to automatically recommend or switch ALL bill payers onto the most cost effective tarrif. Picking the right tarrif nowadays is the responsibility of the bill payer. You have to compare the market ongoing or you are on standard high cost tariff. ",
