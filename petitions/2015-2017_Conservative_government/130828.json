        "additional_details": "For years all of our NHS staff have been underpaid and overworked. Over this time have seen first hand the decline in the quality of care we as patients recieve, as a direct result of your government. \r\n\r\nPut simply, if you see a person sat on bridge crying desperately, do you go over to them, offer to take them for a nice warm cup of tea? Or do you ignore them, and, walk away? I put it to you that you walked up to our NHS, and continued to push them off that bridge.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nThe Patients.",
        "background": "After hearing, and, seeing the opinions of Politicians, and, the National Health Service. I come to you as a concerned member of the British Public, to call for the Resignation of Jeremy Hunt MP, and, for the NHS to be provided with the Support THEY actually need, rather than the Governments scraps.",
