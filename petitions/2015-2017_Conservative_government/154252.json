        "additional_details": "Today, it is not clear where things will end up, but the position is much more clear.\r\nGiven the importance of this decision, the result is not as conclusive as it probably needs to be.\r\nIn Europe it is clear that there is a significant movement that believes that there needs to be a rethink about where Europe is going.\r\n\r\nBefore invoking article 50, it would be very wise and prudent to be sure that NO really is the will of the people.\r\nYes, there will be a cost, but we need to be absolutely sure.\r\n",
        "background": "It is now very clear that probably many people voted without the real facts. It appears that many of the claims made by the leave campaign will not be able to be delivered.\r\nOn the remain side, we were bombarded with the same inane drivel, without real substance and with little credibility.",
