        "action": "Say no to cuts to local government services",
        "additional_details": "The cuts to local government are serious and will cut vital funding from local services, especially social care. Despite the extra social care fund that comes from increasing council tax by 2%, this is not enough to meet the growing demands on local councils. This policy of cuts will hurt local councils and therefore local people, especially the most vulnerable who rely heavily on local government services.",
        "background": "Councils are currently half way through a scheduled 40 per cent cut in funding from central government. As a result of these cuts councils in many areas will not have enough money to meet all their statutory responsibilities.",
