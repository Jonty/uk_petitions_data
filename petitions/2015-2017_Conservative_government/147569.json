        "additional_details": "To stabilise our governance;\r\n1. Reform government by dissolving all political parties. \r\n2. Maintain elected MP's to serve their constituencies and propose a new Prime Minister for a general election.  \r\n3. Remove M.P's from all ministerial posts. Employ 'experts in their field' to hold all cabinet posts and with evidence based facts, to advise the government in the best interest of all citizens and our country, not from any party political affiliation.  \r\n4. Introduce proportional representation.",
        "background": "The UK government is no longer serving the best interests of  the country and our society effectively. \r\n\r\nWe can create a more progressive form of government for the 21st century that serves its citizens instead of divisive party political interests or personal political ambitions.",
