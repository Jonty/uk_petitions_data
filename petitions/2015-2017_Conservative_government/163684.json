        "action": "Offer discounted counselling to housing professionals.",
        "additional_details": "Due to the implementation of reforms such as the benefit cap and universal credit, the already emotionally draining work of housing professionals is becoming more demanding daily. We must now delve deeper into the lives of our customers and often discover horrific issues such as domestic abuse, child sexual exploitation and even dead bodies in our properties.\r\nTo help our customers through these issues we must become heavily involved and yet many are not receiving the emotional support necessary.",
        "background": "The world of social housing is changing drastically. Everyday, housing professionals are presented with greater challenges due to welfare reform. While we are told to advocate greater mental health awareness, little or nothing is being done to protect those who work with most vulnerable in society.",
