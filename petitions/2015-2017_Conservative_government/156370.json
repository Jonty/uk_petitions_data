        "action": "Urgently hold a referendum about invoking Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon",
        "additional_details": "It was very hard for people to predict and understand exactly how their referendum vote could affect, let alone damage, their country, family and community. Where politics, economics, and finance converged, no one could convincingly forecast the events that have unfolded since 23 June 2016. Sometimes, you need to live with the results of a decision to know you would like a chance to reconsider. \r\n\r\nA referendum on invoking Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon offers that opportunity. ",
        "background": "\"Brexit\" needn't be final. Before Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon is invoked, a second referendum is urgently needed. In the light of recent events, the British people deserve the chance to re-examine if they are certain they want to leave the European Union, whatever the outcome for Britain. ",
