        "additional_details": "The Scottish referendum exhibited the impressive amount of political knowledge and interest held by 16-17 year olds which is shared by many of their peers throughout the UK.  Among other things, 16-17 year olds can get married and pay tax so therefore their input on an issue as important as the UK\u2019s membership of the EU is of vital importance.                                                                                                  ",
        "background": "The outcome of the EU referendum will arguably have the largest impact on 16 and 17 year olds, therefore they should be allowed to vote in it. It should be highlighted however, that this petition is not requesting that 16-17 year olds be given the vote in other votes/election or referendums.",
