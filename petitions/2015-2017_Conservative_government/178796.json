        "additional_details": "Over 100,000 attended the women's march in London- one of the biggest protests since the Iraq war.\r\nIn Leeds there were three protests against Trump's fascism over two days, with thousands marching.\r\nThis speaks volumes about what the people of this country want, and it's definitely not a \"special relationship\" with a fascist.\r\nI wholeheartedly believe that severing our ties with US is the only way to show true solidarity to those suffering because of Trump's presidency. Please don't disappoint us.",
        "background": "We must condemn the racism, sexism, xenophobia, scapegoating and blatant disrespect Trump shows towards towards Muslims in particular.\r\nSince Trump's inauguration he's signed away women's reproductive rights, approved the DAPL and banned citizens of seven different countries from getting US visas.",
