        "additional_details": "Mr Cameron can decide when to invoke Article 50, which is the formal notification to the EU of Britain\u2019s decision to leave. The European Parliament's chief has called on Cameron to begin formal proceedings to leave the EU as early as Tuesday when leaders are due to meet in Brussels.\r\n\r\nHe has said in the past that he would have to trigger it immediately after a vote for Leave. On Saturday, the EU founding states called on Britain to \"urgently\" trigger Article 50 and begin the process of departure.",
        "background": "David Cameron called the EU referendum as part of his 2015 General Election manifesto, therefore he should be the Prime Minister to immediately invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and begin the formal process of withdrawal from the EU.\r\n\r\nThe EU referendum result was clear and should be final.",
