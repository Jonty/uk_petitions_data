        "additional_details": "My dad passed away last year, all we saw was his distress at constantly been told how long he had to live! Why keep drilling it in? He knew he didn't have long, he didn't need reminding daily. This caused him not to eat, and he could not enjoy the last bit of time he had, he was inconsolable. Let people who are nearing their end of life do so with dignity, and not be reminded all the time. Family should be consulted more, and they can decide what the  patient needs to hear",
        "background": "End of life care is very distressing and no one wants to hear it, however I think it's unnecessary to keep mentioning it to the patient whom will already be distressed about their upcoming death. I feel it causes unwanted stress",
