        "additional_details": "This petition was prompted by the response to a recent petition, \"Prevent Donald Trump from making a State Visit to the United Kingdom.\" The petition has, at time of writing, received  1,858,279 signatures. The response from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office can be viewed here: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/171928 \r\n\r\nThis response is not only blatantly dismissive, but is also grounded in a dubious and contestable \"relationship\" that must be argued for, not merely asserted. ",
        "background": "Many British citizens/UK residents sign serious petitions to HM Government, only to be knocked back with responses that smack of \"shut up, pleb, we know best!\" Such responses are disrespectful and negate the point of petitions. Either take petitions seriously or do away with this charade. ",

You could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. You could, for example, start a new petition asking for the UK Government to implement requests made by petitions with a certain number of signatures. \r\n\r\nYou will be aware that the Petitions Committee, which is independent from the Government, scheduled a debate on the petition about President Trump's state visit on Monday 20 February. Petitions and petition debates can help raise awareness of issues as part of a wider campaign.
