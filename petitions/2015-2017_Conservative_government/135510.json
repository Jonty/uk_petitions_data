        "additional_details": "the outcome of the referendum was very close , I wonder how many people were swayed by the pledge of \u00a3350 million pounds to spend on the ailing NHS? Already today the very day of victory I have heard leave campaigners distancing themselves from this commitment. Nigel Farrage said he would not have made it, and other in interviews are distancing themselves from it. I call for it to be enacted in full , or the referendum to be rerun in a spirit of honesty.",
        "background": "The very day the referendum was called I was given a leave leaflet describing how only a leave vote could save the NHS , and a saving of 350 million a week from EU exit would allow the uk to spend 350 million in savings on the NHS. This pledge was carried right through the campaign and MUST be done ",
