        "additional_details": "Tax credits do not currently cover all childcare costs for working parents on low incomes, or provide any support unless a minimum of 16 hours are worked per week. Childcare costs cannot be claimed for a future date and payments can take up to 4 weeks. Since the majority of families are reliant on their weekly child/working tax credits to live on, this leaves many working parents unable to pay for their childcare. This needs to change and fast! Parents want to work but the system is stopping us!",
        "background": "As a working parent I have no choice but to quit working soon if the tax credits childcare system doesn't change. Every school holiday is a dreaded worry! Holiday clubs want advanced payment, yet you can't claim for future dates! A wait of up to four weeks for childcare payments makes it impossible!",
