This national guidance is applied at a more local level by Councils who form area specific policies and proposals that reflect the broad guidance of the NPPF, but with more locally specific detail. \r\n\r\nIn Cornwall the main policy document is the adopted Cornwall Local Plan, which aims to control and influence the use of land in the public interest by identifying areas where development can and cannot take place.\r\nMore information can be found here:\r\nhttps://www.cornwall.gov.uk/environment-and-planning/planning/planning-policy/adopted-plans/\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not clear what action you would like the Government to take, since a Cornwall Local Plan already exists."
