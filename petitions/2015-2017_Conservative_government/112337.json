She is recovering but why do our pets and other animal need to go through this\r\n It's not just on Nov 5th but weeks before and after and people are irresponsible and don't think of the impact of what they are doing. More people going to official displays will make more money for local groups and save animals from the fear",
        "background": "More and more people are setting off fireworks in their back gardens without thinking of the impact on wildlife and people's pets. This year our dogs and many others have been badly affected by fireworks not to mention other wildlife. There is no need when there are organised displays",
