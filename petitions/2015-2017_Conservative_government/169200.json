        "additional_details": "I am most worried about the 250,000 with severe (uncontrollable) asthma. It's thought they make up more than half of asthma deaths. Costs of their treatments can be considerable - they often need powerful steroid tablets and antibiotics.\r\n\r\nEmergency hospital admissions for adults are estimated to cost the NHS \u00a361\u2009million a year and many relate to poor asthma control. \r\n\r\nBetter access to medicines keeps people healthy, out of hospital and working. \r\n\r\nThose who manage the budget always look to save money, but charging asthma patients for prescriptions is a back-to-front and morally questionable way to do it.",
