        "additional_details": "Had either of the members currently running for leadership of the party been the leader at the time of the 2015 General Election, it is highly possible that the outcome would have been very different. Considering the public views of some members currently presenting themselves as possible candidates, it is almost certain that the 2015 election outcome would have been different had they been leader at the time. In view of this, a new General Election must follow the appointment of a new leader.",
        "background": "Because of the considerable divisions within the Conservative party, it is highly likely that the government under a new PM would be vastly different to the government under David Cameron that was democratically elected in 2015.",
