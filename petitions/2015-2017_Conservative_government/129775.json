        "additional_details": "CoD has released too many futuristic games and lots of fans want a non-futuristic, non-halo-like CoD. After about 2 years, they listened and remastered CoD4, but you can only get it if you preorder Infinite Warfare (which nobody wants). Activision know they will get low sales on Infinite Warfare so they bundled it in with CoD4 for \u00a330 extra. CoD sales should be banned in the UK so Activision will be forced to sell CoD4 separately or they will lose millions of pounds in sales.",
        "background": "If you don't know, Activision/Infinity ward has just announced their new Call Of Duty and it will be CoD Infinite Warfare. They have also announced that they have remastered Modern Warfare (CoD4). But there's a catch, they're only selling CoD4 with Infinite Warfare for \u00a370. Everyone just wants CoD4.",
