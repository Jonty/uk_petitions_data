        "action": "Respect the democratic process and the majority vote to leave the European Union",
        "additional_details": "The referendum on whether to stay or leave the European Union held on the 23rd of June 2016 gave a 48% to 52% result in favour of leaving the EU. Some within the minority 48% who voted to 'remain' have decided the outcome, based upon the United Kingdoms democratic process, was not to their satisfaction and have subsequently petitioned for a second referendum with amended criteria. This petition asks parliament to respect the will of the British people and ignore calls for a second EU referendum.",
        "background": "This petition is asking for there to be no repeat EU referendum as a result of the one held on the 23rd of June 2016. Doing so will be undermining the democratic process exercised and be ignoring the votes cast by the majority 52% of those voting to leave.",
