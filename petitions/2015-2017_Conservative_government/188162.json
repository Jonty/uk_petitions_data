        "additional_details": "In a 2015 debate in the House of Lords it was stated that thousands of hotels around the country were not meeting the needs of disabled persons. It is common practice to provide grab rails and signage but circulation space, access to walk-in showers and raised beds are sadly overlooked.  This year I was forced by these circumstances to miss a significant part of my son's wedding because a hotel had, in their opinion, undertaken the reasonable adjustments to make their facility fully accessible.",
        "background": "Disabled persons find it almost impossible to find suitable accommodation in hotels.  The Public Sector is required to make reasonable adjustments to physical features in line with Part M design standards whereas the Private Sector simply has a non-specific a duty to make reasonable adjustments.",
