        "action": "Hold a General Election by 01/01/17 so the new PM has a true democratic mandate.",
        "additional_details": "We held a referendum so that all UK citizens could have a direct say over the future direction of our country. But now, the Prime Minister, who will lead our country through this critical negotiating period, will be elected not by a national vote, but by just 150,000 Conservative members. Without an election it will be 2020 before the electorate as a whole has a further say. This is too long. Now, more than ever, our PM must have a mandate from the British people, not just from their own party.\r\n",
        "background": "The referendum was about the EU but neither side voted to give power to a Prime Minister without a mandate from the British people. The new Conservative leader should put his/her government to the popular vote by 01/01/17 and earn the right to represent the UK through the EU negotiations and beyond.",
