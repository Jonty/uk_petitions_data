        "additional_details": "University fees are rising more and more. \u00a39000 for university fees is too high and the stress of being in dept is what puts individuals off applying for degrees.Now that grants have been removed it makes it difficult for family's who need financial support but can't get that anymore.\r\n\r\nSchool is free, college is free, so should university be free as well.  \r\n\r\nIf the government in uk complains about too many people on state benefits then the productive solution is make university free.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Change the University fees from \u00a39250 back to be free from any feees in the UK. University is free in Scotland and it's only fair it should be free in England",
