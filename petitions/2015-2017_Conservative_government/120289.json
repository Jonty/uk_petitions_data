        "additional_details": "Your local, well trained pharmacist can give instant advice on health problems however, if we lose 25% of pharmacies due to this cutback we will also lose this quick and convenient system.   Currently it can take up to 1 to 4 weeks to get a non urgent GP appointment, waiting times in A and E are long.  The NHS is under a great deal of pressure and cut backs to pharmacies will adversely affect us all.",
        "background": "Cutting the funding by 6% will lead to an expected 25% reduction in pharmacies.  This will put even more pressure on struggling GP practices and A and E departments.",
