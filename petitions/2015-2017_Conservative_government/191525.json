        "action": "Make road over-bridges safe, to reduce suicide attempts and road closures",
        "additional_details": "I strongly reassure that this petition is not aimed at apportioning blame for mental health issues; its aim is to dramatically reduce risk to those individuals and at same time limit the awful and costly impact to the travelling public and business. Some such incidents are for legitimate mental health issues and some are done to be deliberately disruptive. To mitigate risks and impact, install barriers that discourage and impede such behaviour so public can\u2019t access or scale barriers naturally.",
        "background": "Road closures cause an incredible cost to the economy and misery to thousands of motorists and businesses. Closures due to an individual the wrong side of a barrier and threatening to jump / or has jumped are needless and I believe avoidable.  Their frequency is astonishing, ask Highways England/Dft",
