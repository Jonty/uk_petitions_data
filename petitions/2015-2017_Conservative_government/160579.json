        "additional_details": "In the wake of the Brexit referendum, the PM has resigned and a leadership battle within the Conservative party will elect his replacement. This new PM is going to be elected by 120,000 people who are members of the party, and not by the 40 odd million British voters. \r\n\r\nLots of people may wish to change their votes based on the new party leader (both for and against). \r\n\r\nThe new Prime Minister must be elected by the whole country, and not just by the party membership of the incumbent party.",
        "background": "During a General Election, it is likely that voters base their vote not only on who they want to represent them locally, but also who they would like to represent the country on the global stage. If the PM resigns, the public may wish to change their vote base on the new party leader.\r\n",
