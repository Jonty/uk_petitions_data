        "additional_details": "Parents should not be struggling to make ends meet and worrying about how to pay the mortgage after the death of a child. \r\nThey should be given a minimum of 6 months paid leave if their child dies, to come to terms with their loss. This would create a better working environment in the long run and better mental health for the parent/s affected. Also aftercare counselling should be provided for them to aid them in their wellbeing. ",
        "background": "Currently in the U.K. there is a pension and a one off payment of \u00a32000 of your partner dies. Well what if your child dies? Benefits for bereaved parents would give them time to grieve after loss.",
