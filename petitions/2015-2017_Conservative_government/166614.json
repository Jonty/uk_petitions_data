        "additional_details": "A large number of collisions and spillages on roads especially Motorways involve a HGV during busy periods, This leads to severe delays and road closures impacting the remaining 99% of road travellers time at home. \r\nBy limiting the times to which they can travel the rush hour periods should run more smoothly allowing traffic to flow with less accidents",
        "background": "During \"rush hour\" periods 0700-0900 and 1700-1900, HGV's and Tractors should not be allowed on Main Roads or Motorways due to the fact that they make every journey longer. ",
