        "additional_details": "The recent EU referendum was an advisory referendum, which is not legally binding.  Only 52% based on a turnout rate of 72% voted to leave the EU, meaning that effectively there are only 37% of people deciding to leave the EU.  The Parliment has power to disregard the referendum result on this basis.  It is not too late for the Parliament to block Brexit to prevent further destroying our economy and breaking up the UK.",
        "background": "The prospect of leaving the EU has caused the pound hitting a historical low, turmoils in the financial market, and a serious threat from Scotland seeking independence.  These have strongly demonstrated that it is best to stay in the EU to maintain stability and integrity of the UK.",
