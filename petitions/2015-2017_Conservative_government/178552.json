        "additional_details": "Prime Minister Theresa May acknowledges how wrong Mr Trump's comments are even saying during the debate of the last petition to ban him that his \"remarks in relation to Muslims are divisive, unhelpful and wrong\" (Home Office, 9 June 2016). Trump wants to stop women having the choice of abortions, he wants to stop Muslims entering his country, he refuses to believe in climate change and he's a compulsive liar. Ban him. Do your duty and protect us by keeping his hate speech out of this country. ",
        "background": "Now President of the United States of America, Donald Trump has provided hate speech towards those of different nationalities, gender, sexual orientation and religion. The UK is struggling to unite after the Brexit vote and allowing Mr Trump to enter the country will only exacerbate the situation. ",
