        "additional_details": "Motivation for buying low-emissions cars will be swept away.\r\n\r\nWhy not simply move the VED CO2 bandings down, continuing to incentivise buyers to look at ever more efficient cars?\r\n\r\nThese changes due to commence in April 2017 do not reward or promote low C02 emissions, do not support the Governments targets for the environment and are further \u2018under the counter\u2019\u2019 tax on income without any focus on true road use or rewarding buyers of low emission vehicles.",
        "background": "Significant changes announced in the 2015 Budget will see UK drivers subjected to huge rises in VED from 2017.\r\n\r\nVED charged on cars is currently linked to exhaust emissions.  Under changes announced, the existing 13 bands will be replaced by just 3 VED bands for all new cars sold.",
