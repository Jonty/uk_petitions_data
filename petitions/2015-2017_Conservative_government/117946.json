        "additional_details": "We live in France, the post office send out the letters by air mail this means 2 day until on a plane, another 2 days in the customs hall at reception airport. (If an air mail stamp is used then it has to go by airmail, if not then to France, Belgium, Luxembourg etc it goes by train, no customs hall! Letters take about 2 days) Councils are obliged to put on airmail stickers. There is therefore no way we get the vote. ",
