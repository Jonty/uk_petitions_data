Why was it ok for young Scots to vote but not young Brits?\r\n\r\nThe conversation must begin in schools and colleges so young people are able to engage with friends and teachers, asking the big questions in a safe environment.\r\n\r\nWhilst 75% of young people didn't vote to leave to EU, many more simply were not asked.\r\n\r\nWe've had enough of being silenced and denied our right to democracy. \r\nChange must come!",
        "background": "If you are old enough to die for your country why should your voice be ignored in elections and referendums?\r\n\r\n16 and 17 year olds should be given the vote in all future democratic events. Although we are engaged, young people have not been listened to and our concerns are never fully addressed.",
