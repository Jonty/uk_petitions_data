        "additional_details": "Disability charities looked at how many disabled people will be affected; initial estimates: 2,200 people with multiple sclerosis and 35% of all current claimants across all conditions and disabilities. Many are concerned about the implications on their eligibility for PIP & support that comes with this, such as carer\u2019s allowance, and what this means to their being able to live with any independence. As a result, disabled people are twice as likely to live in poverty than non-disabled people.",
        "background": "Debbie Abrahams MP revealed the Government has rushed new consultation on the PIP process, in particular cutting eligibility for support with aids and appliances in regards the daily living component: for wheelchairs, walk-in showers and others to help people live independently ",
