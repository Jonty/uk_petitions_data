        "additional_details": "With so much of our UK democracy and powers gone to the EU the UK Parliament is becoming, and has already in large parts become, an expensive \"front\" for the EU. The government should be honest about this and disband the UK parliament if the UK votes to remain in the EU after the coming referendum.",
        "background": "The EU has massive and growing power over the UK. If the UK votes to remain in the EU in the coming referendum the continued loss of sovereignty will be so large that we should disband our houses of parliament and save the people of Britain huge amounts of money.",
