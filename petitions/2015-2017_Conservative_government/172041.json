        "action": "The UK must now avoid any \"special relationship\" with the new US President.",
        "additional_details": "The US president's misogynism is well documented - women have reported him for various offences, and he has been recorded on tape using seriously derogatory language. The man is clearly warped in his views on gender equality, evidenced by his opinions on criminalising abortion. To have a 'special relationship' with such a man would diminish pride in the UK being as gender progressive as it is.\r\n\r\nAlso, we do not need to spend more money on war. Or walls/fences.\r\n\r\nThe UK is better than this.",
        "background": "The US president supports sexism, warmongering, terrorism and fascism. Accused of rape and indecent assault on more than one occasion, a climate sceptic, Islamophobe, and general opponent to basic human rights and freedoms,\r\nUK citizens must be assured that the US 'special relationship' has ended.",
