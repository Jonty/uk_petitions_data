        "action": "Raise the wages for those working in HM Prison Services",
        "additional_details": "Our Prison officers have a very tough and demanding job. Our Prison officers experience every day things most of us would never have to think about or Imagine. Not to mention the hours they serve, and the unsociable times they serve them through. There have been cuts after cuts with the prison service, and its gone on too far. The ratio of HMP staff to number of prisoners is dangerous. Pay our men and woman in the prison service a fair wage for the hard work that they do! Match the USA average.",
        "background": "The average wage for a Prison officer in the UK is not only low, but is also 10 thousand (in pounds) less than the average paid to prison officers in the USA.",
