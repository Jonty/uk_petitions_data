        "additional_details": "Indirect discrimination, in reference to disability, is defined in the Equalities Act 2010, and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.\r\n\r\nThese laws show that the acts performed by landlords and letting agents are pure discrimination based on ones source of income, because of disability\r\n\r\nAs a third of the non-disabled workforce aren\u2019t on benefits, it is therefore easy to show that yes, disabled people are more likely to be on benefits than non-disabled people. the phrase \u2018No DSS\u2019 is illegal.",
        "background": "Too many landlords and letting agents can discriminate disabled people by not allowing them to privately rent rooms or houses. Make this illegal. It is clear discrimination under the Equalities Act. \r\n\r\nHomelessness is rising, and will only get worse. Stop money grabbing landlords who discriminate.",
