        "action": "Cancel Cressida Dick's appointment as Commissioner of the Metropolitan police",
        "additional_details": "At the time of the fatal shooting, Jean Charles de Menezes was unarmed, had nothing on his person resembling a weapon, carried out no act that would give a reasonable person the impression that he was a terrorist. The coroner's jury were instructed (on reasoning pertaining only to the officers who fired the fatal shots) that they could not issue a verdict of unlawful killing. In practice this meant that the controller of the operation, Cressida Dick, could also not be held to account.",
        "background": "Cressida Dick headed the anti-terrorist operation in which an innocent, unarmed man was shot dead by police. As commander of the operation, Cressida Dick bears responsibility for the fatal mistakes made under her command. Her appointment as head of the Metropolitan Police jeopardizes public trust. ",
