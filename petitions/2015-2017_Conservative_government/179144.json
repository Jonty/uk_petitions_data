The decision to close public byways during the winter appears to be one taken by your local council, and not the UK Government.\r\n\r\nYou could raise this issue with a local councillor, who represents you. You can use this page to find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition asking for the UK Government to ban the closure of public byways during the winter.
