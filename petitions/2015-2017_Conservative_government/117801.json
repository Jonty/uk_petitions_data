        "additional_details": "We are told that if you aren't doing well in the core subjects, you aren't trying hard enough eventhough you might be stressed out of your mind trying to understand. However if you aren't good at the arts, you are told it's not for everyone. My question is this - How do you know your not good at it, if your aren't taught? You could argue that you can get lessons outside of school but not everyone can afford to do this. That's why it's important to have the arts in schools.",
        "background": "The arts are a crucial part of a young persons life and teaches many key skills the core subjects (Science, English and Maths) can't always provide, mainly confidence. When you are told to \"be quiet, do your work and get good grades\" you don't tend to develop confidence.",
