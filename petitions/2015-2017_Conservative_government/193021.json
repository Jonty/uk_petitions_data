        "additional_details": "Home Secretary and Europol are demanding companies such as WhatsApp to install backdoors so that security services may read suspected terrorists' messages. (Times, 27.03.17) The UK government may have 'noble' aims, but any backdoor would soon be found by the Russian or Chinese intelligence services. This would make the UK vulnerable to economic espionage, and have a chilling impact on dissidents in those countries. It could also be exploited by groups such as Anonymous, which may use intercepted messages to harass vulnerable groups such as LGBT+ people. T",
