        "additional_details": "Election Day in the UK is by tradition a Thursday, but many people will not vote on a Thursday simply due to being tired after a hard days work, this tradition arose due to several circumstances: the belief that Friday pay-packets would lead to more drunken voters on Fridays and Saturdays; having the election as far after a Sunday as possible would reduce the influence of Sunday sermons, largely irrelevant now due to falling Church attendance numbers.",
        "background": "In order to maximize turnout on a matter of such huge significance, the EU Referendum should take place before or after the traditional UK summer holiday period and either be held on a Sunday or be declared a public holiday.",
