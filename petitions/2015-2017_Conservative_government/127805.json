The government wants everyone to be able to make healthier choices, regardless of their circumstances, & to minimise the risk and impact of illness.\" \r\n\r\nThese runners will likely be local council tax payers who already contribute to such services. Why charge runners who are trying to  stay healthy & free of illness, therefore not draining the NHS as per the policy?",
