        "additional_details": "Some of the Vat Charges on small items are hardly worth the cost of auditing and tracking the payments, it would probably be more cost effective to have a slightly higher cut off, this will also have the effect of reducing the resentment the British public have in paying the extraordinary large charge to the Royal Mail for low cost items. ",
        "background": "It is quite absurd that an item costing \u00a319.00 ($22.00 US) should then incur a \u00a314 odd vat and handling charge. The handling charge of \u00a38 is placed by the Royal Mail regardless of size weight or cost of item, and is added for anything with VAT to be paid.",
