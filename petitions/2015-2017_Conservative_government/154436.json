In addition to this it is becoming ever clearer that certain claims that featured prominently in the campaign to leave were grossly misleading. A Government of National Unity formed of all political parties would be ideally placed  to decide whether, under these circumstances, such a small majority is sufficient to justify the momentous constitutional changes that will result.",
