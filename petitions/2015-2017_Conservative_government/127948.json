        "additional_details": "A Postcode Penalty survey found 63% of online retailers charge extra delivery for certain parts of the UK and 34% said delivery would take longer for those who live on islands. Royal Mail charges the same no matter where you are located in the UK. The Government must create a law that  that ensures that, at least, those customers in these areas mentioned above are offered courier rates and Royal mail rates. THEY ARE  ALL PART OF UK and should be entitled to get the cheapest delivery service.",
        "background": "Homes in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland and in Northern Ireland are normally only offered one rate. This results in much higher costs to these areas OR BEING REFUSED ANY DELIVERY AT ALL. Around 69% online dealers do not offer delivery by Royal Mail, which is the same wherever it is in UK ",
