        "additional_details": "This country is already in debt of 1.56 trillion and counting yet there's still money to go to war? There's cuts to the welfare system, the policing staff, the NHS etc and what are they all for? To use the saved money to spend on bombing a country full of innocent men, women and kids. They are targeting IS but how can a whole country be attacked in response to a small amount of people that are part of the organization. The lives of British servicemen and women will be endangered. No to wars. ",
        "background": "David Cameron has accused the majority of the population as being 'Terrorist Sympathisers' for wanting to seek a non-violent resolution to the Syrian crisis.\r\n\r\nWe demand Mr Cameron resigns as he has no care over the public opinion. His only desire is to continue bombing innocent people in Syria. \r\n",
