        "action": "Citizens must pass GCSE level maths and English to vote",
        "additional_details": "Passing basic mathematical and English competency tests will ensure voters are able to better make informed choices, and understand the implications and consequences of their voting choice. \r\n\r\nVery often voters are misinformed, and unable to distinguish fact from fiction due to their lack of education. It should therefore go without saying that not being able to understand basic maths and English should also correlate with poor understanding of elections and referendums.",
        "background": "Citizens under the age of 18 are unable to vote due to not being mature enough to understand implications of elections and referendums. However, maturity should not be determined by age.",
