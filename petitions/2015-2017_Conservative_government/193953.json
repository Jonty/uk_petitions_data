        "additional_details": "By rating the series an 18, it limits the TARGET audience of the book and the series in the first place. Typically, a rated 18 is accessible for adults only. This material focuses on a teenagers traumatic experience at her high school where she experiences bullying and ends up committing suicide. I believe this content, although distressing, should be accessible for teenagers to become aware of the consequences of bullying and the awareness to mental health and suicide.",
        "background": "Netflix's original series '13 Reasons Why' is an adaption of the young adult novel by Jay Asher; about a 17 year old girls suicide and her history of bullying at her high school. It's rated 18. I want the certificate to change to a 15 to allow the audience it's INTENDED FOR to watch and access it.",
