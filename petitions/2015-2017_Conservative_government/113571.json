        "additional_details": "It is our proposal that parliament be compelled to debate matters that reach 100,000 signatures, rather than have the option.  Any other course of action allows Parliament to pick and choose between matters which demonstrate similar commitment, and this is not reflective of a democratic system.\r\n\r\nThe current system allows Parliament to pretend to offer democratic input, whilst effectively paying no more than lip service to the opinions being expressed.",
        "background": "Currently, if a petition on this site reaches 100,000 signatures, then parliament will consider it for debate.  Many petitions reach this level and are then considered, and rejected, for debate.",
