        "additional_details": "How many times do we have to see innocents, aid workers doctors nurses teachers, innocent people being butchered.\r\nIsis do this with impunity,  they know because of Geneva convention that our troops hands are tied.\r\nTake the gloves off our boys, war is ugly, but we are being held on a leash because of an outdated and not fit for purpose piece of legislation. \r\nThe Geneva convention in relation to enemy combatants is unworkable in theatres of war in middle east and needs scrapping.",
        "background": "My point is this,  if you do not adhere to the Geneva convention then do not expect leniency from UK or any other western nation.\r\nIf you treat our captured soldiers and innocents like animals and murder them, then expect no mercy.\r\nSo message for isis Taliban Al queaida etc. Stand by.",
