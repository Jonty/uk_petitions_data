        "background": "The work that the Probate Registry does is the same whatever the value of the estate. There is no excuse to introduce this extortionate, banded tax. Taxing already-taxed money is offensive enough. The Conservative manifesto promised to decrease Inheritance Tax, NOT raise it through a back door. \r\n",
