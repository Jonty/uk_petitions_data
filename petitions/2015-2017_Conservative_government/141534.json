We want a fair system that represents the interests of the whole country not the party already in power and manipulation of such constituencies is not a true representation of what the UK citizens vote for. Another example is the 2010 elections - the libdems got 23% votes but only 57 seats whereas labour got 29% and 253 seats and conservatives received 36.1% and got 307 seats. ",
