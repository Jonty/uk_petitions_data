        "action": "Hold a referendum, proposing a new body working to improve UK press standards",
        "additional_details": "While it's clear the press can't be regulated or controlled by the government, it's equally clear they cannot be controled by those only seeking profit. If the referedum has higlighted anything it's that there is minimal interest for issues to be highlighted when there is a chance to stir up feelings of national pride or create divides.\r\nWhat is now needed is a serious, independant, ongoing study of a new direction, by a new organisation, not linked to any political party or private organisation.",
        "background": "It's time to dispell the idea of a free press in the UK. It's controled by shareholders and subject to capitalist pressures first and foremost. When the UK suffers turmoil, hardships and social divides, the press benefits. There is no incentive for the press to look after the people of the UK.",
