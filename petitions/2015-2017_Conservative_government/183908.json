As a result, 'donations' aren't getting to the genuine homeless, who often lack sufficient confidence to beg so aggressively in such lucrative positions on the street. Passers-by are conned into parting with their money, whilst these opportunists commit benefit fraud as they sell 'being pitied' on the street.\r\n",

Some opportunists receiving housing benefit, masquerade as homeless, and receive food & sleep in homeless night shelters, where places are limited, so genuine homeless people are turned away",
