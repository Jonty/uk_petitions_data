        "additional_details": "Figures from 2011 indicate that 95.2% of parents who approached the Child Support Agency in order to access their legal entitlement for child maintenance were female. The failure to collect rates are astonishing. It is therefore a gender inequality issue.\r\nThis  social injustice needs to be urgently addressed.The far reaching repercussions have to be legally recognised for both the parent with care and the child/ren when one parent fails to support their child/ren.\r\nIt is neglect and abuse.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Current legislation does not recognise non-payment of child support as neglect. After a year of non-compliance separate criminal charges should be brought against such non-resident parents for child neglect.\r\n\r\nResident parents should also be able to prosecute non-compliant NRP for financial abuse.",
