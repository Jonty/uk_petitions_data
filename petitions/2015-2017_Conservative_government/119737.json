        "additional_details": "I suggest to make maximum rent equal to\r\nProperty Council Tax * (3 + Number of bedrooms)\r\n\r\nFor example\r\nThis way the cheapest 1 bed property in band A max rent will be around\r\n\u00a3100 tax * (3 + 1 bedroom) = \u00a3400\r\nA bigger property in a higher band will provide higher yield to cover the increased number of people living there, like with 2 bedrooms\r\n\u00a3150 (band 2 tax) * (3 + 2 bedrooms) = \u00a3750\r\n\r\nLimiting only top prices will allow for the market to separate properties further by their value.",
        "background": "The current rent prices have gone out of control.\r\n\r\nHousing benefit is often not covering the cost of renting even a room. In some rent has gone up from \u00a3300 - \u00a3400 4 years ago to nearly \u00a31000 p/m. Increasingly, people can afford to stay in a place unless they share a room with another tenant.",
