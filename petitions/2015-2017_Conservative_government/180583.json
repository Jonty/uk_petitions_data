They say that seriously ill people are fit for work, and some have died within the space of a year. These contracted companies are paid \u00a31.6 billion. These are foreign companies who get rich off the British taxpayer. There is no concern for Disabled persons in the UK.",
        "background": "There should be an independent inquiry into the work capability assessments carried out by ATOS and MAXIMUS. We need to know more about the terms of the contracts to know whether they are selling our data. We need to know how many people have died because of their actions.",
