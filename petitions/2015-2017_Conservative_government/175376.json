        "additional_details": "This is another ploy for HM Treasury to defraud us of even more money. Of course, it's illegal to drive without vehicle tax, so one has no choice.",
        "background": "Currently if one taxes a car at any time other than the 1st of the month, the buyer loses on the value of up to 30 days of tax. E.g., I purchased a vehicle and applied for 6 months road tax on 26th October. The tax was backdated to the 1st Oct. This meant I paid for 25 days of tax I did not receive.",
