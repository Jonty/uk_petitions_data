I really need people to get behind this to keep our children, siblings and friends safe. My sister is terrified to leave the house or go out with her friends and it shouldn't be this way!There is no way to identify the thugs that did this to my sister but having cameras put up in our local park can make the future safer for everybody.We can let children play without fear of them being harmed",

Yesterday night (07/04/16) my younger sister (15) was surrounded in Carnegie park by a gang of youths who put a flip knife to her chin.Action needs to be taken!",
