It puts pressure and exploits working class families with children who are desperate to see their idols live on the occasion that they are touring in their city. Also peoples expectations are raised when they're paying \u00a3200+ for a concert that should only of been \u00a350, and often people are left thinking \"Was that it?\"..",
