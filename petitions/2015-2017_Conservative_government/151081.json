        "additional_details": "For example, all young people will have to live with a brexit, and these young people will ahve to live with it for the longest. Also, people who are 16 and 17 cannot vote against tuition fees, and because general elections are every 5 years, such people will not have a vote in a General election until they are 21 or 22, when most have finished university.",
        "background": "Many people a year too young to vote in elections that effect them most. Especially with big votes like referendums, older generations will have to live with the result for a lot less time than the younger generations, yet the younger generations are not allowed to vote for \"their future\"",
