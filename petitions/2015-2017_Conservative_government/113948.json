        "additional_details": "Following the unnecessary pain and suffering caused to Chunky the dog by four youths, it has become clear that punishment for these crimes is not appropriate given the fact these boys only were given a 5 year ban from owning animals and to pay a small fine even with the RSPCA claiming this case is one of the worst cases of animal cruelty they have ever seen. It's time for the government to realise these punishments are not enough!",
        "background": "Following the case of animal cruelty which was inflicted upon Chunky, I feel the punishment for animal cruelty offences should be extended to a life time ban for owning animals at the very least. Punishment for animal cruelty crimes should be harsher to help prevent these crimes!! Justice for Chunky",
