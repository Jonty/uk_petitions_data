        "action": "Limit the level of parking charge by private operators to a reasonable level.",
        "additional_details": "In 2015 ParkingEye Limited won a case in the Supreme Court (ParlingEye Limited v Beavis) with the effect of allowing them to charge whatever penalty they wish. We believe the law as it stands puts too much power in the hands of the car park operator and that they are using that power unfairly and to the detriment of honest motorist who find themselves delayed for some unforeseen reason. The Government must legislate to put reasonable limits on the charges that car park operators can demand.",
        "background": "The Protection of Freedoms Act allows car park operators to charge whatever they see fit when a motorist overstays. Charges can be as much as \u00a3100 for just just 10 minutes. These outrageous charges are causing misery for many motorists. Penalties for overstaying should be limited to \u00a310 per hour.",
