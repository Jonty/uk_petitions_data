At the moment, a number of legal consequences could already follow from the death of a captive animal in a zoo or other visitor attraction where this arises from the negligence of visitors. For example, the negligent visitor could be sued. In some circumstances, if a visitor caused unnecessary suffering to an animal, both the visitor and the owner who allowed it to happen could face criminal prosecution. It is also possible that action might be taken against a zoo if health and safety rules in place to protect the public were not followed.\r\n\r\nYou could submit a new petition which clearly sets out the specific action you want the Government or Parliament to take if a situation like that at Cincinnati Zoo were to happen in the UK.\r\n"
