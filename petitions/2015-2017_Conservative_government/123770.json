        "action": "Introduce a Financial Transaction Tax, use revenue to help fight austerity cuts",
        "additional_details": "The financial crisis caused massive socio-economic human rights violations through austerity measures. An FTT would promote less risky, long term investments which lead to a stronger and more stable economy that benefits all and not just the City. Use the generated tax revenue - European Commission estimate \u00a38bn for the UK - to help fight back cuts to the public sector.",
        "background": "A Financial Transaction Tax is designed to stabilise market volatility by acting as a disincentive to short term risky financial transactions, such as high frequency trading. These financial transactions were a leading cause of the global financial crisis. Impose an FTT to stabilise the economy.",
