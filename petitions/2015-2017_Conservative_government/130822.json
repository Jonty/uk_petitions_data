        "additional_details": "I believe this is a huge problem and threatens democracy, as the majority of people are unheard. So by allowing a proportional amount of seats based on votes to each parties gives lesser parties a better chance to reflect and represent their voters in parliament. So I think this is a problem that needs to change, and we need to change a government that the majority did not vote for.",
        "background": "In the 2015 general election the conservatives received only 36.9% of the vote share so other parties and public opinion stayed ignored. So I think we should have a system were different parties can have more seats and have the same vote share as seat share. By doing this we make a better democracy.",
