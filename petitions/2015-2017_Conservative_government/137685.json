        "additional_details": "The fallout from the EU referendum is beginning to paint a worrying picture, not only because of its vast global consequences, but also because a large number of leave voters are starting to suggest that they feel they voted incorrectly. \r\nFreedom of choice is a wonderful thing and with it, unfortunately, comes the ability to choose wrongly.
