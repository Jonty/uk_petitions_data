        "additional_details": "The BBC are a totally biased corporation & the British public should not be forced to pay for their propaganda and lies. Throughout the whole referendum they have consistently reported doom & gloom about a possible Brexit & are continuing to do so even after our vote to leave the EU. 17 million plus voted to leave the EU. It is our democratic right to be able to choose whether we pay for their news reporting or not.",
