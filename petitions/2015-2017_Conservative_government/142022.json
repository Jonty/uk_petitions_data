        "additional_details": "Only Labour, united with SNP, Plaid Cymru, and the Greens, can provide the framework of a government that could stop Boris Johnson, abetted by Nigel Farage and UKIP, turning Britain into a Thatcherite free-market wasteland. The government was voted in when the UK was part of the EU, with pro-Euro policies dictated by EU laws. We need a clean slate Government that has half an eye on Europe, half an eye on the world stage, and one full eye firmly fixed on UK social and financial sustainability.\r\n",
        "background": "We must prevent the Conservative right using the Brexit negotiations to reshape Britain into a rule-free space for corporations; we need to take control of the process putting the rights of all citizens first. We must unite all parties against the Tory's for social and financial stability.",
