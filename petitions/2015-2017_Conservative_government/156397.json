        "additional_details": "If the UK leaves the EU, in order to remain in the single market it will have to accept free movement of people and other EU rules. EU leaders have made this clear. \r\n\r\nNo one knows how long it will take the UK to renegotiate the huge number of trade deals or whether it would actually agree terms with the EU. This could leave the UK without a free trade deal.\r\n\r\nBillions have already been wiped of shares, the pound has plummeted and Scotland has threatened another independence referendum.     \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Only a vote in Parliament can trigger Brexit (Article 50). Before triggering Brexit, Parliament must repeal the 1972 European Communities Act by which it voted to take the UK into the EU. MPs have every right, and indeed a duty if they think it best for Britain, to vote to stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         ",
