        "additional_details": "Large corporations are already crippling small traders by being in a position to keep their prices low. Smaller ones simply cannot compete with. \r\n\r\nThe government should abandon or at least lower small business rates to help the economy. Otherwise many will have no other option other than to close, leaving high street shops and small towns with rows of empty boarded up shops, less local employment and no community. \r\n\r\nRates for pubs/clubs are calculated differently, and will see the biggest hikes",
        "background": "Small independent businesses are under threat of a massive hike in business rates. Small retailers, independent shops, sole traders and many more will have their business rates increased with pubs and bars being hit the hardest. Whilst online retailers and larger companies will see a decrease.",
