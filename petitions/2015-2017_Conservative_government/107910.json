        "background": "ERS research has shown that \u00a31,262,670 was claimed last year by peers who did not speak.\r\n\r\nThis comes at a time when David Cameron says 45 new peers will be added to the house.\r\n\r\nThe number of peers in the Upper House must be dramatically cut or abolished altogether.",
