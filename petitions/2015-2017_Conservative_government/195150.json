Short of making it standard issue, which some officers will reject, officers that wish to have it, should be allowed it. \r\nAll the officers that ARE eligible, there isn't the training or number of tasers available for them to deployed with taser. More funding is needed and more training is needed. \r\nFrontline officers do the job, and are at risk of some awful dangers and should be better protected.",
