        "additional_details": "There is endless evidence from all the animal rescue charities. RSPCA and World Horse Welfare to name a couple.  The number of unwanted animals is increasing each year. Some control must be taken\r\nI suggest a large fines for non licences or bin chipped animals and pets.  Any unlicensed or Unchipped should be removed into care for resale or rehoming. The fines will cover the cost of sending out enforcing officers and administrative costs.",
        "background": "There are too many animals being dumped, abandoned and stolen in the UK.  It is deeply upsetting to see horses dumped because they have been neglected, family dogs stolen for baiting in dog fights and the resulting injured dogs.  This can be controlled by enforcing animal owners to obtain a licence.",
