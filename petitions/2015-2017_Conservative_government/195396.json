        "action": "Calculate student loans by disposable income per person rather than by household",
        "additional_details": "Currently, a student's maintenance loans are worked out using the full household income in order to assess how much help they require from the government and how much of it their parents can subsidise. This is unfair as, even if the families have the same income, a family with four dependents will be able to subsidise less than a family with only one or two children as they have to make the money go further between people.",
        "background": "If a student comes from a family with 4 children and the income of their family is the same as a student who is an only child, they get the same in student loans, putting one at a disadvantage. These loans should be calculated using disposable income per person rather than household income overall",
