        "action": "Parliament should vote to decide when we start negotiating to leave the EU",
        "additional_details": "The result of the referendum held on 23 June expressed the electorate's wish that the Government negotiate to Leave the EU. The events since make clear that neither the Government nor the Leave campaign have a plan for the UK's negotiation. So Parliament should exercise control over when the negotiation commences. A Parliamentary vote will also make it easier for the European Council to know when the UK has formally notified its intention to withdraw. ",
        "background": "The UK must leave the EU through a well-ordered, timely negotiation. A rushed divorce will damage us both. Article 50.3 of the Lisbon Treaty gives us two years from notification before the Treaties expire. So we should not trigger Article 50 until Parliament votes to say we are ready to negotiate.",
