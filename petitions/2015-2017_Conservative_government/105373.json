        "additional_details": "It was made illegal in the UK in 1977 after the addition of all ring-substituted amphetamines to the class A definition. MDMA was not directly named.\r\nIn 2010 it was rated 17 out of 20 on a scale of harm by Dr David Nutt,  former chief drugs adviser to the British government. It came far below already legal drugs alcohol, which topped the table, and nicotine.\r\nIf legal then police could better use resources on other crime.\r\nhttp://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/11/drugs_cause_most_harm",
        "background": "Legalising it would help protect users from harm as illegal ecstasy tablets can be 'cut' with harmful substances. It would raise substantial revenue in taxes for the government and its use as a therapeutic aid to treat a range of illness including PTSD,  could be explored",
