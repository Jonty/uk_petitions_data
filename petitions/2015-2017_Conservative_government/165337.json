        "additional_details": "On a \u00a3500 insurance policy this adds a tax (for the privilege of taking out a policy, be it house insurance, car insurance, holiday insurance and pet insurance) of \u00a350 to your Policy  and pro rata according to the amount you pay for your Policy. This is a statutory amount payable on EVERY policy you take out and so you are paying this tax on every Policy you have. You are not paying once, but a number of times. The IPT compulsory charge is making insurance policies unaffordable and is yet another `hidden` tax which is making us all poorer. Please sign the Petition to have IPT removed.",
        "background": "A tax known as IPT (Insurance Premium Tax) was added to all insurance policies by the last government and was originally levied at 6%. Recently this has risen to 9% and due to become 10% in October 2016. ",
