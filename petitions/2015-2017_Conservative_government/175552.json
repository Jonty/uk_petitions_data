        "action": "Force all councils to have an adequate quantity of lorry parks for lorries.",
        "additional_details": "There are not enough lorry parks in the UK and the vast majority of them have woefully poor services such as showers and decent food vendors. The majority of them have fast food outlets which encourages unhealthy eating etc. Getting proper rest areas would make the roads safer and provide good business opportunities as almost all haulage firms are prepared to pay the fees.",
        "background": "Lorry driving is a stressful . The best way of helping drivers deal with this is for them to get adequate rest. There are not enough spaces in the majority of service areas. Councils should be compelled to provide enough parking and adequate services to accommodate the amount of traffic.",
