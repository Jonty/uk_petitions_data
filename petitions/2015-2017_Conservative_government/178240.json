        "additional_details": "The Guardian newspaper published a piece on this recently.\r\n\r\nI can bring forward many individuals who have experienced poor practice by UK vets leading to death or injury and have sought support from the RCVS to no avail.\r\n\r\nThe basis of veterinary training has shifted from maximising care outcomes to maximising the profitability of the practise. \r\n\r\nIn order to take a vet to court you must get another qualified UK vet to give written opinion of the failure and the RCVS inhibits this.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The RCVS is the professional body for Vets in the UK.\r\nAs a result they are not independent and systematically err on the side of their members. This is well documented and vets are rarely if ever struck off.\r\n\r\nThe level of poor practice among vets is leading to many unnecessary deaths.",
