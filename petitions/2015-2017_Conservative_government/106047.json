        "action": "Introduce competition for the benefit of consumers within the UK water industry",
        "additional_details": "Examples of bills over recent years from one supplier clearly demostrates the significant price increases. This particular supplier recorded well over 100m in profits over the last financial year and over 150m in the year before. This has resulted in pressure on consumer bills and significant profit gains for the company yet no noticeable improvement in new or existing services for consumers. There is a distinct lack of value for consumers, a real risk of bill shock and inability to pay",
        "background": "There is a complete lack of competition within the UK water industry. This has lead to a price increase of nearly 42% in one instance over recent years. Due to the lack of competition in this market, consumers have no choice of supplier and must use a company that has a total monopoly on the market.",
