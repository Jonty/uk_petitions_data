        "additional_details": "Our police force has become disrespected by the communities they serve. This is in part of lowering standards of our once great police force. The passing fitness test is a joke, once passed They have just 30 minutes a week to spend on fitness so there is no surprise their not up to the high standards they should be! So fast track retiring military into the police, people who are fit, strong, intelligent, think on their feet and who have worked in dangerous environments all their lives. ",

They need structure and purpose while they become readjusted to working and living away from the Forces. Intelligence/strength/pride Would win the war on crime",
