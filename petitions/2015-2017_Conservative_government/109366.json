        "additional_details": "I am a joint Patron of Veterans in Action(VIA) and we continuously raise money that is urgently needed to take veterans away and help them feel part of a team and help them open up, we will go that extra mile to rebuild their future and put them back into society as a stronger better human being. Without funding we can not help as many people as would initially of liked to, we currently are training up Ex-soldiers in bush-craft and survival as a way of bringing in some well needed income to us.",
        "background": "Having served for 19yrs 216 days and completed 10 Operational tours i found myself being placed on the scrapheap once diagnosed with PTSD. Without charities stepping in to help us, we have nothing in support. We need the Government to invest in us, it would mean that Politicians actually care!!",
