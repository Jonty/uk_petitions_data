        "additional_details": "The bridges & tunnels are part of the national infrastructure and should not be the responsibility of the people of Merseyside in the same way the bridge to Skye is not theirs to pay for, the Bridges of The Thames are not purely for the people of London.\r\nthere are many roads, bridges & tunnels that are paid for nationally including the upkeep, I feel the same should be done on Merseyside.\r\n",
        "background": "The River Mersey will end up with 2 bridges and x2 tunnels that will be tolled in the next 12 months. The cost of the build, upkeep and repair of these huge national infrastructures have been given to the people of Merseyside. Who pays for the upkeep of the bridges & tunnels of The River Thames.",
