They are learning that there will be no new money for the NHS or protection for our borders. They are seeing our last industries pack up to leave. Many people that get the most out of EU membership through its support in Wales, Cornwall and the North have been deceived about the impact of taking Britain out of the European Union. We need a list of facts to trust. ",

We need to see what is left of democracy, once the lies are logged.",
