        "additional_details": "1 The UK Parliament has had the power at any time to vote to leave the EU; it did not need a referendum.\r\n2 NATO rules can require us to go to war, regardless of Parliament.\r\n3 Asylum is granted under international conventions.\r\n4 Climate change, biodiversity, population growth and armed conflict are problems that can only be tacked at a super-national level.\r\n5 UK alone will have less influence on internet giants and other multi-nationals than the EU has.\r\nTaking back control is illusion and fraud.",
        "background": "'Leave' called 'Take Back Control' which had a very major impact on the Referendum vote.\r\nThe slogan is misleading and dishonest.\r\nInternational agreements constrain us; multinationals ignore borders.\r\nAny nation state has less power in a globalised world than an alliance like the EU has.
