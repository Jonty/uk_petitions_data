        "additional_details": "What are Sure Start Children's Centres? Sure Start Centres provide vital support for new parents, postnatal classes, baby development groups, toddler play groups, baby weighing in, support from health workers and so much more. They are a vital life line (literally) for many new parents. Their contribution by their professional staff to child development cannot be underestimated and they provide a much needed social network to new mums, some of which are struggling with postnatal depression and other baby-related issues. ",
        "background": "There are further cuts planned over the coming year to Sure Start Centres throughout Tameside which provide vital services and support for babies, children and new parents. Please sign to say 'no more'! Tameside needs these centres and the services they provide. ",
