        "additional_details": "The result is that Britain now effectively has no economic policy at all, no fiscal policy and in fact no policy of any kind.\r\nIt has no constitutional position on the likely independence referendum on Scotland\r\nThe prime minister has made his resignation public and is therefore unfit to lead future negotiations \r\nThe chancellor is absent, and has done nothing to reassure business or the public. He is not capable of the required leadership.\r\nThe remainder of the cabinet cannot agree on future policy",
        "background": "Since the momentous events of Thursday 23rd of June the government has shown itself to be utterly incapable of functioning effectively \r\nIt appears that the government has neither a contingency plan or an initial negotiating stance with the EU. ",
