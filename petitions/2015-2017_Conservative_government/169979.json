        "additional_details": "Evidence shows that it's becoming more common for us to pass from cancer and it's cruel to make us wait the inevitable out. We should be allowed to keep our human rights even in our last months of life and choose to end our life before we get so ill we are just waiting for our death to arrive that is so cruel. ",
        "background": "We all know someone who's died from cancer and if the ill person can fully communicate they should be given an injection to speed things up. No one wants to go that way with so much pain. Once the person has passed no return they shouldn't be made to pass with no dignity and wait for their death.",
