        "additional_details": "The Acts' simplistic definition of a psychoactive substance has been described by the government's own advisory body the ACMD as \"the scientific equivalent of writing in crayons\"\r\n\r\nUnder this act it is now technically illegal to import and sell flowers because smelling a flower's scent \"produces a psychoactive effect in a person ... by stimulating or depressing the person's central nervous system\". Similarly energy drinks are also now technically illegal because taurine has not been exempted\r\n",
        "background": "Historically, British law has operated under the principle that 'everything is permissible unless it is illegal', but now we're seeing a shift towards the Roman principle of law which stated that 'everything is illegal unless we tell you it's permissible' ",
