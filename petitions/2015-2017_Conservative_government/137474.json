        "additional_details": "Everytime there is an election or referendum there are to many people who are too lazy or cannot be bothered to vote which can dramatically change the results. Democracy works when everyone takes part, not just the same people who keep voting for the same things. Australia has this system and people have to pay a fine if they haven't given a vaild reason on why they did not vote.",
        "background": "With the low voter turnout in the last general election (66.1%) and only 72% of people turning out for the EU referendum. The government needs to ensure that everyone's voice is heard during voting periods.",
