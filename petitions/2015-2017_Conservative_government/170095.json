        "additional_details": "In addition, in this part of the UK there are limited services for adolescents, meaning an increased amount of suicides. For instance, Chase Farm unit now only caters for individuals who are 18+, prior to this the unit treated people aged 16-64 - leaving adolescents in urgent need for psychiatric treatment to move hundreds of miles away from their families. Studies show the adolescents who are treated far away from home are at risk of becoming more unwell.",
        "background": "It is imperative that the mental health system changes North London. In particular the 'Home Crisis Resolution Team' in Enfield. This service is of no practical use unless you've seriously harmed yourself, they provided no support for myself even though I'd expressed my plans for my suicide. ",
