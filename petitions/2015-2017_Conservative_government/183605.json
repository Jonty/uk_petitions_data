        "additional_details": "It is already difficult for Muslim students to sit exams whilst fasting, so sacrificing our day of celebration, which is the equivalent of Christmas day for Christians is unjust. We ask those of all faiths and backgrounds to stand with our cause and allow Muslims to be able to enjoy their annual celebration, without the pressure of examinations. The days of Eid are from the 26th - 27th June and all 3 major exam boards (AQA, OCR & Edexcel) are holding examinations on these dates.",

Therefore, we ask you to consider our religious beliefs and allow us to find a way to celebrate and take our examinations on an alternative date other than Eid.\r\n",
