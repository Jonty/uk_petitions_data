        "additional_details": "The majority of the illegal migrants entering Europe today and over the past couple of months are economic migrants. Why should these people be granted asylum under false pretenses? We have laws in place and a system in place to allow people to apply for asylum legally but economic migrants do not want to use this system because they know their claims for asylum will be rejected because their lives are not in danger nor are they running from persecution etc. They want to abuse our asylum system.",
        "background": "Economic Migrants are not the same as asylum seekers or refugees. Economic migrants illegally try to enter another country for the purpose of settling illegally or trying to claim asylum under false pretenses with the aim of improving their personal economic status.",
