        "additional_details": "The Department For Education has decided this fledgling school that offers specialist training to 14-19 year olds in Engineering and Construction is to close. Therefore denying the town and surrounding areas children the opportunity to excel outside of the ''mainsteam'' education system.\r\nThis is a brilliant school, offering a fantastic opportunity and to close it would be an absolute travesty for the children, businesses and future finances of Burnley and the nearby towns and villages.",
        "background": "Last week it was announced that Burnley UTC, a school that cost \u00a310.3m to open in March 2014 is to close in August 2016.\r\nThe DFE have given it effectively just 2 years to sink or swim, not very long to say the least, considering the first pupils to go 14-16 are just sitting their GCSEs now.",
