This is exactly what the Media are doing. It's barbaric and it's evil and the media need to be stopped from using images of the pitbull terrier for writing their stories!\r\nPeople need to be educated on these breeds ,they do not need any more bad press than they already have , IT'S WRONG ,It's discrimination and we are offended!!",
