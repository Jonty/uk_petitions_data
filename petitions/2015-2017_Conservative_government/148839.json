        "action": "Disregard EU referendum result and block Article 50 invocation",
        "additional_details": "The 4% majority is too slim for several reasons:\r\n\r\n1. If even 2% of voters chose leave as a \"protest vote\" it has skewed the result. Likewise if they chose leave on promises that have been immediately withdrawn.\r\n2. Nearly 75% of 18-24 year old voters wanted to remain, suggesting that remain voters would rise to a majority in the near future.\r\n3. It will be more difficult to rejoin than it is to leave, and the UK will not regain its current special powers, not represented in a mere 4% difference.",
        "background": "This petition calls for parliament to disregard the EU referendum result and block invocation of Article 50 on the grounds that a slim majority of less than 4% is insufficient to clearly represent a long-term desire for the UK to leave the EU.",
