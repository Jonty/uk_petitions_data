        "additional_details": "Record numbers of people registered to fight 'Navitus Bay' during the Planning inspection, 90% against.\r\n\r\nLocal MP's, businesses, councils, National Trust and residents are united in opposition.\r\n\r\nThis is a real threat to local tourism, businesses and jobs.\r\n\r\nThe wind farm would dominate the seascapes from the coasts of Dorset, south-east Hampshire and the west of the Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\nThis wind farm would be too big, too close, too damaging to the environment and the ecomomy.",
        "background": "It's too close to the Jurassic Coast Unesco World Heritage Site, which may lose it's status if this giant wind farm is built. The on land cable route would cause huge damage to the New Forest with the permanent loss of thousands of trees. Too big, too close, too damaging to the environment & economy",
