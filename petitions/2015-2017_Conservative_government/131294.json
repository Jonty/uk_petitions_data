The inquiry is ongoing \u2013 see:\r\nhttp://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/journalist/electoral-commission-media-centre/news-releases-donations/electoral-commission-statement-on-application-to-the-high-court-for-the-conservative-and-unionist-party-to-disclose-documents-and-information\r\n\r\nThere is also another investigation into electoral abuse. On 14 August 2015 the Cabinet Office announced that Sir Eric Pickles, the Government\u2019s Anti-Corruption Champion, was to review electoral fraud and make recommendations on what could be done to tackle it. \r\n\r\nIf you think that these two inquiries are inadequate, you could start a new petition calling for further action from the Government or Parliament, but you would need to specify clearly what additional action you want to see taken."
