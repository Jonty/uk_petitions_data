        "additional_details": "The government has failed to invest in the continuation of deep coal mining in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe UK may suffer at the hands of foreign imports costing more, as countries will come to realise we are 100% dependant on them.",
        "background": "Today marks the end of deep coal mining in the UK. We the public feel that not enough has been done to help UK Coal and other similars to stay open and keep mining.\r\n\r\nIt is not only the workers who are affected, with no coal, drivers of road and rail freight will potentially lose their jobs also.",
