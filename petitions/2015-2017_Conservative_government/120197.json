        "additional_details": "These managerial positions could be any doctor grade as long as they have at least 5 years of NHS experience. It would take very little effort for doctors who already want to improve the NHS and are willing to work with the government to come up with a cost effective plan which would be good for patients and government at the same time",
        "background": "In order to help the government with the current situation of the NHS, a very reasonable alternative would be: instead of Managers of other than medical background are trying to manage the NHS. Having a doctor managing a department from a managerial position would be efficient and safe for patients.",
