        "additional_details": "Despite many piercing salons imposing their own age restrictions for body piercings, there is no legal age restriction for any kind of piercing in England and Wales, unlike in Scotland, where people under 16 are required to have a parent\u2019s permission before having ears and other body parts pierced.",
        "background": "I was watching a child cry out of fear and pain in a store which allows children to get there ears pierced. Yes the parents gave consent to it, but the child defiantly didn't know what was going on, watching this really upset me.\r\n\r\nI think the law needs to be stricter on piercings in the UK.",
