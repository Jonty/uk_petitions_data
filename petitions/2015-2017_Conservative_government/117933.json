Due to administration fees for Estate agents and scrupulous landlords being far to high and because fees were being taken upto ten or more times for the same property. Yet Estate Agents and Landlords keep the fees knowing only one would ever take pocession  of the property.  The other fees aren't returned to the potential tenants who either don't fit the criteria ( credit checks etc).\r\n\r\nSince starting the Facebook group 24 months ago I have over 34 thousand families requiring the use of the group.\r\n\r\nThat is more than a thousand a month.
