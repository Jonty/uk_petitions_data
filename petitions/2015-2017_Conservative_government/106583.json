        "additional_details": "Catherine West MP said \"I'm appalled that as a Member of Parliament I'm being denied the opportunity to visit Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre and it concerns me that the Home Office is so keen to avoid scrutiny. My diverse constituency is home to many people from all over the world and the conditions of vulnerable women being held in centres like Yarl's Wood is an important issue. I have written to Theresa May to urge her to step in and get this decision overturned\"",
