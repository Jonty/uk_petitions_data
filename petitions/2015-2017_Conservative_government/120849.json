        "additional_details": "Between them, Asda, Co-operative Food, M&S, Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco, and Waitrose \u2013 account for around 87% of the UK grocery market. They were responsible for the disposal of 200,000 tonnes of food in 2013.\r\n\r\nThis is food that has past its sell-by date, use-by, or best before, and is still perfectly edible that is just put straight into the bin.\r\n\r\nAccording to an EU report into food waste, the UK is one of the worst offenders of food waste out of the EU 27 member states. \r\n\r\nThe UK should force supermarkets to foster deals with food banks and charities to collect the items they cannot sell so that as much food as possible can be used rather than put in the bin.",
        "background": "France has become the first country in the world to ban supermarkets from throwing away or destroying unsold food, forcing them instead to donate it to charities and food banks.\r\n\r\nThe UK should follow suit. ",
