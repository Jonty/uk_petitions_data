        "action": "Not allow a second EU referendum",
        "additional_details": "Many people in the REMAIN campaign did not like the result of the original referendum. The main point of breaking away from the EU was to get our democracy back. It would not be fitting if the very first thing we do with our hard won democracy is to overturn the result of a democratically decided referendum result. If this were the case, we can only conclude that we do not actually have the freedom to leave the EU. We only have the illusion of that freedom.",
        "background": "The will of the voting public was determined by a fair and constitutional referendum on 23rd June 2016. It would be anti-democratic, a waste of taxpayer's money and will maintain the current air of uncertainty to hold a second referendum. The country needs to move on in unity not dwell on the past.",
