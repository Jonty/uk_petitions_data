        "additional_details": "The average salary for 2016/17 in the UK is around \u00a328,000, the person earning this salary will only see around \u00a322,000 of it. To some people this may or may not be a lot of money but regardless of whether you think it is or not, that person worked hard to earn this money. Our contributions are not voluntary but they make a very big difference to our country which is why I believe we deserve at least 1 month in a year where our wages is tax free.",
        "background": "I earn an average wage and when it comes to pay day I still struggle with outgoings especially around Christmas time. I always find myself looking at my pay slip wishing that I could have 100% of the money that I worked hard to make, this is one of many reasons why I have started this petition.",
