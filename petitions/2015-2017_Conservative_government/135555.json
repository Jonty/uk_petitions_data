        "action": "The key terms of a separation from EU should be put to a public referendum",
        "additional_details": "The recent Brexit campaigning was filled with questionable facts (e.g. UK's contribution to EU at \u00a3350m/ week) and irresponsible speculation about the treaties that UK will be able to negotiate with EU (e.g. membership of EEA without any free labour movement rights). We the undersigned believe the people of UK deserve to know the key terms of any such separation, in order to make an informed decision, and for this another referendum should be called after such key terms have been negotiated.",
        "background": "In the recent Brexit referendum, the over simplified 'Remain/ Leave' led to nasty campaigns filled with scaremongering, and many people had to make uninformed choices. We demand that the key terms of a separation be negotiated within 3 months and then put to the British public in another referendum.",
