        "additional_details": "The EU referendum showed how divided our country is and how disconnected people feel from those who govern us.\r\nThe First Past The Post system of voting has been responsible for this disconnect - the Conservatives won the last election outright with only 36.9% of the vote. \r\nGreen Party and UKIP voters in particular were penalised by First Past The Post.\r\nMPs elected through the Single Transferable Vote would represent more fairly the diverse views of the voters and promote consensus solutions.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned call on HM government  to make our parliament more representative of people's views and introduce the Single Transferable Vote system of proportional representation to replace the current first past the post system which is clearly divisive.",
