        "additional_details": "-The referendum was flawed by misinformation and a false promise, already retracted, of \u00a3350M extra NHS funding per week. \r\n-Leaving the EU could lead to the breakup of the UK because England & Wales voted to leave the EU, while Scotland and N. Ireland voted to remain part of the EU.",
        "background": "-The referendum was advisory. Parliament should now decide in a free vote -that is what we elect them for. \r\n-Many of those who voted to leave, now have second thoughts because of the economic and political turmoil, devalued pound, increased racism and divided society that has emerged since the vote",
