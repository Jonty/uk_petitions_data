        "action": "Make incitement to gender hatred a criminal offence.",
        "additional_details": "We live in a society which nominally seeks to promote equality and which has seen advances in the equal treatment of different races, religions and sexual orientation.  The single biggest equality issue, however, must be gender equality simply because the two sexes represent essentially the whole of society.  Female public figures are daily derided and objectified in print and social media and have no specific legal protection.  This petition seeks to redress this.",
        "background": "It is illegal in this country to use deliberately inflammatory language about another person's race or religion if this can be demonstrated to encourage hate behaviour against that person.  It is, however, institutionally acceptable to objectify and deride a person based on their sex.  ",
