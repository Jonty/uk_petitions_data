        "additional_details": " I myself have spoken to a member of the staff at the Discretionary Payment office and was refused a grant on the basis that my income was too high. The reason for my income being so high was not because of work or anything of the like, was simply because my daughter is so severely disabled and on high rate DLA that she was also entitled to disability component of child tax credit's. That entitlement to the disability component of child tax credit's is what put my and come over.  Discrimination.",
