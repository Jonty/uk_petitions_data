It is a regular occurrence and the public don't want this to change. \r\nThe programmes the BBC produces or commissions are amongst the best in the world. \r\nThere are problems enforcing the current license fee, so consider a levy on household rates of \u00a3100 per household and a levy on business rates in line with its turnover. All to be index linked. Alternative methods of funding using the technology available to us today could be used.",

The Government is expected to publish the White Paper this week.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition which called for the licence fee to be replaced by a levy, of the kind you describe in your petition. \r\n\r\nWe could also accept a petition calling for Government funding of the BBC to be maintained and index-linked in future years. \r\n"
