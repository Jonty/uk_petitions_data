        "additional_details": "Currently you are only allowed two fresh and two frozen tries to conceive a baby. If you fall pregnant on these tries you are no longer allowed to have NHS funding for future babies. On average private IVF treatment costs around \u00a38,000 for one attempt. Although it is fantastic to have one child most parents want their children to have a sibling and this should be on the NHS with funding from them too.",
        "background": "At the moment you can only have one live baby through the NHS with their IVF scheme. This is a petition to allow people who need IVF treatment to have at least two live babies with NHS funding. Both tries should allow two fresh and two frozen cycles.",
