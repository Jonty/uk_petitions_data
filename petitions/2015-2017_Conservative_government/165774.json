        "additional_details": "Toilets are a major necessity for people who suffer from stomach/bowel conditions as they can be urgently needed at any time during a journey. This can prevent people from driving long journeys as service stations can often be few and far between. We ask that the government add chronic stomach/bowel illnesses to the list of conditions eligible for a disabled persons railcard. In some cases, people will choose a train journey instead of long car journeys to avoid embarrassment, anxiety and pain.",
        "background": "Many people who suffer from chronic stomach/bowel illnesses such as inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome will opt to use trains for long distance journeys, due to their accessible toilets, on demand. Due to the need for accessible toilets, we ask that sufferers receive a discount.",
