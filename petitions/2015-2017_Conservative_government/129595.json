        "additional_details": "I believe that women should be allowed to choose whether or not they wear high heels in the workplace.\r\n\r\nIf they choose to do so, companies are allowed to enforce a 'formal' dress code on their employees. At present, flat shoes are not recognised as being 'formal attire' for women. But they are for men. \r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition if you believe that women shouldn't be punished for wearing flat shoes at work. \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "I am a female, and a few months ago I was sent home from work without pay for not wearing high heels. It's still legal for an employer to force female employees to wear high heels as part of a 'formal' uniform. \r\n\r\nIt's 2016. I just don't think that's ok anymore. We deserve a choice.\r\n",
