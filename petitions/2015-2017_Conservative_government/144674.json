        "action": "Confirm that Art. 50 exit from EU can only be initiated by an Act of Parliament",
        "additional_details": "No doubt this technical point will be subjected to intense focus by those with real legal insight, however I believe that this point must be debated in Parliament as we cannot make such an important notification on the basis solely of a legal assumption. \r\n\r\nFurther, a General Election fought by one party purely on a Remain basis would effectively renew the democratic mandate (if that party was to be elected) thereby displacing the need for a 2nd referendum as requested by over 3 million people.",
        "background": "As the UK does not have a codified constitution, it is unclear as to how an Article 50 EU exit should be notified to the European Council; can the Prime Minister simply make that notification him/her-self, or does it require an Act of Parliament? If so, should this trigger a General Election?",
