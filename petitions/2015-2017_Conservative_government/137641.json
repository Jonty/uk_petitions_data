        "action": "Dissolve parliament and call a general election by October.",
        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson looks set to take the position of PM despite leading a campaign of repeatedly exposed lying and fearmongering. Both sides of the campaign behaved appallingly in this regard and the British public deserve to reevaluate the countries leadership based on dramatic new circumstances. The union is fragile but it can be saved. There is cross-party support and there is time to implement a new kind of politics to reflect our new place in the world. We, the people, are in charge. Not them.",
        "background": "The PMs decision to step aside following the EU referendum is the right one. However, replacing him with an unelected figure, is wrong and fails to acknowledge one of the principle sources of discontent with the EU. A leave vote was not a vote for a new PM, if we're to have one let them be elected.",
