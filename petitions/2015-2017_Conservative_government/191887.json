        "additional_details": "The 'Vote Leave' campaign advertised a fee of \u00a3350m per week going to the EU (\u00a318.2bn per year), while the ONS calculates the true value to be \u00a39.9bn per year (http://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-perspectives-2016-the-uk-contribution-to-the-eu-budget/). Brexit is predicted to cost an additional \u00a360bn (https://www.ft.com/content/51a19263-9788-37b9-a9fa-8cd307265edf). This will have consequences for government spending and tax rates - taxpayers must be able to understand where their money is being used.",
        "background": "The UK Government is taking us out of the EU whatever the cost.  During the referendum campaign, much was made of the cost of membership of the EU. There will be costs to leave the EU - public sector time, research and consultancy fees, legal costs, repayments, and so on. These should be shown.",
