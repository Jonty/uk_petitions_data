        "additional_details": "Recent examples of attacks in the UK include the killing of Lee Rigby, and the murder of officer Keith Palmer at the Palace of Westminster. Other examples of similar attacks have arisen in France, Belgium and Germany. However, in those countries an armed response was provided by the first police officers on scene.",
        "background": "The nature of policing in the UK has changed over past years, with ad-hoc and individual acts of terrorism becoming more common. In this environment, police officers are faced with situations where they lack the equipment and training to protect themselves or members of the public. This must change.",
