        "additional_details": "Have no internal borders in the UK & keep NI/ROI border open. \r\n\r\nAll UK citizens have the right to live in any UK country.\r\n\r\nEU citizens can live & EU law applies only in Scotland, London and NI but not in England & Wales. Non-EU parts have the right to deport illegal EU immigrants to EU parts of the UK.\r\n\r\nThis is like Greenland who left the EU but Denmark stayed in. \r\n\r\nNo Special Territories are as large as England & Wales, but navigating this will be easier than the whole UK leaving the EU.",
        "background": "Give Scotland, England, Wales, NI & London each a devolved government. \r\nEngland & Wales leave the EU but stay in the UK (as EU Special Territories like the Channel Islands). \r\nAllow London to be a self-governing city state in the UK and EU, separate from England. \r\nThe UK itself stays in the EU.",
