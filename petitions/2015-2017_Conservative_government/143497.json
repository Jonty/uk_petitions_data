        "additional_details": " David Cameron clearly said that his government would honour the results of the Referendum and do all that they can to facilitate the peoples decision.  If this petition by the Stay In campaigners is taken seriously and goes ahead it will only lead to another petition by the Brexiters to over turn that Referendum decision.  What are you going to do, spend then next few decades with petition after petition for more Referendums in order to over turn the peoples democratic decision?",
        "background": "Our country has just gone through turmoil in order to support the peoples democratic right to hold a Referendum on our membership of the EU.  Now the losers want to totally over rule the democratic process by petitioning for a second Referendum.  This is nonsensical and undemocratic to say the least",
