This story was printed in the Liverpool Echo were a vigil was held for Simon and many volunteers offered food to the homeless people sleeping rough ",

His name was Simon and he was only 33 years old and why did he die, because he was homeless and was reduced to sleeping in a doorway even through the extremely cold winter. Why weren't he given a warm bed and safe place to stay ",
