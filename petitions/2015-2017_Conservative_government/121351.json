        "additional_details": "The government is allowing fracking under national parks and residential areas despite the risk to life and the environment.

University education is becoming elitist and only open to the highest bidder, property ownership is only a dream for the majority. \r\n\r\nThis cannot go on.",
        "background": "Today Jeremy Hunt announced his intention to push through changes to the contracts of Junior Doctors, despite the UK public opposing the move and in contrast to his own over-inflation pay rise.
