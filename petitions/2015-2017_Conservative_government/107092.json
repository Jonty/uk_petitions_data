This picture has touched my soul. \r\n\r\n Holding my own son I could only imagine the pain and torment of his mother knowing the risk but it still seeming better than their own current situation. How could anyone turn their back on such helpless in need people yet allow thousands of people who have taken advantage of the current horrific circumstances, in order to gain from our already strained system.\r\n\r\nI find it ironic that our state has become a sinking ship yet many people still climb on, as so did that helpless mother when she climbed the sinking make -shift boat with her kids.
