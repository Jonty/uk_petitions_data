        "additional_details": "i haven't heard any other viable solutions to help tackle the issues of the increasing dog attacks, pet owners that don't pick up poo or ensure sociable behavior, using dogs as a status symbol, and the amount of dogs with health issues from bad breeding. the microchip law is a start but its not nearly enough and it doesn't tackle the issues of puppy farms. we need some solution to these issues and i would be happy to pay for a licence for my dog, despite the cost, if it helps the above issues",
        "background": "if dog owners and breeders had to buy a licence, it would cut down on irresponsible dog owners. if breeders had to have a licence and be inspected annually, like childminders, it would help to eliminate puppy farms, and create industry in the inspectors, if the cost of licence is significant enough.",
