        "additional_details": "Over 60% of Londoners voted to remain, a number which would have significantly increased if the vote was based on people actually living and working in London, or in the UK, who aren't British. \r\n\r\nLondon is the financial powerhouse of the UK & makes the most contribution to the economy, why is that those who contributed less where allowed to influence out future and those of our children? \r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of those between the ages of 18-50 wanted to remain, isn't this about the future?",
        "background": "In the wake of the catastrophe that is the United Kingdom declaring it's intent to leave the European Union, despite the lack of turnout, London (who voted in favour of remaining) and a lot of it's population would like the opportunity to become independent from the rest of the United Kingdom",
