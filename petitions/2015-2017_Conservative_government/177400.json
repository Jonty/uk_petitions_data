        "action": "Build a dual carriageway road from junction 37 M62 northwards to A1079 and York",
        "additional_details": "The A1079 has many accident black spots. Accident figures prove this. The road in parts is also liable to flooding, after heavy rain or snow. It needs upgrading and should be an extension of the A15 which currently finishes at the Humber Bridge west of Hull. The short cut from North Cave via North and South Cliffe would become considerably quiet. and a new junction south of Shiptonthorpe on the A614. would  make the environment safer for the residents of Holme On Spalding Moor.",
        "background": "Bypasses for Shiptonthorpe, Hayton, Dunnington, Kexby, Wilberfoss. The new dual carriageway road would finish at A64 roundabout on the outskirts of York. This would mean a safer environment for the local residents and reduce both vehicle accidents and injuries to people.",
