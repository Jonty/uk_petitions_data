        "additional_details": "In the UK a referendum such as the recent one on EU membership is not legally binding on the government, so there is no requirement to act on the result.  \r\n\r\nAlthough young people under 18 will be most affected by this, they do not get to vote.\r\n\r\nAnother referendum would be unlikely to produce a clearer mandate, and might produce a contradictory result to the first one, leading to protracted and pointless debate.",
        "background": "Although the referendum of 23/6/16 led to a narrow vote in favour of leaving the EU, the margin represents only about 2.7% of the electorate and the \"leave\" vote represents only about 27% of the population as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis seems a small mandate for such a momentous decision.",
