        "additional_details": "This has rendered 1000s of homes with dryers that are not fit for purpose and a danger to life. Hotpoint/ Indesit have also admitted that the repair can't be guaranteed. \r\n\r\nWith this in mind I urge that the government step in and replacement machines are given to consumers that have  said affected dryers free of charge as this is a design fault not a consumer fault.",
        "background": "In 2015 2 homes that I'm aware of burnt to the ground due to design faults with their dryer. This prompted buyers to be contacted in the first instance by letter. Once responded it took 3 months for a second contact. This gave details of estimated repair around 12 months later. ",
