        "action": "Do not cut NHS unsociable hours pay.",
        "additional_details": "The NHS needs a revamp and a boost, but not at the expense of front-line staff. It is not ideal to venture down this path and it would be an idea to explore other options, as opposed to cutting people's pay. The NHS also needs to encourage future employees and this is a solution, to a recruitment problem.",
        "background": "There is talk about fresh contracts to be implemented for the rest of the NHS staff. Due to the national shortage of healthcare professionals and workers, it would not be feasible to cut pay further. \r\nA lot of NHS staff rely on unsociable hours pay, to feed their families and so forth.",
