        "additional_details": "I don't think it's fair how somebody who has willingly signed the organ and blood donation register should go without vital organs they need to live, when there is people out there who would never contemplate signing the registers to benefit others. However these people who don't sign the registers still benefit from other peoples organs and blood but wouldn't be willing to give their own to help anybody else. It has to change!",
        "background": "I want to make the UK more fair! Nobody who isn't on the blood donation register or a registered organ donor should receive. Nobody who is a registered organ donor should go without an organ or blood when there's people who aren't on the organ/blood donor register receiving organs/blood.",
