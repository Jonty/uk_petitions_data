        "additional_details": "The UK Government has a responsibility to the millions of UK Citizens who voted remain. \r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the Government to support the establishment of a European Associate Citizenship. Such a move would soften the blow of Brexit for those passionate about the European project, ensure the millions of UK citizens who live and work in the EU can continue the lives they have chosen, and would give future generations the option to live and work in Europe. \r\n\r\nIt would cost the UK nothing.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Charles Goerens, MEP, has tabled an amendment calling for Associate Citizenship of the EU to be offered to citizens of former EU member states. \r\n\r\nThis proposal offers a realistic and worthwhile compromise for the 16,141,241 people who voted to remain, at no cost to the UK taxpayer.
