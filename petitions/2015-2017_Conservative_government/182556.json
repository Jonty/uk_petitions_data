        "background": "Leaving the EEA was not the subject of the referendum. The UK is a contracting party of the European Economic Area Agreement of 1994 in its own right, as is the  EU. The UK leaving the EEA would be an additional step, requiring a further democratic mandate, which the referendum did not itself supply",
