        "additional_details": "On International Women's Day, it is time for parliament to recognise the impact and positive influence that women have made throughout history and continue to make in modern society.\r\n\r\nMany of these women's incredible achievements have been despite the lack of support & recognition from society.  Let's stop that now.\r\n\r\nTime to include women.\r\n\r\nWe call upon parliament to include women through it's hall and walls.\r\n\r\nWhat do we want our young boys & girls to see when they visit? Their future. Together.",
