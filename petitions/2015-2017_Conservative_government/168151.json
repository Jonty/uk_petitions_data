        "additional_details": "Government announced further increases to tuition fees to \u00a39,500 in 2018.\r\nEven if fees were based on the standard of the University, this makes the better Universities more accessible to wealthier families. The current governent claims to want a country that \"works for everyone\" but instead supports only the elite.\r\nUniversity is free in Scotland, why can't our governent mimic this across the UK?\r\nLet's force a debate on the issue and stop the conservatives making life harder for young people.",
        "background": "Why should students be disadvantaged from higher fees?\r\nIf the proposed changes are based on quality, why are all universities allowed to increase fees? The government is misleading the public whilst indebting thousands of young people, and reducing social mobility.\r\nWe want free education for all.",
