So since he can\u2019t spend it on anything else and chooses not to fund \u00adhospitals, the Chancellor lets it sit there.\r\n\r\nWe need a lasting solution to fund a service we all depend on. So let\u2019s fill the black hole and fund a new National Health and Care Service with our own little pot of NHS gold.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the Tory government is trying to privatise the NHS through under funding until we have no choice but to privatise.
