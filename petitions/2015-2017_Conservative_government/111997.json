Her husband has a financial interest in G4s and given the Prime Minister promised the British Public he would clean up Parliament he sits by and allows this blatant abuse of public power. The Home Secretary previously hired Tom Windsor to start the demise of Policing and as a reward was made HMIC and Knighted .",
