        "background": "When a PM resigns with more than one year of term left, it is unfair that the British people should be governed by an unelected Prime Minister, selected only by members of their party.\r\n\r\nThis law would ensure that if a Prime Minister resigns, they effectively 'void' their party's term in office.
