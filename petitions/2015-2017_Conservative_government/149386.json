        "action": "Make Political ads subject to the ASA & hold 2nd referendum with new campaigns",
        "additional_details": "In 2003 the Electoral Commision decided that political adverts would not be subject to scrutiny from the Advertising Standards Agency-but did not put any code of conduct in place. There are no safeguards to protect the public from politicians presenting statistics that are attractive, but false. The recent referendum has had severe examples of this-impacting the public's ability to make an informed choice. Decisions as large as Brexit should only be presented when these safeguards are in place",
        "background": "It is clear that slogans used in Brexit campaigning were false.  E.g-the Leave statement of \u00a3350M/week for the NHS post Brexit were found misleading by the UK Statistics Watchdog & rescinded by Leave. This is for standards to protect the public & for a 2nd referendum once these changes are in place",
