        "additional_details": "The National Parks were introduced to enhance and conserve the natural and cultural heritage of an area and to promote understanding and enjoyment of the special requirements of the park.  There are 10 National Parks in England, which come under the National Parks Authority. These parks are well managed. The parks encourage visitation, improve facilities and work with landowners.\r\n\r\nThe Green Belt has no such provision, and as such is in reality merely a green blob on the map, which people are aware of, but rarely visit. Access for much of it is limited and not advertised. This is not good enough.  The public should have better access to this countryside and be better encouraged \r\nto use it. Retitling the green belt would also afford it better protection from developers. ",
        "background": "London and the south easts green belt was introduced as a breathing space for Londoners to visit and totals about 580,000 hectares.  Overall the green belt is poorly visited, poorly signposted and visitor provisions, such as disabled access and toilet facilities are  generally non existent.",
