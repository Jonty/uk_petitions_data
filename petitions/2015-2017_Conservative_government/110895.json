        "additional_details": "We call for the sale of all fireworks to the general public to be made illegal. We call for tighter control of the sale of fireworks to registered display organisers. Furthermore we call for better planning of firework displays to take into account not only residential areas, but also areas where animals and livestock are kept to avoid distress and injury.\r\n\r\nWe also call for a complete ban on what is know as Sky Lanterns. They are a real physical danger to people, animals and property.",
        "background": "The sale of fireworks and sky lanterns to the general public is an enormous health and safety risk. Every year people, animals and property are injured and damaged as a direct result of fireworks and sky lanterns (even if used correctly).",
