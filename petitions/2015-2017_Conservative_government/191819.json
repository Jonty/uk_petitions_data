        "additional_details": "Community options for adults with an ASD in North Wales are particularly limited, especially for those wishing to learn to live independently or those requiring a high level of care. It is imperative that these adults are in close proximity to their families, friends and familiar environments as any changes to routines and surroundings cause a huge amount of stress. Many adults forced to move away are suffering the consequences...mental illness, isolation and a reliance on medication. ",
        "background": "There are currently no 'Autism specific' supported living facilities for adults with ASDs In North Wales. Expecting an Autistic adult to move miles away from their homes, families and friends in order to access the care they require is wholly unacceptable considering the nature of the disorder. ",
