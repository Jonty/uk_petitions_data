        "action": "Allow voluntary payments by those entitled to Free Over 75 TV Licence.",
        "additional_details": "Many people eligible for a free licence find the BBC output of great interest and value.  Those whose income is adequate would like to resume paying the TV Licence payment and thus reduce this particular cost burden on the BBC. Attempts to make voluntary payments to TV Licensing have been rebuffed. ",
        "background": "When the free TV Licence was introduced, the cost was borne from national tax revenues.  The present government has transferred the cost to the BBC, thus reducing funds available for their broadcast output.",
