        "action": "Forbid the use of CCTV by local councils for parking enforcement purposes",
        "additional_details": "Taken from section 1.13 of Surveillance Camera Code of Practice, June 2013, Home office:\r\n\r\n\"Motorists may regard enforcement by cameras as over-zealous and relevant authorities should use them sparingly. Such systems should , therefore, only be deployed where other means of enforcement are not practical and their effectiveness in achieving this purpose is subject to regular review.\"",
        "background": "I am writing this as my local council is using a CCTV camera on a regular basis for the purpose of parking enforcement. The guidelines state this method should be used only \"where other means of enforcement are not practical\" - but nothing is more practical that a cheap and covert CCTV camera.\r\n\r\n",
