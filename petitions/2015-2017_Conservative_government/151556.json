        "additional_details": "The reality about the UK referendum is that:\r\n\r\nWhile the majority of votes cast were for leave, this was a minority of the total eligible electorate (37.4%) The majority of the electorate abstained or voted to remain.\r\n\r\nScotland, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar voted to remain. Only Wales and England have given the UK parliament a mandate for leaving the EU.\r\n\r\nWithin the regions that voted to leave the demographics show that both the major cities and young people wanted to remain in the EU.",

Political process and the rule of law must always protect the rights of the individual and minority interests from the tyranny of the mob. \r\n\r\nWe request ratification of any exit proposals within the regional assemblies and by Gibraltar's democratically expressed view.",
