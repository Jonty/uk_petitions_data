        "additional_details": "The NHS is facing chronic nurses and AHP shortages as demand for service continues to pile on pressure and yet staff feel that there are not being fairly rewarded.  Paperwork and workload is on the increase yet the pay has remained stagnant for a long time.  This puts patients at risk and the quality of care at risk.  Better pay may help retain a good workforce and motivate staff to retain NHS permanent employment.",
        "background": "Nurses and AHP's are leaving permanent NHS roles to work for agencies because they pay better and are more flexible, resulting in staff shortages on the hospital wards daily.   As a newly qualified nurse or AHP you cannot even dream of getting on the property ladder because it is not affordable.  ",
