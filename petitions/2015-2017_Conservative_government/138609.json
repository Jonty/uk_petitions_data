",
        "background": "In the wake of BREXIT and David Cameron's resignation it is time that the the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 was enacted and a vote of no confidence is raised. The British people deserve to choose who will lead any governing party and not install a conservative PM who wasn't elected by the masses. ",
