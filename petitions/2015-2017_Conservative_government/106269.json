        "additional_details": "Boots aren't the only store to adopt this  practice. For example Tesco disallow points on baby formulas and tobacco products, yet allow points to be rewarded on alcohol. So I guess parents who bottle feed their babies are as bad as smokers and worse than alcoholics?",
        "background": "Stores aren't legally allowed to be seen to promote bottle feeding. When i was refused store reward points I was left feeling like a bad parent who was not worth rewarding. Was I doing something wrong? \r\nBreast feeding is not always possible, stop discriminating against those who can't.",
