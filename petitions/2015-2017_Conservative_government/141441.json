This is not close but a clear win for the leave campaign.\r\nWhy are some people determined to try and not accept this fair and democratic vote? Sour grapes? Childish tantrum? just didn't believe they would lose? Your clearly out of touch with public opinion. Get over it, stop spitting your dummy out, be positive and accept we are out. We need to move forward now. We're OUT!",
        "background": "23rd June 2016, the UK voted to leave the EU with a clear result of well over a million votes. This was democracy at its best. For the people who cannot handle this result, grow up. Everyone had a fair vote. To now try and start a petition to have a 2nd referendum is pathetic. Accept it & move on",
