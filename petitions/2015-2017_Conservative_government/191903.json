        "additional_details": "Each side paying the expert witness creates an adverse incentive for the expert witness to create a supportive report for the paying side, particularly in relation to acquiring future work (an adverse report is unlikely to result in future work). \r\n\r\nFor that reason, legal cases may be compromised by the expert witness giving evidence that is not impartial. Requiring co-appointment of a single expert witness should improve fairness while also eliminating cases that are more clear cut.",
        "background": "Medical legal cases require an impartial expert witness to allow lay people to understand the context of medical terms, procedures and outcomes. These are currently appointed by each side and often give conflicting evidence. \r\n\r\nCo-appointment of a single expert witness will improve fairness. ",
