        "action": "Stop your plan to repeal animal welfare codes.",
        "additional_details": "This is starting with the Poultry industry (which includes chicken hatchers and breeders) and will be rolled out to the cattle, sheep and pig farming industries.  Charities such as the RSPCA and even opposition parties are rightly concerned that this will lead to a slow erosion of animal welfare standards in farms and lead to a decrease in prosecutions for animal cruelty.  They are planning on revoking the code on 27th April having already 'quietly' tabled a draft order.",
        "background": "A move to industry-led deregulation means the Government abdicating responsibility for animal welfare, abandoning their own official guidance and leaving it up to the Meat industry - one that clearly has a vested interest in relaxing animal welfare in order to further it's own profit-led agenda.",
