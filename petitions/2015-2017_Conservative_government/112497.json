        "additional_details": "Buy-to-let landlords are currently getting an average return on investment of nearly 9% (Daily Telegraph, 5 June 2015), but rogue landlords can multiply that several times over. Fines, generally limited to \u00a35,000 or \u00a320,000, are insufficient: this can be less than a month's income from a large property. If these landlords had simply stolen the money from their tenant victims, they would go to prison: why should they escape prison simply because they made their illegal gains through a lease?",
        "background": "At the moment, rogue landlords only face financial penalties if they breach licensing conditions or fail to make repairs. This is inadequate in comparison to the potential profits. The maximum penalty available for worst cases should be equivalent to that for theft, i.e. 7 years' imprisonment.",
