        "additional_details": "We feel the personal uncertainty, stress and anxiety added to the wider implications the nation will face due to the Brexit vote will be too much. This, to an extent, could be limited by clarification on what EU migrants should expect when the UK eventually leaves. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples;\r\n  \r\n:A legally binding commitment from the government that there will be no mass deportation of EU migrants (or other legal migrants) after the UK has completed its separation from the EU.  \r\n\r\n:If EU migrants may be forced to apply for citizenship after the UK has completed its separation from the EU.  \r\n",
