        "additional_details": "Mrs. May please Reconsider if we want a Brexit at all, polls suggest that many Brexit voters did so as a rebellious act never thinking that it would actually happen, the leave campaign walking back on many of their promises, leaving the EU is not in the best interest of the Britains residents as we are currently seeing how much of an impact we are having in our wallets. \r\n\r\nI would like to ask the PM to reconsider the idea of a Brexit at all, if not at least put it up for a parliament vote.",
        "background": "As we currently stand all of us who live in the U.K. Could say that we have been left with a better taste in regards to Brexit, many promises made none kept... not just that but currently the Pound is the lowest it's ever been, clearly we need to reconsider Brexit.",
