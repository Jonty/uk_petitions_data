        "additional_details": "- Government are demanding control of private childcare providers by promoting 30 hours of \"free childcare\" disregarding the sectors' protestations that they will be significantly underfunded.\r\n\r\n- All working parents earning up to \u00a3200K per household will be eligible for this.\r\n\r\n- Proposals are very different from the reality of what nurseries provide. They describe the minimum requirements, at the lowest end of the market, yet continue to promote the need for high quality childcare.",
        "background": "The pre-election pledge to provide 30 hours \"free\" childcare is unsustainable unless nurseries are properly funded to provide the high quality childcare the government promises. The gap between what government propose and what it costs is highly flawed. Parents need to know the true costs.",
