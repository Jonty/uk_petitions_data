        "action": "Stop the chance of a 2nd referendum and uphold the majority decision.",
        "additional_details": "Before the vote, the remain voters were ensured that they would have won. They did not bring up the need for a 2nd referendum based on the rules that state 75% turn out and a 60% majority as they were certain that they would have won. Now that the Leave supporters have won, the minority that is the leave supporters have now attempted to veto the need of the majority, however small, because they did not get what they wanted. It is not democratic to silence the majority. Stop the 2nd referendum!",
        "background": "With the referendum confirming that the UK electorate want to leave, the petition and pushes for a 2nd referendum will go against the decision of the majority. This is not how democracy works and the chance of another referendum should be blocked.",
