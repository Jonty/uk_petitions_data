        "additional_details": "The EU Referendum asked just one question, which exposed many divisions and problems in our society, while failing to offer concrete solutions to tackle any of them. \r\n\r\nWe want to vote on detailed plans for healthcare, education, international trade & investment, immigration, defence, regional development, farming, energy, pensions and many other areas. \r\n\r\nWe do not want an unelected Prime Minister & Cabinet who have not presented a manifesto and have no electoral mandate. \r\n\r\nThat is not democracy.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call upon our MPs to present and support a motion for a General Election under Section 2 of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011.\r\n\r\nCurrent MPs were elected on manifestos that presumed EU membership. We have a new political & economic reality, making previous manifestos obsolete. ",
