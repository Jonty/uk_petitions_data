You will lose these rights unless they are protected.\r\n\r\n1) Free Movement of Persons: (skip the Schengen section)\r\nhttp://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayFtu.html?ftuId=FTU_2.1.3.html\r\n\r\n2) Free Movement of Workers: (different emphasis: this is oriented to the Single Market):\r\nhttp://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayFtu.html?ftuId=FTU_3.1.3.html\r\n",

The EU Referendum text did NOT instruct the UK government to sign away these rights: so they COULD be preserved in the Brexit agreement.",
