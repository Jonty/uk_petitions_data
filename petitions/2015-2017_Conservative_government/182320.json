        "additional_details": " Many are left disappointed when they've been waiting for an hour before sale and then still don't get tickets. The frustrating part is when tickets have only been sold out for the matter of minutes and start popping up on third party sites for ridiculous asking prices. It is unfair on true fans. I'm asking the government to step up so that you can only resell tickets at face value.",
        "background": "Seeing your favourite artist live is every fans dream and will do anything to buy tickets. It is unfair when people take advantage of this and sell the ticket(s) for double even triple the face value in other to make a profit. ",
