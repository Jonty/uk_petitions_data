        "additional_details": "The figures used by the leave campaign are inaccurate and misleading.  The campaign was led by individuals that put their own interests above the public interest.  The \u00a3350 million figure was one of the lead claims - it has been proven misleading. The political broadcasts used misled the public (the ASA have no power to deal). Nigel Farage said on TV that monies saved by exiting are not guaranteed to the NHS, despite this being a lead claim. Therefore the results of this referendum are illegal.",
        "background": "The leave campaign have provided misleading and inaccurate information in order to secure votes against remaining in the EU.  The electorate have therefore been misled into voting to leave the EU on false pretenses.  The results of the recent referendum should be declared null and void.",
