        "additional_details": "Sarin gas has the potential to end a life within ten minutes of exposure. This is because once this chemical finds its way into the body it manipulates neurotransmission activity by making the body act against itself. This may lead to convulsions, paralysis, and death. Some of it indicators are pupil constriction, blurry vision, and chest tightening. This lotion specifically counteracts the effects of chemical warfare by blocking the skin from absorbing deadly chemicals.  \r\n\r\nTaking immediate and effective action now and distributing these kits across this region and other conflict zones in Syria may then disincentivise the carrying out of chemical attacks again. ",
        "background": "With the use of drones, immediate assistance can be provided by dropping these RSDL kits to civilians and hospitals in and around the Khan Sheikhoun area as continued strikes against their facilities has made treating patients incredibly difficult.   ",
