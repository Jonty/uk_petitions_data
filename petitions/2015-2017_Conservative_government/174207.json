        "action": "Extend child transport fees to the age of 18 in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "We are a group of 16-17 year old politics students who face this issue directly and daily. As we live in a rural area, public transport is extremely important to our lives. Even those of us who are in paid work are on minimum wage of \u00a33.87 (or \u00a33.30 for apprenticeships), and our places of education suggest to us that, as students, we should not work more than 10 hours a week.",
        "background": "16 and 17 year olds are considered children in politics by not having the right to vote. They are also subject to the Education and Skills Act, making full time education compulsory until age 18 in the UK. As they are not in full time paid work, they should not pay adult fees on public transport.",
