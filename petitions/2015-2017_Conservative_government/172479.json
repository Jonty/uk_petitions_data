They will bombard other customers with offers, special promotions etc so that they keep on gambling with them. Others get restricted or banned if they win too much. I do not see people in supermarkets being restricted or banned because they only purchase special offers!\r\n\r\nI call for the UK government to put similar legalisation in place that allows all punters to be able to win a nominal amount on all sporting events.\r\n",
        "background": "I am a successful punter who can make long term profits from the bookmakers. Following my mathematical model, I have been restricted to pennies or banned  from bookmakers. In Australia laws have been approved for bookmakers to pay out a certain amount on all bets placed by all customers.\r\n",
