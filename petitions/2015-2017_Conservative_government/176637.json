You can use this page to find out who your local councillors are and how to contact them:\r\n\u00a0\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\u00a0\r\nOnce an application is made for the development to take place, all local residents have the right to request that a planning application be \u2018called in\u2019 by the Department for Communities and Local Government. This means that it will assess the planning application against certain criteria and decide if a full inquiry is needed. For more information, including the criteria and how to request the call in of a planning application, see:\r\n\u00a0\r\nhttp://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN00930/SN00930.pdf \r\n\u00a0\r\nYou could also contact your local MP, who may wish to request the decision is called in if they agree with you. You can use this page to find out who your local MP is and how to contact them:\r\n\u00a0\r\nhttp://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/ \r\n\u00a0\r\nIf you want the UK Government or Parliament to take action, for example to amend the legislation and policy framework which governs planning and development decisions taken by local authorities, you could start a new petition specifically asking for that action, giving as your reasons the proposal to develop green belt land in Manchester and its likely effects.\r\n"
