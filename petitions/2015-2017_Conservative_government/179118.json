        "additional_details": "The executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump and its consequences have been widely covered in the press. Many people currently travelling but living in the USA are suddenly separated from their loved ones, including refugees. The order is officially motivated by \"anti-terrorism\" but does not make anybody safer anywhere, no national from any listed country has commited terrorism on US soil. The UK must send the clearest possible signal of disapproval by recalling the US ambassador.",

This includes refugees, holders of visas and green cards, and current. U.S. residents. The UK should officially recall its ambassador to the US in protest.",
