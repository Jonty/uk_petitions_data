        "additional_details": "Putting safety before shareholders, makes sense, benefits rail users, and can help fund rail projects, many of which have been suspended by the current government(http://gu.com/p/4a5f4/sbl).\r\n\r\nThis means of operation, where the state, or a state-owned company runs the railways, is not only a proven means of operation, but is the only way of rectifying the brutally opportunistic fares system, and lack of progress on mass electrification.",
        "background": "The railway network used to be owned and operated, on an not-for-profit basis, by British Rail. It was privatised many years back, and since, the pricing of tickets has since risen unfairly, with for-profit companies charging obscene amounts of money for sub-standard services. This needs to stop.",
