        "action": "Stop schools from giving awards for 100% attendance.",
        "additional_details": "Many of the childhood illnesses children contract are caught from their classmates, at school. Many of these illnesses, such as chicken pox, rotavirus and impetigo, require children to be absent from school for a minimum period of time before returning. This means the 100% attendance award is an impossibility and awarding it to children who have somehow managed not to suffer from these illnesses throughout the school year makes other children feel inadequate. It's discriminatory and must stop. ",
        "background": "Schools often issue awards for children who attain 100% attendance. Apart from the fact that this discriminates against many children who have medical appointments which cannot be arranged out of term time, absence from school for certain illnesses is required, making 100% attendance impossible.
