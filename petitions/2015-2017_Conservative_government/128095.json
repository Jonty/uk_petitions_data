        "additional_details": "Many people have to travel for specialist cancer care which costs a lot especially via public transport. I propose that these fares get reimbursed for cancer sufferers and their families OR the government puts more money into cancer and has specialised treatment available more locally across the country. One family is spending in excess of \u00a3200 a month to go backwards and forwards to London. At such a traumatic time, finances should not be adding to the worries.",
        "background": "Too many people are spending a lot of money getting to and from appointments with cancer specialists. They should be reimbursed for these appointments or have more cancer specialists at local hospitals",
