        "additional_details": "We also believe that in a democracy, the winning party should be called to account should they breech any manifesto pledges including ones they make in the media and TV debates.\r\n\r\nAll parties lie during election campaigning, and this is intolerable to the electorate.\r\n\r\nEG. David Cameron made a concrete pledge never to cut tax credits, his government did just that. He promised to reduce immigration, it has risen to record levels.\r\n\r\nThis should also lead to government termination and fresh elections.",
        "background": "As voters, we have grown increasingly tired of politicians lying to the voters in order to get into office. In any other setting this would be construed as engaging in fraud and deception and would certainly result in a criminal prosecution.. We think politicians should NOT be exempt.",
