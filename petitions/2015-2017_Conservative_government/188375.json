        "additional_details": "Thousands of people in the UK battle every day with severe Anxiety and PTSD.  We, the under-signed, felt 'punched in the face' yet again by the comments recently made by George Freeman MP. His statement that anxiety sufferers are not really disabled only serve to increase the stigma shamefully still surrounding Mental Illness. Benefits like the Personal Independence Payment enable sufferers to pay for any help that is necessary for them - something they are often denied by the NHS. Mr. Freeman's remarks are unacceptable from a Government which claims to want to help mental health sufferers. We ask that the Government keep its pledges, made by Theresa May in January of this year and 'tackle the stigma of mental illness' and stop degrading the 'day-to-day hell' of living with Anxiety.\r\n",
