        "additional_details": "Too much evidence to list, but the BBC advertising Ban Trump petitions http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38795998 is a good example. See the HaveYourSay on it(bottom of page). Every HYS they do (and HYS people are BBC sign ups) show the BBC do NOT reflect majority opinion. \r\n\r\nThe recent story of a BBC reporter asking Trump OFFENSIVE questions on May's US visit (making Trump famously quip \"there goes that relationship\") is classic. As a state broadcaster, the BBC is NOT free to HARM US/UK relations. ",
        "background": "The BBC has been waging WAR on democracy, hating on Putin, hating on Trump, hating on Brexit. Now we have this situation where Trump is made to feel unwelcome and it could set back Brexit and US / UK relations a decade. This Bias needs investigation. Will the BBC advertise this petition? ",
