        "additional_details": "Having reviewed the existing plans many residents are sceptical about the motive for this junction. They believe that the new junction would only serve to channel traffic towards a new Mersey Toll Bridge crossing (currently under construction) and will do nothing to ease the serious congestion issues that already exist between Junction 12 and 14.",
        "background": "Highways England are planning to introduce a M56 junction 11a. The plans squeeze a new junction between 2 existing junctions that are no more than 4 miles apart. No evidence has been offered by Highways England to justify it's need or cost. It would have a severe impact on several local communities.",
