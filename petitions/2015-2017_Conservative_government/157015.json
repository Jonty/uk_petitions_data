This was overlooked due to the establishment's broad support for the EU, and the presumed mandate from the 1975 referendum. \r\n\r\nThe people have now voted to Leave the EU. Therefore any attempts to overturn the result of the referendum via parliament, further referendums or any other means must be considered treason. The law must be enforced.\r\n\r\nRepeating the referendum until we agree with the EU will not be tolerated.",

The people instructed HM govt to leave the EU; any attempt to overturn this vote must be prosecuted as treason.",
