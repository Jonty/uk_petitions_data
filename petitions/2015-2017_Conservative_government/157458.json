        "additional_details": "The drug is harmful but not as much as alcohol. If people want to take the drug they will, its readily available in every town and city across the u.k. People can even get hold of it in prison. The least we can do is use the money that would be generated towards helping and educating individuals and ultimately creating safer communities by removing profits from criminals. It is ludacris to think that keeping it illiagal is safer for anyone or to think that it could ever be stamped out completely",
        "background": "The government say that keeping cannabis illiagal is keeping communities and individuals safer? Safer by leaving money in criminals pockets and by criminalising individuals that make bad life choices. The excessive strain on our already limited police force and waste of tax payers money is criminal.",
