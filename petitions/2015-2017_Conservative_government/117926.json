At the same time huge numbers of houses are left unoccupied, have low occupancy or are kept empty, to be used occasionally as second homes. New house building will not help solve this issue, as the rents will be too expensive (while others will prosper from a building bonanza). \r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to give these people without homes a stronger representation in parliament.",
        "background": "Our society fails to adequately care for many people without homes. At present nobody directly represents these people, and many are not given a vote.   This is a question of caring for those who need help.  \r\n",
