There is nothing stating that the Government cannot reject the result, or hold a second one if neccessary. This is what should be done.",
        "background": "The UK and Gibraltar went to the polls to decide on its Membership with the EU on the 23rd June 2016. There is nothing in the European Union Referendum Act 2015, which states the Government has to accept the decision. We therefore urge the Government to reject it.",
