        "additional_details": "Shropshire CCG say that Path House would be better suited to a location in either Shrewsbury or North Shropshire as it is \"under-occupied\". It's our belief that Path's location in Ludlow is what makes it such a special and unique service, the town provides peace and calm and for the majority of our guests that come from larger towns; Ludlow offers the anonymity that guests largely benefit from. The location is only undesirable from the point of view of the CCG in terms of traveling the A49 for reviews and transporting guests. From our point of view and that of the guest; the location is what aids and improves recovery so that guests can return home sooner than they ordinarily would be able to. ",
        "background": "The fundamental benefit of Path House is to offer guests a homely but therapeutic alternative to hospital admission as this is financially very costly and often vastly unnecessary or inappropriate for the individual; preferring a less extreme route to recovery. ",
