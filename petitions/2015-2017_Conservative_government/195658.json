        "additional_details": "I'm a 16 year old who studies politics for A- level and so I understand the implications of political decisions, but I am not allowed a voice until the age of 18 and it would be so much easier if me and my friends could do this by voting in an election. \r\n\r\nCurrently over 1.5 million 16 and 17 year olds are currently denied the vote in the UK, and i feel that this needs to change especially for this general election.  ",
        "background": "Prime Minister, Theresa May announced a snap general election on the 18th April 2017, and seeing as the voting age wasn't lowered for the Brexit referendum in which the consequences of that referendum would affect those around that age the most, and so it should be changed for this general election.",
