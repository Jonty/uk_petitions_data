Councils gave planning permission to 250,000 homes, only 140,000 homes were built. It would be prudent for the the secretary of state to refuse to allow plans, including borough plans, that involve greenbelt, until all other avenues are explored and any problems or obstacles to construction on alternative banked land are resolved.",
