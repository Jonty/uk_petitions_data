        "action": "Ensure there is an A level Food subject available to teach in schools from 2017.",
        "additional_details": "It is essential that a food subject is available to be studied at A level to ensure we get teachers, nutritionists, dietitians and technologists in the future. Students can study to GCSE level but Food is the only subject not to have an A level from 2017. A consultation about D&T:Food Technology is being held but Food and Nutrition has just been wiped with none! This restricts choices and potential careers in all areas of the food industry. Please support this petition to keep a Food A Level.",
        "background": "The government are not reforming the current A levels in Food and Nutrition or Food Technology and are taking them off of the curriculum from September 2017. We need to change their minds and show our support for this crucial subject.",
