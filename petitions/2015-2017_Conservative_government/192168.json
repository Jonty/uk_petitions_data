        "additional_details": "In a war do people always say who they are, or what they are doing? ISIS claims to be a Sunni group, yet attacks all the other Sunni rebel groups, and very little the Shia-based regime. Raqqa has been the ISIS capital in Syria since 2014, yet regime bombing against it has been negligible.\r\n\r\nAn unexposed connection, both economic and military, between ISIS and the Syrian regime is one of the main blocks to peace.\r\n \r\nAre we fully investigating one of the strangest wars the world has ever seen?\r\n",
        "background": "In 2015 a little Syrian boy, Aylan, is washed up dead on the shores of Italy, and the shocked world said: \u201cEnough. Enough. The conflict must end.\u201d But today the war continues. Why? \r\n",
