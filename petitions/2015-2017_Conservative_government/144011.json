        "additional_details": "37% of the 65.1m population in the UK voted to exit.  Both 16 and 17 year olds and many UK nationals resident in the EU were excluded.  They are directly impacted by this decision and should vote in any future referendum.\r\n\r\nExit terms were not available at the referendum.  The electorate is unclear in relation to many issues.  It is undemocratic for exit terms, once negotiated, to be implemented without the electorate agreeing such terms as they are likely to be different from those envisaged.\r\n",
        "background": "The referendum did not present exit terms to the electorate.  It is undemocratic to exit until terms are presented to Parliament to decide if a referendum is needed to ensure terms are in accordance with the wishes of the electorate.  Citizens aged 16 and over, wherever resident, shall have a vote.",
