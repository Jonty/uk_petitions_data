        "action": "Educate society about Epilepsy and eradicate the stigma surrounding it",
        "additional_details": "Educating children from a young age in a First Aid class would severely decrease the stigma around epilepsy and therefore allow those with epilepsy to feel more accepted in the community. By placing a programme of First Aid in primary and secondary schools where children learn about what to do when witnessing a seizure- not touching the person or placing anything in their mouths etc- would make epilepsy a much less lonely and frightening condition. ",
        "background": "More than 500,000 people in the UK have epilepsy, which is a condition that affects the brain and causes repetitive seizures. There is a stigma around epilepsy that needs to be addressed, starting with the lack of knowledge the public have about what to do when someone has a seizure. ",
