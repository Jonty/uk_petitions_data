        "additional_details": "If your driving a car most people get frustrated if somebody infront is doing 50mph so they usually try to overtake. On the other hand tho driving a van you feel pressured to drive at the same speed as cars because you know people get frustrated and drive closer to try and make you speed up. Lots of van drivers risk points and a fine by driving at 60mph but they shouldn't have to it's not the 1950's anymore... Up to 3500kg gross should be allowed to do the same speed as cars.",
        "background": "The speed limits were set when stopping from 60mph didn't happen quickly and neither did getting to 60. Everything is safer and more capable now, some vans perform and brake faster than a lot of cars. It would be safer if we all did the same speed rather than people trying dangerous overtaking",
