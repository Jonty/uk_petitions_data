        "additional_details": "At present legislation is so insufficient that one private healthcare company actually stated in a legal defence document that they were \u2018under no obligation to provide competent surgeons to perform surgery at the hospital\u2019 and had \u2018no duty to protect patients from harm, and risk of injury\u2019.\r\n\r\nWe ask Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt  to close the legal loophole which allows for private healthcare patients to be left without protection or redress when things go wrong. ",
        "background": "Private healthcare patients are commonly led to believe that the care they are paying for will meet the highest standards. \r\nIn cases where patients receive wrongful or negligent treatment  private healthcare patients have less access to adequate redress and compensation than NHS patients.
