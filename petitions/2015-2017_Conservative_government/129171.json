        "action": "Make it illegal for pension funds to be plundered.",
        "additional_details": "When Robert Maxwell, another \"entrepreneur\", plundered pension funds  years ago there was a public outcry but nothing has been done to prevent this happening again.  Why not?  Pension funds should be ring-fenced so that they cannot be plundered.  The money which will have to be found to meet this pension gap would be spent better on doctors, nurses, the NHS in general, better treatment of the older generation and many other causes. Meanwhile the person responsible for this walks away.",
        "background": "Once again an \"entrepreneur\" has plundered the pension fund of many working people - this time British Home Stores.  The shortfall will have to be met by the British Taxpayer while the \"entrepreneur\" walks away.",
