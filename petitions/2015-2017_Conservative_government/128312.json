Currently the service does not take into account that the receiving parent could be with a high earner potentially putting another family in poverty. It also does not take into account an older child whom maintenance is being paid for is in part time work. ",

The system at presents potentially can take from one child to give to another. Finances from both families should be assessed to make a fairer system.",
