Service Providers have already shown that they are unable to protect the data they currently hold on their customers. This bill increases the amount of personal data that they hold without taking the security of that data in to consideration. Examples of this are Talk Talk, Yahoo & Sony. The UK should be focusing on improving individuals online security not introducing measure to exploit it. ",
