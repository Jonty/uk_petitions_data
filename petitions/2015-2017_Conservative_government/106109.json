        "additional_details": "New research shows more than seven million children are at risk of exposure to asbestos at school.\r\n\r\n80% of school stock is in poor condition, allowing deadly asbestos fibres to become airborne during the school day.\r\n\r\nChildren exposed to asbestos are nearly four times more likely to develop mesothelioma, an aggressive cancer, than adults.\r\n\r\nNew legislation is needed to force local authorities to alert parents when asbestos is discovered in their child's school.\r\n",
        "background": "More than 85% of UK schools contain asbestos, which is easily released into the air during the school day. Asbestos exposure causes cancer, and other life threatening diseases.\r\n\r\nThere is currently no legal requirement for parents to be informed when asbestos is discovered in their child's school.",
