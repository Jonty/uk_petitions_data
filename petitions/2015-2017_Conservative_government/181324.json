        "action": "Hold a General Election to allow the British Public their say on Brexit",
        "additional_details": "We're on course to a Hard Brexit and straight into the arms of the USA and President Trump. This is not what we voted for. Many were swayed by the promise from prominent Leave campaigners that we'd receive an extra \u00a3350 million a week for the NHS. Even more powerful was the idea that we could 'Take Control' and 'Make Britain Great Again.' Without an election, the British Public are robbed of the control they were promised and denied the chance to play their bit to make Britain Great, again.",
        "background": "We've heard many politicians and much of the media insist that Brexit is a mandate for this or a mandate for that, but the only mandate the Government has is simply to 'Leave.' I propose we hold a General Election to unify the nation and give the public a chance to articulate what Brexit should mean",
