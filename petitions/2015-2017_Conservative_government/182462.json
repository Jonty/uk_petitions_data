        "additional_details": "This would also stop individuals being landed with very high invoices that are unaffordable as the risk/bill will be shared across the insured community.\r\nTo go even further the government could advise and ensure that travel insurance is an optional extra when travel into the country is purchased. It would be very easy for airlines and other travel companies to give the option of adding travel insurance when paying for the fare online.",
