        "action": "Upon leaving the EU withdraw completely from the European Single Market.",
        "additional_details": "The free movement of people from other EU countries to the UK is in accordance with Article 3(2) of the Treaty on European Union and Article 21 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and is in direct conflict with the wishes of the people and our democratic demands. This would not \"blacklist\" the UK for EU nationals, it would simply mean they would be required to apply for citizenship in the UK and this will allow us to control immigration sensibly.",
        "background": "Membership of the European Single Market (ESM) requires the UK to allow free movement of people into our country from other EU countries. As free movement of people in to the UK was a major reason that the people of the UK voted to leave the EU it is not reasonable to remain in the ESM any longer.",
