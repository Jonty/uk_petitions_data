        "additional_details": "The EU referendum result does not legally require article 50 to be invoked. Article 50 gives official notification to the EU that a member country wants to leave. We should not issue this notification without informed parliamentary debate on the pros, cons and possible consequences of remain/leave. The elected government should make the final decision, taking into account the views of the entire population.",
        "background": "The UK public have signalled a wish to leave the EU via a slim majority following a politically charged referendum. The actual decision to initiate UK exit should be taken by elected members of parliament following a considered debate based on facts and evidence.",
