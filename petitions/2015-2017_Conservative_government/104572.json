This is a travesty beyond all comprehension. ",
        "background": "This government is nasty, regressive and punitive. \r\n\r\nOver half of the people in this country didn't vote for them - this is not fair or proportional representation of the electorate. \r\n\r\nMillions will suffer due to this ideological austerity mantra and it must be stopped.
