        "action": "Prevent Article 50 from being triggered without parliamentary approval",
        "additional_details": "The next Prime Minister of the United Kingdom will be decided by members of the Conservative Party, comprising just 0.003% of the total electorate. As things stand, this individual will have sole power to trigger Article 50, which will begin a two-year countdown to Britain's formal departure from the EU. If this is mishandled, it could unleash terrible economic and legal consequences, and could even result in the breakup of the United Kingdom. It should therefore require Parliamentary consent.",
        "background": "We recognise that the United Kingdom has voted to leave the EU. However, formerly triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty will have vast economic, legal and social ramifications. We therefore ask that legislation be passed ensuring that Parliament has the final say over when and how this happens.",
