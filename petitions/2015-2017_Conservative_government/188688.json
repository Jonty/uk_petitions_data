        "additional_details": "After BREXIT the UK will set VAT rates on this. \r\n\r\nClaiming e-formats are a service but paper is not is ridiculous since both formats require:\r\nan author\r\nan editor\r\nformatting\r\nOnly paper requires tree felling, transport, manufacture, printing, storage, eventual disposal. Re-pulped books require de-inking & disposal of toxic waste.\r\n\r\ne-formats need little oil, produce little toxic waste & add almost nothing to carbon emissions.\r\n\r\nThe government should encourage e-formats by removing this bizarre VAT.\r\n",
        "background": "Ebooks and paid e-literature  (electronic newspaper/magazine subscriptions) carry 20% VAT but paper books, newspapers and magazines are zero rated for VAT. \r\nIn the past we have been told that EU legislation prevents a 0% VAT rate and that e-literature is a 'service'. ",
