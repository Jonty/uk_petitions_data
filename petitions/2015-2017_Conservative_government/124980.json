        "additional_details": "Each paper cup contributes to 0.11kg of C02.\r\n(Starbucks with Alliance for Environmental Innovation, April 2000)\r\nEach cup requires 200 litres of water; the production of cups and lids contributes to the loss of millions of trees, the loss of habitat and to the degradation of the ecosystem.  \r\n(WWF; www.appropedia.org/paper cup) \r\nThe technology needed to produce 100% degradable or recyclable cups is not widely available. Precious resources are wasted now. A charge would reduce the consumption of single-use cups.",
        "background": " Every year, 3 billion cups are thrown into landfill sites in the UK, taking up valuable space and resources.\r\nCharging for each cup will raise awareness of the single-use cups impact on the environment and encourage consumers to carry their own re-usable cup (as we now carry our own bags).
