        "additional_details": "The behaviour of Nigel Farage to the EU Parliament on Tuesday 28th June was offensive and highly counter productive. Britain needs to show reconciliation to move forward and a debate about a formal apology for his behaviour would be an excellent step towards finding a civilised solution. Even if the UK Government does not make the apology the number of supporters from the public, and the fact that it has been debated, will be noticed and signal that Nigel Farage does not speak on our behalf.",
        "background": "\"We the undersigned would like Parliament to debate a formal apology from Westminster to the European Parliament on behalf of the British people for the outrageous and offensive behaviour of Nigel Farage on Tuesday 29th June 2016.\"",
