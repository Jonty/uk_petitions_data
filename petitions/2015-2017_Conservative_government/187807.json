        "action": "To make the Welsh Baccalaureate non-compulsory subject for A-Levels in Wales.",
        "additional_details": "This being a compulsory subject takes up a valuable option space for many students. Most students taking the minimum of three A-levels only choose two A-Levels in total.My concerns about the Welsh Bacc are that this qualification is recognised in welsh universities but it is not an entry requirement, meaning that this option could have been used for a more appreciated subject. I strongly believe it's time where students a have full choice about what they want to do in the future.\r\nFor many students including myself believe that this takes away a valuable Alevel option that we can no longer undertake.",
        "background": "Having Welsh Bacc as a compulsory subject for ALevel can have adverse affects as the student are unable to choose an ALevel which is more relevant to their future career requirements. It forces the students to use valuable resources which could otherwise be used for other more appreciated subjects.",
