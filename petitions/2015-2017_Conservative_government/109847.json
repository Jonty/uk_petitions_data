        "additional_details": "We've done questionnaires and 90% agreed and wanted insurance lowered to a reasonable price.\r\nMinimum wage for an 18 year old is \u00a35.13, which means they would have to work at least 435 hours to afford the average car insurance price of \u00a32232.Excluding the prices of driving lessons, both theory and practical tests, the car itself and road tax.",
        "background": "The car insurance price is extortionate for the money they are able to earn from possibly their first job. Young drivers are discriminated against as being careless drivers, when in fact they feel a sense of achievement when they can finally afford their own car.",
