        "additional_details": "We have received numerous emails confirming the Bank of England's use of tallow in the new \u00a35 notes. They excuse its use by referencing the use of tallow in soaps and candles, the purchase and use of which is a choice made by the consumer. The use of money is not.",
        "background": "The new \u00a35 notes are created using polymer. The polymer pellet from which the base substrate is made contains a trace of a substance known as tallow. Tallow is derived from animal fats (suet). Stop the Bank of England using tallow in the new \u00a35 notes and replace it with something ethical.",
