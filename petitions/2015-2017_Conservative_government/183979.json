Even grandparents are dying of a broken heart. I am in contact with grandparents & fathers all over the United Kingdom. It breaks my heart to hear these stories. We will continue to stand outside Parliament every month until the law is changed and I have a lot of people who are depending on me.",
        "background": "There are thousands of grandparents out there, through no fault of their own, are refused contact with their grandchildren. This is totally unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThe law has not been looked at since 1995. This is a disgrace. It is now Feb 2017. We need the law changed now!!! Too much talk and no action.",
