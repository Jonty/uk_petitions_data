        "additional_details": "British citizens have been also been citizens of the EEC/EC/EU since 1973. For many this status has been lifelong, they are a 'birthright' and identity highly valued by many of the 16 million (48% of vote) who voted to remain in the EU. Morally, a provision must be negotiated for those that wish to retain some formal status & rights as a European citizen to do so - perhaps as an optional British/European status. Citizenship shouldn't be something that can be taken from people on a narrow vote.",
        "background": "British citizens enjoy certain rights, status and identity as citizens of the EU, many have held this since birth. Whilst the UK might have voted to leave the EU, some continuation of this citizenship must be negotiated. This could be some form of optional dual British/European citizenship.",
