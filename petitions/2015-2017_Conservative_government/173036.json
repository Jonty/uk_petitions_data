The NHS is struggling and we have a huge social housing crisis.\r\n\r\nWe should not be using public money on such low priority things. Make the queen take a loan like the rest of us would be expected to do. If they earn enough money from tourism that should pay for the repairs not the tax payers money.",
        "background": "Buckingham Palace is about to be given a \u00a3369m refurbishment. Tax payers are paying for it. The Crown and its estates should be made to fund its own renovations.",
