        "action": "Misrepresentation of facts in run up to EU referendum must trigger re-run.",
        "additional_details": "As an example, the BBC Reality Check Website demonstates how misleading some of the facts used were.  As they were not corrected during the referendum they bring the result into question.\r\n\r\nAfter the referendum there are numerous examples of press coverage showing people did not understand what they were voting for and if offered the option to vote again would vote differently.\r\n\r\nLike financial contracts, this is an important decision, so should be treated with similar safeguards.",
        "background": "Considering the momentous importance to the United Kingdom of the Referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the EU, serious misrepresentation of the facts before, and likely events after the result, means Parliament must pass an Act to re-run the vote as soon as possible.",
