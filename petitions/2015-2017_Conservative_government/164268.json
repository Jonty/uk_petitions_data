Parliament is sovereign except that it shall not diminish its own sovereignty.\r\n\r\nAs Parliament at various times has seen fit to transfer sovereignty to the EU, it is illegal under International Law and should cease forthwith including any procedures laid down by the EU for secession from the EU and withdraw unilaterally,",
