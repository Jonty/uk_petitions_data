        "additional_details": "The UK has always been fastidious in following the rules though they are often ignored by Germany and France.  We are leaving the EU and there is no longer a moral need to keep to these rules.  By not setting up new deals NOW we risk leaving the EU with only the deal that the EU wishes to give us.  We need to replace the trade with the EU with other trade pacts that will give the EU the incentive to give us a fair trade deal beneficial to both sides. ",
        "background": "Article 50 is intended to cause restrictions and harms the UK economy.  We need to sign new deals before the EU imposes a deal on us that requires the UK economy to start from scratch at the end of the 2 year period.  We need to start now to get deals as an incentive for the EU to give a good deal.",
