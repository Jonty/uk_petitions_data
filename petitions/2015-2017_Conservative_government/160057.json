        "additional_details": "Both sides made claims that were difficult to back up with facts but whilst you can stir up emotions and play on peoples phobias about immigration etc, you need a clear plan of how this will be delivered. The biggest issue is that the country has been lead to vote for Brexit and the people driving the motion such as Boris have swiftly disbanded and have left other politicians to pick up the pieces. How can these promises of such magnitude be made with nobody held responsible for delivering them?",
        "background": "Whilst we are proud to live in a democracy, we trust that those in power will look after our interests and represent us fairly in matters effecting our relations with the rest of the world. Misleading the public emotively by promising to reduce immigration, provide much more for NHS was disingenuous",
