        "additional_details": "To this day M.E has always been pushed to one side and has been ridiculed compared to most other serious conditions. The M.E community needs more accurate awareness, knowledge and understanding into our condition. At the moment M.E gets NO government funding and therefore we have to fund current biomedical research trials through our own fundraising efforts and donations.  M.E needs to stop being ignored and pushed to one side and needs to be researched into/recognized as a serious disability!",

Many sufferers are unable to work/care for themselves and 25% of M.E patients are bedbound. This year alone M.E and the lack of understanding for this condition has been the cause of many deaths",
