There was no justification to refuse this age group the same right as they had in the Scottish referendum\r\n\r\nThe exclusion of the 16-17 olds from the right to vote in the referendum will lead to more alienation and a greater rift between the generations.\r\n",

Those citizens that will be 18 at the implementation date should have a right to vote.\r\n\r\nThe younger a citizen is the more effect the decision will have on their lives.",
