        "additional_details": "On 08/04/2016, the UK Council for International Student Affairs received the following:\r\n\"A student who needs more time to complete a course can only apply for further leave to do this if they meet one of the exemptions set out in 120A(a).  A student who undertakes a work placement would be changing their course and would therefore need to apply from overseas if they wanted to extend their leave to complete their (new) course.\"\r\nThe explanatory memorandum to HC877 does not detail this consequence.",
        "background": "New Immigration Rules (HC877) require students to return home if they secure a work placement year or perform better than expected and are upgraded (e.g. BEng to MEng). This is penalising the brightest and best, it is unfair and damages the UK's reputation. This decision should be reversed.",
