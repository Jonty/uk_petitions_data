        "additional_details": "With the council tax increase from the 1st of April the council are making it impossible for people to live. The elderly survive on pensions, single working parents end up having to top up on their rent and council tax, single parents live on income support. We are going to suffer immensely with the rise in council tax and potentially have to scrimp and scrape just to pay for council tax. Something needs to be done to support the members of the public ",
        "background": "Due to personal experience it has resorted me to start this petition. I myself am struggling with how expensive council tax is as a single parent trying to study. From the 1st of April 2017 council tax will be rising by 4.3%! How are people expected to pay the increase on minimum wage or benefits?",
