Foremost leave campaigners recently clearly stated that the latter two arguments are also untrue. Cohesiveness within the EU is now fractious. Millions of voters who were swayed by misinformation now regret the way that they voted wish they had voted to remain in the EU.\r\n",

We call upon our representatives to act immediately to regain stability by giving oath, in parliament, that they will vote against invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, thus ensuring that the UK remains in the EU.",
