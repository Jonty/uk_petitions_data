        "additional_details": "Blood & Transplant make the point that their Donor Carers have excellent needle skills and that B&T have developed various distraction and coping techniques to enable donors to donate without anaesthesia.\r\nFor those who simply have a fear of needles, this is an excellent step forward.  For those whose anatomy makes donation a complicated, prolonged and painful experience such techniques will be of little use.\r\nThe withdrawal of Lidocaine will only save the NHS about \u00a330,000 per year ",
        "background": "Donating blood is, generally, pain-free but for some it can be very painful.  Anaesthesia is available for those donors who need it but\r\nfrom April 2017 it will no longer be available.  \r\n\r\nIn my own case, I was advised never to give blood without anaesthetic after an incident at a donor session.",
