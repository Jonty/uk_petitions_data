        "additional_details": "Miley cyrus has just released a new song and in this song it sexualises infants. She is throughout the whole video dressed up as a baby, in one scene she is laying on her back with her legs open wide. This to me is disgusting. Too many songs and videos are containing too much sexual content. When kids grow up they want to be inspired, and yes sex is going to be around but these types of songs and videos are throwing it into their faces making the risk of underage pregnancy much higher. ",
        "background": "Recently, over the last 10 years music & especially music videos have become too vulgar for tv. Songs contain way too much about sex, drugs, hustling, etc. Kids are subjected to these songs when they are listened too by the parent and when they get older too. ",
