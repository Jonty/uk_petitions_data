        "action": "CALLS FOR TOUGHER AIR GUN LAWS",
        "additional_details": "A survey of 1,000 vets carried out by a leading feline welfare charity  shows that many more cats are killed in air gun attacks than 20 years ago, prompting a call on governments in England and Wales to make it a criminal offence to own an air gun without a licence or permit.  \r\n\r\nThe findings are particularly concerning, given a leading criminologist has warned that some people who shoot cats could go on to commit similar crimes against  humans. \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "An alarming rise in fatal air gun attacks on cats has led to calls for a change in legislation to restrict the sale and use of air weapons. This rise suggests that more powerful air guns are being used. Injuries to the head and body are most common, with many cats left blind or partially sighted.",
