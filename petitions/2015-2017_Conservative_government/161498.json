        "additional_details": "After the rise of the price of the UK national lottery and the added numbers (making it more difficult), there is a proposed rise in the cost of the Euro Lottery and added number/s. The greed of these companies feeding off the poor has to stop! The boundaries and chances of winning are pushed even further away. I ask that a freeze be placed on the current price and that no other numbers are added. also, I ask that there be a cap on the jackpot and that the prize money be spread to other prizes.",
