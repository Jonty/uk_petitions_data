        "additional_details": "The M25 makes a perfect border and passport controls can easily be sited at all the London exits. We will look to establish trade agreements with England and Wales, Scotland will no doubt be separate and back in the EU so no problems there. If Oxford, Brighton etc. decide to leave the UK too at a later date we would be open to forming an alliance or City State Union (CSU). Independence for London!",
        "background": "Only 5 out of 32 London boroughs voted to leave with 59% of the vote in favour of staying. In many central London boroughs over 70% were in favour of staying in. London has spoken decisively, the time has come for us to leave the UK and go it alone. We can then negotiate staying in the EU.",
