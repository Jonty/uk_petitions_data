        "additional_details": "I am a driver myself and I witness nearly every single day, other drivers on there mobile phones pulling out in front of me or travelling behind a vehicle which is swerving all over the road only to notice when passing them they are either texting, posting on social media or talking on their mobile phone. The scary thing about this is they are unaware of my presence and a lot of these drivers are driving heavy goods vehicles making accidents potentially more dangerous with a lot more casualties.",
        "background": "Every driver is fully aware of the dangers but a large amount of drivers continue to ignore the law and insist on using their mobile devices whilst driving causing serious injury and even death due to their ignorance for the law. They should be disqualified instantly.",
