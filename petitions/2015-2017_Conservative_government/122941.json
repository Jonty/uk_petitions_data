While talking to a receptionist on the phone I overheard a patient saying they had come to A and E because they'd had a sore throat for 2 days.  This should be stopped!  A and E stands for accident and emergency the clue is in the title!  They are not doctors surgeries or pharmacies! ",
        "background": "A and E departments are being misused.  This is causing backlogs and ambulance queues. Staff should be allowed to refuse to treat anything but accidents or emergencies.  ",
