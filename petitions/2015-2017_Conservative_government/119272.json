Please look at this map and see that by that logic Chile should have a bigger claim.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tierra_del_Fuego\r\n4)Argentina is in the G20.\r\n5) Why is the UK made to look like bad guys?  ",
        "background": "All 14 Overseas territories have the right to self determination. Spain demands Gibraltar and adds to tension between the UK and Argentina. When Argentina (who gets UK foreign aid) acknowledge this sovereignty our military can be withdrawn thus saving millions in tax payers money that the NHS need.",
