The aim is to attach the product to things that are valued to the society. A product should be advertised for what it is, the good/healthy/practical things should be shown. For when we buy a product, we buy it to aid us, Not to buy because the advertisement gave us something that was an illusion.",

I've wondered why food products are advertised with green hills, blue sky, illuminating sun, when the ingredients are far from nature and closer to the laboratory. The aim is to make the product LOOK natural.",
