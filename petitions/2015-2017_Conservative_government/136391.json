        "action": "Name the 23rd June to United Kingdom's Independence Day",
        "additional_details": "On the 24th June Nigel Farage was quoted saying that this is Britain's Independence Day. By renaming this historical day we have an annual reminder of what our lives were like in the dark ages and how as a country we have moved on from life under the iron fist Mr Juncker and Angela Merkel. Now as a free nation our new Prime Minister can pass legislation freely without EU regulations, and I hope that he/she makes this their primary legislation to pass through and make it a historical one.",
        "background": "On 23rd June the people of the United Kingdom voted on a referendum to decide the fate of their EU membership. This great result led Great Britain to leave the European Union. This is a historical moment in British politics, and to name a day after it is shows our country's commitment to leave.",
