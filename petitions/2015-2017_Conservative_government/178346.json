        "action": "Make handfasting a legal ceremony",
        "additional_details": "The Marriage (Scotland) Act 1977 made Pagan weddings and handfastings legal in Scotland, allowing Norse, Druids & other Pagans to obtain legally recognised marriage ceremonies in accordance with their faith, but at present Pagans in England & Wales do not have that right.\r\nWe request that the government recognise how important it is for people to be able to be joined in matrimony in accordance with their religious beliefs and give Pagan handfasting legal recognition in England and Wales without prejudice and without having to have a second ceremony to legalise the commitment.",
        "background": "The tradition of handfasting has been practiced for thousands of years pre-dating any wedding ceremony concocted by any modern religion/faith. These have their marriages recognised by law and there is no good reason why this same right should not be extended to include Pagan faiths.",
