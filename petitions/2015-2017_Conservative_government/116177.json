        "additional_details": "The UK Government has to act now, to protect the people. We cannot wait for terrorists to kill and maim hundreds, perhaps thousands.\r\nGovernment cuts are affecting front line services, despite the assurances from George Osborne. We don't need people who can quote laws or arrest jaywalkers, we need people that can shoot a terrorist in the head to stop them activating a suicide bomb or murdering hundreds with a Kalashnikov There are thousands of ex forces who can do the job. Protect the People! ",
        "background": "Everyone knows that it is only a matter of time before Islamic terrorists strike in the UK. If we are forced to wait for the police to attend, hundreds could be killed. We need an armed volunteer force to supplement our police force.\r\nThe Home Guard worked in the last war, and it will work this one.",
