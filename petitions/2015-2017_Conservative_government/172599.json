        "additional_details": "As it stands at the moment the councils street cleaning teams who collect domestic pets/road kill from the side of the roads do not have to scan for a microchip. It should be a legal requirement that they scan all deceased pets for microchips, informing owners and keeping records of animals killed by vehicles.\r\n\r\nOwners go to great lengths to ensure they are informed should the worst happen to their companion yet authorities are not playing their part.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "When a cat is hit and killed by a vehicle, it is devastating for their owners. But sometimes, when a\u00a0cat goes missing, its owners\u00a0may never find out if they are lost or have been killed in a road accident. There is no closure for the owners and their feelings of loss may go on and on.\u00a0\r\n",
