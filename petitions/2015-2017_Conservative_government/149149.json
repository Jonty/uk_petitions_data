        "additional_details": "We urgently need to clarify whether the people of the UK really do want Brexit. In light of the narrow referendum result and the many negative repercussions unfolding, and the Prime Minister's resignation, a snap General Election would clarify whether narrow support for Brexit translates into a pro-Brexit parliamentary majority. If it does, Brexit negotiations can begin. But if a pro-Remain majority emerges then Parliament would have a legally binding mandate to disregard the referendum result.",
