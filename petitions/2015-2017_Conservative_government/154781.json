This could be based on geographic location as well as individual wish, eg NI, Scotland, London, Bristol voted to Remain and individuals elsewhere did so as well. A 'virtual' or disjoint EU member state could be created to allow those who wish to keep their EU citizenship.",
        "background": "Half of the UK voted to Leave the EU and half voted to Remain in the EU. With such a small difference between the two opposing sides whichever decision is taken will be in direct conflict with the half of the population.\r\n\r\n",
