        "additional_details": "With the popularity of cycling in the UK on the up, the numbers of people regularly committing offences such as cycling on the pavement is also increasing. Research has shown that cyclists now represent almost as much danger to pedestrians as motorists do, that the injuries inflicted can be as damaging and nearly 100 people in the UK are killed by cyclists each year.\r\n\r\nMaking this offence arrestable and increasing the fine will act as a better deterrent and improve pedestrian safety.",
        "background": "It is a criminal offence in England and Wales to cycle on footways such as pavements, walkways and foot bridges. The current penalty for this is a measly \u00a350 fine despite the danger to pedestrians.  Cycling on footways should be arrestable, the fine increased to \u00a31,000 and cycles seized until paid.",
