        "additional_details": "Statistics and death rates show that women younger than the minimum age requirement (25) are contracting and dying from cervical cancer.\r\nYou have to be 25 years old to qualify for a smear test in England, even though women are sexually active for many years before, even having children before this age too. It is very important to get a smear done and this requires more awareness. You cannot put a price on a life, lower the age! ",
        "background": "Every life is precious and I believe if cancer can be prevented, detected and treated early via a smear then the government should seriously consider lowering the age restrictions on cervical screenings.  ",
