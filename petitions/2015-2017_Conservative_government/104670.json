        "action": "Extend trade union bill to include donations from companies to political parties",
        "additional_details": "  David Cameron says that giving money to a party should be an act of free will. In fairness therefore, the scope of the proposed bill should be widened to include donations from companies to political parties, requiring that:\r\n-\tCompanies are obliged to ask all shareholders if they wish to opt in to any donation proposed by the directors to be made to any political party\r\n-\tThe donations must be funded by a pro-rata deduction in the dividends paid to those shareholders who have chosen to opt in.\r\n",
        "background": "The proposed trade union bill will force union members to opt in if they want to pay a political levy. Many companies make contributions to political parties, but their shareholders are not given an opportunity to opt either out or in. ",
