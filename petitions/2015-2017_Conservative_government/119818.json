        "additional_details": "Google\u2019s UK revenue in 2013, as reported by the BBC, was \u00a33.8 billion. If they were to properly account for its UK profits, & its global profit margin of 20-something percent holds true, it would have made something close to \u00a3760 million in 2013. At the UK corporate tax rate of 20 percent, that would result in a tax bill of \u00a3152 million, but Google paid only \u00a320.4 million that year. That's an effective tax rate of just over 2.5 percent.",
        "background": "At the end of last week, Google agreed to pay the UK treasurer \u00a3130 million in back taxes, covering the period since 2005, and to also pay higher taxes in the future. UK Chancellor George Osborne hailed it as a \"major success.\" The numbers disagree.",
