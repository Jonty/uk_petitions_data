        "additional_details": "The plans were unveiled by the Tory Government without warning at a little-attended House of Commons committee.\r\n\r\nAll new tenants will be given short-term leases of between two and five years and then face a reassessment that could see them booted out of their homes.\r\n\r\nThis will have a disastrous impact on communities across the country.\r\n\r\nWe urge them to think again and restore this long-held right for council tenants immediately.",
        "background": "The Daily Mirror has launched a Save Our Council Homes campaign to try to stop the Tory attack on council tenants.\r\n\r\nWe are strongly opposed to the Government's plan to end lifetime tenancies for people living in council housing.",
