        "action": "Rerun Brexit referendum with voting rights for all British citizens abroad.",
        "additional_details": "British citizens living abroad for more than 15 years were excluded from voting in the Brexit referendum. The Conservative Party 2014 manifesto committed to lift this undemocratic exclusion, but the provision was not implemented before the referendum. In May 2016, the supreme court rejected an attempt to force the government to grant these citizens a vote in a matter which affects them more than any other political matter in the last 50 years. The ruling was not challenged in the European court.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call upon HM Government to annul and rerun the Brexit referendum, because over 1 million British citizens living abroad were prevented from voting under the 15 year rule.",
