        "additional_details": "As a nation of pet lovers we try to keep our pets safe and away from harm. Extendable leads provide the owner of a dog \"control\" from a distance but actually they do more harm than good. These leads provide little or no control over your dog and at times the failure of the mechanism in these leads have led to the tragic deaths of several dogs. Extendable leads dont keep your pets safe they are a tragedy waiting to happen. ",
        "background": "After a close friend lost her beloved pet in an accident involving an extendable dog lead I want the government to ban these dangerous leads. Not only have several pets been killed but adults and children are also at risk to injury. \r\n ",
