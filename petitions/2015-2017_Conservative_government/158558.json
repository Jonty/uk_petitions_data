        "additional_details": "When Athletes sign up to a professional body, the rules state that it's mandatory for a urine test is to be provided upon request to ensure there is no dishonesty in gaining an advantage over the competition.\r\nThe same should go for those running for positions of power.\r\nThat is why we propose that after any speech or TV debate, politicians & MPs should take a lie detector test with questions about their main points to ensure their honesty.\r\nIf they want our vote they should prove their intentions",
        "background": "We the British public are sick of being lied to by the very people who claim to represent us. On the back of an immoral and dishonest campaign, 'pledges' were made to gain votes(which were negated on within hours of the result).\r\nClearly,a change is needed to bring honesty back into British politics",
