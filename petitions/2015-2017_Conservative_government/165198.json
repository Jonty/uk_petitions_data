        "action": "Abandon the alternative HS2 eastern route  through South Yorkshire.",
        "additional_details": "The original route followed the M1, with a station at Meadowhall, travelling on through Barnsley to Leeds.  The new proposal provides a link to Sheffield (via Chesterfield) using existing, slow lines.  It is the worst of both worlds. No station in South Yorkshire, and links make the line little better than existing trains. The 'extra capacity' trumpeted by HS2 would be better provided by investing in the existing rail system. The idea that it will 'drive the Northern Powerhouse' is ludicrous'",
        "background": "The newly announced eastern route through South Yorkshire will destroy homes, natural habitats, important geological sites and some of the most beautiful countryside in the county. Our land is cheap and we don't matter. HS2 won't benefit residents who have to watch the 'rich man's toy' flash past.",
