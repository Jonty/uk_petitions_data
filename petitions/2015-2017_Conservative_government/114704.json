        "additional_details": "1. Pheasants and partridges shot for sport are usually bred in cruel battery cages.\r\n2. Indigenous wildlife species such as Buzzards, Red Kites, Foxes and Crows are snared, trapped and killed to maximise the number of game birds available for shooting.\r\n3. Introducing approx 35 million birds into the countryside each year upsets the ecological balance and takes food from indigenous wildlife\r\n4. The majority of game birds shot are not used for food. \r\nSee Animal Aid & League Against Cruel Sports",
        "background": "Approximately 35 million birds, such as pheasants, are introduced into the British countryside each year and shot for sport.  Shooting for sport is cruel, has a major impact on indigenous wildlife and some gamekeepers kill other species to optimise the number of \"game birds\" available to shoot.",
