We strongly believe that the \u00a3350m that was premised by Boris Johnson and other 'vote leavers' was a wild plea and inaccurate plea to influence the British public. While free business trading was dismissed, attention was drawn to the improbable and humanitarianly refugee situation. Tell us what it really means; please, for the future of the current generation.
