It is difficult to see how the UK Government could return to the Treasury money that it has already spent. \r\n\r\nThe Government would also be unable to take funds from the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign. The funds of this campaign are not public money. The Government has not given any funds to the campaign -  under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 the Government is not permitted to contribute financially to any campaign as it is not considered to be a \u2018permitted participant\u2019. \r\n\r\nThe EU Referendum Act 2015 included provisions for the Government to spend money on and publish a leaflet setting out the Government's position on the EU referendum. You can find out more about the EU Referendum Act 2015 here: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/36/contents/enacted/data.htm\r\n"
