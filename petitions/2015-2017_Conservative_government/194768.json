        "additional_details": "Private housing not yet built are already being bought up by rich owners who are ready to rent it back out at extortionate prices. This is a scam designed to keep the pockets of the already rich lined while the rest of us get our last pennies together. If we invest in social housing we invest in ourselves.. but the rich don't want that. Socialism is already here, the emergency services, the schools, the NHS.. don't be fooled. We need more owned by the public, not the rich few.",
        "background": "It is a complete travesty that, while the private sector is seeing a housing boom, the social sector is being left to rot. This country NEEDS more housing for those who will never get on the housing ladder.",
