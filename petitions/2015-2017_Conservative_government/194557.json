The Government have essentially taken away our rights as parents to decide what is best for our children. The Government should give us back our rights as parents to make decisions for our own children or find a solution to reduce holiday prices during the school holidays. If prices weren't increased so much during the school holidays, parents wouldn't feel the need to take their children out of school during term time.",
        "background": "As parents, we aren't allowed to take our children out of school unless they are ill or in exceptional circumstances. As we all know, air fares rise and many families simply cannot afford to take their children abroad during the school holidays.",
