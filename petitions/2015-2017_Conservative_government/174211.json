        "additional_details": "If you search through websites and ask any Call of Duty fan they will tell you how great this game was, this needs to come back into peoples lives, not only will it be the GREATEST but it is guaranteed to bring crime rates down, you ask any little badman out there and they will tell you that they'd play this game if it came back out, this would stop little yobs harassing people on the streets as they will all be inside keening this up to get to the highest prestige, you won't regret this.",
        "background": "Modern Warfare 2 was one of the greatest games on Xbox 360/PS3, most people now have an Xbox One or PS4 so are no longer able to play this masterpiece of gaming. One of the greatest if not THE greatest Call of Duty games in history and I'm sure many people would appreciate it back on their consoles.",
