        "action": "Make childcare costs exempt from Income tax",
        "additional_details": "1. According to an OECD report - The UK has the highest costs of childcare for any country apart from Switzerland - 26.6% of average family incomes, compared to an OECD average of 11.8%.  \r\n2.  While the long term solution would be to bring the childcare costs down, making them tax exempt would atleast provide some relief in the interim.\r\n3. Families are bringing up the future generation, who will work, contribute to pensions, support the elderly and society.",
        "background": "We request the Government to make the child care costs exempt from income tax. This will help in two ways\r\n1. Help provide relief to families \r\n2. Help bring more people especially women into the workforce.\r\n\r\n",
