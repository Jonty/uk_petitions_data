        "additional_details": "Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06111), the only way a General Election can be called before 2020 is if the House votes for it with a two-thirds majority or if a the Commons passes a motion of no confidence and no new Government can be formed within 14 days. We believe the current situation warrants a vote on an early election.",
        "background": "The political turmoil at the highest levels of Government since the recent EU referendum is deeply concerning. Whatever is going to happen next, we believe that a new, strong Parliament is required with a clear mandate to lead the country.",
