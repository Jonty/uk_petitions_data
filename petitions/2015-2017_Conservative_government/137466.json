        "additional_details": "The recent referendum on Britain's membership of the EU has seen repeated assertions that we send \u00a3350 million a week to Brussels, with subsequent claims that we would be able to reallocate that same amount upon leaving. \r\n\r\nThe UK Statistics Authority, along with many other organizations, declared this to be misleading and yet the claim was repeated verbally, in campaign materials, on posters and on the side of campaign buses. This simply should not have been allowed to continue. ",
        "background": "Currently, misleading parliament is properly punished to prevent nation-affecting decisions being based on poor information. \r\n\r\nWe believe a senior figure in a referendum or general election campaign should be held to similar standards, with action being as timely as possible.
