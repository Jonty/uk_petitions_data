        "additional_details": "Towards the end of a school day as it is, there is a lack of concentration from students.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor says that his plan is to enable us to have the best future possible. He's wrong. The longer the school day, the more problems there are.There will be more reports of bullying, leading to lower grades, stress, anxiety, depression, and even suicide. ",
        "background": "George Osborne recently announced his plan to help increase a standard school day to being eight hours long. This is simply ludicrous. As a current student, I can say that the additional time will not be useful. Students want to spend as little time in school as possible. This is not what we want.",
