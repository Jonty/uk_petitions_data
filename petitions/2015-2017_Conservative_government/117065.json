        "additional_details": "Investigate thoroughly, create flood defences and take appropriate action to prevent flooding in the future to the homes and business in the areas affected.  These people deserve flood defences that work and not sand bags, it is not acceptable to say that the level of rain is unprecedented.  As a country we provide aid for floods and such disasters in other Countries but it does not seem that that this is reciprocated.",
        "background": "We have areas in England that are regularly affected by flooding and the defences that have been created and action taken are not resolving the issue.  We hear from the Environmental Agency and the Government that it could have been worse but it is obvious that much more needs to be done.",
