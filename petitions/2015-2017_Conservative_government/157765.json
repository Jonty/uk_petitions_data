        "background": "It is already clear that key elements of the Vote Leave campaign (e.g divert \u00a3350m a week to the NHS, or stay in the Single Market while denying freedom of movement to EU citizens) are not achievable. The UK needs a full debate on the true options available before deciding to invoke Article 50.",
