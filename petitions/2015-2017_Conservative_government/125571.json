        "additional_details": "Now that we do not have to display tax discs and everything is computerized, road tax should run for either 6 or 12 months from the DATE IT IS INSTIGATED. \r\nNot everyone can MOT their car on the 1st day of the month and neither can sell or take their vehicle off the road on the last day of a month, so we are paying needlessly.\r\nParticularly now that you cannot sell a vehicle with the road tax included, the government are receiving tax from both parties during the month when a sale takes place.",
        "background": "MOT certificates and insurance run from the day you instigate them, so why must car tax run for WHOLE MONTH periods? \r\nIt is illogical and a complete rip-off that vehicles need to be taxed for full months when they cannot be used because one of the above items may not be current or the car is sold.",
