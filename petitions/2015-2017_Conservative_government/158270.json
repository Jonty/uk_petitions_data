        "action": "The Queen should be asked to stop Art 50 being invoked because of the referendum",
        "additional_details": "The narrow victory for Leave in the recent referendum, and the likelihood that initiating Article 50 will lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom, leave the UK in a very difficult position. Political parties are in chaos. \r\nThe Queen has the power to stabilise the United Kingdom and it would help if she were advised to do so by Parliament.",
        "background": "In the light of the threat to the integrity of her United Kingdom and the narrowness of the vote, Members of Parliament should request that Her Majesty the Queen use the powers invested in her to ensure that Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty is not invoked on the basis of the June 23rd referendum.",
