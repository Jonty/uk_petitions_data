        "additional_details": "It has emerged, in the recent report, allowing Transgender people to change their gender, on their passport, without a medical certificate. This is a big step, but there's much further to go. The 'X' box gender should be allowed, and therefore this legislation should be changed, recognising all gender identities, be that to one, all or no genders. Everyone is valid and deserves to be represented. ",
        "background": "Currently, the only genders recognised under the law are 'Male' and 'Female'. This makes people who do not identify as either gender uncomfortable and is discrimative. Please change this legislation. ",
