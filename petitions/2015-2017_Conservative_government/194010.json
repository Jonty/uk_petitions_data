        "additional_details": "Countries from which furs and fur products can be legally imported to the UK: \r\n\r\nMain suppliers: China, North America, South America, Russia and Europe.\r\n\r\nOther suppliers: Belize, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, El Salvador, Greenland, Hungary, Jordan, Lebanon, Mexico, Maldovia, Nicaragua, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Poland, Republic of Korea, Republic of Slovenia, Romania, Slovak Republic, and Turkey.  \r\n\r\nWild furs imported to the UK include muskrat, beaver, raccoon, marten, fox, coyote, bobcat lynx, sable, and nutria. \r\n\r\nFarmed furs include mink, fox, raccoon and chinchilla. \r\n\r\nFur causes unimaginable pain, fear and physical and mental suffering to millions of animals every year. It has no place in such a civilised country as the UK. ",
        "background": "The government banned fur farming in Britain in 2003 but it can still be imported from other countries. The UK imports both farmed fur and wild fur. Countries from which fur and fur products can be imported legally include those that have very weak or no animal welfare laws at all. ",
