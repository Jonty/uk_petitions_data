        "action": "Declare A Motion of No Confidence in Her Majesty's Government And Opposition",
        "additional_details": "There is currently no legal means by which the general public can declare a motion of no confidence against either Her Majesty's Government or Her Majesty's Opposition. Governments can only be removed from power by the public during a general election. Neither party has shown itself to be in any way prepared to handle the detachment of Britain from the EU, or even a willingness to do so in the manner the British public expects. As such they must be removed from office immediately and replaced.",
        "background": "The fallout of the EU referendum result has demonstrated that neither Her Majesty's Government nor Her Majesty's Opposition can in any way be trusted to fulfil the mandate handed to them by over 17 million British voters, and it is now necessary to demonstrate the public's lack of confidence.",
