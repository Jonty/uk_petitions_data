        "additional_details": "Many residents living close to the 1600 level crossings with 'whistleboards' didn't receive a letter forewarning them of this 'adjustment', as Network Rail underestimated the number of households affected. Eight hours sleep is recommended for adults, more for children. Health is as important as safety. Trackside residents all over Britain are losing sleep, don't leave bedroom windows open at night, and their properties may have lost value as a result of the short Night Time Quiet Period.\r\nReferences:\r\nNetwork Rail: Adjustment of the Night Time Quiet Period Dec 2016\r\nRail Safety and Standards Board: Annual Safety Performance Report 2015/16\r\nRail Accident Investigations Board ",
        "background": "Train drivers hoot when approaching crossings, to warn people not to cross. In 2016, 4 people were killed on crossings, sadly. Up to 10th December, trackside residents enjoyed 8 hours quiet from 11pm to 7 am. Since then, the Night Time Quiet Period has been cut by two hours, from midnight to 6 am. ",
