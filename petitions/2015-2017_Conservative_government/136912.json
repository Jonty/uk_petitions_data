        "additional_details": "A majority of Northern Ireland's voters chose to remain part of the EU. This shows a contrast between Northern Ireland and England in terms of vision.\r\nN.I's economy is heavily dependent on agriculture and regional development subsidies from the EU. We are not confident that the UK would adequately distribute funds into such programs.\r\nOne also cannot deny the Republic of Ireland's very close cultural and geographic links and that the Island of Ireland was once one entity while part of the UK. ",

A border poll is vital to maintaining  Northern Ireland's place in Europe and allowing the people to have their say. ",
