        "additional_details": "screening from birth will contribute to giving children with SCID an increased survival rate. Rather than waiting until the child becomes unwell and then discovering that their body cannot produce T-cells to fight the infection. If made aware earlier the bone marrow transplant will have an increased chance of being accepted, this will increase the death rates within the United Kingdom. ",
        "background": "SCID is a disorder that can be tested from birth to determine if a child has a deficiency of RAG 1 & 2, which is essential TCR & BCR development. Children that have SCID basically have no immune system and in many cases this is discovered around 6 months and in most cases is fatal.",
