        "action": "Conduct a national referendum to solve London\u2019s airport capacity stalemate",
        "additional_details": "This has resulted in a perpetuating pattern of indecision and enquiries. Air travel is recognised as being a driver of jobs and economic growth. The 2008 Greater Manchester Transport referendums should be used as a referendum template. The result of this democratic process should lead to a swift policy announcement, using public opinion to influence this decision as a way of decreasing the political bias that has historically surrounded the issue.",
        "background": "This petition suggests a nationwide referendum with the following options: \r\nNo new Runways\r\nNew Runway at LHR\r\nNew Runway at Gatwick\r\nNew Runways at both Gatwick and Heathrow.\r\nLondon airport capacity has been a recurrent and politically sensitive issue. ",
