They increase in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation figure calculated in the previous September. As the CPI rate of inflation was at -0.1%, war pensions would have fallen by this amount had the Government not agreed to keep the rate the same as in 2015. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more about the Government\u2019s decision here: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/2016-war-pensions-and-allowance-rates\r\n\r\nIf you would like war pensions to increase each year, whether or not inflation increases, you could start a new petition calling on the Government to ensure that war pensions increased by a set percentage each year. Alternatively, you could ask for war pensions to receive the same \"triple lock\" protection as the state pension."
