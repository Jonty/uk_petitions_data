        "additional_details": "I am aware of a paedophile who was convicted of grooming a 13 year old girl online who he planned to have sex with.\r\nThis was his 27th offence and he received an 8 month prison sentence, suspended for 2 years.  I do not feel this is justice for his victim(s).\r\nThis is just one of a catalogue of child sex offenders who are getting off too lightly and repeatedly putting vulnerable children in danger.",
        "background": "The legal system would appear to be too lenient on paedophiles. \r\nMany repeat offenders with dozens of convictions only get suspended prison sentences.  \r\nThis is not only no deterrent but also leaves them free to re-offend. \r\nI would like this reviewed as it is outdated.",
