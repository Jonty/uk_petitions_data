        "additional_details": "I demand an introduction of a curriculum for followers of Jediism to be introduced into our national education, giving an unbiased, factual account of the religion, equal to that of every other religion on the curriculum. It will be optional to be taught, and focused on a factual basis, but available nevertheless. Help end this crude outdated inequality, and give Jedi followers the recognition they deserve.",
        "background": "I find it sickening that in the present day, in a society which \"claims\" to accept people of all opinions and beliefs, that there is still such widespread disregard for the followers of Jediism. Why are children expected to learn in school of Christianity and Islam, yet skip such a major belief?",
