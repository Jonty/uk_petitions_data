        "action": "Restore the crown emblem to pint glasses at the earliest opportunity.",
        "additional_details": "The removal of the crown certification stamp seems a small and insignificant move in a world of violence and injustice. However the replacement by a CE mark suggests a final move to remove the authoritative significance of the crown emblem in British society with one associated with the cold bureaucracy of Brussels. The restoration of the crown on all pint and half-pint glasses will be a huge symbolic gesture in the renewing of royal and UK government authority in British society.",
        "background": "In the United Kingdom, the crown emblem is often associated with the highest authority in the land. Since1699 it appeared on the side of pint glasses and vessels and was used to indicate a true pint measure of beer. This changed in 2006 when an EU measurements directive came into force.  ",
