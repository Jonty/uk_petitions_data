        "action": "Ensure landlords receive full rent payments from DSS tenants",
        "additional_details": "Social housing has been hit with compulsory rent reductions, they can't afford to have rent arrears. Why is the government allowing people to go into debt?\r\n\r\nIf the tenants benefit for rent was given straight to the landlord it would stop arrears and would certainly give private landlords the confidence in letting their properties to DSS tenants, this potentially greatly helping the housing crisis!!",
        "background": "I work in social housing and currently the tenant has to be in rent arrears before the landlord can request for the rent to be paid straight to them. Rent arrears cost thousands to recover with dedicated teams to recover the money not paid, when it's already been received by the tenant.",
