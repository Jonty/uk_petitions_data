However given the imperfection information provided by both campaign the final decision should be debated by the Commons and voted on by this elected parliament to ensure the best outcome for all. Any major decisions regarding the future of the United Kingdom made in the UK should be debated and agreed upon by parliament who hold sovereignty. Any executive power held by the Prime Minister derived from the crown should be held to a minimum.",
