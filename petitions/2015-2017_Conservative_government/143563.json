        "additional_details": "MPs are elected to make tough decisions on behalf of the country. \r\n\r\nMPs are well-equipped to make informed decisions on matters such as the EU. They have real knowledge and experience of both the benefits and disadvantages of continued membership.\r\n\r\nSo far, Parliament has not had its say. Allow MPs to vote before withdrawing from the EU, taking in to account all relevant factors including the referendum result, renewed calls for Scottish Independence and real motivations behind many leave votes.",
        "background": "The electorate have made their views clear on future EU membership.\r\n\r\nNow it is time for HM Government to recognise that the UK is a representative democracy and that referendums are advisory, not binding. MPs should now be able to vote, taking in to account the referendum result & other factors.",
