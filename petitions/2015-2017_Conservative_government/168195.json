        "additional_details": "The detrimental consequences of leaving the EU are becoming more apparent each week, yet the government seems to be only considering the options for leaving. They should also seriously consider whether remaining in the EU is not the best way forward for the UK. Any political fall-out from regarding the referendum result as advisory could be addressed by another referendum now that the issues are becoming clearer.",
        "background": "The EU referendum result was close with no distinction between hard Brexit (complete separation from the EU) or soft Brexit. It is highly likely that of the three options, Remain received the highest vote. It should therefore be considered as a valid response to the referendum.",

Are you asking for a debate in Parliament on the three options you outline, or are you asking for the Government to change its position on Brexit? Alternatively are you calling for a new referendum  - which is mentioned in the final line of your petition.\r\n\r\nIf you want to you, you can create a new petition which set out more clearly exactly what you want the Government or Parliament to do and we may be able to approve that petition. You may first want to check whether any existing petitions already address the point you want to make. "
