As a parent it is very difficult to get a push chair and child out of a normal sized car space. \r\nTo park in a parent and child space you should display a pass like disabled do if you don't have one you should recieve a fine like people do in a disabled space that don't display a pass\r\n\r\nBetter control is needed for the safety of children and other peoples property",
        "background": "It's not about being close to the shops it's about having the extra room to open the doors fully to get children in and out of the car easier and not damaging other people's cars. It's also a safety factor for children as well. I want cars to display a pass similar to a disabled pass as proof ",
