No system is likely to be foolproof but every effort should be made to recover as much of that money as possible. Any recovered money should go directly to the relevant NHS trust.\r\nOnly 5% of that amount, \u00a3100 million, was recovered in 2013/14. ",
        "background": "Medical attention given to overseas visitors (inc health tourism) is a drain on the NHS. The Border Agency should develop a method to ensure that visitors with visas also have appropriate medical insurance to cover them for their stay. The NHS could recover some of the \u00a32B spent on overseas visitors",
