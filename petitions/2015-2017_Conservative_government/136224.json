        "additional_details": "Scotland and Northern Ireland now have to leave the EU against the wishes of their electorates. This is unjust.\r\n\r\nThe petition proposes a solution which corrects the injustice and avoids the need to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, by dealing with the issue as a matter internal to the UK.\r\n\r\nEngland and Wales leave the EU by seceding from the UK, and Scotland and Northern Ireland, being the rump UK, stay in the EU.\r\n\r\nPrecedent for secession from the UK: the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921",
        "background": "In the referendum held on 23 June 2016, two of the countries comprising the UK voted to leave the EU and the other two countries voted to remain.
