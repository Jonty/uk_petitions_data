        "additional_details": "Allowing those who do extreme amounts of mileage to pay the same rate as those who barely use the road is unfair. I personally fall into both catagories. I do approx 50k a year for work and less than 2k in my own personal vehicle. Yet i pay more tax for my personal vehicle than my company does for the vehicle doing x25 the mileage. monitor fuel usage when you register a car. You get a fuel card u swipe everytime you fill up (similar to a company fuel card) to prevent tampering. No card no fuel.",
        "background": "For years we have been paying road tax on a fixed rate system. This is old out dated. Punishing those who barely use the roads while those who abuse them barley cover the damage they cause.",
