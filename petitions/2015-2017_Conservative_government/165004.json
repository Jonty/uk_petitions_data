        "action": "Make gender/sexuality a compulsory topic in PSHEE/P&E lessons in UK high schools",
        "additional_details": "Although the statistic for LGBT+ students is estimated, around 1 in 5 students are believed to be a part of the community. This means that approximately 646,900 students are LGBT+ and would benefit from this topic, as well as the remainder of students who will be more educated and aware of the many genders and sexualities there are.",
        "background": "Many genders and sexualities are unheard of by most people, meaning it is difficult for those questioning to find a label which describes them. I think introducing a gender and sexuality topic in PSHEE/P&E classes in all high schools would assist those questioning and lessen homophobia in schools.",
