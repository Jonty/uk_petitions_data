        "additional_details": "There has been many cases for which people have been affected by Southern Rail!\r\n\r\nSouthern Rail could not get me back home to from London to Eastbourne one night for being short staffed. I had to travel to Brighton and then get a bus to Seaford where everything had then terminated. As a result one of my relatives had to pick me up in the middle of the night. This journey had taken me over 3 hours!\r\n\r\nOther people I know have found their trains cancelled or delayed in 4 out of 5 journeys in a week!",
        "background": "Southern Rail has been giving worse and worse service for years and years! Trains are being delayed and cancelled too frequently and causing major disruption for commuters.  It is time for a new company to be given the franchise or better yet for the government to take control of the rail system.",
