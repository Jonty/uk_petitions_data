        "additional_details": "Full time carers are the hardest working people you will meet. We are on call 24hrs a day 365 days a year....The government think it's OK that us carers work for 49pence an hour as the NHS are overloaded... I think we as full time carers should be getting at least the minimum wage of \u00a37.20 not \u00a362.10 a week.. We can not get a job as we already have one looking after vulnerable people we love. We didn't ask for them to be ill, sick or dying but we care for them because the government doesn't care",
        "background": "Full time carers can not work due to looking after sick, venerable people. They work long hours for \u00a362.10 a week...you upped the minimum wage to \u00a37.20 and you should be paying full time carers this amount is money due to lack of care staff in the NHS...we work long hours and never have a day off!!!",
