        "additional_details": "You can only get special consideration for mental health illness if you are experiencing stress or anxiety and are being treated with medication.\r\nI think this is unfair. A panic attack or episode of severe depression on the day of an exam can really inhibit someone's ability to perform well. If special consideration can be given for hay fever, why not mental illness?",
        "background": "Currently, in A Levels and GCSE exams, special consideration (which allows for an increase of up to 5% of marks) is given under certain circumstances to students, including for illness, headaches or even hay fever. Yet students with mental illness are not eligible.",
