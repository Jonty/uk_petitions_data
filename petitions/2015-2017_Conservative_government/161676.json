        "additional_details": "The attacks in Europe hit are proof that there needs to be a paradigm shift in approach.\r\n\r\nThere is no justification for risking the safety of law abiding citizens in the uk by allowing criminals to stay or freely enter the uk.\r\n\r\nWe need to toughen our stance as the global threats increase.\r\n\r\nThe British people cannot agree with the ruling elite on this issue and parliament has to listen to the people it serves, not the people who would abuse the rule of law.",
        "background": "Our liberal values are threatened by imported criminals, people who enjoy the benefits, yet abuse the privilege. I call for a zero tolerance for criminality - the rights to come and stay are lost once any crime is committed - we should have benefits of migration without the fear of becoming victims.",
