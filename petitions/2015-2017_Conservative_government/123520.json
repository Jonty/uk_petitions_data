        "additional_details": "According to figures 725000 have claimed pip and there is no time scale in place so the disabled are left waiting and often deteriorating in health. This doesn't seem to matter. Disabled need to buy equipment and aids to enhance their lives and are often left bedridden whilst waiting an appointment. Carers are working free as they cannot access funds until pip is issued.this has become a tremendous strain on the sick and the unpaid overworked carers. It's not acceptable to the British people",
        "background": "Pip payments are the new dla and the system is appalling. Disabled people are getting increasingly sicker whilst waiting for a decision. asos who make assessments have no available staff to make appropriate appointments and people are suffering waiting for help",
