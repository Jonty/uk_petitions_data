        "additional_details": "The politics of the world are very different than 23 June 2016, when Trump and the option of hard Brexit was not a consideration. Much of the argument on both sides has proven to be false. Any reasonable individual would think it only right and proper to reflect and review a decision made in their personal life if circumstances changed. It is only right the UK population is allowed to do the same. A 2nd leave vote would however also give the UK govt a full and informed mandate from the people.",
        "background": "The article 50 act needs to be passed, but should include a 2nd referendum on 30/3/ 17 askng the UK public to confirm their  wish to leave the EU, in light of a very different world outlook. Peers and MPs would be supporting the democracy of the UK, giving the people a final but now informed choice",
