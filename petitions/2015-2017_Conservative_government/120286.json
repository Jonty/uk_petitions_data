        "additional_details": "We appreciate that this is a very complex political matter, but the fact remains that war crimes are being committed in Yemen, civilians are being constantly bombed and murdered. Thousands are displaced and do not know when their next meal will be, many are suffering from malnutrition. The British government have their hands dirty and this must end. We must send more humanitarian support and stop arming and providing military assistance to Saudi Arabia.",
        "background": "The British governments are arming Saudi Arabia with weapons and military advisors. Saudi Arabia are conducting airstrikes on civilians and even refugee camps, this goes against international law and the British GOVT is actively participating in these war crimes. Britain must stop this involvement.",
