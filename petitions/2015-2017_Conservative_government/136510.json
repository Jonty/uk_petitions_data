        "additional_details": "The average life span in the UK is 81.5 years (according to the World Bank). According to the BBC, people between 18-24 voted 73% to stay in the UK and therefore they have to live with the consequences of the vote for at least, on average, for 57.5 years. The percentage moved from 'remain' to 'leave' as age groups increased. At the other end of the spectrum where people were aged 65 and over the vote to remain was only 40% and those people, on average, have at most 16.5 years to live. ",
        "background": "It is wrong that younger people, who voted to remain, have to live with the consequences of older people, who voted to leave. This is fundamentally unfair and therefore the vote should be reconsidered.",
