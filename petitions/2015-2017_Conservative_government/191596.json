Surely this is a conflict of interest. \r\n\r\nMany other public service employees can not take other jobs (Police Officers etc) why are MPs different to this?",
        "background": "A large number of MPs have other jobs. Some of these jobs pay more than the salary they are earning as an MP.\r\n\r\nSurely as a member of parliament, which carries great responsibility an MP should not have another job which could be a conflict of interest.\r\n\r\nI propose this is changed.\r\n",
