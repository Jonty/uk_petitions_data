        "additional_details": "The PM has a duty to represent and act in the interests of all Britain's citizens, including its Muslim population, and must denounce such a blatantly Islamophobic and inhumane policy.\r\nMoreover, it is outrageous that this executive order came on Holocaust Memorial Day. The PM must stand with Britain's Jewish community and condemn Trump's enacting a policy of hate on a day set aside to remind us of the horrors that hate can bring.",
        "background": "Theresa May has initially refused to condemn the shocking policy of Donald Trump to immediately ban refugees from seven majority-Muslim countries. Such an action stands completely at odds with a humanitarian and 'Global' Britain. The PM must publicly condemn this ban.",
