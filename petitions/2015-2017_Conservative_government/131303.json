        "additional_details": "We have had to provide /medical evidence' and letters of consent from a doctor to say he is unfit for school. This is discriminating against a parents' verbal word, making us feel like liars when our child is poorly. This takes up valuable doctors appointments, when our children are not always needed to be seen by a doctor. Other bugs fly around schools where we should also keep our children at home but not see a doctor. STOP PROSECUTING PARENTS for educational statistical targets! ",

He has regular flare ups and suffers with coughing fits/ weasiness & breathlessness as a result also causing lack of sleep and the need to stay at home.
