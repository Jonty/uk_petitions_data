It is the first time in 100 years that it's been on the open market, having been on display in Edinburgh for the last 17, on a loan to the National Museum of Scotland from owners Diageo (selling due to \"no direct link to our business or brands\").\r\n\r\nAt a time when Scotland needs its sense of self, pride, and identity more than ever, this cultural amputation would be a devastating one. Prevent it.",
