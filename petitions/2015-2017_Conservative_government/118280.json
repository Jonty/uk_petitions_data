        "additional_details": "This is the reason behind Tyler's ban: The home secretary has reached this decision because you have brought yourself within the scope of the list of unacceptable behaviour by making statements that may foster hatred, which might lead to intercommunity violence in the UK.\r\n\r\nTrump has also made numerous statements that may foster hatred, which might lead to inter community violence in the UK. It is highly contradictory to ban Tyler and not Trump as they have both committed the same 'crime'",
        "background": "Tyler was banned from the UK because of his lyrics in a song. The song was made up and was not a real belief. It is entertainment. Donald Trump has recently said more divisive comments that disturb the peace and he actually believes them. Trump's views are real, Tyler's were a made up song.",
