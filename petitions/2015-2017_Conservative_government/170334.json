        "action": "Legislate against premature marketing of festivals, especially Christmas",
        "additional_details": "Other festivals can be included in legislation (e.g. 1 week prior to Valentines, Easter, Halloween) but the law must first target Christmas. We accept there are commercial ventures that that may be exempt since they rely on festivals such as Christmas for much of their business and therefore need to market early, e.g. Christmas hamper savings, turkey butchers, greeting card shops, booking for a Christmas party, etc. Punishments for breaking the law should raise money for children's charities.\r\n",
        "background": "The excitement of Christmas is spoiled by premature marketing in shops, 'papers and TV. We are not killjoys, but tinselled TV ads and festive trees in Malls in early November dwindles our joy well before the event. We propose, under penalty, the first day of marketing for Christmas as 1st of Dec.",
