        "action": "Require George Osborne to live in the shoes of a disabled person for 24 hours.",
        "additional_details": "It is important politicians understand the impact their actions have on real people. This peition suggests a way he can get that, to avoid poor decisions being made again in future.\r\n\r\nIt suggests Mr Osborne lives like a disabled person for 24 hours. All it might be that he immobilises his writing arm.  He can then see how he dresses, ties shoe laces, shaves, eats, writes etc.\r\n\r\nAfter that experience, he will surely have a feeling of what it is like to be disabled and make better policy in future.",
        "background": "Even though it has been reversed, the recent debacle over Disability Benefit cuts in the budget shows George Osborne is, not for the first time, out-of-touch. Mr Osborne needs to experience  real-life before he makes any future policy. So live like a disabled person, just for one day.\r\n\r\n",
