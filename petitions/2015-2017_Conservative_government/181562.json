        "action": "Equalise the right for a gay man to give blood.",
        "additional_details": "A ban on gay men donating blood was first passed in the 1980s when HIV was prevalent. Since then, the LGBT community has experienced the equalisation of the age of consent and also marriage but still gay men are discriminated against over giving blood. The advancement in the detection of HIV and treatment steps (albeit it cannot be cured) has since meant that HIV is much easier to identify and the donor can be prevented from giving blood. A blanket ban is unjustified in modern society. ",
        "background": "If you are a gay man in the UK, you are forbidden from giving blood if you have been sexually active in the last twelve months. Conversely, if you are a straight man and are sexually promiscuous then this doesn't apply to you and it is fine for you to donate. This is discriminatory and wrong. ",
