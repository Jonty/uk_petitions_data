        "additional_details": "This legislation is already outdated and obsolete. Many people have stopped or reduced smoking with the aid of e-cigarettes. Some jobs will be lost as it will force some small company's to close. This is knee jerk legislation at its worst and contradicts the governments own findings.",
        "background": "Only a few months ago NHS Direct published the headline \"E-cigarettes 95% less harmful than smoking\". The TPD (Tobacco Products Directive) comes into effect today. It classes e-cigarettes as tobacco related products. It's effects could increase the use of tobacco and not reduce it.",
