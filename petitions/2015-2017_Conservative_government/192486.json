        "additional_details": "You cant imagine what goes through the mind of a terrorist other than the hatred for humanity that fuels their actions. They often do this in the name of religion but these murderers do not reflect the majority of decent peaceful people that represent their communities and religions in a positive way that truly shows the great diversity of our country. Many of these terrorist acts are perpetrated by individuals with warped ideas and lone wolf types looking for a headline. ",
        "background": "Part of the motivation for organisations or individuals committing terrorist atrocities is the publicity and headline that sadly comes with it. Its time to stop this and make it illegal for the media to publicize their names and deprive them of the headline they seek. ",
