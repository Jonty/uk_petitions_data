There are many people that are employed but struggle to afford this. These prescription charges represent nothing more than an unfair, stealth tax. \r\nIf the general population were forced to pay an additional \u00a38.40 in tax, every month for life, there would be public uproar! \r\nThis is immoral, fundamentally wrong and needs to be stopped.",
