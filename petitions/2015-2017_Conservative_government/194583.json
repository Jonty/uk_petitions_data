        "additional_details": "There is no evidence to suggest that this new limit will stop those with lower incomes from deciding against having a third child and is therefore a direct attack on women and children. \r\n\r\nHaving to declare that you have been raped/coerced in order to receive financial support runs the risk of your child and many members of the public becoming aware of the situation in which your child is conceived especially to other bodies who ask you to declare what income you receive and for whom. ",
        "background": "The new tax credits limit will push many families, especially women and children, below the poverty line and it also forces women to publicly declare children who are conceived from rape or coercion thus making a women relive a horrific ordeal for the sake of financial support.
