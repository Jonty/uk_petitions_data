        "additional_details": "We have the fifth largest economy in the world and we want to trade with the world on our terms, not the EU's. We want a fairer immigration system that welcomes hard working and talented people from all over the world, not one that discriminates against non-EU citizens. We want our security, borders and fishing grounds back. \r\n\r\nIf Switzerland, Norway and Iceland are big enough to be independent, peaceful and rich European countries, then the UK with 64 million people is certainly big enough.",
        "background": "Almost two hundred countries around the world have 'National' or 'Independence' days, from the United States to Uganda and Norway to Nicaragua. It's not nationalistic to be proud of your country, it's very normal. UK INDEPENDENCE DAY would be celebrated on the 23rd of June each year.\r\n\r\n",
