        "additional_details": "We ask the government not to dismiss this petition as they have done before, as whilst there was a vote in 2011, with only a 42% turnout (& was described by political scientist Iain McLean as \"bad-tempered & ill-informed public debate\") ;  We believe opinions and the political landscape has now changed, so before you reject this, Please do additional research this year and next, such as with YouGov, & social media and if opinions have changed, as we believe, hence this petition, hold a new vote!",
        "background": "We call for a new debate & Vote into replacing the current First Past The Post system with Proportional Representation.  FPTP is out-dated & only benefits the larger, more established parties. It is unfit for the modern times. PR allows for the views of the country to be more accurately represented.",
