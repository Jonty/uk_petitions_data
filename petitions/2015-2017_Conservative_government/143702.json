        "additional_details": "The referendum result was a close call, a result that Nigel Farrage had previously stated shouldn't be informing a decision on our EU status if the polls had been reversed. The U.K. woke up with a result it wasn't expecting and realisation hit of the impact of misplaced anger and blatant campaigning lies. Many voters active expressed regret at their leave vote for a variety of reasons. The statistical breakdown shows remain majorities based on age & education. So let the people vote with facts.",
        "background": "51.9% verses 48.1% - if a doctor said 'I'm 52% sure it's not cancer' would that be good enough for you? This is a complex political and economic decision to make that many politicians have used as a scapegoat for other issues. I don't want a decision based on 50:50 split - do you? I want to be sure.",
