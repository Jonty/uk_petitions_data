        "additional_details": "Whilst the EU Referendum result declared the majority of voters want Britain to leave the EU, most of the population had insufficient valid information to make a fully informed decision to understand the actual consequences. Some have said they voted as a protest rather than for the actual outcome. Our politicians of all parties now need to coolly debate how best to make a governing decision for the country rather than rush immediately into invoking Article 50 for Britain's exit from the EU.",
        "background": "The majority (75%) of MP's declared EU referendum stances were for  Britain to remain in the EU, with 57% of Conservative MPs, 67% of Labour MPs, and 100% of Scottish National Party and Liberal Democrats all in favour of 'Remain'.  The true democratic process is for our elected MPs to govern the UK.",
