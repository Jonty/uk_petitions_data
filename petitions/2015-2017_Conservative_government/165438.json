        "additional_details": "Former Chancellor George Osborne initiated the \"Help to Buy\" scheme, whereby first-time buyers would be able to be the recipients of a Government 'top up' to their savings in \"Help to Buy ISAs\" (up to \u00a33,000.00) by 25%.\r\n\r\nIt has since been discovered that this promise of additional funds cannot be used to actually help to buy the property, and instead may only be applied for after Completion. It can be used to help sustain the property, but not to buy it, as initially put forwards. ",
        "background": "National media recently announced that the Government have stated that the much publicised \"Help to Buy ISA\" cannot be used towards the deposit to a new house for first-time buyers, leaving hundreds of thousands of first-time buyers needing to seek additional finance to buy their first house.",
