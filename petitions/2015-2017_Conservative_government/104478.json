        "additional_details": "- Gulls are currently protected under the 1981 Wildlife Act\r\n- Since then the population of urban gulls has grown alarmingly\r\n- Existing legal methods of prevention and control do not work\r\n- Seabird 2000, the last proper survey of gulls, is 15 years out of date\r\n- Further research is urgently required to tackle the problem\r\n- New technology can provide fresh information about gull ecology\r\n- Accurate knowledge of gull behaviour is the key to control\r\n- We cannot afford to wait any longer ",
        "background": "The Prime Minister called for a 'big conversation' about urban gulls after a pet dog was savaged by a seagull in Cornwall. But the government has recently cut the budget for research into the problem. We can't have a proper conversation without more information about the behaviour of gulls in towns.",
