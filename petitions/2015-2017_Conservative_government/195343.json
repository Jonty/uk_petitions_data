It is time we showed them we are not afraid  of them or frightenen of going it alone. The trade gap between the EU and ourselves is huge, the UK imports far more than we export  to them.   If the EU refuses to play fair.....We the people of the UK ask that we just put a stop to their unreasonable behaviour and demands by  just walking away.    Stop  paying them any money, reclaim our fishing waters, and let's  just get on with trading with the rest of the world !!!! ",
