        "additional_details": "I have suffered over the years with a controlled censorship on my business lines resulting in call drop outs at an alarming rate,  yet when I called the 1471 service 99.9% of these callers were unavailable which I find very odd. Yet friends and family and established clients have no problems contacting me. The present system is out of date and Ofcom needs more power to regulate the industry. Security is a major problem - there are 2000 calls a day to Action Fraud.",
        "background": "I have experienced poor service from a telecoms provider, which resulted in me being given 2.6-2.8 Mb when 10-15Mb was freely available at my home. People who work in the telecoms industry have a great deal of power, and should be licensed and checked before they can work.",
