This election is one of the most significant elections of most people's lifetimes - and May cannot be allowed to sidestep public scrutiny. ",
        "background": "On April 18 Theresa May called for a General Election on June 8 in order to strengthen her Party's position in Parliament, going against the Fixed Term Parliament Act. However, in a bid to avoid scrutiny, she has ruled out appearing in any TV debates, robbing the public of further democratic debate.",
