        "additional_details": "I believe this new system would make the roads a safer place for new riders and would make motorbikes more appealing to people who had not previously considered then to be a viable commuting/ transport alternative to cars. This could lead to less congestion on the roads as it would encourage more young people to make their daily commute on a bike as opposed to a car. The current system is deeply flawed and is an outright danger to would be riders, something has to be done.",
        "background": "At 17 years of age motorcyclists are limited to low power, 125cc machines, many of which struggle to maintain 70 mph, making riding on motorways unpractical and often dangerous. These machines simply don't have the power to get riders out of trouble if and when a dangerous situation presents itself",
