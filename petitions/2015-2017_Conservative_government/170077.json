        "additional_details": "Sam Gymiah previously stated his government would implement the Turing bill to fulfil their manifesto that they would pardon all those convicted under anti gay laws. \r\n\r\nThis bill that would have eradicated criminal records of thousands of gay men has fallen at its first parliamentary hurdle because Gymiah talked for 25 minutes exceeding the time limit for any decision to be passed.\r\n\r\nThis would have pardoned all men living with UK convictions for same-sex offences",
        "background": "This conservative MP is responsible for preventing justice by filibustering the Turing bill.\r\n\r\nSam Gymiah is a justice minister and does not deserve this role. Let's sign to get him out of office.\r\n\r\n",
