        "additional_details": "Claim that \u00a3350M a week could be spent on the NHS now repudiated by pro-leave MPs. Implication that the overall level of immigration will be reduced is no longer being promoted by pro-leave MPs. Suggestion that access to the internal market could be achieved without acceptance of the principle of free movement of labour now seriously questioned. The potential for the break-up of the UK, with Scotland voting to leave the UK in order to remain in the EU, has not been properly considered. ",
        "background": "Claims made before the referendum regarding the UK's position after leaving the EU are unsubstantiated. The terms of any future UK/EU relationship can only be known when the exit negotiations have been completed. The UK must have the opportunity to vote on leaving the EU when this position is clear.",
