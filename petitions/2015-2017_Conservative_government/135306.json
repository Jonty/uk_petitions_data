Our generation should not be ignored simply because of our age. It is the entirety of our lives, our children's lives and further beyond that will be affected by Britain leaving the EU and unless we want to live in a society that disagrees with our morals, we require the opportunity to speak about what means the most to us.",
        "background": "Ultimately it is the under-18 year olds, primarily 15-17, who are going to feel the immediate and long term effects of leaving the EU for the longest. As a result, it should be our right in a democracy to influence the society in which we are going to live our lives.",
