        "action": "The Government should trigger article 50 immediately despite High Court ruling",
        "additional_details": "The government has undertaken to abide by the outcome of the EU referendum, therefore there is no need or justification for allowing MPs to vote on when Article 50 should be triggered. MPs should carry out the will of their constituents regardless of their own personal opinions. This latest High Court ruling in favour of Gina Miller's case demonstrates a total disregard for the democratic process.",
        "background": "The High Court has ruled that MPs should  vote on triggering article 50. The High Court should not be able to overrule the democratic decision of the people and that therefore this judgement should be considered invalid and a threat to democracy.",
