        "additional_details": "Many services have been handed to private companies, which cost the NHS & tax payer far more than when provided by our publicly owned and publicly run NHS. Public health systems don\u2019t seek profits, and don\u2019t pay dividends to shareholders.\r\n\r\nStop the privatisation. \r\n\r\nThe NHS Bill will reinstate the NHS as a proper public service - which WE (the public) WANT.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The NHS in England is being dismantled. NHS services - including acute and emergency, children\u2019s, elderly and maternity care - have been deliberately underfunded since 2010. The comprehensive care we\u2019ve come to expect continues to be cut back. Stop destroying our most precious resource.",
