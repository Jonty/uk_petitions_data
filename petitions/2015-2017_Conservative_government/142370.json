        "additional_details": "We elect MPs to make informed decisions on our behalf. It is unreasonable to expect ordinary members of the public to fully understand the implications of leaving the EU. Conversely, MPs are expected to be familiar with and understand the complexities of such issues.The concerns of the people must always be listened to. Nevertheless, the final decision must be made by elected MPs, who will ultimately be held responsible, by the people, for the implementation of change and its consequences.",
        "background": "Leaving the EU is clearly a constitutional change. Therefore, the case for requiring House of Commons ratification is unarguable. MPs must be given the opportunity to decide whether or not the Government should act on the advisory EU Referendum result before triggering Lisbon Treaty Article 50.",
