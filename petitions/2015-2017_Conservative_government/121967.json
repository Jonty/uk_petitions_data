        "additional_details": "My suggestion: as a minimum 0.750 kwp per bedroom of solar pv installed into the property, or in the case of commercial buildings or extensions 1kwp per 100 sq m of footprint.\r\n\r\nThis would increase new build cost, but would provide sufficient savings over the term of a normal mortgage to offset those costs, and be significantly cheaper to install during building than retro fit.\r\n\r\nThis would not need to be eligible for the fit scheme.",
        "background": "I just drove past a new development of housing in Dudley and thought what a waste, why are there no solar panels in all those new properties.\r\nWhy not make it a requirement of ALL new domestic and commercial properties.\r\n\r\nThis would help the uk achieve its targets for renewables.",
