        "additional_details": "Over the last two weeks they have been carrying out Street Clutter Surveys.  Every child found cars parked on pavements making it impossible to pass without stepping in the road. Without drop kerbs this causes issues for wheelchair and pushchair users and means stepping onto the road for blind people and guide dogs which puts the person in danger from passing cars as they do not move quickly and a clear road can quickly have cars rushing past whilst they manoeuvre past the parked car.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Staindrop Cub Scouts are very concerned about the safety of pedestrians especially Guide Dogs and their owners..\r\nAfter  a visit from Sula a Guide Dog the children realised the dangers that blind and partially sighted people face every day because of the careless way people park their cars.\r\n",
