        "additional_details": "After the period of 3 years when the negotiations have taken place and following article 50, traditional parties should create a mandate based on the conditions negotiated, which would then allow the British people to choose the party they feel most capable of taking the county forward. This would allow everybody to feel their views were represented and bring back together the people of the UK and to re-elect the party they feel can correctly steer the future of the UK.  ",
        "background": "With the disparity of the political parties and the people of the UK, negotiations with the EU cannot be carried out by any one existing party. As such all Political parties should be suspended for a period of 3 years allowing the best representatives to be chosen to negotiate a deal with the EU. ",
