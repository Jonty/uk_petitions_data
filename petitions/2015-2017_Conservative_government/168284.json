        "additional_details": "Many people believe that capital punishment is wrong as there has been cases in the past where people were sentenced to death when they had not committed the crime.\r\n\r\nWith DNA testing etc and techniques that did not exist years ago, we can now prove a persons guilt beyond dispute thus resulting in an end to wrongful death sentences.\r\n\r\nWe support the re-introduction of Capital Punishment by means of hanging or lethal injection, Corporal Punishment by means of the birch and chain gangs.",
