The licence will be issued to an adult not banned from dog ownership with valid dog insurance (non-cancelation policy). This will protect animal welfare, ensure annual vet check-ups and responsible ownership\r\n Abandoned/regular straying dogs will be traceable as will those  left off leads in play parks. Banning a breed just moves the problem onto another breed",
