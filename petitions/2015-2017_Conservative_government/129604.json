        "action": "Call for greater public scrutiny of how police forces are spending public money",
        "additional_details": "The current system is unfair, unequal/bias against the victims and their families who deserve justice. Scrutiny and reform is required to monitor and stop those in the police and across our public services abusing public money to cover up their failures. The Hillsborough disaster proves how deep the covering up goes and how those in our public services do not admit their guilt but continue to pervert the course of justice. The government must act to hold those who abuse public funds accountable",
        "background": "Following the Hillsborough verdict, where 96 people died, greater scrutiny and reform is required to look at how public money is spent by the police to defend themselves and cover up their failure and mistakes. The Hillsborough victims\u2019 families were denied the truth and struggled 27 yrs for justice",
