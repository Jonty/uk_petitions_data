Parents need to be made aware of how to help their child in a situation like this incase paramedics cannot reach them in time ",
        "background": "My son was 13 weeks premature so I luckily got the training. At 12 weeks old, when he was home with me he stopped breathing then 4 hours later on our way home from the hospital it happened again, as I had the training I saved his life before the ambulance got to us.",
