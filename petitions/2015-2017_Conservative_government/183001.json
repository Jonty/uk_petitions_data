        "action": "Amend the Criminal Justice Act 1988 to allow ambulance staff to carry batons",
        "additional_details": "Currently, Section 139 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 states it is an offence \"of having an offensive weapon in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse and having an article with blade or sharply pointed in a public place without lawful authority or good reason\". Currently there are 3 specific defences. A specific defence must be added stating that ambulance staff, in the course of their duties may be in possession of a telescopic baton for the purpose of defence of life.",
        "background": "In 2014/15 there were 1861 reported assaults on emergency ambulance staff. Staff must be authorised to carry telescopic batons to defend themselves from attackers, as we have no means of currently doing so. A specific defence must be made for staff to be in possession in the course of their duties.",
