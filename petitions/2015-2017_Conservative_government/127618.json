        "action": "The UK should remove the moderator (silencer) licensing requirement for firearms",
        "additional_details": "In many countries throughout the world, moderators are treated as devices to protect the hearing of shooters and those around them.\r\n\r\nRemoving the requirement for a moderator to be held on a Firearms Certificate would help shooters to further protect their hearing, and would reduce the effect the sound of shooting has on other people & the environment. Furthermore, it would also help reduce police workload as police would no longer have to process certificate variations for moderators.",
        "background": "Moderators (silencers/suppressors) are designed to reduce the volume of a gunshot. Modern shooters & those around them deserve the best in hearing protection, and moderators can help provide this. They should be treated as a safety measure, without the need for expensive FAC variation.",
