The Vote Leave campaign purposefully misled people, by, for example, continuing to use the \u00a3350m figure banned by the UK Statistics Authority and promising it to the NHS which since the result they have revealed was never there intention. It is paramount to democracy that politicians, like businesses are held to account of the people and do not receive preferential treatment! ",

If any other sector within the UK conducts themselves in a similar way, they will be called to a Select Committee and held to account. ",
