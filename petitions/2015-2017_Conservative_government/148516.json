        "additional_details": "As things stand, by voting to leave or to remain, the electorate have effectively entered into a binding contract without having sight of the terms of that contract. This would not be considered legal, acceptable or binding in any other context. On this basis a second, final referendum, should be called once the terms of separation are known.",
        "background": "There was much mis-information and supposition during the recent European referendum. By definition, the facts were unknown and therefore the electorate was not in a position to make a fair and informed judgement of the alternatives. This can only be done, once  terms of withdrawal have been agreed.",
