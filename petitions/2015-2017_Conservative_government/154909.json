The most blatant was Leave campaign\u2019s claim that \u00a3350M per week savings would be added to the NHS budget. It was criticised by UK Statistics Office as misleading. Despite this, Leave continued to use the claim. If either side of the debate knowingly mislead voters on such an important issue they must be held publicly to account.",
