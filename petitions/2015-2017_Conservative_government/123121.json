I regularly give up my seat for elderly or disabled people, children, pregnant ladies and anyone else I feel requires the seat more. However, if sitting on the floor amongst luggage and rubbish is the only alternative, it should not cost the same amount as being seated comfortably. ",
        "background": "As a student who regularly uses trains, I recently decided something needs to done about the seating system. I often find myself sat on the floor, having paid the same amount as someone on a table seat. I believe this should be changed so that those left seatless have a discounted ticket price. ",
