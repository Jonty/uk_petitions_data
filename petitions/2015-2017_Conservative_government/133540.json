As such, politicians and the media have been unable to present clear, factual and un-biased information to the general public on either side of the referendum debate. The outcome, therefore, has been largely the product of misinformation and the referendum should not be the basis on which we, as a country, make such a monumental decision.",

As a representative democracy, this petition proposes that we hand the question over to those qualified, and paid by taxpayers, to answer it.",
