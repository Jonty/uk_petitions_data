As humans, part of our understanding & communicating is being able to 'read' the emotions of another persons facial features. \r\nDavid Cameron himself has declared Britain as a Christian country and therefor we should respect that view. \r\nWhen British women travel to a Muslim country, they respect the countries beliefs and wear head scarfs, why should they no respect our beliefs?\r\n",
