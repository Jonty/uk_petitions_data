        "action": "Stop the roll out of grammar schools and work to close down current grammars",
        "additional_details": "I recently wrote to Cllr. Zahir Mohammad, Cabinet Member for Schools in Bucks, about funding inequalities between grammars and secondaries and his response was this, \"The non-selective schools receive considerably more support from increased funding e.g. per pupil Free School meals, Prior Attainment, English as an additional language and Pupil Premium etc and this can be quite significantly more than grammars.\". The 11+ is biased against poorer kids and this system cannot be rolled out further.",
        "background": "There has been speculation that the government are looking into lifting the ban on new grammar schools and this would create more inequality than social mobility. In areas where there are grammars, secondary schools receive a lot more Free School Meal funding etc. The grammar system doesn't work.",
