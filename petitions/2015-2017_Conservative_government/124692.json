        "additional_details": "Recently many cuts have been made that decimate the lives of thousands of people. This is not in the public interest. The whole point of having a society where we have 'law makers' and people who designate funding and allocate resources to help is that the public is protected and supported. This is not happening. If any MPs are under the influence of mind altering drugs then it may indicate why this responsibility is being ignored so freely.",
        "background": "It has become very obvious that some decisions made recently are not in the public interest.\r\nThe only reason I can surmise for this is that members of parliament are under the influence of mind altering substances, that or they're not upholding their pledge to make responsible decisions.",
