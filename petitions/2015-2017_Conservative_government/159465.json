        "additional_details": "Independent, Huffpost, Guardian & other newspapers report that many regret voting to leave believing they were making a protest vote. \r\nCurrently the UK does NOT have open borders & DOES HAVE opt out on EU legislation. Any post Brexit EU deal would lose these.\r\n\r\nOver 4 million people signed a petition to have a 2nd referendum. The main protaganists resigned leaving an uncertain future financially and politically, pensions & savings down, \u00a3 down, racist & other attacks up. No more money for NHS.\r\n",
        "background": "As EU referendum was not legally binding and as many votes are deemed protest votes. We wish the MPs of this country not to invoke\r\nArticle 50, to keep us within the EU with all our current benefits and opt outs which will be lost in any new deal. It would also bring stability back to the country.",
