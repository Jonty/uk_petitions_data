        "additional_details": "The Labour MP Naz Shah has expressed personal opinions about the existence of Israel in her support of the Palestine issue. Regardless of her opinion being right or wrong or her support for an oppressed people being right or wrong; politicians are expected to be able to justify their opinions regardless of the government paradigm. This MP has ashamed the house by not being able to articulate or justify her opinions on this matter of Israel/Palestine. In our opinion her status as MP is tarnished.",
        "background": "British politicians and our parliament are respected the world over for expressing what they believe and what their constituents believe. Politicians have parliamentary privilege which allows them to express opinions which maybe against the narrative of government policy but which have to be aired.",
