        "additional_details": "Social services documents are well known for being inaccurate and falsified. If you notify social services you wish to record all meetings they take extreme exception however if they were to note down events accurately surely this would just be another form of evidence.\r\nSocial services having to record means they cannot deny knowledge of events, or be accused of recording inaccurately as there will be evidence of what was said. It also can act as a form of reference to ensure reports reflect events.",
        "background": "Social services often try to put those who attend meetings with them off when it come to recording meetings. Their code of conduct explains they should be open and honest so I question why they will not do this. It would help to avoid disputes over what was said and ensure clarity for documentation",
