        "additional_details": "There is a ban being passed where anyone under the age of 21 can no longer claim housing benefit. This is morally wrong. The amount of young people who will be tossed out onto the streets, those who are just turning 16 and desperately need to flea from their abusive homes now cant or they will wind up homeless. Those who have no choice, who get kicked out are left on the streets. Do you we really want our youth, our future left on the streets with no hope? No. So please help us and sign.",
        "background": "I myself would have been left to the streets had i not been able to claim housing benefit. Being able to claim and get away from my stressful household has given me new life. It has enabled me to become a strong, independent young woman, where as had i stayed at home i would no doubt be in a cell.",
