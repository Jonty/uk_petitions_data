        "additional_details": " A vote of just 37.5% of the electorate must not and can not undermine the sovereignty of parliament. MPs are voted in by us as experts to represent our interests. The expectation that they will simply accept such a monumental change to the constitution without close consideration of the conditions in which the Leave vote was made is illogical. We call for a debate where MPs and Peers can vote freely, taking into account the EU referendum and the national interest.",

This petition calls upon the government and oppositions to have a full debate in both Houses on whether to proceed with the result of the EU referendum in which only 37.5% of registered voters supported withdrawal.
