        "additional_details": "The 5th term of the Chief Executive, which is the highest office of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), will be elected on 26 March 2017.\r\n\r\nIt appears to be a golden opportunity for the Consul General to Hong Kong & Macao, Andrew Heyn OBE, to re-negotiate with the newly-elected HK government officials with regard to the provision of same-sex civil partnership registration service at the British Consulate-General in Hong Kong.",
        "background": "Civil Partnership (Registration Abroad and Certificates) Order 2005 states that all British nationals (BN(O) inclusive) are allowed to register civil partnerships with some British consulates/embassies abroad.
