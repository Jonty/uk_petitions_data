        "action": "We would like to get Creative Writing reinstated as an A- Level qualification",
        "additional_details": "We want to argue against this. Michael Rosen said How about cutting art from art?. The government says that Creative Writing is too vocational yet they don't know how academic it really is.Otherwise why would it be offered at university? Furthermore, they want more 'academic' subjects such as English Literature to prove their worth but many teenagers find this difficult due to much writing being written in the elaborated code which puts children from a working class background at a disadvantage.",
        "background": "In 2018, the last exams of A-Level Creative Writing will run. This is  because the Department of Education and OFQUAL say that it doesn't meet their guidance and Nicky Morgan and Gove argue that it is not 'Academic' enough. We want to show them how academic it really is and show them why it matters.",
