        "additional_details": "Other countries, for example America, have adopted this method and have numerous, positive cases where an emotional support animal significantly helps in dealing with situations like a panic attack or a person wanting to self harm. These animals can be trained to recognise signs and traits of a person lapsing in mental stability and offer comfort and relaxation at a time where a person is at their most vulnerable. An example of an emotional support animal would be a dog or a cat. ",
        "background": "Emotional support animals are currently not available to people in the UK. They provide comfort and support to those with mental health related problems, such as anxiety and depression, and could be a great solution in combatting the mental health crisis we have in the uk, in a cost effect manner.
