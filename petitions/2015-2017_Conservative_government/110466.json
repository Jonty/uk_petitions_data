        "additional_details": "I was curious to find out exactly what students and young people were learning about in school so I asked a group of 5 students (boys and girls) how much do they think they would earn a week and 3 of the 5 students said \"\u00a31000\" and 2 said they had no idea, I actually had to laugh at how little they are getting taught because as we all know the average income is around \u00a3250-\u00a3300 a week if even! How come we learn about plant cells but not stuff that is actually going to be useful? ",
        "background": "Is has come to my attention that school leavers including myself have been left in the real world with no idea how to do the more important things e.g I don't know average income, how to deal with taxes, bills, and in my opinion It isn't fair because it seems like we are expected to know life skills",
