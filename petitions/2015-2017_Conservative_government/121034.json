The club has a fun and vibrant atmosphere where children are able to naturally interact with staff. Staff initiate and participate in games for indoor and outdoor environments to suit all ages and abilities. The majority of children have additional needs or issues at home. WASP aims to provide a trusting, respectful, caring and constructive environment for these issues to be dealt with. ",
        "background": "Whitehawk after school project has been running for over thirteen years as part Impact Initiatives. As of 24th March the project will be closing down and all staff redundant due to a \u00a316,000 short fall. Funding is given by Children in Need but will not be secured unless another source supports us.",
