        "additional_details": "It seems so silly to test children who can read fluently on words they will never come across again as they are no where to be found within the English dictionary.  Words such as 'quather' or 'jove'.  The English language is not a phonetically correct language.  We have 26 letters and 44 sounds (43 in some areas because of dialect differences).  Rules for some words are not the same for other words for example, come and home.  The 'o' sound in both words are very different.  ",
        "background": "In Year 1 children take a phonics check.  It is a test made up of real and 'made up' words.  The child is tested to make sure their phonics knowledge is at the expected level.  They should only be tested on real words that are in the dictionary.  ",
