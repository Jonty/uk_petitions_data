        "action": "The UK should take in more refugees, in proportion to its size within the EU",
        "additional_details": "More than 2 million refugees are expected to arrive in the EU in 2016. The UK has been among the most unwelcoming countries thus far. From January to October 2015, the UK received only 32,000 asylum applicants, which ranks among the lowest in the EU as a proportion of its population. Under the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation  program, only 252 Syrians had been resettled as of September 2015, and the Government plans to resettle only 20,000 Syrian refugees by 2020. The UK must do more.",
        "background": "The UK should accept more refugees from war torn countries, and should seek agreement with its EU partners that would require each member state to accept a proportional number of asylum seekers. Most economists agree that the UK economy benefits from migration to boost its aging workforce.",
