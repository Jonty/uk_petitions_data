        "action": "Give England and Wales a vote on rejoining the EU If the UK breaks up.",
        "additional_details": "If the UK breaks up and Northern Ireland and Scotland remain in the EU this would be a significant change in material circumstances and would be a good reason to consider England and Wales place in the EU. The relationship with the EU would be quite different as more citizens of England and Wales would be living in the EU. In this event more citizens of the EU would be living in England and Wales. Also trade would be more with the EU and culturally England and Wales would find itself closer.",
        "background": "Scotland wants to have another referendum on independence after the material change in circumstances due to exiting the EU and Northern Ireland may follow suit. In which case it would perfectly reasonable too look at the again at the case for leaving the EU in England and Wales.\r\n",
