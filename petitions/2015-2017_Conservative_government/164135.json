Just typing \"pro ana\" into google came up with 4,480,000 results which is shocking, I believe there should be more awareness through schooling or external groups into the dangers of obsessive dieting and eating disorders which include heart attacks, seizures and death and that pro eating disorder websites should be a criminal offence. ",

As an eating disorder sufferer myself I have been shocked when I have been told people wanted an eating disorder to allow them to be thin or the number of pro ana blogs available to influence people into eating disordered behaviours. \r\n",
