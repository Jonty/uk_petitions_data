        "additional_details": "All those born in the UK since 1993 have the right to work and live in any part of the EU, together with voting and other rights. It is my belief that it is the duty and responsibility of Government to guard and uphold all rights given to its citizens by birth and, moreover the validation of any legislation, such as Article 50, adversely effecting such rights may be contrary to Articles 15 and 23 of the Universal Declaration and Articles 5 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights.",
        "background": "Currently all UK Citizens also hold jointly EU citizenship, this was invoked in the Maastricht Treaty of 1992. However, since 1993 this right, that of dual nationality and all other rights gained through it has been acquired by birth and may be irrevocable under UK, EU and International Law.",
