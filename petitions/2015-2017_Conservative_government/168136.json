        "additional_details": "The UK government's decision to export arms to Saudi Arabia is deplorable considering evidence that Saudi forces are violating international humanitarian law in Yemen. The bombing that has taken place has not just targeted militia but also the supply of basic supplies like food, water and essential medicine to millions of innocent citizens. Millions are on the verge of death - this is NOW a humanitarian disaster. The Saudi's are essentially blockading access to Yemen, starving them.",
        "background": "A human tragedy is unfolding in Yemen, there are millions on the brink of starvation. The UK government is actively contributing to the situation by supplying weapons to Saudi Arabia. Millions are dying due to a Saudi Arabian led coalition against those allied to the former President of Yemen.",
