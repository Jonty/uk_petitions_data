        "additional_details": "Political and legal mechanisms can be used to ensure that the results are subject to member state ratification. \r\n\r\nThe House of Lords report on the process of withdrawing from the EU states that 'a member state could legally reverse a decision to withdraw ... at any point before the date on which the withdrawal agreement took effect.'\r\n\r\nA referendum ensures that the Government's negotiations reflect the original beliefs and intentions of those who voted 'leave'.",
        "background": "The simple question asked in the 23rd June referendum did not adequately reflect the complex issue of exit.\r\n\r\nFor the exit talks with the EU to reflect the people's intentions, they must include a settlement on the future relationship between the UK and EU. This should be ratified in a referendum.",
