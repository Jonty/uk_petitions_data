That is the Leave Campaigns bus, with the slogan down the side of \"We send the EU \u00a3350 million a week\".\r\n\r\nThat figure of \u00a3350 million a week, as most people who educated them selfs on the issues knows, was the theoretical maximum amount; and due to rebates, was closer to half that number.\r\n\r\nThat image, indeed that message, was a powerful one. It was not the only one, and that message was a lie.",
        "background": "The EU referendum campaigns, on both side of the debate, used inflammatory, misleading and even completely wrong information in their advertising. [I think] this is wrong. [I think] political campaigns should have at least the same scrutiny and legislation as advertising and trading standards.",
