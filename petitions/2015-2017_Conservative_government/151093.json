        "additional_details": "To date the UK has lacked clear and concise strategy since the EU referendum. In disentangling ourselves from the EU all parties should be allowed a voice.  This will make us stronger as a country as well as ensuring that major parties focus on the needs of the citizens before their own political ambition.  It is important we are able to stabilise both the UK and the EU.  As our decision has sent shockwaves around the world and it is our obligation to millions of people to steady the ship.",
        "background": "As a country we are currently in unprecedented territory, the last time this country faced this level of uncertainty was in WWII. During that time Churchill invoked a coalition to display we were a country all working for 1 common goal. I suggest we do the same again to allow all parties a voice.",
