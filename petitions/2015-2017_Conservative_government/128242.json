        "action": "Allow Practice nurses employed prior to 6/3/1990 to retain Special Class Status",
        "additional_details": "Many nurses that have paid into the NHS pension scheme without a break of more than 5 years have the right to retire at the age of 55 years without penalty(this right was abolished for new nurses after 6/3/1995).  GP nurses were excluded from the pension scheme until 1/9/1997 so many have incurred a forced break of more than 5 yrs.(A period of time 6/3/95 - 31/8/97 is ignored) For those employed in GP work prior to 6/3/1990 the SCS has been removed and is unfair.",
        "background": "Because I became a practice nurse prior to 6/3/98 I have lost my right to retire without penalties at 55yrs, despite never having a break in my career. SCS nurses entering into General Practice after 6/3/1990 are entitled to retire at 55yrs, if they have not had a break of more than 5 years.",
