        "additional_details": "Using the EU referendum as an example again, we see too many \"scare tactics\" presented openly as \"fact\" by both leave and remain campaigners. This has led to many of us being left confused and feeling like we are backing the party with the loudest voice. I think one of two things would help everyone if another situation such as this should arise; either campaigns should always be presented with for AND against points equally or an independent analyst should present one document with all FACTS.",
        "background": "There are so many factors that go into something like the EU referendum and so many points of view, from infinitely many sources, that facts are lost/blurred in a \"shouting match\" between parties attempting to court our vote with ill or misinformed information.",
