It is not possible to ascertain the extent to which these excess deaths may be preventable; to assume that they are avoidable would be rash and misleading.\u201d (Freemantle et al 2015, BMJ) \r\n",

The proposed changes to junior doctor contracts are based on an uncritical interpretation of research into weekend health outcomes, and are intended to lead to an untried extension of non-urgent procedures into weekends. \r\n",
