        "action": "Urge Volkswagen to compensate owners of cars with emission defeat devices",
        "additional_details": "Emission \"defeat devices\" are a software Volkswagen knowingly installed in its cars to fool emission testing machines into thinking that the car is safer than it is. The software actually allows the cars affected to emit up to 40 times the legally allowable pollution, whilst cheating at the MOT emission test so that it passes. The scandal has also damaged the resale value of affected cars and as such I think it a travesty that Volkswagen do not pay compensation to owners",
        "background": "In the US, Volkswagen have to pay $5100 to each owner affected and the owners get the option of buyback by Volkswagen of the vehicle or to wait for VW to develope a fix that can win regulatory approval. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
