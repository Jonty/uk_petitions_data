        "additional_details": "Due to space permitting, here's an extract from the repeated template:\r\n\r\nOn 23 June 2016 the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in a referendum provided for by an Act of Parliament.\r\nThe Government is committed to implementing the democratic outcome of the referendum.\r\nThe Government was clear in the run up to the EU referendum that we would honour the choice made by the people of the UK on 23 June 2016. We will maintain that commitment: the UK will leave the EU.\r\netc, etc, etc.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Many anti Brexit petitions have been written and supported by at least 10,000 people therefore requiring a Government response. The Government's response has simply been a repeated template churned out with little thought.  This undermines the whole process and the point of petitions.",
