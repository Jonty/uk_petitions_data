        "additional_details": "There are numerous examples.\r\nOne of the most controversial claims of the campaign was that the UK sends \u00a3350m a week (or \u00a350m a day) to Brussels, which could be spent on the NHS instead.  Many bodies including the UK Statistics Authority pointed out that we do not send that much a week because the rebate is deducted before any money is spent.  Source: BBC Reality Check website.\r\nThat BBC website is a good source of information about inaccurate claims from both sides of the referendum debate.",
        "background": "We now observe that during the recent EU referendum there was a deliberate and serious misrepresentation of factual information by holders of public office. This behaviour is inconsistent with the Nolan principles of objectivity, openness and honesty and is unacceptable.",
