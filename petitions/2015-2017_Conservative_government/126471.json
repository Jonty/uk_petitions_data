        "additional_details": "'River pollution is a very serious issue that is not recognised as being as destructive as it really is.' - Thames21 worker\r\n\r\nA fine for littering would significantly reduce the amount of litter on streets, which would reduce the amount entering rivers, like the Thames.\r\n\r\nIt has been successful in Manchester, Newcastle, and Belfast.\r\n\r\nA fine for littering in London is a start to saving wildlife and our health.",
        "background": "Litter from streets is blown by the wind into rivers. This threatens marine organisms as they can die from being suffocated, cut or poisoned. Also, some fish which digest plastic litter and survive are eaten by us. This introduces plastic with toxic chemicals into our food chain.",
