        "additional_details": "My own personal experience of getting into debt due to having to change jobs because of unsuitability, not earning enough income and then having to rely back on benefits to support myself and family showed me that wages need to be reasonable to actually live on. I have been unable to save for many years which I want to do and have been struggling to provide for my family/ myself due to the lack of suitable available work. I believe people with a stable income and career benefit our economy.",
        "background": "The basic minimum wage is a unreasonable income to live off of especially having the responsibility of a child/ children. It is a big struggle for many working class parents/ people to make do in the society we live in to actually live off of the basic wage provided. Many people have got into debt.",
