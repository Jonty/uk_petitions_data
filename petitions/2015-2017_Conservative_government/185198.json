        "action": "Substantially increase funding of the NHS by an equal cut in overseas aid budget",
        "additional_details": "Britain currently spends around \u00a312 Billion Pounds per year on foreign aid and, although there are good examples of money being spent well, there are many tales of money being wasted.  With the growth of the Chinese economy, why is it being looked at that we send money to help the aged population of China, while our own people are laying on trolleys in hospital corridors?  Are the Chinese, or anyone else sending money to Britain to help our sick? ",
        "background": "In view of the worsening position within the NHS, funding should be increased substantially by an equal reduction in the overseas aid budget. As a nation we can spend Billions on helping other countries develop, but we can't ensure that our own sick are looked after properly. Charity begins at home!",
