For 43 years we have been trading with a strait jacket on, imposed on us by Europe in compliance with their many rules and regs that we have now voted to reject.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease listen to the people that have asked for change and voted us out of the EU, do the right thing and look after the British people first and foremost for a change and help us to achieve our full potential, which is one of power and greatness.\r\n\r\nIf you agree, please sign the petition.",
