        "additional_details": "This new law will impost a direct violation of free speech and privacy. Whether you are 'innocent' or have 'nothing to hide', this bill directly violates your rights as a citizen. In no way should our free and democratic society be subjected to police-state-like mass surveillance laws, which don't benefit any operation of tackling major issues, such as terrorism. The flaw this bill won't tackle is the fully encrypted, anonymous dark web - which is where actual illegal activity is carried out. ",
        "background": "Mass surveillance could be legally bestowed upon us. Government now aims to legally obtain all your browsing data by means of mass collection and 'back doors'. This is unlawful, non democratic and totalitarian. Let's put a stop to the Investigatory Powers Bill. We are not a police state. ",
