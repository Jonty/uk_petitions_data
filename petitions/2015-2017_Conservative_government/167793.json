        "action": "Allow TV coverage of Saturday 3PM Premier League Matches",
        "additional_details": "I find this notion to be far outdated, especially if you consider these games are shown all over the world apart from where they're being played?! Then consider the rising cost of premium TV services such as Sky and BT Sport yet consumers are not even receiving coverage of half the premier league games. \r\n\r\nI empathise with the desire to keep fans going to the game, I really do. So I'm proposing something similar to the NFL Blackout policy that requires all tickets to be sold 72 hours prior to kickoff or no TV coverage",
        "background": "In 1964 Burnley chairman Bob Lord was convinced that televising football on a Saturday afternoon would have a detrimental effect on attendances to stadiums. As such, he created a movement to prevent showing these games,  which still stands today.",
