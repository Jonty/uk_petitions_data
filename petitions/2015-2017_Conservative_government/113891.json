We have sustained our national \u00a32.4 million investment in HIV prevention and through this funded a number of innovative local projects and set up a new HIV home sampling service -  one of the first of its kind. It is also worth highlighting that national investment in home sampling has been significantly enhanced by local investment from local authorities.  \r\n \r\nWith regard to PrEP, NHS England has agreed to carefully consider their position on commissioning. Planning continues on the early implementer tests sites in the meantime. Whatever the commissioning arrangements for PrEP, decisions to fund will depend on full assessment of clinical and cost effectiveness and how it can be integrated with other HIV prevention efforts.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health",
