        "action": "Change law regarding child sex abuse extending sentences for all the convicted",
        "additional_details": "Child sex offenders are receiving light sentences sometimes walking away with community service hours. Offenders should receive longer sentencing to deter from reoffending. Community service isn't a punishment when children suffer a lot longer and they are out sweeping the streets or other communal work. Children are our future and they should come first! Communal work is sometimes based around school areas and this should no longer be allowed as that's an offender's paradise.",
        "background": "Child sex offenders are getting away with light sentencing throughout the UK. The law needs to be changed regarding all sex offenders especially if they commit offences against children.",
