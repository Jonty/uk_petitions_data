        "additional_details": "This is not the first time that a European country has signed such a deal with Turkey. It is frustrating that the Prime Minister just signed a \u00a3100m fighter jet deal with Erdo\u011fan. She also hoped that this will lead to Britain becoming Turkey\u2019s main defence partner. The United Kingdom is one of the countries that has always respected human rights and it is vital that we stand for our values and principles. We urge the Prime Minster to cancel this deal with Turkey.  ",
        "background": "Prime Minister Theresa May signed a fighter jet deal with Turkey after visiting Ankara. Turkey has massacred Kurds, is bombing Kurds in Syria and Iraq, has shut down all Kurdish media, and has unlawfully detained Kurdish political leaders in Turkey. We demand the UK stop selling weapons to Turkey.",
