        "action": "Raise a vote of no confidence in Theresa May",
        "additional_details": "Her Brexit policy leaves her in a position that she is prepared to accept ANY deal with non European countries rather than negotiate from a position of power. We need a stronger leader and, moreover, one which has been elected by the British people, unlike Theresa May. For this reason, a vote of no confidence should be debated. Sources: Theresa May told a US refugee ban was coming http://nzzl.us/CEAqOQI",
        "background": "Theresa may has demonstrated poor judgement in her trade negotiation with US, poor leadership in initially refusing to speak out against Trump's immigrant ban and she has demonstrated poor morals in the evidence which has surfaced showing she knew about the proposed ban beforehand yet said nothing.",
