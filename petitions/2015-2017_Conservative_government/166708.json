        "additional_details": "The surge in HMO's - House of Multiple Occupancy and extortionate private rents is forcing people to live in poor conditions. Social housing with long term tenancies will help to create a better community where people can call their house a home. Private letting creates a transient community of people leaving and moving every few months and destabilises peoples lives for work, health care and general community cohesion.   ",
        "background": "With immigration at over 300,000 per year for the last 15 years we do not have enough housing. Private landlords are taking over \u00a39bn a year in housing benefit. This money should be spent on building social housing where low income persons can feel secure in a long term tenancy.",
