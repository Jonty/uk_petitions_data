        "additional_details": "The BBC's charter, as a state financed broadcaster means that the news has to unbiased. They are completely ignoring Ofcom's guidelines. They appear to be scraping the bottom of the barrel in trying to find negative items, whilst ignoring almost every single piece of more positive news. It has never been so obvious that there is something seriously wrong.",
        "background": "The news content from the BBC has become increasingly skewed by the politics of those within its editorial team. They are insidiously harming the UK by the amount of negative stories that they are broadcasting, whilst putting out virtually no positive items to balance the other side of the argument.",
