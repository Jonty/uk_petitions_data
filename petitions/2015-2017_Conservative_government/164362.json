        "additional_details": "There is already a school bus in operation for the catchment school that my son has been accepted at, and has been for many years. Other children in the village use this bus that was originally put in place for the children of our village, but it seems the policies have recently changed meaning my child and others are not entitled to the free transport. I believe this should be changed back and children should be entitled to free transport to catchment schools if needed.",
        "background": "If the walking route is unsafe due to no paths, streetlights and cars speeding down country roads then I feel that children who are offered their catchment schools, especially in rural villages, should receive free transport.",
