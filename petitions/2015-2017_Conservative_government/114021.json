        "additional_details": "The industry standards is to group victims of these crimes into the 'at fault' claim category opposed to a 'non fault' claim. The industry suggest as an 'at fault' claimant you are at a higher risk to claim again. An uninsured driver hits you or you are victim to a hit & run how does this make you a higher risk? Rather than just 2 categories (at fault & non fault) I suggest a third category - 'victim claim'. Recognise victims as victims & stop charging them for other people's criminal offences.",
        "background": "Claims due to uninsured drivers, a hit & run or vandalism will be grouped as an 'at-fault' claim. You could be charged up to 40% extra on top of your annual motor insurance for 'at-fault' claims. Victims of these crimes should not be charge additional premiums, how can a victim be at fault.",
