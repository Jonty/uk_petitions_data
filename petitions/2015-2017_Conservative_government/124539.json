        "additional_details": "Unfortunately I was classed as disabled and unable to work any more due to recurring Lymphoma cancer in 2015, I enjoyed my job which I have done for the past 35 year, even when very ill having to undergo dialysis and a Renal transplant, \u00a330 per week to me is a fortune, I am lucky enough at the moment to have a mortgage and buying my house, therefore I'll get NO help with any mortgage payment once the insurance stops paying it, if I can't afford to pay in the future we could loose the house. ",
        "background": "How can reducing the disability benefit payments by \u00a330 p/w  encourage the disabled to look for work, when too ill to work?, reportedly one minister has said people with disabilities should be willing to work for less than the minimum wage, disgusting. It will force even more people into poverty,",
