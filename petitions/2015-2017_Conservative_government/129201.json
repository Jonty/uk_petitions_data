        "additional_details": "Another event; 4 yrs after the attack. I was walking to work through a 'PARK' there were plenty of people with dogs off the lead and also people with them on. An irresponsible owner let their staff run straight at me and let his dog jump up over me, it kept running back at me and the owner stood watching, watching me trying to stop it getting near me with my bag. I had a panic attack. Dog owners always say 'no not my dog, it wouldn't hurt a fly' any dog can turn whether its trained or not.",
        "background": "I was attacked by a German shepherd/alsation in a public place. I had to have stitches and I was suffering with post traumatic stress disorder from it. My own dog was attacked by another dog off a lead, and is also suffering due to irresponsible owners.",
