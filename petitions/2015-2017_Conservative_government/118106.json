        "additional_details": "The town of Collecchio in Italy, has just passed a law to make fireworks silent, to save stress on pets and wildlife. Every year in the UK (and probably around the world) animals and owners end up in Veterinary centres to get sedatives to help keep their animals safe and with the fireworks \"season\" now being more year round, this issue is now much greater than it needs to be. Keep fireworks pretty but make them silent.",
        "background": "Every year many thousands of pets and wild animals, get stressed by the ever increasing noise made by fireworks. Several decades ago, fireworks were pretty but quiet. Nowadays, they are incredibly noisy and are often let off at other times of the year, not just in November and New Year's Eve. ",
