        "additional_details": "This is having an adverse effect on residents, workers, small businesses and visitors to Tadcaster.\r\n\r\nDue to its listed status the road bridge is unsuitable for many modern improvements. Samuel Smiths brewery are refusing to allow a temporary pedestrian bridge to be placed on land owned by them\r\n\r\nA permanent, modern and flood resistant pedestrian bridge, close to the town centre is required, should the unthinkable happen again. Keeping the town united and minimising disruption and loss of business",
        "background": "On Boxing Day in 2015 flooding caused devastation across the country. This lead to the town of Tadcaster being split in two when the bridge subsequently collapsed. \r\n\r\nPedestrians and the like are forced to use the viaduct to cross which despite recent improvements is still unusable by many.",
