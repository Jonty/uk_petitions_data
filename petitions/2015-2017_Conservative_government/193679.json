        "additional_details": "We weakened our armed forces just  prior to world war one and world war two, and reduced our Armed forces in the Falklands just before the Argentinians invaded! Weakening our Forces only encourages our Enemies, and Causes wars which are prolonged because we have to rebuild our assets.. We must learn from the lessons of history, and be in a strong position to deter our enemies..\r\n\r\nIt's no good saying we have enough to respond to today's issues! For example we could not re take the Falklands today.",
        "background": "The reason for this is obvious in my view! The world is entering a very dangerous period.. With North Korea and Iran now playing dangerous games, and Islamic terrorism on the rise! The world is getting more dangerous, we can not keep reducing the size of our fighting capacity, we must increase it.",
