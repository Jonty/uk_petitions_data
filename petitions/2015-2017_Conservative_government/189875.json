        "additional_details": "There are examples of assemblies such as the Scottish parliament that don't have an adversarial chamber and they have been shown to be effective\r\nAdversarial politics/behaviour leads to protectionism, delays and avoiding difficult decisions\r\nIt is timely due to Brexit, and the greater similarity between parties.\r\nThere should not be pressure on a 'shadow' parliament to automatically oppose everything the PM says.\r\nInstead every MP has a duty and responsibility to represent their constituents\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "At present MPs sit in opposition as adversaries instead of working together\r\nThere would be less need for a 2 party system defaulting to oppose the government\r\nMPs would be empowered to represent their constituents more & hold govt to account\r\nRight decisions that might seem difficult could be made",
