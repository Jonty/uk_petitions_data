        "additional_details": "Having faced two SEN tribunals to date, I'm faced with another battle. \r\nThe Local Authority SEN department procedures for issuing EHC plans, are governed by statutory guidelines, and also guidelines determined by Sendist Tribunal. \r\n\r\nHowever, Local Authority's are not held accountable for either timescales and as in my case exceed them by an excessive amount of time with no accountability. Local Authority's MUST be made legally accountable for unjust and unfair delays to securing SEN support.",
        "background": "This petition is to make Local Authority Special Educational Needs departments, accountable when failing to meet statutory guidelines, and those determined by Sendist. Local Authority's are currently not accountable when failing to meet those timescales, and this MUST change. ",
