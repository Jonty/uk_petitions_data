        "additional_details": "We are angry at the food industry for pandering to the minority group that want halal and kosher foods, and we want you to stand up and set an example that halal is wrong. It is completely unneccessary because the people who eat this food can say a prayer over the food which enables them to eat it.. We ask you to respect the wishes of the British people who are against it and remove this from our foods. ",
        "background": "The British people are against halal and kosher slaughter. Under British Law, animals must be stunned before slaughter, and not killed in full view of other animals. Halal and kosher slaughter is a cruel, barbaric way to slaughter an animal. ",
