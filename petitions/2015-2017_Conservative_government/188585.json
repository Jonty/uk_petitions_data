        "additional_details": "When women have a child they either have to pay for Nursery Daycare which costs \u00a35o a day on average or take the day off which concludes to not being paid. Either way they are loosing out on valuable money - in Sweden childcare costs 5 euro a day. Which is a tenth of what we pay. If we remove the extreme cost of the child day care, the gap would be reduced. ",
        "background": "On average women are paid 30% less than men annually. This is a problem. Women have the same skills as men and are able to do the job just as well but are not given the chance. They would be able to efficiently perform high up in the workplace but are not seen as capable because they're women. ",
