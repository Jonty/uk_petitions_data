        "additional_details": "The offence needs to encompass physical, mental and psychological abuse. There should be the ultimate provision for the perpetrator to be imprisoned, depending on the level of abuse. There should be a consideration of whether there was more than one occasion or if there is more than one perpetrator involved in the carrying out of the offence.",
        "background": "Those who are sufferers are various forms of Dementia and Alzheimers are very vulnerable to abuse, especially as the condition progresses. There needs to be a robust response to any such abuse. What we have now is insufficient as the offences keep happening. ",
