        "additional_details": "The extra financial burden will prove fatal to small, family run pubs.\r\nWe urge the Government to give additional rate relief to local authorities to ensure the protection of such community assets.\r\nPubs not only employ local people, they are a community hub providing a meeting place, local entertainment and support for our local farmers and suppliers, community groups and charities. \r\nIf the rate increases go ahead we will lose our independent pubs and all diversity in the hospitality industry.",
        "background": "Business rates have increased by more than 100% for some pubs. \r\nThe hardest hit are the small, family run businesses who are already struggling in competition with large chain pubs, giant pub companies and breweries.\r\n",
