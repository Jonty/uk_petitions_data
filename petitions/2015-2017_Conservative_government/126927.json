        "additional_details": "Too many residents in the Molesey area can not get the patient care they deserve and have been paying into the NHS for. Glenlyn Medical Centre is just one practice who are continually taking on new patients but can not meet the needs of their current patients, many of whom are families that have been with the surgery for generations.  People can not get appointments when needed, not even emergency appointments given out on the day.  Who else is going to pay the price before our needs are met?",
        "background": "Not enough doctors surgeries and therefore appointments are putting peoples lives at risk and a greater demand is being put on what should be an emergency care solution such as 111, hospitals and the ambulance service. Gone are the days where you can see the same GP and have consistent care. ",
