        "additional_details": "I'm starting a petition about spice and illegal highs, now at one time they was legal, now they are not legal. I have noticed an increase of homeless people in Manchester City centre, smoking spice and not knowing what to do afterwards. The worst case can cause death.  Now I'm no drug expert, but these drugs should not be allowed on our streets. Especially where elderly people, kids really all types of different lifestyles & all ages are. So please help my petition come into action.",
