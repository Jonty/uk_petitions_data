        "additional_details": "The British Government in January said it was considering whether to conduct a study into whether gay or bisexual men in monogamous, same-sex relationships should still have to wait 12 months after having sex to donate blood.\r\n\r\nThis still does not make sense.  It cannot be logical that a gay man practising safe sex with a single partner is banned from giving blood while a straight man having unsafe sex with multiple partners can. There is no logic to this and it is unnecessarily discriminatory.\u201d\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The government state:  You should not donate blood for 12 months after having sex with, a man who has had oral or anal sex with another man.  Even thought there is currently a shortage of blood.  \r\n\r\nMy mother had a triple bypass several years ago, it was my wish to repay the blood used.\r\n",
