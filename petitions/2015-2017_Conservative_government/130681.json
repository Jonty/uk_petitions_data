        "additional_details": "Universities and SFE offer varying amounts ranging from \u00a32000 to \u00a32500. According to the NUS average living costs for a student in the UK is \u00a313,388 for living costs\r\n(\u00a36,143 for rent, \u00a31,956 for food, \u00a3316 for household goods, \u00a365 for insurance, \u00a32,074 for personal items, \u00a31,524 for travel and \u00a31,310 for leisure).",
        "background": "SFE is there to help students afford their university studies, however the amount offered for a volunteer (unpaid) placement year is considerably lower, making it hard for students to afford living costs. Universities are pushing for students to take placement years yet SFE is making it unaffordable",
