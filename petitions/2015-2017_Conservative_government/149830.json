The claim \"We send the EU \u00a3350 million a week\"; the statement \"Let's fund our NHS instead\" appeared to imply this sum could be spent on the NHS; members of the Vote Leave Committee have backtracked on this claim within days of the referendum.\r\n\r\n2. The claim that \"The EU IS expanding to include ... Turkey\" and \"WHEN they join...\"; was the public misled over accession requirements and the UK's veto?\r\n\r\n3. The claim stated as fact that \"60% of our laws come from the EU\".",
