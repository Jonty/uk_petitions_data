        "additional_details": "You may ask why I haven't asked for a General Election.  The rules of these petitions say you can't submit one that will directly trigger an Election, so the wording of this one is to ask MPs to indicate their preference.  \r\n\r\nIt is democratically poor in this country that parties have mid-term leadership contests and replace their PM without reference to us.  \r\n\r\nIn this case the political landscape is so dramatically altered, and the UK will change so much, we really should be allowed to choose.  ",
        "background": "In the wake of Referendum result, and its massive implications for the UK, the current PM has chosen to step down.  Fair enough.\r\n\r\nWhat's not acceptable is that the Electorate will have no say in the government that follows, especially when that will be the government negotiating our withdrawal.  ",
