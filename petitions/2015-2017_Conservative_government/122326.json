        "additional_details": "I currently work for a company through an agency in the North East UK.\r\nI have been told on numerous occasions, that\r\n\"the company\" has stated that NO ONE will be given permanent contracts for my job description, only certain departments offer contracts and that is EXTREMELY rare. \r\nMany of the staff on my department have worked with this company for over 2 years and are STILL being told by bosses things like \"if you don't come in this Saturday (voluntary overtime) we'll just replace you\" ",
        "background": "Agency workers are used by companies as a disposable resource. Yes not all staff want to stay with the same company, but the majority do. All agency workers want is a permanent contract, fair working wage, and conditions after 6 months working for a company that clearly needs them. No exceptions!  ",
