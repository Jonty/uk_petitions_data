        "background": "The proposed 1 mph tolerance is unacceptable for two main reasons:\r\n1) speed cameras should be used for public safety and not as cash generators\r\n2) setting such a strict limit will distract drivers as it is very difficult to remain within such a tight threshold without constantly checking speed.",
