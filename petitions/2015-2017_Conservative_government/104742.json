        "action": "All Rooftops on new buildings must be partially covered by Plants/Solar panels.",
        "additional_details": "Some benefits:\r\n- The plants on green roofs do a great job of capturing airborne pollutants and other atmospheric deposition. They can also filter noxious gasses.\r\n\r\n- They open up new areas for community gardens, commercial and recreational space in busy cities where this space is generally quite limited.\r\n\r\n- Adding natural beauty and major aesthetic improvement to buildings.\r\n\r\n-  Assistance with storm water management because water is stored & then taken up by plants & returned to the atmosphere.",
        "background": "Green roofs, have an isolating effect which helps to reduce the amount of energy needed to heat a building during the winter or cool it in the summer. They are capable of retaining rainwater and reducing problems with run-off, and also offer birds a place to call home in the urban jungle.",
