        "additional_details": "Of an estimated 3 million expatriate UK citizens, the 1.2 million living in EU countries are those most immediately affected by Brexit, yet many of their voices have not been heard. The fact that they have not been UK-resident for 15 years should not exclude them from voting in an issue of great importance with a direct impact upon their lives. Their numbers would be sufficient to change the result in favour of Remain. The referendum should be declared null, or repeated with full representation.",
        "background": "There are some 3 million expatriate UK citizens, equivalent to around one-tenth of the total votes cast in the referendum. Many have been denied a vote as they have been living abroad for 15 years or more. Had their votes been recognised, they could have tipped the balance in favour of Remain. ",
