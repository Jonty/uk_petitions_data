        "additional_details": "My class' official last college deadline is June 10th. The move to Future Skills is 23rd May. This either means; finish all of our work, including our Final Major Project, in the next 3 weeks or; move and have the possibility of losing our work, as well as the anxiety of starting somewhere completely new just 5 weeks before the end!  It's right in the middle of A level revision before their exams. Salford City College, who I put my trust into for the past 2 years, are now jeopardising my grades.",
        "background": "Why are Salford City College sabotaging my grades at Eccles Sixth Form Centre?\r\nSalford City College have made the decision to start their move early. My current course, media, and some other courses are moving centres. Media is moving to Future Skills in Media City...before I finish my assignments.",
