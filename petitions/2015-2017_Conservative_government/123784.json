        "additional_details": "There are over 400 unaccompanied children in the Calais Jungle and tens of thousands across the continent. They are the most vulnerable of the vulnerable. They have travelled hundreds of miles without the protection of adults or families.\r\nMany have relatives in the UK and a legitimate claim to enter the country. \r\nIn January, a senior representative of Europol estimated that 10,000 unaccompanied children had gone missing within Europe. \r\n",
        "background": "Medical volunteers helping in Calais report they have treated 7 boys aged between 14 & 16 in the past six months who claimed to have been raped. All had injuries consistent with these claims. \r\nWe call on the British government to ease the path of entry to minors with legitimate claims to asylum.",
