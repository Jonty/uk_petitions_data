        "additional_details": "Under previous schemes with the child Support Agency non resident parents would be expected to pay 20% of Net pay, under the new scheme with the Child Maintenance Service they are expected to pay 16% of Gross taxable income, so a company car and fuel allowance of for example \u00a39000 per annum will see a non resident parent pay an additional \u00a31'440 per annum without ever seeing additional pay in their pay. ",
        "background": "Non residents parents are being financially penalised by having to pay extra monies if they receive 'benefits in kind' such as a company car, fuel allowance or private medical care from their employer. This is fundamentally unfair and unethical, and puts extra pressure on the non resident parent. ",
