        "additional_details": "The UK faces a series of incredibly difficult decisions following the EU referendum result. The future of the UK and its very existence as we know it are in jeopardy. Those decisions need to be taken by a democratically elected leader with the backing of the public. We cannot reward ambitious politicians, such as Boris Johnson, for misleading the public and exploiting nationwide issues for their personal gain. We cannot accept a Prime Minister who seeks to by-pass the UK's democratic process.",
        "background": "David Cameron will step down as PM by October. His replacement will be voted for by 150,000 Conservative party members, given a choice of just two candidates, selected by 331 MPs. They will govern for 3 years and 6 months unless parliament approves a motion for early elections. We demand it does so.",
