        "additional_details": "The normal parking bays are too small for me to open the buggy and take my baby out of the car. Whereas the parent and child bay is wide enough to do so as that is what it is meant for. I think this problem would lessen if a parking badge was given at antenatal or doctor appointment & the badge would start from the day the child is born until they are maybe 5 years old or at least 3 years old.",
        "background": "Many times I have gone to a parent and child bay to park and there are no spaces. Most times I wait around for a space to become vacant. In doing so I see people who have no children with them going back to their cars. They are taking spaces from people like me who have a baby & need the space.",
