        "additional_details": "For Example, Catfish and the Bottlemen, recently sold out in 5 minutes. at 10:02 the ticket companies previously mentioned were selling tickets for \u00a369 and upward, some tickets costing \u00a3158. The original selling price of the ticket was \u00a319.50. As a fan from the beginning I think this is totally unfair and more should be put in place to stop this from happening. Tickets should be capped at how much they're allowed to sell for. ",
        "background": "Bands 'sell out' their concerts in minutes. However, 2 minutes later, reselling ticket companies (seatwave, ticket oligarch, GetMeIn, Viagogo) have tickets, selling them for a highly inflated price, sometimes over 3X the original price. Leaving fans disappointed and unable to see their favourite band",
