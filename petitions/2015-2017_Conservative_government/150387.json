        "action": "Disregard the result of the recent EU referendum due to the public being misled.",
        "additional_details": "Not only does the \u00a3350m figure willfully ignore the rebate, the Leave campaign immediately backtracked after the result, saying this sum could not be spent on the NHS. They have also begun to distance themselves from immigration promises made in the run up to the referendum. It is therefore clear that the public were misled about the choice they had to make, with many now regretting their choice and its consequences. The extremely narrow result must now be disregarded or the referendum repeated.",
        "background": "The British public were deliberately lied to in the run up to the EU referendum. Many people who voted for Brexit did so because of widely spread implications made by the Leave campaign that \u00a3350million per week could be saved and spent instead on funding the NHS. This was clearly false advertising.",
