        "action": "Restore old mathematics specification.",
        "additional_details": "There are only a hand full of students achieving their personal FFT target and others who have a certain potential, if the exams were not worded in such ways as seen in specimen and predicted papers. Furthermore, in comparison to last year, students' grades have dropped exponentially to the point of concern for students, teachers and personal tutors.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this will stimulate many more students achieving their FFT and reaching full potential in success for the future.",
        "background": "As most students and teachers are aware, the new maths specification is significantly harder to achieve. With the new 9-1 grading system and completely reworded questions, It's more difficult for students to succeed resulting to thousands underachieving their target grade by a significant amount. ",
