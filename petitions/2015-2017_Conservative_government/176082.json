This web site gives the details. http://www.cmoptions.org\r\nMost absent parents are more than willing to provide maintenance for their children but the system sound could be a lot fairer instead of penalising the paying parent.",

This is means that After TAX and NI contributions have been taken off their income, the paying parent is left with less disposable income, which in turn can lead to financial difficulty.",
