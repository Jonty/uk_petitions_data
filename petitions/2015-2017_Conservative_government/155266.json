Daniel Hannan says they cannot guarantee an end to free movement even though this was a Leave campaign promise. A poll by Survation says over 1,000,000 people now wish to change their Leave vote to a Remain vote.",

Over 1,000,000  now regret having voted Leave. Surely this should mean that MP's debate the result but should not act on it.",
