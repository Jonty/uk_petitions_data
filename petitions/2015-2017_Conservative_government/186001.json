        "additional_details": "RSA insured our specialist truck-mounted carpet cleaning machine and van set-up last year with 0 NCD for \u00a31800, this year they are asking for \u00a33400 even though we have earned 1 years NCD and no changes.\r\nI have invested over \u00a375,000 in this machine and vehicle based upon us being able to insure it, I will now have to sell the setup and make 2 staff members unemployed. I also have another setup which is renewable in Sept, if the same happens the business will go under and 8 staff become unemployed",
        "background": "Our specialist commercial vehicle insurance has risen from \u00a31800 pa to \u00a33400 pa for no reason, we have not made a claim & now have 1 years no claims discount, Insurance company refuse to provide an answer.\r\nThis is kind of increase will result in less vehicles and therefore less employees.",
