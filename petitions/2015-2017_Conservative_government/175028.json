        "additional_details": "I have taken the time to speak to carers, some of whom have dedicated their whole lives to fostering. Many have shared with me that despite being unhappy they remain where they are as they could not face another full process at their time of life. They also feel that they are unable to share how they are feeling due to fear of being penalised by the local authority for example 'not placing children with them'. As carers we have no rights, please give us the right to transfer and be happy!",
        "background": "I have been a Foster Carer for my local authority for the past five years. Over the last year I have become incredibly unhappy with the way in which the service has treated myself and other carers. We are unable to transfer to another agency without being subject to another full process. ",
