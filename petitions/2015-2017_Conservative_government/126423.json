        "action": "Ban remote gambling nationwide, it is dangerous and destroying lives.",
        "additional_details": "Under section 24 of the Gambling Act 2005 - 'Children and other vulnerable people are protected from being harmed or exploited by gambling'. Age vertification and self-exclusion are not enough to protect the children of problem gamblers or the millions of UK citizens who would be deemed 'vulnerable'. Since most online gambling operators are based outside of the UK there is no financial gain for the British people that would remotely justify these companies being able to transact with or advertise to consumers in Britain.",
        "background": "British families are being destroyed by remote (online) gambling. Individuals can easily lose property, retirement funds, business money, savings, and wages from the comfort of their homes and within hours resulting in suicide, depression, divorce and losing their children. It needs to be banned.",
