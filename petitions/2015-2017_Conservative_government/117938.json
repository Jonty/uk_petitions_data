        "additional_details": "The current ban has been treat with total disregard as foxhunters are \"accidentally\" killing foxes as if the ban does not exist. Thugs have been wielding knives & punching women in the face who oppose this barbaric activity. Drag hunting is not an option either as hounds have ran into the path of hounds.We are living in the modern age & changes have to be made & if the hunters still want the thrill of the chase Clean Boot hunting is the only way forward to keep the foxes safe. ",
        "background": "Clean Boot hunting where hounds pursue a running man rather than a terrified fox is the only humane option. Opposition to fox hunting has never been stronger with 83% of the population opposed to hunting. It`s about time people who fox hunt evolved & stop living in the past stating it`s tradition.",
