He is tipped to head the inquiry.\r\n\r\nDavid Isaac is a lawyer chosen to be commissioner's chair. Isaac states he \u201cleads teams of lawyers on major projects\u201d - some are for the DWP. His employers, Pinset Masons, refuse to reveal what Isaac has been involved in for the DWP, so Isaac could have been involved in reforms now under investigation by the watchdog for whom he now works.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
