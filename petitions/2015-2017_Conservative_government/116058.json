        "action": "Stop the introduction of quarterly tax returns for small businesses.",
        "additional_details": "Most small firms and individuals such as myself rely on the help of our accountants to complete and submit the complex tax return forms. The average cost for accountancy fees for a small business is \u00a31000. A four fold cost increase to \u00a34000 pa. is simply unsustainable at a time where profit margins are continually being squeezed. The additional red tape for small business owners along with the greatly increased accountancy costs will drive many small firms out of business.",
        "background": "U-turn on George Osborne's declaration that small businesses and workers currently filing their own tax returns will have to submit tax returns four times a year to come in line with the larger corporates.",
