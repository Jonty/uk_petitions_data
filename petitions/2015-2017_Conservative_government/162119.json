        "additional_details": "A 2013 Barack Obama Bill allows use and training with adrenaline auto-injectors in schools for acute asthma and anaphylaxis, and includes a Good Samaritan clause. IM adrenaline slows mucus production, and relaxes bronchial smooth muscle allowing cough, improved breathing, and enables mouth to mouth resucitation. EpiPen, Jext, and Emerade auto-injectors have needles which pass through clothing into thigh muscle; 2 or 3 injections may be needed. Ref. doi:10.1136/thoraxjnl-2015-207207",
        "background": "800 asthmatics die per year out-of-hospital; autopsy invariably shows lungs blocked with mucus. News reports attest to helplessness of parents and bystanders. Intramuscular (IM) adrenaline injections may maintain life until paramedic help arrives, when further adrenaline is already allowed.",
