He says waiting for his illness to leave him \"like a living zombie\", was a \"terrifying\" prospect.\r\n\r\nGive the patient the right of choice and control over their death, because the current ban on assisted dying denies them these rights and forces them to face an unacceptable set of options.\r\n",
        "background": "At present there is a blanket prohibition on providing a person with assistance to die.\r\n\r\nSome illnesses like motor neurone disease have such a horrific end to life that the patients should have the right to decide whether they want  a swifter death through medication. \r\n",
