        "additional_details": "Google 'Indigo Development Guardian Article' to read a bit of our story. \r\nAnyone can set up and work as a builder. Building Control, despite the title, does not protect home owners. Once things goes wrong, builders use liquidation to avoid liabilities and continue trading using another company. Good builders should welcome regulation, bad builders should fear it. \r\n\r\nScrap Building Control and use the money to protect the public by getting builders registered, as in most countries and industries.",
        "background": "We suffered from bad builders. Every control failed, including Building Control. The builder went into liquidation owing us and HMRC. We are sick of hearing \u2018that\u2019s what builders are like\u2019. In many countries they are regulated. Sign the petition to protect others, perhaps yourself in the future.\r\n",
