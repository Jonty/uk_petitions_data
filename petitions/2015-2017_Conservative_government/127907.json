        "additional_details": "A fine for littering in the UK will reduce the amount of litter on streets, and entering and polluting rivers.\r\n\r\nOver 75% of some types of fish have been found to have plastic fragments in their gut. This also harms humans, as we eat some of these fish and so are allowing the plastic and toxic chemicals further into our food chain.\r\n\r\nIntroducing a fine for littering would significantly reduce the amount of river pollution by litter, like plastic items. This saves wildlife and our health.",
        "background": "Litter on streets is often blown by the wind into rivers, polluting them. Thousands of marine organisms die from being trapped and suffocated by packaging, and poisoned by digesting some of the litter, like items made of plastic.",
