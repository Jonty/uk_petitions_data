        "action": "Fund health and psychological care for survivors of FGM",
        "additional_details": "It is important for non-pregnant and woman under 25 to have access to a discrete and holistic service which will enable them to take the first steps to recovery from this most serious form of abuse.  These are the women who will end FGM if we support them now. Providing support at an earlier stage will prevent more serious physical and psychological issues and promotes efficiency in healthcare provision.",
        "background": "The NHS is providing inadequate services to FGM survivors, e.g. funding for the award-winning Acton clinic that has helped thousands for nearly a decade is ending. Government must provide funding to ensure services remain and are provided away from hospitals as many fear repercussions and stigma.",
