My payday was the next day and I had plans to pay then anyway so I would have found out. As a result I got an in 10.  6 points which stay on the licence for 4 years pumping up car insurance by lots and lots of money. (I STILL BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MY FAULT).  So 4 years have passed and still my car insurance is sky high as all the insurance companies keep it on record and used it against us for an extra year. THIS IS WRONG! THIS MUST CHANGE NOW! ",
