        "additional_details": "As many more people now travel to Layton Government offices from Preston, Blackpool, Poulton, Kirkham and further afield. We have to suffer cold, overcrowded trains and spiralling ticket prices  Currently this route and others are served by awful Pacer 'trains'  which are the body of a bus welded to the base of a freight train. The line between Preston and Blackpool is being upgraded in the next year so this would be an ideal opportunity for them to amend the timetable for more Layton stops. ",
        "background": "The train service between Preston via Layton to Blackpool North is inadequate. Only 1 train an hour stops at Layton. Due to expansion of Government offices there now upwards of 3,000 staff and rising commute to Layton. What we want is 1) Extra stops at Layton 2) Heated trains with more carriages. ",
