        "additional_details": "Another referendum should not be held. This was a once in a lifetime decision made by the British people, and such a decision should not be ignored. Some people are evidently upset with the result, and that is understandable, but you do not ask for another referendum just because the result did not go your way. After the divide, chaos and uncertainty caused over the past four months, we do not need a repeat of that process. It would be devastating and unwise. ",
        "background": "On 23 June, Britain voted to leave the EU, with a majority of 51.9%. Despite the outcome, there is currently a petition going around to hold a 2nd referendum, turning a blind eye to the democratic verdict given on Thursday. David Cameron said himself that \"this is a referendum and not a neverendum.\"",
