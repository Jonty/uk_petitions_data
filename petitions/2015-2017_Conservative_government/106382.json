        "additional_details": "Nick Gargans case has already cost the tax payer over \u00a31 million and the case continues as Nick refuses to stand down.\r\nWe must make Nick Gargan resign and stand down before he puts Police forces further into trust issues.\r\n\r\nNick Gargan needs to be shown what he has done is not acceptable and there needs to be a clear message to other Police staff that this behaviour will not be accepted and there is no hiding behind a rank.",
        "background": "Nick Gargan was found to have committed a number of misconduct offences while on duty within Avon and Somerset Police.\r\nAlthough he was found guilty, he continues to work for the force. We the undersigned demand he is sacked from the force without further appeal.",
