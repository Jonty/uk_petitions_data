We therefore call on the British People to sign this petition in line with current legislation of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011, asking that Parliament debates a vote of no confidence in the current Parliament. Erosion of public services, victimisation of the disabled and working class, and a mishandled economy all serve as justification for this. ",
