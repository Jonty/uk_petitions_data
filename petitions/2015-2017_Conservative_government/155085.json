        "additional_details": "Throughout the Leave campaign, the campaign leaders implied that money recouped from the EU would be used to fund the NHS, a claim they have now backtracked upon. They encouraged the public to ignore expert opinion and have since carefully removed all evidence of their backhanded campaign tactics. Nigel Farage has publicly launched campaign materials that singled out a single racial group, actions which we feel constitute an incitement to hate and should be treated as such. \r\n",
        "background": "There is considerable evidence that the figureheads of the recent EU Referendum Leave campaign - Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Nigel Farage amongst others - wilfully misled the public during their campaign. They are unfit for public service. We call for a full independent review of their actions.",
