        "additional_details": "A previous petition was raised to make labeling food as vegetarian and/or vegan as a legal requirement, as many companies refuse to label their products as Vegetarian or vegan. A simple legal requirement for a label, would assist thousands of consumers to make smart choices.  The government's response confirmed that no single agreed definition makes it difficult to legally require food businesses to provide labeling.  A legal definition will assist in changing this.",
        "background": "Currently there is no single agreed definition for \u2018vegetarian\u2019 or \u2018vegan\u2019. This makes it difficult to legally require food businesses to provide information on the suitability of their products for vegetarian and vegan consumers. ",
