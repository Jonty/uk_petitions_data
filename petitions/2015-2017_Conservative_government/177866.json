        "additional_details": "Many Police Station based gyms have been closed and cops starting on \u00a319'000 a year are paying over \u00a360 per month in certain areas to keep themselves at the REQUIRED standard. If there is a required standard then surely they should be helped along. We want Gyms back in Police Stations or subsidised Gym memberships for our dedicated and professional Officers. ",
        "background": "Police Officers are required to pass a fitness test every year and also when they apply to take on different roles such as Public Order Policing or firearms roles. We expect our Police to chase people and climb fences. Most importantly we expect them to CATCH the suspects. ",
