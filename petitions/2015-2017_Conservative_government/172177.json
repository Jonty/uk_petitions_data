        "additional_details": "I propose we immediately introduce a \"e-vote\" system into the UK. This can secured by applying online to vote, providing email and post address. A code can then be posted to the applicant which needs to be entered into the website to vote on polling day, with the  postcode and NI number of the voter. An email can then be sent to the registered voter to confirm the time they voted. This ensures that the system could not be hijacked and would make it more secure than the current postal vote.  ",
        "background": "Recent elections have shown that the younger voter feels disenfranchised with the  process in the UK. It is really important to get everyone involved  in UK politics and allowing people to vote via the internet would  increase turnout for future elections, something that can only benefit democracy.",
