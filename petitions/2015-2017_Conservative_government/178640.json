        "additional_details": "No government wishes to increase taxation for fear of losing power. Of the big three taxes:  a 1% rise in all rates of income tax would raise \u00a35.5 billion; a 1% rise in all employee and self-employed National Insurance  contribution (NIC) rates would raise \u00a34.9 billion; and  a 1% rise in the main rate of VAT would raise \u00a35.2 billion [Institute for Fiscal Studies, 2015]. We urge the government to engage with the public who demand a properly funded health service, and are prepared to pay for it.",
        "background": "The NHS remains critically under-funded. The most optimistic predictions on efficiency savings means by 2020 \u00a38 billion extra per year is needed [NHS England, 2014]. Increased revenue is required for the NHS to continue delivering world class healthcare for all, free at the point of need.",
