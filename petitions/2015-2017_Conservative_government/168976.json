        "additional_details": "\r\n\r\nWhilst we welcome the move to schedule CBD as a medicine following clinical trials, it must be understood that completely removing it from the market with only 28 days notice is not sufficient time for patients to find alternative ways of maintaining their health. \r\n\r\nCBD is well documented through clinical research to be non-toxic and non-psychoactive and has no recorded negative side effects in humans, as well as being a powerful anti-inflammatory, anti-spasmodic and anti-epilepsy drug.
