        "additional_details": "Due to the crisis in Syria, our families were forced to leave the country to seek safety. Germany made four separate programs to allow their German - Syrian citizens to bring their families to Germany. As British citizens, we also should have the right to bring our parents and siblings who have fled the devastating war and terrorism to the UK. This will help  their integration within the British society and ease their everyday life. ",
        "background": "After the announcement to accept Syrian refugees from the camps bordering Syria, British-Syrian citizens still can't bring their families to the UK. As British citizens, we request to give our families living in Syria's neighbouring countries the priority to seek asylum in the UK.",
