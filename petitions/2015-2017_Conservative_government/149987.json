        "additional_details": "The country is completely divided over the result of this campaign, we need a leader who 'Remain' supporters can also believe in to help unite the British people once again.  For the future of Britain I beg David Cameron to  remain as Prime Minister and lead EU negotiations to insure we get the best deal.  Having tried his best to convince Britain to stay in the EU, he is far better placed to negotiate with Europe than the 'Leave' campaigners who contributed to our rejection of the EU.   ",
        "background": "David Cameron has resigned as Prime Minister on the basis that 'Remain' marginally lost the referendum for the UK to remain a member of the EU.  Having won a majority in the last election just 13 months ago, I feel he has a responsibility to deliver his mandate. ",
