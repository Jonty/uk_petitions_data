        "action": "Create a \"Brexit\" coalition government of 'all the talents' to negotiate EU exit",
        "additional_details": "Not only does the issue divide the nation equally, but also urban and rural communities, as well as creating a generational divide. There are also significant risks to the stability of UK, with Scotland, as well as Northern Ireland, where peace is also threatened. Full inclusion of all views and persuasions in a \"Brexit\" coalition government will best enable Britain to negotiate its future interests and ensure that our people and politics can heal and prosper following such divisive campaigns. ",
        "background": "The handling of the process of \"Brexit\" is too important not to fully include views and talents from across the House of Commons. The process and its ramifications will have consequences for the UK population and political parties for generations that it is only right that they are fully included.  ",
