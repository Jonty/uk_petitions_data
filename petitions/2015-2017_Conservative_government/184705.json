        "additional_details": "The government and the schools need to wake up and realise that even if the students do not achieve high marks, they are still learning and they are still more prepared for their future. \r\nI was told I'm not good enough to study computer science by my teacher, but I did it anyway and finished with top marks. I have Ba in CS and Ma in IT in education. I run successful business and yes maths never was my thing. Yet I wasn't denied the chance. My niece unfortunately is denied to learn for her future",
        "background": "Girls and disadvantage children are left behind unprepared for the future as they are denied to study computer science.\r\n\r\nSecondary schools are setting up high requirements for maths and other subjects for students to be allowed to take CS GCSE.\r\n\r\nMany schools have no girls taking CS GCSE ",
