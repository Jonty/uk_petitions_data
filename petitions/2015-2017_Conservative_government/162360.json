        "additional_details": "New Zealand's smallest coin is the 10c which is approximately equivalent to 5p (GBP)\r\nAustralia has scrapped its 1c & 2c and its 5c coin is approximately equivalent to 3p (GBP)\r\nIn the USA it has long been known that minting the 1c coin actually costs more than 1c per coin.\r\nMany people in the UK often throw away 1p & 2p coins as they are practically worthless.",
        "background": "There is very little that can be purchsed for 1p or 2p now, so it is pointless having these coins. It is also a waste of money minting them. If the lowest denomination of coin minted was 5p then everything could be priced at \u00a3x.95 instead of \u00a3x.99",
