        "additional_details": "The Leave campaign potentially appears to have made misleading economic allegations in their campaign literature and general \"messaging\" to UK voters, and this may have swayed them to vote Leave, concluding wrongly that a Leave vote would result in more money for UK services such as the NHS and to grow the UK economy.  Since the pound, stock market and other economic indicators show that the UK's economy is in jeopardy, we call upon Parliament not to make the EU referendum legally binding. ",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, call upon the UK Government not to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The result of the June 2016 referendum is not required to be legally binding under the European Union Referendum Act of 2015. We call upon the UK Government to protect the UK economy.  ",
