        "action": "Create new Animal and Domestic Pet Protection legislation to imprison abusers",
        "additional_details": "Recently introduced legislation in the US will allow courts to treat those who abuse animals in the same vein as humans. Numerous physiological research conclude that one of the first steps towards a person being mentally capable of taking another human life often start off abusing and killing animals\r\n\r\nAt the moment pet homocide can only be treated as 'criminal damage', but with people like the Croydon cat killer freely walking the streets we believe stronger legislation should be introduced.\r\n",
        "background": "Britian is a nation of animal lovers, with an estimated 46% of households having a domestic pet. Unfortunately however, animal cruelty offences continue to occur, with very little in the way of \"animal rights\" to prevent them, or to punish offenders. Pets mean more than the \"property\" defined in law",
