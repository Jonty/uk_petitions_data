        "additional_details": "In many circumstances in the past careers and livelihoods have been ruined by such allegations - even when the accused were eventually found innocent in a court of law. For many of the same reasons that the accusers are granted anonymity, we should extend this to accused to allow them protection from public scrutiny until they are found guilty. ",
        "background": "While we find complete sympathy with all men and women who have been raped, the anonymity provided to the accusers must be extended to the accused until a verdict is reached. Careers are easily destroyed on allegations alone - even when the accused is found innocent. The imbalance is unjustifiable.",
