        "additional_details": "The government could work in partnership with all the major retailers like ASDA, Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrison\u2019s, Tesco etc. Supermarkets can claim the money back from their local authority, it will be similar to the healthy start vouchers, but on a bigger scale.  Help stop wasting tax payers money, by people spending our tax money on scratchcards alcohol and cigarettes. Buying stuff they actually need. The welfare voucher will restrict by not being able to buy scratchcards with them and limit how much cigarettes and alcohol they can buy with them as well. ",
        "background": "Introduce a welfare voucher for individuals, couples and families alike which will replace the benefits that they are on. No one will be out of pocket as they will get exactly the same amount of monetary value, based on their circumstances",
