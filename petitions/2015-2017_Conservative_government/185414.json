        "additional_details": "Parents of children with headlice are been harrassed to send their children to school and the spread of lice continues. \r\nThey think if a childs hair is tied up they can not be spread. Wrong.\r\nThey think as long as your actively trying to get rid of them, the child should be in school. Wrong.\r\nChildren with headlice should be kept off school until the headlice are completely gone and the nit nurse should be able to check before allowing a child back into school. \r\nA once a week visit would sufice.\r\n",
        "background": "Are you sick and tired of your children getting headlice because parents are forced to send their children to school with headlice, as schools see education been more important than health? I certainly am. Help to get nit nurses back into schools.",
