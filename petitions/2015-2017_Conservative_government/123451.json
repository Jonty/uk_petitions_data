We call upon all governments to apply sanctions on Israel, as it must not be allowed to continue to break International law with impunity. We ask our government to explain why it allows the occupation to continue while maintaining its friendship with a state which acts in this way.",

Israel must cease its expansion and occupation of all foreign territories. We call on the UK Government to boycott Israel until such time as it complies with International law.",
