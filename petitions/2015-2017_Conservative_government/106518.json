        "action": "Change the hate crime laws in the UK to include alternative sub-cultures",
        "additional_details": "People who are part of the goth,emo, and mosher sub-culture face discrimination everyday. It is also an international problem as, a few years ago, Iraq students were killed because they 'looked emo' and the government considered it 'satanic'. Last year, a man in Iowa was attacked for having body modifications and was called a 'freak with horns'. This is a large issue that affects many people regularly and we can make a change to promote tolerance everywhere",
        "background": "After the death of Sophie Lancaster, Sylvia Lancaster set up the Sophie Lancaster Foundation to change the hate crime laws to include alternative sub-cultures. So far, the police in places such as Greater Manchester treat crimes against people because of their alternative lifestyle as hate crimes",
