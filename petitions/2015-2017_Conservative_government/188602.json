        "additional_details": "We need more funding and education in this area from the government. NHS staff need to be trained in how to deal with FGM, especially in Midwifery. Teachers also need to know about this issue and it should be introduced as a discussed health issue in school. Police also should be aware and need to know how to deal with cases of FGM. Finally, more funding should be directed into community services and groups, charities, and other organisations aiming to support survivors and push for eradication.",
        "background": "FGM is an issue all round the world, but an estimated 137,000 women and girls are affected by FGM in England and Wales [Macfarlane, A. and Dorkenoo, E. (2015)]. Despite this, there are only 14 NHS clinics in the UK to help survivors of FGM. This needs more attention and input by the government.",
