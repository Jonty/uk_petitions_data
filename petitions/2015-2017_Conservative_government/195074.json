Whether it happens in the home, in the school playground, on the street or in the workplace\u201d.  \r\n\r\nThe vast majority of workplace bullying has a substantial element of Psychological Abuse associated with it.  As with domestic Violence, there are numerous similarities and the effects can be just as devastating, life changing and long lasting.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on workplace bullying, the effects and on this petition, visit www.workplacebullying.me. \r\n",
        "background": "A new law targeting people who psychologically and emotionally abuse their partners etc has come into force under the Serious Crime Bill. This law only covers intimate relations.  Abuse is abuse, therefore, I believe this law should also cover victims of workplace bullying and other forms of abuse.",
