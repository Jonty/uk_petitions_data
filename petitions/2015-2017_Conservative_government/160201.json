        "additional_details": "I reviewed my CCTV footage and can see only one car drive down my road from when the cat goes over the fence until someone clearly picks him up and places him on the pavement. the car in question can't be positively identified but was going at some speed and made no attempt to swerve, slow down or stop after the event. This attitude that family pets are not important enough to make a law to protect has bred this type of attitude and I for one think this is wrong and needs addressing ",
        "background": "On Friday 13th of May my life was forever changed.\r\nMy much loved cat was run over and killed outside my house. I was on my way to work when my neighbour called to break the news. I had to come home and take my cat to be cremated the same day and was off work for a week as a result with stress.",
