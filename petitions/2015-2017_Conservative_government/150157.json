        "additional_details": "I have seen elderly people drive up to the bus stop and get on the bus. This is completely unreasonable as they are perfectly able to drive. As a young adult in Burton, Dorset, I have been shocked by the fact that the local bus company (which is no longer funded by the local authority) has had to scrap their service after the 6th August 2016 which as a result will leave the whole of Burton isolated from the rest of Christchurch. The nearest bus is over 2 miles away.",
        "background": "The majority of bus users such as workers, students and parents are annoyed with the fact that bus services are being withdrawn from their local area due to the bus company not being able to make any money because of there being a high usage of elderly people using their free bus pass.
