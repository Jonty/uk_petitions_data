        "additional_details": " If the Postal Votes show a marked difference in voting patterns to that observed from those voting in person, then the result should not be announced until the Postal Votes hav As the postal votes are not retained for verification, this could be leading to an undemocratic \"fixing\" of important elections or referendums.  There are rumours that large groups of non-English speakers, allow there voting cards to be collected to form these \"block\" votes which skew results.",
        "background": "It appears as if past votes have been unduly influenced by block voting in Postal Votes.  The Postal votes are not retained for examination.",
