        "additional_details": "CPR is not part of the national curriculum. I would argue this leads to a fear of causing further harm which deters people from acting positively and swiftly in life threatening situations. \r\nIt will cost next to nothing to train a teacher in every school to deliver basic CPR. This should be repeated each year from 12 to 16  as a refresher as part of the school curriculum. Children with then leave school with the skills and confidence to make a difference.",
        "background": "I am a state registered Paramedic of over 12 years experience.\r\nPeople are dying because others have neither the confidence nor the free state backed training they need from a young age to help save lives.\r\nTeaching CPR through school up to 16 could save many lives and boost children's confidence.",
