        "additional_details": "A slim majority was gained in a non-binding referendum based on people voting for unachievable ideals, promises and misconceptions, and not practical planning and consequences. Many have expressed their regret based on the short and long-term prospects that are already now apparent.\r\n\r\nHistorically a number of key referenda with close results have not been enacted, as the most popular option was seen to be unworkable. These led to a second vote or parliament acting for the greater good.",
        "background": "Parliament should use its powers to halt the UK exiting the European Union as the consequences will be so negative as to greatly outweigh any benefits.\r\n\r\nI call on you, my elected Parliamentary representatives to do the right and sensible thing, and protect the UK from years of avoidable harm.",
