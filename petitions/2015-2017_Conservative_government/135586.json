        "additional_details": "Bernie Sanders is an independent United States Senator, who has been fighting for progressive issues in the USA for 40 years. He is currently running in the Democratic Presidential Primary, although it now looks certain that he will not be the nominee.\r\n\r\nWith the UK looking at rough few years after the Brexit vote, Senator Sanders would be the perfect person to lead the country through the worst of it. He would also be the perfect person to make sure that it is the working class and middle class who receive the most benefit from the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.\r\n\r\nFeeling The Bern is better than Feeling The Boris.",
        "background": "Parliment didn't ban Donald Trump from entering the UK, but that wasn't the best idea. Instead of banning one of the worst of the Americans, why not try inviting one of the better ones over for tea, crumpets and a spot of political revolution?",
