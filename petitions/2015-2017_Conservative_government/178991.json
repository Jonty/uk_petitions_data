If further evidence is required, please seek out a reputable newspaper, turn on your televsion or have a browse on Twitter (do that last one first; it would be hilarious if not so horrifying).",

We feel that such a visit would indicate our country's tacit approval for his policies; this is emphatically not the case for a large number of Britons. ",
