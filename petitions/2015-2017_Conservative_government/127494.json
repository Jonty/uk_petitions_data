        "additional_details": "Drivers only see the outside of a person, they dont feel the pain, or other effects that the so called invisible illness causes, which is why they were issued with the badge.  Drivers have not learnt the lesson and wont unless radical action is taken.  It it therefore proposed that any car owner without a badge or those who abuse a badge are fined not \u00a360 but \u00a3300 and 3 points on the licence. The law is too leanient and has no effect. I ask everyone to support this MP's as well",
