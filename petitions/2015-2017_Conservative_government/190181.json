        "additional_details": "During the 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum, Nicola Sturgeon labelled that referendum a \"once in a generation\" choice for the Scottish people. They resoundingly said No to independence (55.3% No, 44.7% Yes) on a record turnout (84.6%)\r\n\r\nNow, Nicola Sturgeon is asking for another referendum, despite little change in polling since 2014 to suggest the Scottish people would favour independence.\r\n\r\nThe First Minister is playing politics rather than getting on with running the Scottish Government.",
        "background": "We urge the UK government to deny Nicola Sturgeon her vanity project 2nd referendum.\r\n\r\nThere has been little change in the regular polling since the 2014 referendum to suggest the Scottish people would return a different result, and this referendum is not in the interest of the Scottish people.",
