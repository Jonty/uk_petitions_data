I'm sure that many will agree that there's alot of unhelpful information you received that didn't really help you in 'real' life. By signing this petition your giving people who haven't got a voice a chance to push for a cause that I feel should have always been in place. Why aren't we made aware of disabilities and how we can help others. \"Bless those that see the world through a different window and those who understand their view\"",
