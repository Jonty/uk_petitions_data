        "additional_details": "There are thousands of car, motorcycle and home thefts throughout the year, admittedly not all the culprits are found, but those that are, and are found guilty in our opinion get away lightly, a fine, a suspended sentence. This doesn't really help the victim who could be put out of pocket by losing their no claims bonus on insurance therefore hitting their pockets again. I would like to make it so all criminals found guilty are liable to pay the victims insurance for a set amount of time. \r\n",
        "background": "I and thousands of people across the country have been victims of theft, be it vehicle, home or personal theft. \r\n\r\nA lot of us feel that the justice system is not helping the victim. We fear going through our insurance company as it affects us by increasing our insurance premium. ",
