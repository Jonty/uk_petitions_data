        "additional_details": "1)The result was simply too close. 2 countries of UK voted remain and 2 out. The 51.8 - 49.2 outcome shows that people are divided and confused, It is not a \u201cclear and certain instruction\u201d.\r\n\r\n2)It is not true that government must always do what a slim majority proposes. If that was true then majority could vote e.g. to massively reduce taxes, which would harm the country.\r\n\r\n3)If Brexit happens, many complex, huge decisions must be taken but the replacement PM was not directly elected to take them.",
        "background": "The Parliament is obliged to independently decide what is best for the UK. The referendum is non legally binding. Since the voting result was so close, now parliament owes to decide what they believe is best, otherwise call for new general elections since the priorities have now completely changed.",
