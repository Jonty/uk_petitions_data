        "additional_details": "Article 50 details are available from www.lisbon-treaty.org \u203a ... \u203a Title 6 - Final provisions (Articles 47-55)\r\nThe possibility of a second referendum being forced is high unless Article 50 is activated. The will of the people is being ignored in the worst possible way by failure of the Prime Minister and Government to recognise our democratic rights following the referendum. Your vote is not safe as a result of this failure.",
        "background": "The referendum held 23/6/2016 was a fair and true representation of the will of the BRITISH people in that 51.9% of voters said they wanted to leave the EU. Article 50 should have been enacted by the Prime Minister the day the result was declared. Article 50 legitimises Britain's exit from the EU.",
