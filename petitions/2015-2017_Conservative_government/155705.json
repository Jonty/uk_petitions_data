        "additional_details": "The Fixed Term Parliament Act offers two ways to trigger an election; via a no-confidence motion or if 2/3's of members of the House of Commons vote for one.\r\n\r\nMP's have misled voters, campaigned without clear manifestos & compromised Nations with an ill thought out ballot resulting in a failure of politics.\r\n\r\nVoters need a new start.\r\n\r\nAlso if a pro-Remain party won the election, it may supersede the Referendum. \r\n\r\nThe Referendum would be a democratic mandate, replaced by a new democratic mandate.",
        "background": "The EU Referendum has ripped apart our main political parties leaving Parliament incapacitated when reassuring the British public & negotiating with the EU should be the priority. \r\n\r\nA vote of no confidence in the current Government & a Parliamentary vote on an snap General Election is essential.",
