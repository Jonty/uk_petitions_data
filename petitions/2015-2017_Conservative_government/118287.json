        "action": "Allow reformed GCSE results to be counted by school year 11 performance tables",
        "additional_details": "This is due to schools not allowing people to do the exam twice as it does cost them money for students to sit them. I, along with many other candidates across the country, strongly feel this rule is not needed and pupils should be allowed to sit a test at any time if they are capable of reaching high end results.\r\n\r\nIf you think about it who benefits from the rule? Pupils would never be invited to sit an exam early if they were not proficient. All this rule does is take away the \"drive\" to do well.",
        "background": "Highly academic achievers in the UK, who are capable to take their examinations early should be motivated to do so, which has proved evident in the last couple of years. Now, for the Department of education to not allow the results to be counted is preventing candidates from being submitted to do so",
