        "additional_details": "There is so much Fake News relating to world leaders, governments, celebrities, events, religion, etc., that no one should be able to create, report and or distribute any Fake News. All claims made should have demonstrable, and readily available evidence and facts, to prove what is being stated and not merely be based on, heresay, or output from the many independent and very dubious agencies that exist on the internet and social media. News should be about quality and not just first to publish.",
