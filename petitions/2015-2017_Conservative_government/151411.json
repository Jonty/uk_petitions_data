        "additional_details": "The advisory nature of the EU Referendum means that there is no legal compulsion for Parliament to legislate activation of Art. 50 TEU which begins the process of UK exit from the EU. The current Parliament was elected on a mandate not containing a promise to leave the EU. The conflict between the democratic will of the people as expressed in May 2015 and June 2016 can only be resolved via an early general election, for which the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011 requires Parliamentary approval.",
        "background": "The advisory EU Referendum has returned a result that is at odds with the composition of Parliament that emerged from the May 2015 General Election. The majority of MPs cannot be obligated to legislate the steps to leave the EU against their expressed beliefs as to the interests of the country.",
