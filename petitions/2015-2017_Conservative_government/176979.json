I say this is unfair and due to people taking advantage of this before they started the fine scheme. If people take holidays often they should not be authorised to them but not to everyone. I say please help me get over a 100,000 to get the government to respond ",

Over 1billion pounds have been taking altogether from parents etc. But this is wrong and unfair due to some people taking advantage of this before the ban. Please sign to stop.",
