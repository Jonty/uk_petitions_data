Gay pride, deserve to feel safe & to be in a non-judgemental environment at these events. With protesters there, you often find arguments start, abuse & threats are often directed at those celebrating. \r\n\r\n\r\nHumans rights are for everyone, regardless of any factor.",
        "background": "Events that celebrate or try to raise awareness of equality issues In the UK should be safe places. \r\nIf you attend a pride or rally, you shouldn't have to face people who are protesting against your human rights & entitlements.\r\nProtesting (even peacefully) at these events should be an offence!
