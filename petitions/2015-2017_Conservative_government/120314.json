        "action": "Abolish ALL prescription charges for people suffering with cystic fibrosis",
        "additional_details": "All of this constant medication is unaffordable, particularly if we become so ill that we can't work. Our quality of life is greatly affected, the thick build up of mucus slowly clogs up all our internal organs and many complications such as cf related liver disease, cf related diabetes and osteoporosis frequently arise. The government funds NO research into CF at all and yet we are only asking for free prescriptions for a condition that fits ALL of the criteria for free prescriptions.",
        "background": "CF is one of the MOST COMMON, LIFE THREATENING genetic diseases in the UK that becomes PROGRESSIVELY WORSE. Daily, our lives include taking over 50 pills, nebulisers, inhalers, draining physiotherapy regimes 3x a day to clear our lungs of thick sticky mucus & frequent hospitalised stays for IV's.",
