I then entered the roundabout to make a right turn, after being fully established on the roundabout a driver from my right who was not looking entered after me, he was speeding and did not go around the roundabout like he was suppose to. Instead he drove straight across without looking and hit my car at about 30-35mph. My Insurers have placed blame on to me and I do not see how this can be right.",
