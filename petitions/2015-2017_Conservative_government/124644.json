        "action": "Iain Duncan Smith MP: Give sick cancer patients access to financial support",
        "additional_details": "Cancer comes with huge costs. Not just physically and emotionally, but also financially. It robs people of their ability to work, their livelihoods and their savings. While cancer is classed as a disability in some aspects of law, it isn't classed as a disability when applying for benefits. Under the current government, cancer patients are being denied access to crucial financial support. That support needs to be made more accessible - because cancer is devastating enough.",
        "background": "The benefit rules should be relaxed for cancer patients who prove they are genuinely sick, regardless of their age, employment status and financial status. ",
