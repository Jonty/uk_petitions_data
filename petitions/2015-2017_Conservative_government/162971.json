        "additional_details": "Research showed that 73% of young people voted to remain in the EU. This suggests that the majority of older people voted to leave. We think that this is unfair, as the repercussions will be felt more by 16-17 year olds as we are beginning to head out into the world of work and our lives will be shaped by the choices of older people. Furthermore, now that we do not get governed by the EU parliament, it is more important than ever that we get a government that we support, not one we get given.",
        "background": "We believe that the voting age should be lowered as 16-17 year olds live by the laws created by a government that we have not chosen. We think that this is unfair. We can pick our college subjects that decide our future. So why can't we decide who decides the future of our country?\r\n",
