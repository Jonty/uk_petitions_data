        "additional_details": "This will allow families to spend more time together, bring people in closer. This will also benefit companies that decide to work a full week, as customers will have more time to shop their services or products. Importantly, this will benefit schools and allow them to improve and achieve more, as they may have an extra day for training or planning lessons. This 3 day weekend solution will also benefit individuals as occasional rest from routine/work is essential in life.",
        "background": "Introduce the 3 day weekend! This means 4 weekdays of school/work and 3 days of free time a week. This will benefit families, schools, companies and individuals. Nowadays, everyone is busy doing their own things, and this is where we forget about what is most important to us.",
