Parents may direct, not determine, a child's choices in life. \r\n3) Anand & Scalzo, 2000\r\n4) Hammond, 1999 http://www.noharmm.org/bju.htm\r\n5) Earp, 2013 \"Female genital mutilation (FGM) and male circumcision: Should there be a separate ethical discourse?\" ",
        "background": "A girl's genitals are no more sacrosanct than those of the world's men. Fight the double standard on circumcision. Bodies are born, made as they were made to be made: there is no place in the modern world for doctor, state or faith to interfere: it is time to ban male circumcision for under 18s. \r\n",
