        "additional_details": "According to Section 2 of the Fixed Term Parliament Act a general election may be held before the end of the established period with the support of two-thirds of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nMPs therefore have the authority to dissolve parliament and should do so as soon as possible to allow the British people to debate and vote on the important issues at the heart of the coming negotiations. An early general election is also crucial to help heal national divides post-referendum and restore stability.",
        "background": "Exiting the EU represents significant constitutional change for the UK. The coming months will be crucial in determining Britain's new relationship with the EU. In these circumstances it is appropriate to seek a new mandate from the electorate to decide what form the settlement will take.",
