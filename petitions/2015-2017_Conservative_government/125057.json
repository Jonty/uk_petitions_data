So while they themselves have massive wages to live on and on top of that are allowed to claim expenses, the other 99% of the UK population is left starving and unable to live healthy. I say NO MORE. They have taken it too far, Taken too much and caused many people to suffer severly and unnecessarily. Its the 21st century and no one should have to live like animals.",
        "background": "The amount of people in the UK being forced to claim benefits and emergency food banks and Loan sharks because they have no other choice is absolutely appalling. Politicians are constantly cutting our benefits in half forcing more and more people to go hungry and without heat and water. ",
