        "action": "Make it law that all drinks containers carry a refundable deposit",
        "additional_details": "There is a discussion in Swanage in Dorset about the amount of litter dropped. most people can remember getting money back on bottles and think it was a retrograde step when deposits were abolished. \r\nIn the American state of Maine you cannot sell a drink in a container unless a deposit has been charged.  Households are given cards that can be credited when cans and bottles are inserted into the recycling machines.  This system would greatly reduce the amount of such containers that end up in landfill as people would actively collect them for the deposits. ",
        "background": "There are millions of cans and bottles discarded in Britain which need to be removed from the waste cycle. My suggestion is that it should be made a legal requirement for a deposit to be charged on all drinks containers so that people are incentivised to return all containers for recycling/ reuse.  ",
