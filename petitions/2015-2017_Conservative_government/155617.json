        "action": "Do NOT implement Article 50 to leave the EU until after a General Election.",
        "additional_details": "As with any partnership, once one party decides to leave it's usually the case that the other party wants them to do so ASAP.  However in this case the EU seem to hold all the negotiating cards and as it's in the EU interest to leave ASAP and get this moving, why should we now do so?  Let's keep them hanging on, this would of course continue uncertainty for a potentially long period, but could also destabilize the EU so as to force them to work with us rather than against us in negotiations.",
        "background": "Let's ensure we don't implement Article 50 until we are ready, after a General Election & when we have a Parliament Ratified Plan that works to protect British Interests.  This could give us a negotiation position with the EU who want us to leave but can't force us to do so.",
