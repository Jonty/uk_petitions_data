        "additional_details": " We recently conducted a year long survey which looked at the impact of gambling  on families, friends and colleagues of problem gamblers. This survey was promoted and supported by Aylesbury Church Network and Christian Vision for  Men. Analysis by professor Jim Orford from Birmingham university showed that over 90% of respondents wanted to see a 9pm watershed on televised gambling advertising.  The results of this survey can be accessed on gamserve.org.uk",
        "background": "We believe current legislation does not protect children and the vulnerable from developing a gambling addiction.\r\nWe are bombarded with adverts for bingo, in play sports betting etc. all day long. \r\nWe believe that the \"strict controls\" that are already in place do not provide adequate protection.",
