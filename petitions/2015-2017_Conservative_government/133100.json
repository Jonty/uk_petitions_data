IPSA conducted a public consultation after 2012 and decided what the salaries of MPs should be after the election.\r\n\r\nIPSA also oversees and regulates MPs\u2019 business costs and expenses.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contact IPSA with your suggestions, here\u2019s how to contact them:\r\n\r\nhttp://parliamentarystandards.org.uk/About%20Us/Pages/Contact-Us.aspx \r\n"
