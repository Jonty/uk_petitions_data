        "additional_details": "Throughout my travels I have find that very few pubs and bars as well as establishments generally have good access for disabled people. The vast majority will often have steps that a disabled person cannot overcome without some form of assistance.\r\n\r\nThus the law should be changed meaning that all pubs and bars must have step free access, in a similar manner to them being 'smoke free'. That would greatly improve the opportunities available to disabled people. ",
        "background": "As a disabled person who is a wheelchair user, I strive to live my life as closely as I can to that of an able-bodied person. However I often find when wanting to visit pubs and bars that poor access limits the opportunities available to me.\r\n\r\n    ",
