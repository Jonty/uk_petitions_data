I  looked for a legitimate UK home based job without success. I was only able to find US based work at home jobs. I want this for the UK. ",
        "background": "I want more large UK companies to provide home based job roles so the disabled/chronically ill have more opportunities available to them. Many disabled/chronically ill people hate not being able to work and want to contribute, but find it hard to find a well paid job to suit their ability. ",
