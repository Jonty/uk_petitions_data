        "additional_details": "Type 1 diabetes is a condition which is completely mis-understood, it has nothing to do with lifestyle, which is a common misconception. It complicates even the most simplest of tasks. \r\nThere has never been a campaign that educates parents and medical professionals in the symptoms of Type 1 diabetes. Once diagnosed, and with the correct treatment and support nothing is impossible. You only have to look at our Prime Minister. \r\nEducation is the key.",
        "background": "Type 1 diabetes is on the increase in the UK, the biggest increase is in children, especially those under the age of 5 years old.\r\nUnfortunately many people are unaware of the symptoms which can lead to deadly results. A delay in diagnosis can be fatal, children are dying needlessly.\r\n",
