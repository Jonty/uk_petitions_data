        "additional_details": "The last couple weeks have been intense, campaigning for both Remain and Leave, and granted this is more intense in the work place, between middle aged men and woman, but in schools and colleges through out the nation it has been a heated topic. If it has shown one thing, it is that young people are passionate about their futures and about political decisions such as this. And i firmly believe that if 16 and 17 year old's were granted the vote this time around, political participation would peak",
        "background": "For someone like me, a sixteen nearly seventeen year old, i find it infuriating that in a once in a generation referendum we were denied the vote, a vote which would dictate our future, could make or break us. So i propose, for one time, we are given the chance to democratically voice our opinions.",
