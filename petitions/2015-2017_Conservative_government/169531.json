        "additional_details": "People like this are free to get more animals and abuse them too and this has to be addressed. The law also needs to change how it disregards cats being hit by cars etc and they dont have to declare this! Make it the law so anyone who runs a cat over MUST take it to a local vet. We microchip our pets incase they go missing or worse, but whats the point if noone bothers to have them checked? My cat was a hit and run and microchipped. He was dumped in a bin ",
        "background": "Animal abuse has been on the rise for years, but recently it came to my attention of a little kitten who was beaten then strangled to death, the neighbours heard everything and their was proof of what happened but the rspca and police closed the case after speaking to the suspects.",
