        "additional_details": "Following the referendum to leave the EU, a new relationship needs to be agreed with our European partners and with the wider world. The form this takes is the most important decision in 50 years and the people need to decide this. The current government cannot fairly invoke article 50 when they were opposed to leaving the EU.  A conservative government may be able to do this but first they must give a new manifesto which gives a clear direction of what they want to achieve.  ",
        "background": "A clear vision for the UK relationship with the EU needs to be proposed to the people.  The current government has no manifesto on this. The best and fairest option is to call a new election so the people can be given options of what the government will try to achieve. ",
