        "additional_details": "Closing Glenfield and Royal Brompton will have massive detrimental affects not just on the families who already attend there and will have to go elsewhere, but also the thousands of families at the cardiac units expected to cope with the influx from the closures. Those centres are already under massive strain and sadly more lives WILL be lost due to that strain and the additional burden of having to transfer critically ill children across the country.",
        "background": "Several years ago, Glenfield & Brompton were threatened with closure over the Safe & Sustainable Review, a review found to be flawed. Today's announcement of the closure of children's cardiac services there is an attempt to implement that review REGARDLESS. ",
