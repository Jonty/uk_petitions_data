        "additional_details": "Once I was driving home travelling at 40mph in a 40 zone, and a taxi overtook me and came really close to hitting my car. The taxi driver was dropping off a customer on my road, and I confronted the taxi driver and asked why he was driving so close to my car and he said \"because you were driving too slow\". I told him that I had a black box and he said he understood, but then proceeded to tell me that in future I should let other people know that I have a black box by \"using my hazard lights\".",
        "background": "As a young driver, I myself have a black box and am personally limited to the speed I can travel at.Taxi drivers have the privilege to be able to drive in bus lanes and I am always seeing them driving past the speed limit. This is dangerous for everyone and increases the likelihood of an accident",
