        "action": "Call an independent investigation on impacts of EU referendum misrepresentations",
        "additional_details": "As the referendum was only advisory, narrowly decided, and the result was reached by a vote made by individuals who may have been misinformed, a review of the impacts should be considered before the parliamentary decision to trigger article 50 is made. For example, how many voters would have voted differently if they knew then what they know now, not only regarding what the campaigners said, but also with hindsight in terms of impacts which are only now coming to light.",
        "background": "Many facts were stated and promises made during the referendum campaign which may at best be misleading and at worst untrue. Other consequences were not made clear. The impact of any misinformation should be investigated by an independent body before a parliamentary vote on article 50 takes place.",
