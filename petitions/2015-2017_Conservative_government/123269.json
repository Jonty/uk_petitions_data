        "additional_details": "They are attempting to spread the current NHS workforce across 7 days and so weaken the service provided from Monday - Friday. The imposition of the contract on the junior doctors is simply a way of saving money. The government is going after all those who work in the NHS and morale has never been so low. The governments 7 day NHS plan is completely flawed as it provides no real additional staffing and an independent public inquiry would prove they do not have a workable and safe plan. ",
        "background": "The enforcement of the junior doctors contract shows how little respect the government has for the staff and patients of the NHS. The 7 day NHS plan from the conservative government has inadequate planning / resources and is based on the mis-representation of the weekend mortality statistics. ",
