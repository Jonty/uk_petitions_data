        "additional_details": "There has been a lack of Tier 2 social housing. This research emerged during a project I was undertaking in York - after further research, I believe that this lack of housing in Tier 2 is not confined to York. Indeed, lack of social housing is merely reflective of the national problem of a lack of affordable housing for all. According to Shelter England, nearly 41,000 households with dependent children were living in temporary accommodation at the end of December 2012. This was before even the worst of austerity. Waiting lists for social housing are long and the vulnerable need affordable housing now!",
        "background": "Homelessness affects towns and cities up and down the UK. Although we need more affordable housing options generally, Tier 2 (shared housing with support) is needed, in particular, so that the homeless can progress forwards from emergency help in Tier 1, and from Tier 2 begin to restore their lives.",
