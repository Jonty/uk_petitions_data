        "action": "End the Special Relationship with America.",
        "additional_details": "Any trade deals with the US should be reexamined. \r\nWe condemn the racist, misogynistic, bigoted comments made by Mr Trump, and extend our sympathies to the American people. We urge calmness in reaction to this most troubling event on the world stage.\r\nWe plead with all nations denigrated by Mr Trump to avoid a military response for the benefit of the peoples of planet earth. \r\nMr Trump has not behaved in a statesmanlike manner, accordingly, the global community must do so on his behalf.",
        "background": "Following the election of Mr Trump it is no longer appropriate for the UK to be associated with America in a Special Relationship. The US should remove all American bases from the UK, and cease to hold sovereignty over military assets based in the UK including Trident and any Trident replacement. ",
