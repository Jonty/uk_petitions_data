If you think that there should be a legal limit on the amount of alcohol JSA claimants can consume before attending a JobCentre appointment (a bit like the legal blood-alcohol limit for driving), you could start a petition about this. As currently drafted, your petition doesn't call for sufficiently clear and specific action by the Government."
