        "additional_details": "There are increasing incidents of content needing to be removed post broadcast, often well after any damage has been caused. In addition, increasing examples of \"fake news/facts\" are now also being seen, some with significant implications. Online media owners created the tools being used to disseminate this content and benefit from the revenues such broadcast generates. As such, they must become legally responsible for whatever they publish.",
        "background": "Online content providers such as Youtube and Facebook provide a channel to publish content in the UK. However, unlike more traditional media outlets, including television and radio stations and the traditional printed press, there is an almost total lack of editorial oversight.\r\n",
