        "additional_details": "It is manipulative and discriminatory as well as undemocratic to deny Scots, born in Scotland along with their families their right to vote on the future of their country purely on the basis of where they may currently reside. Thousands of Scots who have been working and therefor reside in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were denied their birthright in the last referendum and this is simply unacceptable.",
        "background": "In the event another referendum is called on Scottish independence, all Scots born in Scotland and their families resident elsewhere in the UK must have the right to vote on the future of their country.",
