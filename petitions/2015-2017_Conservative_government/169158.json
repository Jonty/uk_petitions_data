        "action": "Stop phone or utility companies increasing prices during fixed-length contracts.",
        "additional_details": "Customers can leave fixed-term contracts without penalty if prices rise, but it's time consuming and stressful. It makes it harder for people to manage their household budgets and plan spending effectively. Virgin Media (as one example) have raised prices 3 times in the last year [http://www.mirror.co.uk/money/virgin-media-customers-face-another-8662724]. Companies shouldn't be allowed to use lower prices as a bait-and-switch tactic while enforcing fixed-term contracts.",
        "background": "Many phone and utility companies require customers to have contracts of fixed duration (e.g., 12 or 18 months) on promise of better value prices. The price on signing up should be honoured and NOT subject to increase during the time of the contract.",
