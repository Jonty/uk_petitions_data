I am now 22 and I see that I am still being discriminated against due to my age. What happened to equality, fairness and justice? ",
        "background": "A person aged 21 and a person aged 25 still has to pay the same bills, the same rent and the same council tax. Although, in April 2016 NMW will rise only for over 25's to \u00a37.20 per hour. I don't do any less work than a 25 year old but I am not entitled to a \"living wage\". Why?",
