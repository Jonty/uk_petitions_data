Police would of taken this seriously if it had been an illegal classed drug given by an adult to a child. Why not with with legal highs? Which could infact do the same damage as illegal drugs if not worse! They can kill.\r\nToo many people are dying from legal highs. \r\nDoctors struggle to help as new ones come on the market quickly which delays the help the person/child receives.",
