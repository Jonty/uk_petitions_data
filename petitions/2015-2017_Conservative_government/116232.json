        "additional_details": "Manston\u2019s runway is 2,752m, long enough and wide enough to accommodate any commercial aircraft type.\r\nManston was regularly used for flight testing and crew training (e.g. British Airway\u2019s A380 and the 787 Dreamliner).\r\nThe area surrounding the airport is home to a developing cluster of aviation-related businesses. There are significant areas of land around the airport identified for development within Manston Airport\u2019s masterplan \u2013 which can offer direct air-side access if required. ",
        "background": "Manston Airport is being left to deteriorate when it really could be considered as a credible London third runway alternative. Manston\u2019s runway is 2,752m, long enough enough to accommodate any commercial aircraft. With development of High Speed rail, travel times to London could be less than an hour",
