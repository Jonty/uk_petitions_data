Guidelines recommend that prior to offering bariatric surgery (Tier 4) the NHS should provide help through dedicated centres staffed by experts in weight loss, exercise, and talking therapies, to help obese patients lose weight (Tier 3). This petition calls for more Tier 3 centres so all obese patients are able to access Tier 3 as a right. ",
