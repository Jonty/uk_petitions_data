        "additional_details": "The Fixed-term Parliaments Act allows for a general election should 2/3rds of MPs vote to dissolve Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe decisions the next Prime Minister takes will go well beyond a 5 year term of Parliament.\r\n\r\nUnder those circumstances it is democratically unacceptable for that Prime Minister to be elected by Conservative Party members only.\r\n\r\nMPs must put the UK before themselves and give us the opportunity to shape the Parliament that will represent us through these momentous changes.",
        "background": "Given David Cameron's pending resignation a new PM must have a full, democratic mandate from all the UK before enacting article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which last year's general election were held have changed beyond recognition. Parliament must now reflect these changes.",
