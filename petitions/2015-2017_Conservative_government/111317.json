        "additional_details": "There has been a significant loss in confidence from Bangladeshi Nationals in the British High Commission who feel that this is a fundamental injustice. The relocation has been made without any consultation which has also caused distress for Bangladeshi Nationals. In a country where poverty is rife, this is an unfair judgement which hinders Bangladeshi Nationals chances of visiting the UK. \r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to take this matter to the UK Government. \r\n",
