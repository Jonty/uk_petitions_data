        "additional_details": "Halal slaughter is banned in Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Denmark, and Sweden. As a civilised country surely we should do the same, after all Britain is known as a nation of animal lovers and this does not go down well.",
        "background": "The UK has high standards of animal welfare and so it is unacceptable that animals are allowed to be slaughtered in a cruel, inhumane way (throats slit without being stunned and left to slowly bleed to death) in the name of religion. Animal welfare should take priority over any religious beliefs. ",
