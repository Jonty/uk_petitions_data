        "action": "Parliament to debate the outcome of the EU referendum and have a free vote.",
        "additional_details": "The majority of the electorate have not voted to leave.  The Government is not obliged to enact the outcome of the referendum.  It is already clear that a decision to leave would be extremely damaging to the UK, to Europe and to the World.  It is unnecessary and irresponsible for the Government to enact a decision to leave without subjecting that decision to Parliamentary scrutiny.  This petition is intended to request that this scrutiny occurs and that due legislative process is followed.",
        "background": "The EU referendum is an advisory referendum.  It is not legally binding and the Government is not obliged to enact the outcome.  Only 37% of the electorate voted to leave (35% voted to stay and 28% abstained). The Houses of Commons and Lords should provide oversight of the decision.",
