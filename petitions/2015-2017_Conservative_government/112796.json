        "additional_details": "No officer should be compelled to carry firearms however there is a wealth of existing ex military and hobbiest firearms experience that is untapped and not used. \r\nThese officers could be quickly and cheaply refreshed and using firearms safely to protect the public in a few short hours per month. This need be no different to the firearms training given to the reserve forces, or the use by PSNI.\r\nA Glock 9mm pistol is far cheaper and more useful than the current issue TASER.",
        "background": "British Police should be given the choice to carry firearms for self defence, the defence of others, and the containment of any active shooter incidents.\r\nSpecialist firearms teams numbers are falling due to budget cuts and response times are rising. This will be 30mins or more outside major cities.",
