        "additional_details": "British citizens are currently EU citizens and millions of us voted to remain in the EU in the recent referendum. Some of us have the right to take up a dual nationality with an EU country but most of us do not have that option. It is unreasonable that millions of us who value our Europen citizenship alongside our UK citizenship should have that part of our identity taken from us against our will. We therefore petition Parliament to require the Government to make this a high priority when negotiating the terms of the UK's exit from the EU.",
