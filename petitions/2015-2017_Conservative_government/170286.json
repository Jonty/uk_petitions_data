        "action": "Eliminate residency requirements when determining a British Citizens fee status",
        "additional_details": "With the current fee status terms, many British citizens are classified as international students when returning to their home. Not only are international fees extortionate, this means that a citizen is treated no differently than a foreigner when they are in their own country. These fees may even impede a citizen from returning home. In order to end this discrimination, fee status should be based upon citizenship; a Briton should be considered a Briton, regardless of where s/he has lived.",
        "background": "As a British citizen, one can expect fair and just treatment in their country; one should not be treated any differently than fellow Britons. Currently, a citizen must live in the UK for the 3 year before starting a university course, which discriminates against citizens who live abroad.  ",
