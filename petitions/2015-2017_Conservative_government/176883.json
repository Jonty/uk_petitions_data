        "additional_details": "In todays society many employers require their employees to provide random urine samples for drug testing as part of their code of conduct and to promote a safe working environment.  Most government agencies including the MOD and public services, to state a few, mandate that samples must be provided on request, with severe consequences for any refusal to provide a sample or for providing a positive specimen. \r\n\r\nA Zero tolerance policy should apply to both employed and non-employed people. \r\n",
