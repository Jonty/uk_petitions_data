        "additional_details": "Seth, was 7 years old. Against my clearly expressed & known wishes his organs were not donated.The knowledge that a child's organs are particularly precious & his organs could ensure other lives were saved or made easier was a comfort to me. This meant the failure to donate them, especially following my urging them to let me deal with the paperwork ensuring everything was in place, & them insisting I need not yet, left me further devastated in my grief.  Save\r\nlives, ease grief with life.",
        "background": "I urge the government to recognise that when people are against organ donation they will speak out. Knowing my son's organs could ensure other lives were saved was comforting. Research shows donation eases grief & I was devastated with the failure too. Save more lives, ease grief with life.",
