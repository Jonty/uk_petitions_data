        "background": "Current KS1/KS2 SATS criteria state that a child who does not write in the approved way can only be assessed as \u2018working towards\u2019 or \u2018working at expected\u2019 standards; they cannot be 'working at greater depth\u2019. This discriminates against children with special needs who are unable to write 'joined up'.",
