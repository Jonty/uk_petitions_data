        "additional_details": "The investment in Defence would be more justified if personnel resource shared with Justice Dept. Indeed with the focus now on Territorial Reserves - their could be combined roles of Prison officer and Reserves. Another resourcing model - could be to have all Armed Forces personnel (all levels) spend say three months a year deployed in HM Prisons. Not all prison staff need to be resourced this way; it may be ideal to have some civilian some armed forces for two-way benchmark/ skill transfer.  ",
        "background": "Prisons need to be better managed and discipline restored. \r\nArmed Forces personnel are better equipped to deal with this matter. \r\nThey would be solid role models to inmates. They would introduce respect for others and self-respect. The ethos and rigour of Armed Forces is best fit for this purpose.",
