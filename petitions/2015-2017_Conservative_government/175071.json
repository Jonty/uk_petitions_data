        "additional_details": "Southern Rail's prolonged disruption from strikes, cancellations and delays have resulted in season ticket holders receiving blanket refunds.  This is good and goes someway in recognising the impact this has on commuters lives.  Affected Oyster users should receive automatic refunds too.",

Given the scale and scope of disruption this is unrealistic and unnecessarily time consuming when TFL hold sufficient information to apply refunds automatically.  Season ticket holders received refunds, Oyster users should too.",
