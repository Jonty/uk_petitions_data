        "additional_details": "Blue Badges, which allow people with certain disabilities to park closer to services, are only available to those with a physical disability. Those suffering from the above conditions are not able to apply for a badge unless they receive the higher rate of the mobility component of DLA.\r\nThe exception is if a person is unable to follow a familiar route without aid.\r\nMental health conditions can affect mobility and be extremely disabling, preventing a full life. Blue Badges could help with this.",
        "background": "Under current regulations mental health conditions such as agoraphobia, anxiety and panic disorder are not accepted as valid reasons for needing a Blue Badge.\r\nThese conditions can be equally and sometimes more debilitating than a physical disability and it is discriminatory to exclude them.",
