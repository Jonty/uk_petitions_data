Afterall, Work Placement, where available as an option on a degree course, is assessed by Higher Education Institutions, and a work placement in the industry is often time, offered to only bright students. No doubt, Work Placement contributes to human capital development and, enhances academic performance too; the Home office should not discourage it by imposing pointless rules.",
