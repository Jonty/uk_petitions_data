        "additional_details": "The humanitarian crisis we are facing should not be left only to those councils most willing, as it creates an unnecessarily large strain on some councils that should be shared. \r\n\r\nAt least 38 councils have not signed up to the scheme which includes the rehoming of refugee children who entered the UK alone. \r\n\r\nThe current voluntary system is unfair, and means that schools, healthcare resources and other public services in participating councils are needlessly overstretched. ",
