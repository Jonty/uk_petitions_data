        "action": "Bring back the death sentence for proven murder and rape cases",
        "additional_details": "The government needs to think how much money they spend on keeping evil monsters alive, the number will be high! The supporters of this petition believe that people who are convicted of rape and murder to be able to receive death sentences from the court. If justice is served, the number of cases of such crimes may even go down. However, of course 100% evidence must be given before handing out such a sentence.",
        "background": "A lot of people are convicted of murder and rape in the UK, and we are suppose to bring justice to those people, but instead they are imprisoned (and usually even get out eventually!) and tax payers and the government pay for their food, drinks, shelter. We shouldn't waste money on keeping them here",
