Usually in a way and at such a time so as to have the maximum impact. This is not \"politics\". It is crime. A despicable misuse of power affecting every aspect of every citizens life. It's time to make politicians accountable as in every other profession. ",
        "background": "Whether this is speaking in the House or across any media, it must be made absolutely clear that the MP is either expressing an opinion or reporting facts. This is especially important during events such as televised debates or TV programs such as Question Time. \r\n",
