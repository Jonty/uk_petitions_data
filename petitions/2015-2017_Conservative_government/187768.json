        "additional_details": "Courier &/or food delivery firms are growing in numbers year on year in a big way. There is an ever growing demand for riders &/or drivers. Riders &/or drivers can be paid employees or self employed subcontractors. Many, if not all riders &/or drivers are not currently allowed to have a daily lunch break. Both types of drivers &/or riders deserve the same right to have 1hrs lunch break for their own safety & for the restoration of concentration for the prevention of accidents.",
        "background": "Motorcycle, van, & bicycle couriers are all often working very long hours with no daily lunch breaks at a set time. Although the work is not technically challenging, it still requires high levels of concentration & physical effort. 1hr lunch breaks will restore concentration & prevent accidents. ",
