        "additional_details": "I posted an enquiry if a register like this existed, and found one did but only for Domestic Violence (Clare's Law). However, this doesn't help those mothers (generally) who deal with their co-creators choice to not participate. A register is needed because it's a highly common issue, often seeing the same (mostly) men 're-offend' and go on to ruin even more young minds of growing children. This perpetual cycle often repeated could easily be stopped with a register. Divorce is common, so is this",
        "background": " I feel this register is much needed and highly overdue. Fathers who have children and then, (when it doesn't work with their co-creators) decide to penalise their own children by not regularly visiting, contributing or communicating. This Leaves the mother to counsell their young 'damaged' kids.. ",
