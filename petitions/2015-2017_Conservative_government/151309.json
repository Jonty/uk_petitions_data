Our country is being held to ransom as a result.  We cannot let this stand, and call for the result to be declared null and void, based as it was on lies and propaganda.",
        "background": "People voted to leave the EU on the basis of promises already broken, such as \"\u00a3350m for the NHS\" & \"reduction of immigration to the UK.\"  Promises were made by campaign leaders knowing they were not the whole truth, but would strongly influence British voters unable to research facts themselves.",
