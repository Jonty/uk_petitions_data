        "action": "Place in statute law that NHS will never be sold off to any company.",
        "additional_details": "The purpose if this proposal is to protect the NHS and its direct care staff by making it illegal to sell it off to any company or organisation. In all cases these organisations exist to make a profit and taking money from such a vital service under the banner of improving it is not required or wanted by the electorate. I ask the house to end speculation and accusation by passing the proposed law.",
        "background": "For too long the question of NHS privatisation has been considered by consecutive governments. It is clear that this organisation is wanted by the population as it stands managed directly under government rather than handed over to private corperations looking to make profit. End this by passing law",
