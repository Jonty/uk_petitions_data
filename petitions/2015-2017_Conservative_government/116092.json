        "action": "Reinstate river dredging to help reduce the effects of excessive rain fall.",
        "additional_details": "Simple hydrological theory states that if a watercourse's volume is reduced by inserting a mass then its permissable volume of said channel is reduced by the same. Ceasing to dredge the waterways as they aren't required for commercial navigation has resulted in silting up of our rivers.  Eg; The Ouse in York, once a 6m deep river, now is 3m deep at its deepest - the rest is Silt.\r\nDredging is time consuming & expensive but very necessary to reduce the impact of increasingly excessive rainfall.",
        "background": "Over the last 10 years we have seen a dramatic increase in the amount of flooding, both coastal and inland from excessive precipitation. This is in direct corrolation with Global warning, but also a consequence of reducing the volume of the UK's riverways by ceasing all but targetted dredging.\r\n",
