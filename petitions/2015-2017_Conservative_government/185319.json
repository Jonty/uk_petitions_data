I received a letter in April 1978, and opted to pay a full stamp yet now I have to work till I am at least 67!! Increased Pension ages was brought in over many years by all parties (no one party stopped this happening) and no one protested so they think we are happy about it - let the government know we aren't HAPPY...!",
        "background": "Heard they are thinking of reducing pension payments, because the elderly have saved all their lives, worked hard, paid their taxes, paid off their mortgages and apparently they are better off than some of the low paid workers in the UK \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7..the younger generation take note how we've been duped!!",
