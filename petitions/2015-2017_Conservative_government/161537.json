        "additional_details": "ID cards are used in many other countries. and should be thought of as a positive way forward in this changing world.\r\nFor example; they can help to identify victims caught up in a terrorist attack. They could be used to identify people that have a legal right to the NHS, housing and benefits. They can also be used to help police identify those persons present near a crime scene area; like a mugging or a rape. Our information is already on a system somewhere, ID cards are a link to a safer world.",
        "background": "Security, safety and entitlement are just three of the benefits we would gain by the introduction of ID cards for all UK Citizens. And if we aim to make the UK a leader rather than a follower then this would be a progressive move forward for us all.  ",
