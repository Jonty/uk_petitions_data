        "additional_details": "Numerous women have recently been prosecuted for having pregnancy terminations or helping others to do so, including a mother who is currently awaiting trial for helping her 15 year old daughter access abortion pills. Doctors are also at risk of prosecution, meaning that patient confidentiality is void with regards to abortion and miscarriage. Human rights is not an area devolved to Northern Ireland. We in England can address the subject and support a law reform in Northern Ireland.",
        "background": "Even though Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, pregnancy termination remains illegal in the country in almost every circumstance, including rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality. Anyone involved in an unlawful abortion can be sentenced to up to life imprisonment, including doctors.",
