        "additional_details": "Trump signed the order with little prior warning, and citizens already committed to travel plans - some actually in the air at the time - found themselves stranded or detained.\r\n\r\nThis order is racist, knee-jerk, (probably) illegal, divisive, irresponsible and anti-democratic. The UK cannot be associated with Trump's policy.",
        "background": "President Trump signed an executive order banning citizens from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, and Libya for 90 days, and indefinitely suspends admission of Syrian refugees. The ban also applies to British citizens born in those countries. This includes Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi and his wife.",
