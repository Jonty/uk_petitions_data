        "additional_details": "16,000 young people miss school everyday in fear of being bullied. Young people run away from home to hide from bullies, and some even turn to suicide, self-harm or suffer other mental health difficulties. Schools and police forces across the country deal with the effects of bullying every day, yet the cause is often not treated seriously, effectively or at all. Meaning that the victim still faces the ordeal day in day out. The government should introduce a framework to deal with this epidemic. ",
        "background": "Bullying effects young people in both primary, secondary and higher education. However the police, schools and local authorities are ill-equipped to deal with the victims and their perpetrators. There is little national guidance on how to deal with this epidemic; legally, effectively and safely.",
