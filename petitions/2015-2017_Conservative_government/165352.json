        "additional_details": "The UK has been the second largest contributor to the air campaign in Iraq. In November 2015 the government suggested that the UK had carried out 8% of coalition air strikes in Iraq. \r\n\r\nOn 7 July 2016 the MOD confirmed that the UK had conducted more than 2,800 missions, including 915 airstrikes against ISIS targets in both Iraq and more recently Syria (865 and 50 strikes respectively). It went on to state that \u201cthe RAF has not operated at this sustained operational tempo in a single theatre of conflict for a quarter of a century\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe Government has consistently maintained that no civilian casualties in Iraq or Syria, to date, have resulted from UK air strikes. This is no longer accurate and thus the policy on offensive action needs to be revisited. ",
