        "additional_details": "Nigel Farage, the People\u2019s Politician, can be credited with at least having played a large part in causing UK voters to be given their say on EU membership and the resulting Brexit.  A former commodity broker, he was a co-founder of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) which he now leads, and has been a SE England MEP since 1999. He has reintroduced UK political debate being based on facts rather than soundbites and was named \u201cBriton of the Year\u201d by The Times in 2014.",
        "background": "Recommend Nigel Farage to her Majesty the Queen for a knighthood for having worked tirelessly and selflessly to restore democracy to the British people. The most articulate of UK politicians he has the required temerity, business background, and unrivaled experience of the EU to negotiate Brexit.",
