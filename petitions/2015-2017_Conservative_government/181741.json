        "additional_details": "When the future of this country is being discussed, when welfare cuts that destroy lives and families are being discussed, it is disgusting to see jokes being made and heartily laughed at. General disorder slows the processes of power and disrupts the scrutiny of government. An immediate review and reform of the guidelines of MPs parliamentary behavior should be enacted. Those who cannot behave in a way befitting the seriousness of political discourse should be disciplined. ",
        "background": "Many citizens of this country are  appalled by the jeering, cheering, and most unacceptably, laughter that characterizes PMQs and every other debate that takes place in the chamber at The House of Commons. This childish behavior demonstrates a general disinterest in engaging in robust debate. ",
