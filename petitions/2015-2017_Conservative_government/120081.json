        "additional_details": "After the first year of cuts, by admission of it's own councillors, the IW Council will go bust. We will have no services, our most vunerable people will go without help. If our Government can give 60m to a Garden Bridge project from the public purse, and we can allow multi-national companies to get away with relatively tiny tax bills then why are local authorities being forced to destroy the communities that they are there to provide for? This is appalling and needs review!",
        "background": "This year the government are forcing our local authority to save 17 million pounds, next year it has to save another 9 million pounds. Even if they cut every 'discretionary' service the IOW council will not be able to meet the statutory services that they are required by law to provide.",
