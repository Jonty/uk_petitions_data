        "action": "Build a modern, functional, UK Parliament on Salford Quays, Greater Manchester",
        "additional_details": "This is an opportunity to have a 21st Century purpose built Parliament as they have in Scotland and Wales. Land is available by the Manchester Ship Canal and Government offices could be built on the Industrial Estate in Trafford Park. The cost could be covered by selling Government offices in Whitehall. There is an excellent local source of unskilled labour for the project when under construction and in use. Local leisure facilities are excellent with many hotels, restaurants and bars near by. ",
        "background": "The Government is proposing to spend \u00a37bn refurbishing a crumbling, antiquated Parliament in central London which is difficult to get to from the rest of the UK. Salford is in the geographical centre of the UK, less than one mile from the UK Motorway system and with excellent public transport links.",
