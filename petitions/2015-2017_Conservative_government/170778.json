        "additional_details": "In the UK, 1.9 million young people aged 16 and 17 are denied the right to vote for their government. \r\n\r\nThe general consensus in Britain is that young people are underrepresented; this is solely because MPs and Councillors do not require our vote in order to achieve power. \r\n\r\n The age should be lowered to 16 is because that is the age of which we are then subjected to Government decisions more than ever. Until we can be represented and choose who represents us, we are not part of a democracy. ",
        "background": "Those aged 16+ have an increasing political awareness, they can join the armed forces, pay tax/national insurance, choose their education after school, drive a vehicle, attend state - ran schools/colleges, consent to sexual intercourse or decide their home but cannot vote for their government.",
