        "additional_details": "When pressure becomes too much for a balloon it will pop, and the foil balloon will land in the ocean- a innocent sea creature will eat it and die.\r\nHelium is a limited resource and is needed for MRI scanners to work. Helium is the only element out of all 118 in the periodic table that can cool the electromagnets to the right temperature for the scanner to work. One day helium may save your life.",
        "background": "I am always seeing helium balloons. Helium is a limited resource so should not be used for balloons, especially as helium can be used for important MRI scanners. This gas is lighter than air and will never be seen again if it floats away. So please support me in my hope to ban helium balloons.",
