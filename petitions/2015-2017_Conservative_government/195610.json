        "additional_details": "Political debates are educational. Debates provide candidates with the opportunity to inform the electorate, summarise major policy positions and provide opponents with the chance to critique/challenge the Prime Minister and other candidate's policy positions.  \r\nTV debates have become one of the most influential factors in British political campaigns, according to a Panelbase survey 38% of people were influenced by the TV debates, 23% by TV news coverage and 10% by party political broadcasts.",
        "background": "Theresa May's aides have insisted that she will not take part in TV election debates for the upcoming 'Snap election', which she has called. Live debates will force candidates to engage with issues considered central to the diverse needs and wants of the electorate. ",
