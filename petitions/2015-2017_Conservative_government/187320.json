        "additional_details": "It would appear Mr Miah has been the victim of racial profiling and has been given no reason for the denial of his entry to the United States of America. He was not allowed to board a plane in Iceland (bound for the USA) and given no explanation. \r\n\r\nHe was travelling to the USA on a school trip as a teacher. \r\n\r\nThere has been no response or reason for his treatment given by US officials or the embassy. This is unacceptable.",

We petition Boris Johnson to summon the ambassador of the USA to the Foreign & commonwealth office to explain the reasons for Mr Miah's refusal of entry to the USA and to offer an official apology.
