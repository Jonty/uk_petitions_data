        "action": "Introduce random drug testing of MP's in Parliament.",
        "additional_details": "It has recently been noted certain key MP's and/or ministers appear to have symptoms of drug usage. A pale skin complexion, dilated pupils and a seeming lack of concentration are all known symptoms of drug usage and so it makes logical sense to introduce random drug testing in order to expose MP's who are abusing (illegal) substances and are not holding their important position in the regard which is needed.",
        "background": "This is a petition to encourage Parliament to introduce random drug testing of MP's. Decisions in Parliament have real-life impacts on ordinary people's work, pay and general livelihoods, and it makes logical sense that MP's be in a fit state of mind in order to debate and make clear decisions.",
