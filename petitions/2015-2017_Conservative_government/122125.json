        "additional_details": "I sought support from BT retail. Despite claiming to be separate from Openreach their language in their communications suggested to me that they were acting as one business.  When I politely challenged the decision, BT retail became aggressive on the phone. Other houses on the estate have been connected to fibre. There's no recourse for customers. Openreach has now said my house will be in the 5% not to achieve 10mbps by 2020. No customer focused business would do this.",
        "background": "Openreach recently connected my new house to a cabinet they say is not commercially viable to convert to fibre. This cabinet only guarantees 6mbps. The local exchange is converted to fibre. Another cabinet they could connect me to is fibre enabled.  ",
