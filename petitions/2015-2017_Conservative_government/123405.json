        "additional_details": "Pursuing law career is very expensive and affects poor people more. Law training contract serves no purpose other than as a barrier to stop the poor entering the legal profession. Many countries including the USA do not have training contracts. Getting a training contract is near impossible for working class people. The rich and the privileged normally secure training contracts in the family or friend's law firms.  Abolish law training contracts and improve social mobility for a fairer Britain ",
        "background": "Law training contracts prevent many poor people from pursuing career in law. Anyone passing the legal practice course has the same academic qualification as any supreme court judge. It is unfair that the difference in becoming supreme court judge or minicab driver is in securing a training contract ",
