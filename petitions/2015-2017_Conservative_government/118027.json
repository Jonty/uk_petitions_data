No petition should be rejected due to personal opinion.\r\n\r\nCheating: (eg. \"Ban Donald Trump\" had duplicate signatures, none were deleted but the opposing petition \"Don't Ban Trump\" had 10s of 1000s of signatures deleted. CHEATING! \r\n\r\nToo many petitions not being debated (eg. Vote of no confidence in D. Camoron).  \r\n\r\nNothing positive accomplished by any petition.  ",
