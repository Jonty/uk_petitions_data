Yet between them hold 10/650 seats (aprox 1.5% of total seats in parliament). \r\n\r\nOn the other hand the main two parties received ~2/3 of the votes for a 85% share of the seats.\r\n\r\nRegardless of your ideological views, you must agree that this parliament is non representative of the electorate in this country and allows the Labour Party and The Conservatives to govern in unchallenged majority governments.\r\n\r\n ",

Regardless of your party preference it is plain to see that this is undemocratic in what is now a multi party country. FPTP only acts to preserve the status quo for two main parties",
