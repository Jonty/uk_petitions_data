        "action": "Make Government time immediately available to repeal Expats 15 year voting limit",
        "additional_details": "The Rt Hon David Cameron recently stated that there was an intention to repeal this limit but no time was available before the Referendum. Since the \"Leave\" vote will compel a new programme of legislation when Parliament returns after Recess an opportunity exists to progress this. A Bill was introduced by Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP in 2014 but failed for lack of time despite strong Conservative support. This should be immediately reintroduced in Government time not by a Private Member",
        "background": "In the recent Referendum vote, many British subjects were prevented from voting on a matter which could potentially affect their lives because they have lived and worked abroad for more than 15 years. Government time is needed in Parliament immediately to enable a promise by David Cameron to be kept",
