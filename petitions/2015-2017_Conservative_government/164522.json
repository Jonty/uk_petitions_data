        "action": "Repeal the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, used by the BBC to snoop",
        "additional_details": "The BBC has a charter to serve the public, and not its own elite. That BBC elite has used its monopoly position to influence the public in every election and has abandoned the original ethos of neutrality in providing information and news. If the public resent this then they should be able to vote with their wallets and the BBC should not be able to use the power of the state to oppress them fom exercising the free will that Englishmen thought was their birthright.",
        "background": "The BBC uses the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, passed by Tony Blair, to snoop on the public to maintain its enormous income and preserve its privileged position to control opinion in the UK, and prevent the public protesting in the only way it can against its biased reporting.
