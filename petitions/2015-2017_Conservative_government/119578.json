        "additional_details": "Many retailers offer consumers unconditional returns within a period of time including on sale items. Some retailers like Gerard Darel, however, don't offer refunds in any case. \r\n\r\nConsumers drive the economy and we desire a better protection from the government. The UK law should require all the retailers to offer consumers unconditional full refunds within 30 days from the purchase date on all items, as long as the item is in original condition. ",
        "background": "I got a faulty item from a fashion store but when I wanted to return the item the next day, they refused to give me a refund on the grounds that they don't do refunds. They even threatened to call the police on me. Consumers need more protection from the law to avoid bad service and unfair trade.",
