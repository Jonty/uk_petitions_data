        "additional_details": "Since the start of brexit campaign the subject of EU citizens living and working in UK has beed avoided and so far there are only questions and no answers at all. People made UK their homes, have jobs, children (who often are british citizens), bought their first houses and settled in. Now this all is one big question mark and people fear that their lives can be turned upside down within two years time.",
        "background": "I'd like Theresa May to finally give a clear statement about the post-brexit future of EU citizens who've been living and working in the UK for many years. Their future is now one big question mark and people need to know what's going to happen to them. For many UK became home and only place to live",
