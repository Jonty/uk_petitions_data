        "additional_details": "In the UK people in this position should be doing it for a privilege and not to gain money. The money must be diverted to the NHS and not government coffers as this is the only way that the people of the UK will reach agreement. This is a no brainer and will not cost the public a penny, but is only a \"Robin Hood\", a redistribution of money from the rich to poor and all that need it.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "That Peers in the House of Lords can claim a daily allowance that can amount to over a thousand pound a week when this money should be better used by the severe crisis the NHS is in at the moment, in particular the pressure put on the elderly and the growing ageing population.",
