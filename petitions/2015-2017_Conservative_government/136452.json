We ask that you consider that there is no precedent for such significant change based on such a result and refer you to the Scottish referendum of 1979 in which 51.6% of a 64% turnout voted for the Scotland Act 1978 to create a devolved assembly, this Act was repealed on the basis that the margin was too narrow.",
        "background": "This is on the basis that: 1.The result of a referendum vote is advisory, not mandatory 2.Parliamentary Supremacy means that parliament alone has \u2018the right to make or unmake any law' 3.A decision based on a referendum result alone would wrongly confer on the electorate a direct legislative power.\r\n",
