        "additional_details": "Many People including myself have fallen on hard times due to a combination of factors that are out their control such as the recession, job status and personal issues (health,family). As I have stated this is categorising people with poor credit as a risk for certain job roles. This can only have a detrimental affect on their future prospects and continue their downward spiral in life. Bad things happen to good people too. ",
        "background": "This petition is to request a change to the judgement that an applicant should be automatically exempt from a position of trust because they are considered a risk due to poor credit. If there is no correlation between credit history and criminal history then this is discriminatory practice.",
