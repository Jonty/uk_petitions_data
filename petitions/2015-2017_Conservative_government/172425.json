        "additional_details": "Whatever ills, injustices, or absurdities the US may have it has a political system that contains the potential to do good for all. Their constitution protects against anyone becoming an absolute ruler.\r\nThey created a state based on a Bill of Rights for all with a written constitution containing a set of rules to define their government, and what powers are held by whom. It includes checks and balances between its parts including convoluted presidential election processes.",
        "background": "Mr Donald Trump is not the US President. Until the following process is complete he is the president \"elect\". \r\nTo become President he still needs to be elected by the \"Electoral College\" (in mid December). Their decision has to be confirmed by the US Congress, before Inauguration in January 2017. ",
