        "additional_details": "Whether done maliciously and knowingly, or through negligence in their responsibility to research their arguments, the lack of direct personal consequences for politicians will continue to foster such unacceptable misconduct unless they are called to account\r\n\r\nFacts misused include for example, the UK's net financial contribution to the EU, the achievable reduction in future immigration numbers, likely funding for the NHS. \r\n\r\nThis enquiry must be held transparently, in public and finish this year",
        "background": "Politicians who have persistently misrepresented facts during the campaign have failed in their duty to the public and must be held to account. \r\nParliament must hold by end of 2016 an independent enquiry into such conduct, with immediate bans from office for at least 5 years of those who did this.",
