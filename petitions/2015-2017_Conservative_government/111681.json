The petition proposes failure to do this becoming a matter to be addressed by the RCVS in the hope that failing vets and Registered Veterinary Nurses take the matter more seriously. The following give more info on the eartipping process.\r\nhttp://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/112/6/129\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_9iL8q-DX0",
        "background": "Neutered ferals which aren't eartipped (removing 3-8mm of left ear via straight cut) during surgery can't be identified later as neutered & often get caught and operated on again unnecessarily - traumatic for the cat and a waste of resources for charities. Make this a professional conduct matter.",
