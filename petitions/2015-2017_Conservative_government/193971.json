I am currently in a vulnerable state and can sympathise with people in any position similar. \r\n\r\nThis is not ok and should not be tolerated as the norm because it is not. It borders on annoying and a complete disregard for a human's right to privacy and inhuman treatment.\r\n\r\nThe nature of my call will not be disclosed however it infringes on the following human rights:\r\n\r\nRespect for privacy and family life and the right to marry \r\nThe prohibition of torture and inhuman treatment.",
