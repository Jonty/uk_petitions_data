People convicted of the most serious terrorist charges or those killed during an attack should have them and/or their families deported to act as a deterrent and to show justice is being seen to be done. This will be aimed at people such as \"British born X\", the X being the nationality of their recent history I.E British born Pakistani/German/Nigerian etc. Let's cut this cancer out of our great nation. ",

We are welcoming of views that often challenge our beliefs but in recent years this has been taken for granted by a small but lethal minority. I call for the removal of their entire family to act as a deterrent to others. ",
