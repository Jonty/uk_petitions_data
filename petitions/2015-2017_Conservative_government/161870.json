        "additional_details": "I would like to see designated vaping areas in places that have designated smoking areas where vaping is not permitted in doors. I don't think its fair that vapers are being exposed to cigarette smoke. They have taken up vaping from smoking for a healthier lifestyle and to have smokers and vapers together in one area is not ideal. I would like to see vapers have same rights as smokers but treated separately.",
        "background": "People have taken on \"vaping\" to give up smoking and to have a cleaner healthier lifestyle, some pubs and places of work alow vaping in doors and welcome it where as others do not, then in most cases vapours are forced to use smoking areas exposing themselves to the chemicals and toxins ",
