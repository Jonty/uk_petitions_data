        "additional_details": "The average family spend up to \u00a3700 per year on wasted food which is thrown away due to the food item being past its \"Best Before Date\". Many consumers maybe aware of the difference however a vast number of consumers are still tuned to following the date listed on the item. Therefore we want it to be made easier with no room for confusion with the scrappage of the \"Best Before\" label.",
        "background": "The UK consumer throws away 7.2 million tonnes of food a year. One of the reasons that contributes to this is the confusion between the \"Best Before Date\", \"Use by\" and \"Expiry Date\". The \"Best Before Date\" refers to quality \u2014 Foods will be safe to eat after the best before date. ",
