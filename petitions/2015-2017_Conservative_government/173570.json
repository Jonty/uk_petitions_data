        "action": "End all government subsides and other financial aid to the fossil fuel industry.",
        "additional_details": "Direct subsides are hard to calculate \u2013  Reasonable mid-range figure is \u00a36 billion annually, given by widely trusted sources such as the Independent and the Overseas Development Institute(ODI) however the UK claims not to have any using an irrational definition. The International Monetary Fund puts the figure much higher at \u00a326b.\r\nThis petition's specific demand is that fossil fuel subsides, as defined by the ODI are to be abolished by 2020 and the extra revenue should be invested in clean energy.",
        "background": "The UK government provides the domestic fossil fuel industry with funds to the tune of \u00a36 billion annually. This industry, endangering all of us by intensifying climate change, is getting money from our government at the expense of the taxpayer. This has to stop before it is too late.",
