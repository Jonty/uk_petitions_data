        "additional_details": "The volume of unwelcome cold calls could I believe be significantly reduced and offenders penalised by the introduction of legislation requiring the following:-\r\n1. Telephone service providers to copy its \"Direct Marketing\" customers itemised telephone bills to the TPS.\r\n2. TPS to cross check all numbers called against its register.\r\n3. An appropriate \"per offence\" financial penalty to be levied.      ",
        "background": "It is clear that \"Cold Callers\" blatantly ignore telephone subscribers registration with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) and in doing so cause aggravation, stress and in some cases expense to members of the public who have opted out of receiving such calls.       ",
