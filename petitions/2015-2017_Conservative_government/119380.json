        "action": "Raise the adult fare on trains and other public transport to 18.",
        "additional_details": "Public transport is also vital for economic and social connection in young people. Young people earn far less and should be able to pay a child rate when still in education, whether that is school, sixth form, college, university or apprenticeship at least until they are 18 and ideally until 21. The 16-25 railcard cannot be used on peak journeys and therefore any 16 year old travelling to school by train is charged an adult fare!",
        "background": "A 16 year old can't vote, can't drive, is probably still at school and unlikely to have much of an income, yet they are expected to pay an adult fare on trains. This is so wrong. We need to give young people a better chance in life and affordable public transport it vital to their educational needs.",
