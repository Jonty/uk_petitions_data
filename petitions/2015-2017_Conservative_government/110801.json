        "additional_details": "It is general consensus internationally that a living wage is the minimum income necessary for a worker to meet their basic needs. The new 'National Living Wage' does not strictly meet this criteria.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to Trademark the term 'Living Wage' in the UK, which it is not, then the Living Wage Foundation could have a case for infringement, as it would be straightforward for them to demonstrate confusion among the public. They have used the term regularly, and publicly, since 2011.\r\n",
        "background": "In the 2015 budget, the chancellor announced a change to the 'National Minimum Wage' that also included rebranding to the 'National Living Wage'. This has the potential to cause confusion, as this could give the impression that the government is implementing the 'Living Wage' as defined by the CRSP.",
