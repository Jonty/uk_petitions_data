        "action": "Trigger a general election following the resignation of a Prime Minister",
        "additional_details": "There is the potential for an unelected official to lead our nation for nearly five years, depending on when in their term a Prime Minister resigns. This is unacceptable in a democratic nation and there needs to be a change to the laws surrounding this.\r\n\r\nIn the last ten years alone, Great Britain has twice faced being led by an official the people did not vote for. We ask for a law to trigger a General Election when a Prime Minister resigns, so the people can democratically choose their leader.",
        "background": "A Prime Minister's resignation triggers a leadership contest. This decides the leader of Great Britain without reference to the people. We cannot call ourselves a democratic nation if we are controlled by an unelected official. We ask to amend the Fixed Parliaments Act 2011 to account for this.\r\n",
