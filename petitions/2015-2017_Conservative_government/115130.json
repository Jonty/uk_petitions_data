        "additional_details": "I have listened to Prime Minister's Questions (PMQ's) on the radio on several occasions now.  It is bad enough that the Prime Minister refuses to actually answer the questions raised but the whole proceedings are reduced to bad theatre by those present laughing, shouting, cheering or cajoling which is an embarrassment to our Nation and disrespectful to the people looking for answers. Only the Speaker of the House, the Prime Minister and the person asking the question should ever be heard. ",

Anything else is superfluous to the event and the behaviour of those present is ridiculous given that it is broadcast worldwide on TV and radio.",
