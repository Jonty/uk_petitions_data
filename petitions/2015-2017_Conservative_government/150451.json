FPTP and the arrangement of constituencies means national minorities can end up with parliamentary majorities.

        "background": "People are not feeling listened to by Government. It would be fair and just for representation in matters of UK governance to be more directly placed in the hands of voters. Seats in parliament therefore should reflect the national number of voters supporting a party.",
