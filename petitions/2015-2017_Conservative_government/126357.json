        "additional_details": "From personal experience I can tell you that it is so difficult to move out from your parents home. To suddenly turn 18 and start paying bills, tax and rent because I have moved out is so expensive. And without the national living wage being extended to my 18 year old self I can not afford to eat as well as do these things. I do not see why because of my age number, I should not be entitled to the NLW when my circumstances have been looked into.",
        "background": "It is great that the National Living Wage has come in. However, why must you be over 25 to receive it. So many 18+ year olds have moved out: pay rent, pay bills, council tax ect and do not attend university to receive student loans. They deserve the national living wage too.",
