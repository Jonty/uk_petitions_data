It is not fair. Please increase our pay to reflect our daily hard work!!!",

We spend the best part of 18 months training for our qualification and on top of that need to do cpd as well as pay to be on the GDC register (to what benefit to us?) at \u00a3116/year as well as now having to have our own Indemnity Insurance.
