This is one example of countless organisations and companies that routinely choose thier own age limits for pricing. We need a country if not worldwide pricing structure so parents don't get ripped off \r\n",
        "background": "I believe pricing of  attractions should be fair. And having to pay adult prices to gain entry to attractions, shows, holidays. Flight's etc for anyone under 18 is wrong. When you have a young family it is becoming increasingly expensive to do anything when you have to pay full price adult children ",
