        "additional_details": "ASD/Autism is a life long condition and should automatically qualify for PIP. The assessment is nothing more than unnecessary bureaucracy that usually ends in refusal for PIP. I would also like to make the RT Hon Damian Green MP aware that the assessors that carry out these assessments do take advantage of an autistic person's disability to ensure they dont score any points in the assessment and refuse them PIP. If the RT Hon Damian Green would like more detail I am available to talk about it.",
        "background": "If you are officially diagnosed with ASD/Autism by a GP or a health care professional such as a psychologist, psychiatrist or a multidisciplinary team, then a PIP assessment to prove your illness should not be needed. It should be recognised upon application when you provide written diagnosis.",
