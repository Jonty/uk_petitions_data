        "additional_details": "In the EU Referendum, 1.5 million 16 and 17 year olds were denied a say on a crucial decision that will affect them for the rest of their lives.\r\nIn the Scottish Independence Referendum in 2014, the voting age was lowered to 16 resulting in a huge turn out, a lively debate and young people talking about politics.\r\nIn 1918, a young woman called Emmeline Pankhurst fought for and won the right for women to vote. My name is Lucy Emmeline. We shouldn't have to wait 100 years. Please sign my petition. ",

Be sent to war to defend your country, but not vote for who runs your country. Campaign as a member of a political party, but not be able to cast your vote in support of them.",
