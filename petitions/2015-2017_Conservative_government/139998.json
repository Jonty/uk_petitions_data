        "additional_details": "Both the 'Leave' and Remain' campaigns of the 2016 EU Referendum have made claims which are in some cases, deliberate misinformation. This was not prevented or regulated by an external, independent body. It is therefore, of the responsibility of the government to ensure both campaigns are investigated for unlawful distribution of misinformation in order to gain votes from a potentially uninformed electorate.",
        "background": "There is indication that misinformation was spread in the EU Referendum Campaigns that will have contributions to the loss of the rights afforded to us as EU citizens. We urge the creation of an emergency, independent investigation into the potential infringement of electoral autonomy.\r\n\r\n",
