        "additional_details": "It didn't work in Iraq or Libya so why would it work in Syria?\r\nIt is not currently working for US, Saudi Arabia, France, Russia, so why would it work if we joined in?\r\nInnocent people, real men, real women, real children, parents, siblings, sons, daughters will now die because David Cameron's blinkered vision has led him to ignore what the people he serves have asked for and he feels empowered enough that he doesn't care.\r\nIt's time he left parliament, maybe go to Syria and see what he's done.",
        "background": "Despite what David Cameron's government has voted for, it is not the desire of the constituents, David's public, that we begin air strikes in Syria.\r\nCameron has ignored repeated requests to put it to the public vote, including in the form of other petitions which have reached over 190000 votes.",
