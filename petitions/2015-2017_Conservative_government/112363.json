        "additional_details": "The 'nuclear family model' (a father, mother and their children) is no longer representative of the family dynamics within the UK.\r\nTherefore, we hope a law will be put in place to ensure siblings are entitled to contact with each other, as the law does not currently serve to protect that special, intimate bond they share. If the parent with custody decided to stop access to the other parent, the siblings suffer consequently - being unable to see each other.",
        "background": "Individuals should be entitled to contact with their siblings (including 'half-' and step-siblings) under 18, unless the courts deem that there is reasonable concern this would have a negative impact on the child's welfare.\r\nAs the law currently stands, there's no rights of access for siblings.",
