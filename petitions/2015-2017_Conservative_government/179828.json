        "background": "PM May has no mandate to force a hard Brexit on the devolved nations and will force further independence referendums after doing so. England can avoid the turmoil of Scotland and Northern Ireland (and possibly Wales) having to reapply for EU membership post-independence by simply leaving the UK.",
