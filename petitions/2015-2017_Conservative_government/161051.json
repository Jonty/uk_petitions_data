Anyone who joined after then will have to pay an extra \u00a325 to become a \"registered supporter\" - and will get a two-day window in which to do so.\"\r\n\r\nA vote which is so crucial to the working class Left in Britain should not be subject to an extortionate fee. This is a deliberate attempt to dissuade poorer voters from supporting Jeremy Corbyn.",
        "background": "We believe that the \u00a325 charge has been put in place as a barrier against those who support Jeremy Corbyn and have registered as a member of the Labour Party in the last 6 months. This price hike deliberately and obviously targets the working class supporters to dissuade them from voting for Corbyn.",
