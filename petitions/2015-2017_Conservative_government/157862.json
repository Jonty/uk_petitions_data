        "action": "Hold a public inquiry into the conduct of politicians during the EU Referendum",
        "additional_details": "The EU Referendum campaigns fractured our country, generating a level of hostility which divided families, friends, communities, and that ultimately may have indirectly resulted in the death of a respected MP. During campaigning the nation may have also been knowingly misled, and racially inflammatory tactics may have been used to generate support. A public inquiry and new electoral standards legislation is now needed so lesson can be learned, and to help restore confidence in our politicians.",
        "background": "We hereby call for a public inquiry into the conduct of politicians involved in the EU Referendum debate, investigating and recording any misleading information and inflammatory tactics, and making recommendations for new electoral standards legislation to protect the public during future elections.",
