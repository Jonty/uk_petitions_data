        "action": "Make Nutrition and Hydration training for workers in the Care Sector mandatory.",
        "additional_details": "The care certificate has a section on fluid and nutrition which can be covered in a 25 minute online course. As the impact of malnutrition and dehydration has such a detrimental effect on service users, families, the staff and costs involved (\u00a319.6 billion per year spent on malnutrition - BAPEN report 2015) the level & amount of training is insignificant in improving the skills and knowledge in terms of the provision & delivery of Nutrition and Hydration to vulnerable people in the care setting.",
        "background": "Poor provision and delivery of Nutrition and Hydration has long been a contentious issue in the Care Sector. Improving nutrition and hydration training & implementation will not only improve the health and wellbeing of service users but will also have a vast socioeconomic and environmental impact. ",
