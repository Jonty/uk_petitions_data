Egyptian authorities worked closely with the Department of Transport, British security firms Control Risks and Restrata to implement a joint action plan to upgrade security in all Egypt airports. The airport has had a radical restructure to ensure that it complies with strict new standards set by the UK government. Yet, the UK is now the only country in Europe, that hasn\u2019t lifted the ban on flights.\r\n ",
