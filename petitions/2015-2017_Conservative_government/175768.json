        "action": "Public inquiry into the death of Mogous Abay",
        "additional_details": "Since 1990 there has been no serious police investigation into the death of Mogous Abay. The circumstances leading to his death are considered to be suspicious and the handling of the case by the police highlights inconsistencies. The police assumed that Mogous had committed suicide by throwing himself from the fourth floor of his flat in London. Contrary to police reports several witnesses have signed statements insisting that Mogous had come to his death before the event of a fall.",
        "background": "We the undersigned consider the conduct and investigation in to the death of Mogous Abay as being riddled with inconsistencies and incompetence. We therefore call for a public inquiry into his death. ",
