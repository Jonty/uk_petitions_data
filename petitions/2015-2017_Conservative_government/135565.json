Complaints about political advertising should be made directly to the party responsible for that advertising.\"\r\n\r\nIn the UK, there is a longstanding ban on political advertisement on television, which is why the ASA only covers non-broadcast ads.\r\n\r\n",

Democracy requires transparency, accuracy and trust. That trust is best earned when we know that our politicians, by law, cannot lie in ads.",
