        "additional_details": "The Assad regime and its allies have broken the Cessation of Hostilities agreement just as they have flouted every UNSC resolution on Syria. Peace talks and words of condemnation are meaningless so long as Assad continues to murder populations with impunity. We call on the UK to give Assad an ultamitum to cease airstrikes. In the case of non-compliance, we call on the UK to eliminate Assad's air force through military action, and pressure Russia to halt its own attacks.",
