        "background": "UKIP MEP Nigel Farage says he is a man of the people and his stance against unelected bureaucrats and elitism is well documented. He is also a highly divisive figure who uses incitement as a means to achieve political ambition. It would therefore be inappropriate to ascend him to the House of Lords.",
