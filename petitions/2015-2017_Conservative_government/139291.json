        "additional_details": "For example, please see the final two Vote Leave leaflets delivered in the last week of campaigning. The first purported to be 'official information about the referendum on 23 June 2016' and claimed it was to 'help you make your decision' with a list of 'facts' which were not factual. On the back a map of countries set to join the EU included Syria and Iraq. Both leaflets claimed EU funds could be diverted to the NHS, a claim Nigel Farage freely admitted was false on the 24 June. ",
        "background": "Those responsible for Vote Leave's misleading campaign material filled with mistruths should be held accountable by government. Since the electoral commission does not arbitrate on this issue, deliberately misinforming the public in political campaigns should be made a criminal offense.\r\n\r\n",
