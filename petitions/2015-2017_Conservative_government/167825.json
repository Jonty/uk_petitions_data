        "additional_details": "Currently there are over 7,000 people on the UK national transplant waiting list and, during the last financial year, over 1,300 people either died whilst on the waiting list or became too sick to receive a transplant. This is because, despite more than 500,000 people dying each year in the UK, fewer than 5,000 people die in circumstances where they can become a donor. \r\n\r\nIf we can increase the amount of people by only 5% this will save lives each and every week in the UK.",
        "background": "As of 2010, 24 European countries have some form of presumed consent (opt-out) system, with the most prominent and limited opt-out systems in Spain, Austria, and Belgium yielding high donor rates.\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom organ donation is voluntary and no consent is presumed.\r\n",
