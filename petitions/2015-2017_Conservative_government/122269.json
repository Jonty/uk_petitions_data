        "action": "Introduce a law on animal Medication advice and distribution",
        "additional_details": "The reason we are petitioning for a change is that many owners cannot afford the medication charges from the vets especially for long term conditions and face the hard decision to put their pets to sleep, giving their pets up to animal welfare organisations or worse abandoning their pet. Prescription charges range from \u00a38.00 to \u00a315.00 depending on which vet you use.\r\nWith Blu's Law we would reduce the amount of abandoned animals and animals put to sleep needlessly.",
        "background": "We want to change advice owners get from their vets in the UK with regards purchasing medication for their animals and introduce a statutory prescription charge. Many owners do not know that they can purchase a written prescription from the vet and get the medication from a pharmacy at reduced price",
