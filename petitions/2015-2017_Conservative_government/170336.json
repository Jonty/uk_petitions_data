        "additional_details": "There is nothing to stop the 'refugees' in Calais from going to the nearest police station and claiming asylum in France. They are not escaping from a war zone; they are escaping from France which is regarded as a safe country and it's not a war zone.\r\nAny refugee that has come to the UK through, under, over or via a safe country is not a genuine refugee and is, instead, an economic migrant.\r\nMost 'Syrian' refugees in Calais are not even Syrian; quite clearly, many are from sub-Saharan Africa. \r\n",
        "background": "According to the United Nations, a refugee should seek refuge in the nearest safe country. Once a refugee leaves a refugee camp or a safe country, that person loses their refugee status and becomes an economic migrant. Therefore, those in the 'Calais Jungle' are not genuine refugees.",
