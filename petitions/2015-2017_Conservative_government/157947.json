        "action": "Agree Michael Gove is unfit for public office & demand his immediate resignation",
        "additional_details": "A specific example is Gove's endorsement of a poster specifically promising an additional \u00a3350m per week of funding for the NHS if the UK left the EU. His campaign bus was emblazoned with a slogan further supporting this message. These claims potentially influenced the outcome of a referendum critical to the nation. At the time of doing so Gove knew this figure to be grossly inaccurate and that the pledge could not be upheld.",
        "background": "It is believed Gove deliberately misled the UK electorate & made claims he knew to be false for his own political gain. \r\nHaving purposefully & deliberately misled the UK public, Gove's position as a public servant is untenable. We urge Conservative party MPs to carefully consider his track record. ",
