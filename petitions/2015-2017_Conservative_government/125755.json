Jersey and other UK islands do not have these problems but allow these firearms.\r\n\r\nAnd i call for the amendment of the Firearms act of 1968 to allow pepper spray, tasers and other primarily defensive items to be legal, to own and carry in public for the purpose of self defense, to protect the public by taking away their protection is ludicrous.",
        "background": "Repeal the firearms amendment act of 1997 and of 1988, meaning licence holders can own handguns and semi-automatic rifles legally, also amend the Firearms act of 1968 to allow pepper spray and tasers (stun guns) to be legally owned and carried in public for self defense with no restrictions.",
