        "additional_details": "For example, in Castle Point, a party achieved 37% of the vote but gained 60% of the seats, while another party there achieved 31% of the vote but gains no seats.\r\n\r\nIn Oldham, 49.1% of the vote was enough to gain 75% of the seats available.\r\n\r\nWe are calling for a fairer system to be put in place so that every vote counts.",
        "background": "The current system of FPTP is leaving Local Elections in England and Wales with abnormal results. parties are gaining a higher percentage of seats compared with the actual vote they receive, which is leaving the majority of voters unrepresented at Council level.",
