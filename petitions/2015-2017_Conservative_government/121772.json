MSLCs have a proven track record in delivering this.\r\n\r\nThe government/CCGs should commit to funding MSLCs in order to maintain the interaction between providers and users and to support patient involvement in influencing service provision locally.\r\n\r\n",

Many MSLCs are at risk due to a lack of funding. Support should be given to MSLCs to continue and improve on the work they are currently doing.",
