        "additional_details": "Some voters accept as genuine, without question, posts on social media that are either written, endorsed or shared by MPs. The government should set up an independent body to monitor and police MPs Social Media accounts. Were it can be proven an MP has intentionally lied or spread false information on Social Media, this body should have regulatory powers to impose sanctions and or fines on the MPs responsible. It is important that MPs are seen to be as transparent as possible.",
        "background": "Social media usage by MPs is on the increase and given their influence over potential voters it is important that the posts that MPs write, share and endorse are clear and honest and not misleading or false in anyway. The Government  should set up an independent body to monitor these accounts. ",
