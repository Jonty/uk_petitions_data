        "action": "Introduce the study of Politics and Economics into the core curriculum",
        "additional_details": "Since the introduction of the representation of the people act in 1918 the general public have been granted the right to vote. Nearly a century later political studies are yet to be included in the core curriculum for secondary schools. The same can be said for the study of economics, which is intrinsically linked to Politics. We the concerned electorate believe this undermines the rights given to us and propose their implementation in order to rectify this.",
        "background": "We believe that Political and Economic studies are largely neglected within the current educational system. We propose the integration of these subjects into the core curriculum in order to equip future generations with the necessary skills to form unbiased, well reasoned opinions.",
