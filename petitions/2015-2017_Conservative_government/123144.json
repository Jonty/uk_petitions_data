        "action": "Introduce NHS funding for Forensic Psychology doctorate students",
        "additional_details": "The Forensic Psychology doctorate is a professional training course during which you are on placement full-time, whilst also conducting thesis research. However, the full-time work that students undertake on placements (often within NHS establishments, e.g. secure hospitals) is completely unpaid. This means that Forensic Psychology doctorate students have to find a way to pay the course fees and be able to work for free for 2 years. I believe the Forensic Doctorate should be funded by the NHS.",
        "background": "The NHS funds Clinical Psychology doctoral students so that they are able to complete their training whilst earning a fair salary. This means that anyone can apply to do the Clinical Psychology doctorate. The Forensic Psychology doctorate is not only NOT funded, but must be paid for (over \u00a37000/yr).",
