        "additional_details": "At time of writing (26/01/2016) there are 760,000 people claiming JSA, that is essentially three quarters of a million people ready to work on state projects, man food banks, and help towards the state. Obviously how this would be implemented would be up to the government, but just me thinking out loud.",
        "background": "Please don't view this as an out of touch 50 year old something living in Kent ranting and fuming about how people these days don't do anything. I am sure that people claiming the allowance are literally just trying to find a job, and getting by on what they can, however it's a matter of principle.",
