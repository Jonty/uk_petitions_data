Out of interest clicked on the links on the site to see if I could get them somewhere else. Available on both StubHub and Heatwave at a minimum of \u00a3129 per ticket, ticket face value \u00a350. \r\nIt seems obvious that either companies or individuals are buying tickets with the express intention of reselling them at a huge profit. This prevents all but the very wealthy from seeing the bands they love. ",
