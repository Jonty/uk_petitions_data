        "additional_details": "Just 66.1% of the electorate voted in the 2015 Election; 65% voted in 2010, 61% in 2005 and only 59% in 2001. Even in the 2016 EU Referendum,  27.8% of the electorate failed to vote i.e 12.94 million unused votes. If we promote the UK as being a truly democratic country,  then government must ensure that we have a voting system which guarantees the views and wishes of the majority of the electorate,  are reflected. Voting in Australia is already compulsory, and so it should be in the UK. ",
        "background": "The more people who vote, the greater confidence we can have that the result represents the majority of the UK. Too often   voting turnout in the UK is embarrassingly low. The result of an Election or Referendum,  will affect our lives and the lives of future generations, and must be taken seriously",
