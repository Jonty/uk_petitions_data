        "additional_details": "The fact that there has been so much debate over the validity of the Brexit result is self evident of a deep malaise within the referendum process. In the US there must be a two thirds majority for any constitutional change to occur. I propose a similar system with parliamentary support and debate to be imposed to provide a clear mandate for the referendum and process to prevent the chaos that has insued from the recent Brexit result. A watchdog can also be created to monitor the debate as well.",
        "background": "With the recent debates over referendums with Brexit being a clear example of the ambiguity of referendums within British politics. This is leading to increasing levels of division and a legal framework must be created to provide a clear constitutional path for the results to be processed.",
