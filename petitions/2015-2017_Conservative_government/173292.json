        "action": "Begin phasing out the sale of new fossil-fuel powered cars by 2018",
        "additional_details": "Then, sales of private non-electric-powered cars must be prohibited by 2025.  Obviously, this must be supported by additional scrappage schemes to help those who must buy cars to meet the additional costs of electric vehicles AND (more importantly), massively increased investment in public transport but by starting with fleets, this will mean the first phase of eliminating fossil fuel powered cars will by carried out by those best placed to absorb the costs - i.e. large businesses",
        "background": "Although by no means the only cause of air pollution, there is an opportunity to make inroads into NOx emissions by the gradual phasing-out of fossil-fuel powered cars, commencing with banning company car fleets from purchasing anything other than fully electric vehicles by 2018.",
