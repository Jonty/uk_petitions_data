Make public transport open to the public again. ",
        "background": "Bus-fair is rising exponentially yet no additions to the service are coming with this rise in price. \r\nMany citizens rely on busses to get to and from work and when they are late this can cause people to be late for work, which can lead to sanctions and loss of earnings. ",
