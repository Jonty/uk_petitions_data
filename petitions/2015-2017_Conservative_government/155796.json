It must be shown that this behaviour is not representative of the entire British population, nor that we condone it. \r\n\r\nThe elitist political leaders are no better than the media - Johnson's false claims against Turkey, Farage's \"breaking point\" poster, and Cameron's claims on \"swarms\" of migrants. \r\n\r\nA simple written reply from the government is not acceptable in this circumstance. Action must be taken. \r\n",
        "background": "Many factors played into the \"Brexit\" campaign, a major one of which was immigration. Since the announcement of a Leave win, and mainstream media coverage, racism has soared. It is clear that a more definite action is needed to cease this hate fuelled conduct. ",
