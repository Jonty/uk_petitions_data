        "additional_details": "The individuals putting up the flags in areas that have never had flags flying before are threatening and intimidating people in their own homes.  They are no better than dogs urinating up lamp posts to claim them as theirs.\r\nCommunity leaders do nothing, the PSNI won't react until the Department of Infrastructure make an official complaint and politicians are voiceless.\r\nA law must be created to stop this behaviour.  Objects flying from lamp posts and telegraph poles should be illegal and removed",
        "background": "Large areas of Northern Ireland are becoming littered with flags flying from lamp posts.  The expanse of flags is increasing every year into areas that are mixed and not involved with this type of tribal behaviour.  It is wanton intimidation, by small factions of the community",
