        "action": "Re-nationalise the rail services to make it more accessible to everyone.",
        "additional_details": "With the revelations over the past few years that car manufacturers have been attempting to modify their emissions test results, it is not irrational to suggest this will have had a negative impact on our environment. By renationalising the rail services, it is possible that the increase use of the rail services will lead to a decrease in traffic on our roads, and therefore help to reduce this country's carbon footprint.",
        "background": "In this country we are encouraged to be more environmentally friendly and to use public transport to aid this goal. However with the train fairs being so high it seems to put people off using the railway as they simply cannot afford it. As such we see more traffic on our roads and so more pollution.",
