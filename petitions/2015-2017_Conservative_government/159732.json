        "additional_details": "Due to the current instability in the country given the fact that the result of the EU Referendum was so divided, and the fact that the two major political parties in the UK are in meltdown - I believe that the public should be able to have influence on who runs the country rather than someone being placed by other Conservatives. Supporting this - in the referendum there was a surge in young people voting; it could be argued that prior to the referendum the importance of voting was not clear. ",
        "background": "David Cameron was elected Prime Minister. As none of the other candidates were voted in to run the country - (and given the recent results of the EU Referendum) I believe that we should hold another election so that the public have a say in who runs the country and not just MP's choosing.
