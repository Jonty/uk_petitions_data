        "action": "Parliament to exercise its constitutional right not to implement EU referendum.",
        "additional_details": "Since the referendum results were announced, the pound has already fallen to a 31-year low. Large companies are preparing to relocate their offices from London to Frankfurt or other major cities in the EU. The Leave campaign has as much as admitted that it made false claims during its campaign particularly as far as NHS funding is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe referendum's principles were also flawed by not calling for a two thirds majority nor a minimum turnout. The referendum does not reflect democracy.",
        "background": "The UK Parliament is not legally or constitutionally bound to implement the results of the EU referendum. Leaving the EU will result in lower living standards for all UK citizens and will inevitably lead to a breakup of the United Kingdom. It will lead to an increase in hate crime.",
