        "additional_details": "Surviving parents and their young children will be hit hardest by this cruel cut.\r\nThis is in essence stealing from these children because their parents have paid National Insurance contributions and then never lived to draw a pension or use the NHS in old age and when these parents die early, their children will get no help from this after just 18 months.\r\nThis planned cut is inhumane and must be reversed.\r\nhttp://www.childhoodbereavementnetwork.org.uk/campaigns/fairer-welfare-benefits.aspx ",
        "background": "The government plans to reform Bereavement Payment and Widowed Parents' Allowance putting pressure on surviving parents who are seeking to meet their grieving children's needs. These reforms drastically cut support available, heartbreakingly leaving approximately 75% of bereaved children worse off.",
