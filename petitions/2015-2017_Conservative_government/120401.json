        "action": "Make it a requirement that cabinet MPs have appropriate qualifications",
        "additional_details": "During the last parliament George Osborne embarrassed himself by confusing the deficit and the debt in a public statement. He does not have economic qualifications was obviously ill-prepared for the role of chancellor. Jeremy Hunt caused outrage and triggered the junior doctor strike by trying to force a new contract based on ill-informed conclusions, and Micheal Gove cause chaos in higher education over fees. If each office had appropriate qualifications such issues could have been avoided.",
        "background": "The recent strike by junior doctors has highlighted the gap of understanding between members of the cabinet and the fields they are expected to work in. If we are to have confidence in the abilities of our cabinet, regardless of their party, they need to be properly qualified in their fields.",
