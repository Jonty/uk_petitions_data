This so-called democracy recently released a 12 year old Palestinian girl from prison, after alleging she was in possession of a knife. Israel also recently made the headlines when an Israeli Soldier shot dead a wounded and unarmed Palestinian who posed no threat.\r\n\r\nWe have every right to denounce Israel for these crimes, without being labelled anti-semitic. Criticizing Israel is not anti-semitic.",

We have every right to be critical of Israel's appalling treatment of the Palestinians in the Occupied Territories. ",
