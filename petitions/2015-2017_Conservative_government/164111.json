        "additional_details": "The Thameslink line is the most expensive in Europe for passengers and the most lucrative for the train operator.\r\n\r\nThe Thameslink Twitter feed (@TLRailUK) has evidence of daily complaints and issues. All of which highlight Govia's incompetence.\r\n\r\nTFL should be awarded the franchise.\r\n\r\nThis is the shortest commuter line into London. \r\n\r\nGiven the revenues Govia generate on this line, it would be hugely profitable for TFL and better service for commuters as TFL reinvest all profits in the service.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Since Govia took over and despite promises for improvement, the service is worse than it was under FCC.\r\n\r\nPeak time trains continually cancelled due to \"No Crew\", \"Technical Fault\" or no reason at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 carriage trains on what was advertised as 12 carriages during peak times.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
