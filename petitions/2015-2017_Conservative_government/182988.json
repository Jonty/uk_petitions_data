        "additional_details": "Solicitors fees are usually fixed but other hidden charges increases the finaly bill to twice or even more sometimes. For eg. 1) 'Ground Landlord notice fee' \u00a3100! Just to notify the council (land owner) that there is a change in owner. Telegraphic transfer fee \u00a345 (you pay this twice if 2 transfers are to be made). There should transparency in these costs and some standardisation where possible.",
        "background": "When you buy/sell/remortgage a property, the conveyncing solicitors gives you a quote to start with but the final bill is usually twice the quote (specially when buying). You dont even understand the charges they mention in the bill, nor you get a choice at that point and it feels like extortion.  ",
