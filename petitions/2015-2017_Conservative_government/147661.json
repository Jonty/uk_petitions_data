        "additional_details": "After the EU Referendum result and the Prime Minister\u2019s resignation, Parliament must show confidence in the Government or call a general election.\r\n\r\n\u2028The Government and any new Prime Minister have no mandate for post-referendum negotiations. The exceptional circumstances and political division require a new mandate.\r\n\r\n\u2028Petitions cannot call for a vote of No Confidence, nor for the dissolution of Parliament, but they can ask for an amendment to legislation such as the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.",
        "background": "We call for the Fixed-term Parliaments Act to be amended such that any new Prime Minister\u2019s government must face an explicit vote of confidence in the Commons. If no government can win such a vote, a general election must be held.",
