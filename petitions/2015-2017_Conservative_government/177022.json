        "additional_details": "House of Commons Health Committee \"Winter pressure in accident and emergency departments Third Report of Session 2016\u201317\" demonstrates that compliance with 4h targets plummets every winter (85% in 2015, 80% in 2016) and demand is currently higher than ever. Hospitals are paying the price of chronic government underfunding of Primary Care and Community Care, and to financially penalise hospitals for flawed government policy is clearly absurd.",
        "background": "The Standard Contract for NHS Providers in 2015-16 charges hospitals \u00a3120 for every breach of the 4h wait times over the target in Emergency Departments. With unprecedented pressure on Emergency Departments currently this is an absurd system of punishing hospitals for being busy. ",
