        "background": "Research suggests we develop an 'attachment' to key caregivers in early life. Developing a 'secure attachment' is linked to good self-esteem, healthy relationships & emotional wellbeing. Yet the average person has no awareness of 'attachment' & 40% of children don't develop a 'secure attachment'.",
