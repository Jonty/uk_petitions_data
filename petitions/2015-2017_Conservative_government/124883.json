        "additional_details": "Mr Turner does not seem concerned about the Isle of Wight Council having there budget cut. In fact he has previously voted in favour of cutting funding to local councils. This in turn means housing benefit and council tax benefit is being cut and islanders will suffer again.",
        "background": "Mr Turner has been unaccountable and ignoring many media enquiries about his recent voting. He has recently also shown no concern about the impact on Island Residents when voting in favour of cuts.",
