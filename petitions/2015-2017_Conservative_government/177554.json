        "additional_details": "Tavistock and Portman, England's only GIC for adolescents, recently received a large amount of funding to help it meet demand, but adult GICs have not been given the same aid.\r\n\r\nGovernment guidelines dictate that no one should have to wait more than 18 weeks for an appointment, but GICs have not been provided with the resources needed to meet this target. Repeat appointments at Charing Cross GIC used to be 6 months apart, but are now closer to 9. Clinics also need more admin staff.",
        "background": "There are seven NHS England Gender Identity Clinics (GICs) for adults. Currently, there all of them have a waiting list of over a year from referral to first appointment. It can take months just for letters to be typed up and sent. Referrals are rising, and GICs need more funding to keep up.",
