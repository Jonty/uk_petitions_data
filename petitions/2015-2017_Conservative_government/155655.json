They did not expect to win, and had not fully thought through the consequences of doing so. They may now be reconsidering.\r\n\r\n64% of 18-24 year olds, who disproportionately support 'remain', did not vote. They may now wish that they had.\r\n\r\nThe first vote does not have to be final.",
        "background": "In the aftermath of the 'leave' decision, some may now wish they had voted differently. If the will of the people has changed, it is vital to recognise this before taking irreversible steps.\r\n\r\nA very large number of signatures on this petition will demonstrate that the nation has changed its mind.",
