We can stop this madness and bring this nightmare to an end through a vote in Parliament.  \r\n\r\n\u201cOur sovereign Parliament needs to now vote on whether we should exit the EU.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe referendum was an advisory, non-binding referendum.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Leave campaign's platform has already unravelled and some people wish they hadn't voted to Leave.\r\n\r\n\u201cParliament now needs to decide whether we should go forward with Brexit, and there should be a vote in Parliament next week.\r\n\r\nWe support David Lammy\u2019s call.  \r\n\r\nAt the same time, Parliament needs to take on board the needs of poor, working-class, people in this country who have been ignored for nearly four decades.  \r\n",
