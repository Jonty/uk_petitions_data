        "additional_details": "Jo Cox's life as mother, wife, citizen, and MP was tragically cut short in an act of sheer madness. It, however, allowed the rest of us in the UK & abroad, who hadn't been fortunate enough to meet Jo, to learn more about the kind, caring, inspiring, and selfless individual she was. \r\n\r\nIt would not only be right and befitting to erect a statue in memory of Jo Cox, but would also act as permanent reminder of the humanitarian, selfless, and compassionate values she embodied and inspired others too. ",
        "background": "We ask that, to permanently recognise all the values Jo stood for, and as a reminder of the best of British and all that we should aspire to, a permanent statue be put up, either in Batley, Birstall or somewhere else as appropriate, in her memory.\r\n",
