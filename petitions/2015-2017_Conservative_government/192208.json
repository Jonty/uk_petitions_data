        "additional_details": "When a person is in need of a little help there are people there to help. The carers and nurses who help, struggle on a daily basis to park their cars to get to the client often driving round for 10 minutes to find somewhere to park. This time spent driving round trying to park their car could be put to better use of the struggling demand of people in need of help or assistance. Carers and nurses should be allocated a badge to stop the parking tickets when working. ",
        "background": "Carers and nurses in the community often arrive at a clients house only to find that it is a permit road only and all other surrounding roads have no space to park. So the nurse or carer decides to put the client 1st and park wherever they can to help the person in need. ",
