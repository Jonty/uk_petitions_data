        "action": "Scrap the 7 day week NHS proposals or fund them by the amount the BMA requires.",
        "additional_details": "The evidence is in the proposals themselves and the medical practitioner's need to strike over such an unreasonable contract. No further evidence of inadequate provision is required, the burden of proof lies with those trying to push through the contract.\r\nThe BMA are the organisation representing the NHS and it's staff.",
        "background": "The \"7 day week\" proposals would stretch the already stretched resources and people of the NHS well past breaking point, and do Not provide the funding and staff required. The petition to have Mr Hunt removed was brushed aside, can we at least agree his policies need removing?",
