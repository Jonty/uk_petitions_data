        "additional_details": "A 50 bedroom hostel would pay \u00a3145.50 for the first 15 units and \u00a3145.50 for every 5 units after that. So its total cost would be \u00a31164.00 which divided by 50 people is only \u00a323.28 each per year. However in a 50 room hall of residence each student has to pay \u00a3145.50 because their rooms include receiving equipment/sockets, whether they use them or not. The total cost raised for the BBC is \u00a37275 (more if paid in installments) If students can't have free TV then at least make the system fair. ",
        "background": "Halls of residence are little more than self catering Hotels or Hostels.  Students share \"Flats\" with on average 8 other students. Although they have their own room (as they do at home and don't need their own licence).Yet every student has to pay for their own licence! This is an unfair system.\r\n",
