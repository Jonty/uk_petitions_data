        "additional_details": "Enough is enough, It is time to give the National lottery back to the public. It is time that Camelot's contract was terminated & given to an organisation that will make it worth playing again. Who wants to win \u00a375 for matching 4 numbers or \u00a31000 for 5. \r\nPeople who have been playing the same numbers since the start have seen their weekly cost quadruple or they just stopped playing because they cannot afford it.\r\nKeep it simple, 1 main draw a week & higher value prizes for lower matching numbers.",
        "background": "Camelot has abused the nations trust with its greed. Going from 1 draw a week when it first started to 2 in 1997 then doubling the cost of a ticket in Oct 13 & now adding an additional 10 numbers making the chance of winning 1 in 45m whilst our money is going to Canadian pension funds.",
