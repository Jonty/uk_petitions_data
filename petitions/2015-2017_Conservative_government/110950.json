They bring crime, disease, overcrowding and wage depreciation, are a burden on our welfare system and on our national infrastructure and routinely cause mass public outrage.\r\n\r\nThe only affective way to secure the border in Calais is by using anti-personnel mines.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11946146/If-Brexit-happens-UK-wont-be-able-to-police-French-borders-to-stop-migrants-warns-France.html ",
        "background": "The UK border in Calais is being routinely compromised by organised gangs of foreign often violent criminals. Fences and border agents without powers of arrest are inadequate therefore mines must be deployed and the relevant international treaties repealed to ensure their full and unassailable use.",
