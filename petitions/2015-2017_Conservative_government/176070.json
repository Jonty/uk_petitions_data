        "action": "Abolish old & outdated leasehold law for all leasehold flats. Make them freehold",
        "additional_details": "The freeholder of the building should be forced to sell part of their freehold (for a cheap price) at the start and then eventually force them to give up the freehold. Leaseholders in UK are being conned and ripped off by unregulated freeholders.",
        "background": "Crooked & unregulated freeholders hold leaseholders to ransom with high fees. When we buy a flat, we should also own a section of the outside part of the building and parts of the communal area. Responsibility should lie with the flat owner, not the freeholder. Commonhold law may be required here.",
