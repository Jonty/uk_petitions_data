        "additional_details": "Since it will be made law that we should make life easier for Local Authorities and save them money, to which I agree, to chip our pets I believe they should also inform us if they find our pet too. So many families are searching every day for their pets yet who knows how many have been discarded by our LA cleansing department. These animals are not just animals to us, they are part of our family, we feel we should have rights too.",
        "background": "Many local authorities dont act responsibly regarding deceased pets and check for chip information and inform owners. Instead there are many complaints of animals being wrapped in bins and thrown out as indicated by the cleansing department workers themselves.\r\n",
