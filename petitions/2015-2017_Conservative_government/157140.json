        "additional_details": "The article by David Pannick QC can be read at http://tinyurl.com/j9yxu3l \r\nCurrently Brexit MPs have been unclear and in conflict as to whether or not a post exit UK would seek to re-join the Single Market. The EU say they would not be permitted to do so without accepting free movement of people, an issue that Brexiteers reject. Such a plan risks no agreement being reached and thus the UK being thrown out after 2 years with no deal in place and no plan for survival outside the EU. \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "As explained by David Pannick QC in The Times (30/06/16)  it would be unlawful to instigate Article 50 to leave the EU without a new Act of Parliament. That would give MPs the opportunity to debate and consider a specific post EU proposal and its prospects of EU agreement before authorising an exit.",
