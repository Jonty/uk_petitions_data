        "additional_details": "On the 23rd June 2016, the people of the UK were allowed to cast a vote on whether we remain part of the EU, or we leave the EU. Both sides, Leave & Remain campaigned exhaustively, both putting their points over - but when all the votes had been counted, the people of the UK had decided that we were better outside of the EU, and voted as so.\r\nTo allow a 2nd referendum would be to undermine the people of the UK, and also their right to vote. Now we need to look forward, and accept that result!\r\n",
        "background": "A petition has been recently started to allow a 2nd EU Referendum - this is despite a fair voting process. We were told by David Cameron that this was a ''one time deal'', and Jean Claude Juncker also said that ''once we're out, we're out''. We voted to leave, and that vote should stand.\r\n",
