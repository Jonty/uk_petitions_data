        "additional_details": "This is happening every day all over the country and it is wrong! What is the point of having the spaces if anyone is allowed to park there? The stores don't do anything to enforce it and it is getting out of control. It would be the same as having a disabled badge, people parked in the spaces without a 'parent pass' should be fined.\r\n\r\nParents with young children aren't able to use smaller spaces due to getting their child in and out of the car and we rely on the mother and child spaces",
        "background": "A man parked in a mother and child space, I asked him where his child was and he ignored me, pulled a child seat out of his boot and placed in the back of his car and walked off. I had to park far away from the entrance in a space that was small and made it difficult to get my child out of the car.",
