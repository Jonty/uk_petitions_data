Even those who hate it.\r\n\r\nOpposition to MMA is everywhere. Whether you\u2019re standing at a bus stop, waiting in a supermarket queue or having a pint, the chances are that someone within earshot will be willing to openly admonish its brutal, no-holds-barred nature.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Martial Arts Commission (IMAC) have provided the latest dissenting voice.\r\n\r\nThey believe MMA to be \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d.\r\n\r\nThey\u2019re right about dangerous, and maybe even irresponsible.\r\n\r\nBut then, so is boxing, rugby and horse racing.\r\n\r\nIn fact, all of the above sports have more blotches on their copybook than MMA in terms of athlete safety.",
