        "action": "Keep Britain in The EU! Overrule Article 50 on Basis of Non-binding Referendum",
        "additional_details": "The referendum consequences are dire and will cause more damage going forward. Brexit will almost certainly result in Scotland leaving the union, turmoil in Northern Ireland, and a recession. MPs have a duty to protect the greater interests of the country. Given the public regret, narrow margin of victory, and unquestionable negative impacts of Brexit, it is Parliament's responsibility to oppose the triggering of Article 50. We urge MPs to safeguard our future by keeping Britain in the EU.",
        "background": "We urge the House of Commons to a) retain the sovereignty of parliament over an advisory, non-binding referendum and b) refrain from invoking Article 50 which triggers permanent changes that our country has no capacity to manage. Brexit has no realistic transitional plan. It must be overruled. ",
