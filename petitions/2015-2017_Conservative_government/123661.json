I believe that anyone who will be impacted by this should have a say in what happens. For example if we vote to leave and as a result the economy collapses, we are the people who will have to deal with that and have to adapt drastically to it. ",

I think the fact that we are all going to live in a world effected by this decision gives people from age 16 the right to vote. ",
