        "additional_details": "Reasoning:\r\n-During campaigning there were allegations of misrepresentation from both sides. \r\n\r\n-Voter registration was extended beyond the originally agreed deadline prompting a prominent leave campaigner to declare it \"unconstitutional\" and demand a judicial review. \r\n\r\n-The high-profile murder of Remain campaigner Jo Cox MP.\r\n\r\n-On winning the referendum, Leave immediately retracting their two key campaigning issues as undeliverable.\r\n\r\n-The continued reluctance for Leave to deliver for their voters.",
        "background": "The EU referendum was advisory and the government is not legally bound to act in accordance with the result. The integrity of the referendum is questionable and it has already caused significant financial turmoil and irreparable political damage to the union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.",
