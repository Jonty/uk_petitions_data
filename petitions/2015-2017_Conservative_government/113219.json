We cannot afford another 5 years of Tory rule, with the recent welfare reform that will cause nothing but immense poverty in the UK.\"   The government has refused to debate this.  This really does show how ineffective the petition system is, wether you agree or not.",

We're therefore not sure what changes you would like to see.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons Petitions Committee looks at petitions and has the power to schedule debates on them. It does not, however, have the power to schedule debates on motions of no confidence.\r\n\r\nThe Petitions Committee is not the only way that petitions can be debated. The topic of a petition can be debated in other House of Commons debates. Some debates are scheduled by the Government, some by the Opposition parties, some by the Backbench Business Committee, and there are also opportunities for individual MPs to secure a debate on a topic. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more about how the Petitions Committee and how it works here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.parliament.uk/petitions-committee\r\n\r\nYou can see which petitions have been debated here:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/#petitions-with-debated-outcome\r\n\r\nIf you would like the system to be changed, you could start a petition asking for a specific change to the rules. You might for example be interested in this petition:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/113291\r\n\r\n"
