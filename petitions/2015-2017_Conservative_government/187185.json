Although I agree with this I also feel what about the mothers whom constantly try to get their children's fathers to step up and they don't. I read an article today in the Daily Mail suggesting mothers will be jailed whom withhold their children. How about we suggest fathers who don't do their fair share of responsible parenting also have some kind of legal scrutiny. ",
