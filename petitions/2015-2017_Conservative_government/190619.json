        "additional_details": "By making breaching an order a criminal offence with a power of arrest, the police will be able to take action. I believe 99% of the time all that would be needed is for an officer to supervise a handover to the parent with court ordered contact. The power of arrest would enable action when the person with the child refuses to co-operate, also someone could be de-arrested once the child is with the correct parent. A court order is made in the best interests of the child, and should be respected.",
        "background": "Far too often non-resident parents spend \u00a31000's in the family court system, to achieve a contact arrangement with their children, only to find the resident parent ignores it and the police are unwilling to take any action.There is rarely any penalty for breaches, and non-contact can go on for years",
