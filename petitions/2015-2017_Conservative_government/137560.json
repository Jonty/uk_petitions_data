        "additional_details": "A clear mandate exists for a 2nd Scottish referendum before UK exits EU. The  democratically elected SNP manifesto states:\r\n\r\n\"We believe that the Scottish Parliament should have the right to hold another referendum if there is clear and sustained evidence that independence has become the preferred option of a majority of the Scottish people - or if there is a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2015, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will.\"",
        "background": "Scotland unanimously voted to remain in the EU, in all 32 unitary authority council areas. A Brexit inflicted on an unwilling Scottish population deeply undermines the concept of nationally democracy, and the result not in keeping with Scotland's proud international and collaborative tradition.
