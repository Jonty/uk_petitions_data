        "additional_details": "Schools are cutting music from their curriculum and this is increasing nationally. Music is dying within our schools. Teachers of the arts know that the increasing importance being placed on Ebacc has contributed significantly to the sheer destruction of the Arts in school. Jobs are at risk and the heart of schools is being ripped out. Studying the Arts makes a much more well-rounded individual with a much wider skill set. Arts needs to be included to allow a \u201cbroad and balanced\u201d curriculum. ",
        "background": "We need serious consideration from the government to include Arts and creative subjects (Music, Drama, Dance and Art) as part of the Ebacc measures. We have to stand up and fight for all the young musicians and creative students. We have to fight for our subject. ",
