        "additional_details": "On average, three children in a classroom are experiencing a mental health problem. Most common are behavioural problems. These children often feel misunderstood by teachers and other pupils. By introducing mental health awareness into the national curriculum, students would be learning life long skills on how to deal with mental health issues. It would also help to remove the stigma surrounding mental illness, as well as teaching about signs and symptoms and where to get help if needed. ",
        "background": "Schools are ideally placed to protect and promote children's mental health. Children are there five days a week for most of 11 years. Every school teaches physical education, so why ignore mental health? ",
