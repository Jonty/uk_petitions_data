        "action": "Abolish the TV licence as the BBC has been censoring its news broadcasting.",
        "additional_details": "When Tory election fraud came to light the days before local elections across the country, the BBC conveniently decided to not report on it. Similarly, after the general election a massive anti-Tory protest was carried out in London which the BBC at first refused to report on it. When forced by the public to say something, they censored information about the protest and sold it as much smaller than it was. If the BBC are not going to be independent the the TV licence should be void.",
        "background": "If you own equipment that can receive or transmit a TV signal you are forced to pay a hefty licence fee on top of the price you have already paid for the device. This supposedly goes towards keeping the BBC independent of political interest yet it censors the news and still takes your money.",
