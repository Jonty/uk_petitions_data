        "additional_details": "We can't blame Syria for current refugee crisis.  IOM was first established to deal with post WWII migration - remit includes refurbishment / establishment of camps & policy making. Recalling also EU's agreement in 2004 with Mr Gaddafi of Libya to be the gendarme of Europe to control northbound migrants including IOM camp in Libya - it was predicted then that migrants would be released from camps by the 1000s to enter EU and it is happening - engagement in Syria will not stop the refugee influx.",
        "background": "Refugees have always streamed out of camps run by multinational International Organisation for Migration (IOM) coordinators of transport from borders to camps, sharing out of refugees between host states etc.  We always hear about UN organisations, what about IOM's role since inception in the 50s?",
