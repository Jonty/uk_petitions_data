        "additional_details": "According to the Royal College of Nurses there has been a 14% FALL  of nursing pay since 2010 in real terms. \r\n\r\nNurses and HCAs will not tolerate this any longer.\r\n\r\nSuccessive governments have abused the special 'calling' that health workers have to their patients, but this can no longer be taken for granted. \r\nThe Government can, and should, properly value and reward NHS staff. Scrap the 1% pay cap for NHS staff & award them with an above-inflation pay increase. ",
        "background": "The 1% cap on NHS pay  puts patient care at risk. More Nurses/HCAs than ever before are leaving, piling pressure on those that remain, so this becomes self perpetuating. Those who stay are having to take 2nd jobs and even use food banks. The RCN is balloting members on strike action over low pay.",
