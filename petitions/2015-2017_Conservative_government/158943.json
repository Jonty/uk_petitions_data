        "action": "Support the provision of new bomb detection equipment to Baghdad checkpoints.",
        "additional_details": "There are many Checkpoints in Baghdad. Police are still using fake bomb detectors bought via a bogus British businessman who was jailed in the UK over the deal 3 years ago. Iraqi Prime minister called for an end to their use. It is frustrating to see that so many innocent lives could be saved using modern security technologies, which the UK is a world leader in. I call on the British government to openly support the Iraqi authority in replacing bomb detection equipment at checkpoints.",
        "background": "On the 2nd of July, 165 innocent Iraqis were killed in the Karrada district of Baghdad in a massive explosion near a shopping mall by car bomb- a truck to be precise.  Another car bomb explosion took the lives of around 100 innocent shoppers at a market in Baghdad a month before. The list is long. ",
