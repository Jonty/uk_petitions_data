        "additional_details": "Please can the house of commons hold an immediate vote on whether to proceed with the UK exit, or to ignore the referendum and remain in the EU. The referendum vote was too close and the future of this country should be guided by the elected members of parliament from all UK countries. Without this vote uncertainty will grow and damage the UK economy further. ",
        "background": "Following the EU referendum, there has not been a vote within the house of commons on whether to proceed formally with the UK exit from the EU. The referendum is not recognised legally and the government has the power to stop the UK leaving the EU if it is in the country's best interest. ",
