They want independence but don't seem to realise that means the withdrawal of British Forces and MoD contracts from Scotland whilst simultaneously calling on the UK Gov to secure the ship contracts in Scotland... Let alone moaning about the 5 Military Base closures when Independence would've guaranteed closures to last a lifetime. I know we all know the lot of them are brain dead but can the Gov smack them with some reality please. This is stupid.",

They're trying to break our Kingdom in two whilst simultaneously banging on about MoD shipbuilding contracts specifically in regards to the Type 26's and Type 31 Frigates and how they can't be spread throughout the UK. The nerve.",
