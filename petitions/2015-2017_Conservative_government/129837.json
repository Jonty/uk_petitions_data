        "action": "Remove political party affiliation from police and crime commissioner elections",
        "additional_details": "Party affiliation is unnecessary. Having party affiliation politicises the role, which isn't designed as a political role. It also creates an issue of candidates having to \"toe the party line\" as they are party affiliated, which again politicises the role of police and crime commissioners. Therefore party affiliation should be removed from the police and crime commissioner role and election process. ",
        "background": "The role of a police and crime commissioner is non-political and therefore party affiliation shouldn't be stated on ballot papers or be used in the campaign process. Candidates should be elected on their merit and policies not their party affiliation, party affiliation threatens this.  ",
