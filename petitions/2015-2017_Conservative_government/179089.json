        "additional_details": "I looked into background checks because the recent \"Brexit\" referendum raised doubts about the professional ethics and integrity of some of the MPs involved.\r\n\r\nIn 2014 North East MP Helen Goodman called for MPs to have \"the same sort of checks as teachers and youth workers.\" As far as I'm aware this hasn't happened yet and is long overdue.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/criminal-checks-needed-make-sure-7386465\r\n",
        "background": "As a Health Professional I was surprised to learn that MPs, unlike other Public Servants in a position of trust, are not routinely required to have an Enhanced DBS check as a condition of their employment. MPs should be honest, trustworthy and above reproach, so background checks are reasonable.",
