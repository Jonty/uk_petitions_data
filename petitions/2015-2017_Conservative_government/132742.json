        "additional_details": "One of the offenders moved a few months ago, and since reoffended and been given a custodial sentence. The other is still in residence. There was another offender who owned his property, who reoffended and has since left the area. These are the registered sex offenders we are aware of, no doubt there will be more. Our concern is allowing registered sex offenders to live in an area like this, is a recipe for disaster. We have our children to think about. ",
        "background": "Recently quite a number of registered sex offenders have been allowed to reside in properties owned by a housing association. Two within yards of each other. The area the properties are in is heavily populated by children, also up the road from a school. ",
