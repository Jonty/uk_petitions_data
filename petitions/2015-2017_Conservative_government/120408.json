It is noticeable that all searches beginning with \"N are\", featuring the name of a political party, result in derogatory and negative suggestions.  Where \"Tories\" or \"Conservatives\" is entered, no suggestions are proffered.",
        "background": "As of 1st February 2016, searches on Google beginning with the words \"Labour are\", or \"SNP are\", or \"Lib Dems are\", bring up suggestions such as \"liars\", \"finished\", \"a joke\" etc., while the search \"Conservatives are\" brings up no results.  This suggests direct, subversive propaganda.",
