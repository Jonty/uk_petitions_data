        "additional_details": "Increasing number of stories and requests for help are being posted online all over the country. Those of us forced onto universal credit are suffering severe hardship and un realistic sanctions aswell as ridiculous call charges to speak to ill informed poorly trained and rude staff who have no idea how to resolve issues with one member of staff admitting that letters requesting information are simply to entice people to call the premium rate telephone number. Restore the benefits system!",
        "background": "An increasing number of customers are suffering severe hardship because of the new system. I myself have been waiting 3 months to be paid. Costs to call the service are ridiculous for those on a low income amd letters are being issued deliberatly encouraging people to waste precious money on calls.",
