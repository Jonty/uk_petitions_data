        "additional_details": "People across the world have been shocked by this act of cruelty that is live streamed by many welfare organisation to raise awareness, e.g. dolphin project, sea shepherd,racing against extinction etc. This year the order book for Taiji is 150 dolphins for captivity, anymore captured will be killed. The world is watching and speaking out against Taiji but Governments continue to ignore their people. We ask, when will someone in power step forward and end this horrific act before its too late.",
        "background": "I've been horrified to learn & witness that every year in Taiji,Japan, dolphins are chased into a small cover and butchered in the most horrific and cruel way imaginable. The hunts are subsidized by the dolphin captivity industry,for a few \"show quality' dolphins that are ripped from their families.",
