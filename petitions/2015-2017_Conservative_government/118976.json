        "additional_details": "An Animal Cruelty Registry is already active in parts of the USA, such as Tennessee, and New York counties Albany, Rockland and Suffolk. The purpose of the registry would be to aid those in the sale or adoption of animals to ensure they are not unknowingly placing them in the hands of someone who has a history of animal abuse. It would only be accessible to the relevant institutions i.e. the police, animal adoption centres/breeders. If abuse is preventable, there is no excuse if it occurs again.",
        "background": "Whilst an animal abuser can be disqualified from future ownership, it is still possible for an offender to simply move out of the area and repurchase an animal. An Animal Cruelty Registry would aid in preventing previous offenders from inflicting such brutality on animals in the future. ",
