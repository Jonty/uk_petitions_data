        "additional_details": "A frigate from the Russian Navy is armed with missiles with a range around 70 miles, leaving the Royal Navy with an insurmountable challenge. In effect our modern fleet bulging with technology is ineffective against ships 30 years their senior.\r\n\r\nMissile technology is readily available for purchase, including a modern \"Harpoon\" missile or the new \"Naval Strike Missile\" developed in Norway. \r\n\r\nOur Navy deserves the protection and ability to strike hard when required in the defence of our liberty.\r\n ",
        "background": "The Royal Navy's \"Harpoon\" ship to ship missiles are now obsolete and will soon be withdrawn from service. The MOD has no funds to purchase new missiles which will leave the billion pound type 45 destroyers with only a 4.5 inch deck gun with a range of 17 miles to engage other ships. ",
