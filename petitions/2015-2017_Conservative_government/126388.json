        "additional_details": "A new law came into effect in October 2014 which gives police the power to prosecute dog owners however I don't believe that this law goes far enough, it should go further and include the option of the removal of the dog from the owner or even the dog being destroyed in extreme cases if a professional body such as the rspca believes the dog is a permanent danger to cats. \r\n",
        "background": "My dearly loved 19 year old pet cat, Chip, was killed by a dog mauling him to death however we were informed that due to my Chip not being classed as 'property' by law, if the victim of this dog had been another dog, pig, goat etc then the police could have prosecuted.\r\n",
