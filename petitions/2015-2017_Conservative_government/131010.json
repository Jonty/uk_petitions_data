        "additional_details": "At present compensation is classed as savings. If a veteran recieves over \u00a36,000, their entitlement to benefit may be affected  (reduced). If a veteran recieves more than \u00a316,000 then they may not be entitled to the benefit at all. \r\n\r\nVeterans should be able to choose how they use their compensaton, and not be turned away for benefits and expected to live off it!\r\n\r\nHelp protect our veterans and their compensaton by signing my petition in support, thankyou :)",
        "background": "If a veteran recieves compensation as a result of an injury caused whilst serving our country - i believe it should be protected and disregarded for benefit entitlement.\r\nRecieving compensation shouldn't effect a veteran claiming benefits inc ESA, JSA and housing when they return to civilian life.",
