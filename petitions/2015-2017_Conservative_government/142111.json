There is now a question of who will now lead us into the future.\r\n\r\nThough the Tories won the last election, the party which was voted for has now ripped itself apart. MP turned on MP and there have been a few of high profile resignations including the PM and IDS. Labour isn't fairing too better.\r\n\r\nWhen the PM eventually steps aside in October there should be a fresh election. That leaves 3 months to prepare.",
        "background": "Under the Fixed Terms Parliament act 2011, the House of a commons can debate an early general election. If the House votes 2/3rds in favour of it, then an election can be called.\r\n\r\nWe ask the government to put forward the motion for an early General Election to the House.",
