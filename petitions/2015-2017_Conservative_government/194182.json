        "additional_details": "Today I was looking for James Blunt tickets. They were on sale for \u00a344 on ticketoligarch but none were available. The website suggested I go to its own secondary ticket website getmein where the cheapest ticket with a face value of \u00a344 was up sale at \u00a3110. If the government make this practice illegal then ordinary fans like myself will be able to afford tickets and have a fair chance at getting hold of the sought after tickets we all want",
        "background": "Ordinary fans of sports and music and other ticketed events are being priced out of the market by tickets being bought up and sold on through secondary ticket sites. It's about time the ordinary fans were thought of and this was made illegal to sell on tickets for profit",
