        "additional_details": "They have well informed opinions due to information resources in school as well as through teaching. They have opinions as equally justified as many adults. These should be heard through voting. In light of the recent referendum to leave the EU, 75% of those under 18 would have voted to remain, however due to current laws they were misrepresented and as a consequence had no say in the national decision, even though it is their future that is being decided.",
        "background": "16 and 17 year olds are treated as responsible and mature people. They have valid opinions that should be listened to among adults. Unjustifiably, these opinions are ignored. They should have the right to be involved in the decision of the future of the nation.",
