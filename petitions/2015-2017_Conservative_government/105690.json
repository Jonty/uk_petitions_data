        "additional_details": "As stated in the provisional findings of the CMA report, 1 in 3 householders failed to switch energy suppliers (Gas/Electricity) which could have saved them a huge amount over time. Why could the government not automatically find the cheapest tariff for individual opt-in consumers based on their usage trends?  After collecting crucial data from opt-in households, dedicated government-managed web software (similar to unbiased comparison websites) could easily fulfil this valuable service.",
        "background": "Hunting low-tariff energy supplier is time-consuming & confusing for many people, yet the government could draw a solution as it has access to all suppliers\u2019 tariffs & trends showing household consumption. With this data, should be easy for government to automatically determine best tariff available",
