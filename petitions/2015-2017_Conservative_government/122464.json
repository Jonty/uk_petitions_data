There was also a recent debate in 2014 when 16-17 year olds voted in the Scottish referendum. I think it's time young people (who this really effects) have the chance to have a say in politics and due to this might actually take note and be interested in political affairs allowing them to make better judgements as they get older",

As in 2014 (in the scotish referendum) I'm hoping to get the young people of our country the right to vote and have a say/voice in our country - Please support our young people!",
