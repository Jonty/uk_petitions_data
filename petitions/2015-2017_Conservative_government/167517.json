        "action": "Establish economic tests to assess readiness for Brexit.",
        "additional_details": "Various attempts have been made to estimate the cost to the UK of Brexit. Such an estimate has to take into account potential loss of trade, inward investment and joint R&D, as well as additional spending on the military, borders, redundancy and pensions, and bureaucracy. This is against the background of record debt (approx. 90% GDP). Parliament should establish metrics for the economic impact of each Brexit scenario (e.g. so-called hard or soft) so that an informed decision can be made.",
        "background": "The decision to leave the European Union will have huge consequences for the United Kingdom. The economic tests that were created to assess readiness for EMU provide a model for taking proper account of the economic consequences prior to notifying the EU of our intention to leave under Article 50.",
