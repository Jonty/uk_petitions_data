        "additional_details": "I think strongly people riding bicycles on a public road should have to pay insurance like anyone else, plus have to take a test like everyone else, People who ride bicycles are unsafe on public roads because alot of them dont know the rules of the road, plus if they cause an accident they cant pay for damages whice is the same as an un-insured driver on the road",
        "background": "I think its unfair that people who drive or ride motorbikes have to pay out so much money for tests, road tax and insurance, when someone can just jump on a bicycle and use the road without knowing the rules of the road and being able to pay out if they cause an accident.",
