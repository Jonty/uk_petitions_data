        "additional_details": "As public servants and representatives of the people, MP's should send information of what they have voted for (on our behalf), so we can decide if we choose to keep them in office. I am aware that this information is in the public domain, but is not readily available to us all. In a society where we celebrate  democracy, the MP's should be happy for us to see what they are doing and allow us to celebrate their achievements by voting them in next time. ",
        "background": "In a time of information and misinformation I propose that MP's send a report to each of their constituents outlying which bills they have voted for, against or abstained. Their attendance in office and parliament and their expenses. ",
