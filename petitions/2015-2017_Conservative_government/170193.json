        "additional_details": "The promise was made by several members of the Cabinet: Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom and the Development Secretary Priti Patel. Despite the promise of \u00a3350 million p/w they repeat \"Brexit means Brexit\".The Chancellor has to accept the verdict of the British people and include in his Autumn Statement the most visible promise made and spend \u00a3350 million a week on the NHS. This funding will be made as soon as money becomes available after leaving the EU \r\n",
        "background": "A pledge made to provide funds into the National Health Service, which was made by the Leave Campaign during the EU referendum, has now been abandoned by the Brexiteers. Not to honor this commitment is nothing less than betraying the wishes of the British people. \r\n",
