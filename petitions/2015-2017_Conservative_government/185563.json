More importantly where is everyone going to park? This will cause chaos in Bishops Stortford.\r\n\r\nWe must put a stop to this development so the commuters who use this car park can continue to do so.\r\n\r\nInstead, build a new multi-stores car park before any new developments take place. Like they've done at Harlow train station",
