        "background": "Government is rushing through the sale of RBS shares at a massive \u00a313bn loss to taxpayers. We own 79% of RBS. Rather than selling off these shares to city traders who want business as usual; the government should be reforming the bank; waiting to sell the shares at a profit so the nation benefits.",
