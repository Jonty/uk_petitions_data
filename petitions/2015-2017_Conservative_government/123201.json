Many girls in our secondary school wish to have the chance to play rugby and football in PE. We understand that there are school clubs and local clubs for girls for predominantly male sports but most of us have other commitments and do not have the time to attend these clubs and we wish to have the chance to play these sports in PE.",

As much as it is sexist towards girls, some boys would enjoy trying dance, netball, rounders etc. Can this be changed?",
