        "additional_details": "Obviously we cannot enforce any ban on him becoming leader, but if this petition gets anywhere, we would at least be letting the party know how people feel about the possibility him becoming Prime Minister. After all, they will not put a leader in place who does not have the support of the public.

        "background": "Considering his strong public support of brexit and high profile within the party, it's highly likely that he will take over as party leader, a prospect that I cannot bear, this buffoon is not capable of saving our nation from the turmoil we have plunged ourselves into as a result of brexit.
