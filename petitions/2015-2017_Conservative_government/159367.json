        "additional_details": "Opinion polls and anecdotal evidence tell us that many did not foresee the consequences of \"Brexit\" for their jobs, for pensions, for inflation, for holiday costs and for freedom of travel. They now have new insight into the costs of \"Brexit\". We need to assure Members of Parliament through this petition that they would be in tune with popular opinion if they refused to activate Article 50, and possibly waited until after a new UK general election before deciding to go ahead with \"Brexit\".",
        "background": " For Britain to leave the EU, the government must activate Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. We ask that the government to allow a free vote in parliament to decide whether Article 50 should be activated, now or later. At 52-48 the recent referendum was too indecisive to justify \"Brexit now\".",
