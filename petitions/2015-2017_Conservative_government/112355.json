        "action": "Change the law on men being sexually assaulted to rape with the same convictions",
        "additional_details": "By law men can't be raped. Even though they go through the same traumatic experience as women it's only 'sexual assault'. \r\nSo a man or woman convicted of this crime will get a much lower sentence than when the victim is female.\r\nA male needs an erection but they could be drugged or just get them easily that doesn't mean they consent it's a body's reaction to stimulation which can't be controlled.\r\nTherefore I believe the law and sentencing should be the same for men and women under similar events.",
        "background": "I know of men who have men raped and won't come forward as 1 it's not always taken seriously and 2 they won't get the justice they deserve as by law men can only be sexually assaulted.\r\nSex without consent is rape it doesn't matter what gender you are.",
