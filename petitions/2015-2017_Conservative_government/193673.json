        "action": "Establish a cross-party Constitutional Convention on European membership.",
        "additional_details": "Scotland successfully used a Constitutional Convention to determine 'the settled will of the people' on the matter of devolution. This should have been the UK's approach to BREXIT, but wasn't. Now, we must build consensus, taking account of the concerns of citizens from all four nations, young and old, living here and abroad. And we urgently need to agree which principles and values, which individual and collective rights will be safeguarded in any forthcoming negotiations with Europe. ",
        "background": "The BREXIT referendum was a crude method of gauging political opinion. The outcome has been highly divisive. We now need a more sophisticated mechanism for determining what our relationship with Europe should be. We cannot leave this in the hands of a single political faction.",
