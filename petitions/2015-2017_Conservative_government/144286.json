        "additional_details": "Notably the Boris Battlebus with \u00a3350 million a week going to the EU was wrong. Brexiters now admit there will be no immediate immigration drop or controls and the Mayor of Calais wants all migrants to be sent to Dover without delay. Exiting the EU has already caused financial damage with threats to jobs imminent and work prospects for the younger generation being threatened.",
        "background": "The leave campaigners admitted immediately after the result that much of their information was completely wrong. We the undersigned demand a new fact based EU referendum without the misleading rhetoric.",
