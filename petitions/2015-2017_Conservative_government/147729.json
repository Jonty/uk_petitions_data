It fuelled race-based discrimination.\r\nWe demand public apology of UK Government and recognize us as British citizens to stop a torrent of racism unleashed by EU referendum.\r\n",
        "background": "We EU immigrants are hardworking people who want to contribute to the community and we refuse to be portrayed in demeaning light as scroungers. \r\nWe come to work here and pay our taxes. We contribute a huge amount to the UK. We do pay in more than we take out.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
