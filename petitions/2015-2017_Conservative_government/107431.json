Helen has been threatened with 1 month prison away from her family if she does not pay 4000\u20ac by October 2015 when no criminal offence has been committed. EU, UK and French laws were ignored. Evidence was not taken into account and Human rights were totally ignored! As a Veteran of 10 years, Helen deserves better! ",
