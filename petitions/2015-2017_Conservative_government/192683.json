        "additional_details": "This petition is to review.\r\n\r\nWestminster was attacked this week and PC Palmer was killed in his frontline duty. We need to ask ourselves why was he unarmed and what could of happened if plain cloths officers were not at the seine when the attack happened. \r\n\r\nShould Westminster Bridge have Road protection at such a prominent site to prevent further fatalities from road vehicles. \r\n\r\nHow could an attacker breach the outer gates.\r\n\r\nOur thoughts are we those that lost their lives this week.",
        "background": "This weeks Westminster attacks clearly show that police need to carry firearms at high risk sites across the U.K. PC Keith Palmer was unarmed at one of the most sensitive sites in our country. A review is urgently needed to protect police and provide effective means to defend against attacks. ",
