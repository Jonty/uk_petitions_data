        "additional_details": "I understand from Internet posts, people in residential care are liable to income tax and in this area it costs \u00a31350 per week to live in a good care home (no such thing as an excellent care home) and it is \u00a3950 per week for a bad care home! When I spoke to a person from DWP, she confirmed there is no tax exemption. Dad like many of his generation has savings, because he worked from age 14, did not smoke or drink, no holidays abroad and did not spend on his house which is now in disrepair.",
        "background": "My father has an income of c\u00a312000 pa from pensions he paid into from age 14. He is now a 95 year old, disabled war veteran who pays\u00a316350 for care 3 x a day, so he can stay in his own home. In addition he has running costs for his house,constant central heating set at 21 degrees, council tax, food.",
