Stripping them for parts would be far more beneficial to the environment.",

The Government does not have the power to compel private companies or individuals to sell/save end of life vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe Government 2009 vehicle scrappage scheme ended in 2010. When a sale was agreed through the scrappage scheme, the dealer was responsible for disposing of the old vehicle through authorised treatment facilities (ATFs). Once a vehicle is handed over to an officially recognised scrappage yard it is up to that ATF to decide whether to repair and sell the vehicle or to completely scrap it.\r\n\r\nAs you noted in your petition the Government stated at the time of the scrappage scheme that it would only approve or make payment on a transaction under the scrappage scheme where a Certificate of Destruction on the old car had been issued (see: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090721/text/90721w0150.htm#09072344004168).  \r\n\r\nIn relation to the destruction of classic cars under the 2009 scrappage scheme, the Government Minister at the time confirmed that it was up to the owners of a vehicle to decide what to do with their own property (see: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090721/text/90721w0150.htm#09072344004168"
