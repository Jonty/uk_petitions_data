        "action": "Provide income tax relief and remove insurance premium tax on health insurance.",
        "additional_details": "There is currently no financial incentive for individuals or organisations to take out private health care insurance.The NHS is left to pick up all the workloads and costs of large numbers of the uk population who would by choice move into private sector health care provision if the cost of premiums were lowered by incentives. This would rapidly reduce the demand on NHS services across the uk now and for the foreseeable future and stimulate growth and investment in private health care provision.",
        "background": "The affordability and rapid uptake in the number of individuals and employing organisations taking out private health insurance across the uk would immediately ease the current pressure on the NHS. There would also be a rapid growth of private sector health care in the uk providing economic benefit.",
