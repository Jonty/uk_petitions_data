        "additional_details": "This petition recognises that the purpose of the recent referendum was to advise HM Government and Parliament about whether the UK should remain or leave the European Union (EU). The final decision properly rests with our democratically elected representatives through a full debate and vote in the House of Commons. \r\n\r\nWe ask Parliament to take into account all available evidence in reaching a balanced decision: the effect of mis-information (e.g. immigration, NHS funding etc.) during the referendum campaigns on voting; the legitimate concerns of the UK population; the impact on our economy, social cohesion, the environment and security; and prospects for European Union reform in the wake of the UK referendum.\r\n",
        "background": "We the undersigned call on our democratically elected representatives in Parliament to vote on whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union, prior to action by HM Government triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to commence the withdrawal process.",
