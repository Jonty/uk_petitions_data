For example, Green Day tickets went on sale for between \u00a355 and \u00a373 per ticket on Ticketmaster 9am 09/09/2016 and instantly most tickets were sold. However there was over 150 tickets for each UK show available for \u00a3120 and above per ticket on Ticketmaster's sister site, Get Me In. ",
