        "additional_details": "If the fee cannot be reduced to the (still excessive) \u00a33250 mark, then we demand transparency from the institutions. They should disclose a) where our \u00a39250 goes every year - every single pound of it; and b) what has changed since 2010, causing them to require an additional \u00a36000 from every student, every year. \r\n",
        "background": "in 2010 the university tuition fee cap was \u00a33250, however 2010 saw a rise to \u00a39000, and 2017 has seen a further rise to \u00a39250. These should be reduced back to \u00a33250 to ensure fair access to university, and to avoid crippling debt upon graduation. \r\n",
