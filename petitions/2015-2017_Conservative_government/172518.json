        "additional_details": "Just like having to sit your theory and your practical test to obtain a driving license, Cyclists should have to do the same. What training have they had to use the road safely?\r\n\r\nInsurance, if a cyclist throws him/herself into the back of a stationary motor vehicle... Who's to blame? Not the cyclist... The driver of the motor vehicle would have to pay their own excess to repair the damage.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nGraham \r\n",
        "background": "The public roads built for motor vehicles are becoming unsafe to use due to one particular community that feel they are eligible to drive on public UK roads.\r\n\r\nNot only that these cyclists posses no insurance for their chosen 2 wheeled non mechanical death trap, neither do they pay road tax. \r\n\r\n",
