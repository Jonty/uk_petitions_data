        "additional_details": "As of the 17th March 2016: 328,550 people had called for a vote of no confidence in Jeremy Hunt. This is in addition to numerous protests and strikes his disastrous, demoralising ministership has generated. The Petitions Committees (PC) existing rules, are unable to act on a request for a vote of no confidence. Allowing the PC broader scope to cover such matters would increase the democratic accountability of ministers by allowing the people to call on Parliament to debate the competence of MPs.",
        "background": "Jeremy Hunt has repeatedly given unfounded medical advice, disrespted the healthcare service, coined \"the Hunt effect\" due to his disastrous mishandling of A&E admission data. But despite an overwhelming call for a vote of no confidence there is no mechanism for his removal. There really should be!",
