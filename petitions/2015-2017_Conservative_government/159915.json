        "additional_details": "The UK continues to pay the EU at least \u00a3250 m every week, until we officially leave the EU. So, every extra week of delay in triggering Article 50 is unnecessarily costing UK tax payers money that could be spent on other things. \r\n\r\nBy the time the new Prime Minister is installed, this Government will have willfully wasted at least \u00a33 Billion, simply by delaying the implementation of Article 50.  \r\n\r\nHow can the Government afford to waste so much money, yet claim we must still live in austerity?",
        "background": "On page 14 of the EU Referendum booklet \"Why the Government believes that voting to remain in the European Union is the best decision for the UK\" it says: \r\n\r\n\"This is your decision. The Government will implement what you decide.\"  \r\n\r\nWhy then, hasn't Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty been triggered?",
