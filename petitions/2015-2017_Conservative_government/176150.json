        "action": "Introduce a phased ban on multiple point fishing hooks for all leisure angling",
        "additional_details": "Leisure angling is one of our biggest recreational pastimes. Whether as a requirement or personal preference, fish should be returned to the water quickly and unharmed. Whilst conservation measures, including a ban on lead weights, help to protect native fish and other wildlife, leisure angling\u2019s use of multiple point hooks remains its Achilles heel. Removal is more time consuming, increases fish stress and the likelihood of harm or death. There are no grounds for defending multiple point hooks.",
        "background": "For future generations, the welfare and conservation of all native fish species will benefit from a phased UK ban on multiple point hooks for all leisure (sea, coarse and game) angling. This petition proposes to change government policy, restricting anglers to using one single fishing hook per rod.",
