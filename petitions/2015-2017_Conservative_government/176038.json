        "additional_details": "This site is perfect for new businesses, with access to the station as well as supporting industries in the surrounding area.\r\nExisting centres of innovation (The University and Business parks) could be sources of collaboration.\r\nErnst and Young forecasts Reading to be the fastest growing local economy in the UK, making this a pivotal moment in Reading's economic future.\r\nThe prison site will enable a diverse range of new businesses to develop, further spreading Reading\u2019s prosperity.",
        "background": "This petition proposes the multiuse development of Reading Prison. The Grade II-listed building would be used as a \u2018Business Incubator\u2019 where start-up companies share communal infrastructure but operate within a designated space themselves. The remaining site would be a residential development.",
