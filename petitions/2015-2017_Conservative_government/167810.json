        "additional_details": "Because the sport is run by people who own the clubs, decisions and rules are made individually to suit their needs, and what will make them make more money or save them loosing money. \r\n\r\nThe pay and working conditions for riders are very poor, this is not what fans pay to see.",
        "background": "Currently Speedway is run by the British Speedway Promotors Association, however we feel that this body of people are not running the Speedway sport in the interest of the riders or the fans, this is because the body of people are formed by the speedway promotors who own the clubs.",
