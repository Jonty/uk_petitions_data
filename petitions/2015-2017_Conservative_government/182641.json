        "additional_details": "No less than 2 minutes after tickets for Ed Sheeran's latest tour went on sale they were available for resale at 3x face value on Get Me In. The government needs to act now to make it law that tickets can only be sold on at face value or less. Twickets is a great example of how things should be done.",
        "background": "Time and time again genuine fans are missing out on getting tickets to concerts for their favourite artists and bands because touts buy them up in bulk and sell them at up to 5x face value on sites like Get Me In and Viagogo. This prevents genuine fans seeing acts they love.",
