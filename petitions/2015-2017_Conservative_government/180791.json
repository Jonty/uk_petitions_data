        "additional_details": "Stamp Duty & the reduction in interest relief has made investment in residential property much less favourable, the result, less investment in BuytoLet (BTL) properties and landlords have been selling existing stock ahead of the changes.\r\n\r\nThis reduction in stock and the high demand, will inevitably lead to  rent increases.\r\n\r\nIncentivise investment by exempting Stamp Duty on all property let to the public sector for a 5 years term, long term landlords should benefit from enhanced interest relief",
        "background": "Growing shortage of affordable property to rent.\r\n\r\nIncentivise Landlords to rent to the public sector for a minimum of 5 years below market rates, in return for tax and duty relief.\r\n\r\nAlso introduce enhanced Interest Relief for long term Landlords committing to a 10 year or more investment term.",
