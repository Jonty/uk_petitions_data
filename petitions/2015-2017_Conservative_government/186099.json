        "additional_details": "John Major started the NHS PFI's and Blair/Brown continued to use them as a way to build hospitals with no cost to the government. The cost is being born by the NHS, on which these contacts were forced, and it is our money that is being used to pay off the eye watering interest payments. ",
        "background": "PFI's raised by previous governments means that the NHS is paying off enormous interest at rates agreed by those governments and not by the NHS. Our taxes which should be going to the NHS are being used to pay off these interests instead of being used to cure the patients.",
