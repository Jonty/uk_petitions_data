        "action": "Legislate to guarantee EU citizens already living in the UK the right to stay.",
        "additional_details": "Many UK citizens who have moved to another EU country, such as my brother-in-law, have settled and have families in their adopted country. The same is true of EU citizens who have settled in the UK;  I know many who have married UK citizens and settled in the UK and have families. Surely it cannot be the wish of the UK to break up these families?  The UK government needs to sit down urgently with other EU governments to obtain agreement that their citizens already moved can remain.",
        "background": "The UK has voted to leave the EU.  \r\nThree million citizens of the EU currently live or work in the UK, and a million and a half UK citizens live in other EU countries. All moved in good faith and legally and before the referendum. We are asking that they continue to enjoy these rights.",
