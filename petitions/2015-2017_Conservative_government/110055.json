        "action": "Change Building regulations to include a renewable energy source for new homes.",
        "additional_details": "This would be easy to implement and cost the tax payer nothing. The additional building cost would be relatively minor and would be offset by reduced energy bills and selling excess power produced back to the national grid in line with the governments current scheme. Solar panels produce roughly enough power for 2 households needs. If most homes produced enough power to cover their own needs we would only need enough power stations to cover industry and high periods of high consumption.\r\n",
        "background": "Building all new homes with solar panels,wind turbines, etc. would increase green energy in the U.K, reduce household energy bills and make us less reliant on out-dated, environmentally unfriendly energy sources, e.g. coal, fracking and importing energy from other countries, e.g. gas from Russia.",
