        "additional_details": "My dad has Dementia - he's disregarded for council tax. \r\nSo am I - I provide 35 hours of care per week. \r\nIf everyone is exempt the bill is cut by 50%. \r\nHowever, mum isn't disregarded because she's his wife.\r\nA person living alone with dementia pays no council tax at all. \r\nSurely it's safer for them to have a carer there? \r\nBut then they get taxed.\r\nMany of the elderly have to pay or provide care and pay their tax too. \r\nA caring society would call time on tax for elderly carers.",
        "background": "Reforms to treat spouses and partners in the same way as any other family member or individual, allowing them to reduce their council tax bill accordingly. Additionally, remove pensioners who care for a partner from council tax altogether.",
