        "additional_details": "Inmates rehabilitation is not to the standards that they could be. Inmates need guidance. The ratio of inmates per staff member is unreasonable. Thus, staff suffer and potentially risk their safety. Prison staff are over-worked and not paid enough in light of the work that they undertake. Inmates are often not in receipt of adequate care. The lack of rehabilitation of offenders affects all parts of our society. It is time to stop ignoring inmates and staff members needs.  ",
        "background": "Prison staff are unable to cope with the safe running of our prisons. Staff and inmates safety must be priority. Promises of more staff have not been fulfilled. More training is needed for prison roles. Health and safety practice is poor. Begin a public enquiry. In the meantime; bring in our Army.",
