        "additional_details": "I want action to support young people have a real alternative to Uni, not be taken advantage of & not even learning, just doing a job. On \u00a3110 per week, I spend \u00a360.80 on travel & \u00a310 housekeeping,left with \u00a340. Why should I leave a 7am & get back at 7pm for a profit of \u00a340 a week. On Jobseekers I would be on \u00a357.90! With no stress or travel, I thought the government was encouraging work! Being in a dead-end apprenticeship doesn't help either,theres no room to work you way up. Just a waste time.",
        "background": "The government is constantly talking about how many apprenticeships they have created,but are putting the quantity over quality. After starting mine about year ago,I see how flawed the system is how employers take advantage & get no help on travel. Personally I would be \u00a317.90 better off on benefits",
