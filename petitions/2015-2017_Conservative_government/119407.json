Service personnel act under mandate and management of the British government and as such we believe that this 'management' must be held responsible and not the service personnel.\r\n2. We believe this organisation is a waste of tax payers money. The armed services have their own investigatory powers and as such this organisation is not required and has essentially achieved very little.",
