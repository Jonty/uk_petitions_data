        "action": "Improve the social welfare safety net for people fleeing domestic abuse",
        "additional_details": "There is an alarming lack of support for people fleeing domestic abuse, especially women/families. This manifests the deprivation that families often experience moving out from an abuser or from a shelter.\r\n\r\n\"The threat of poverty is often described as being \u2018among the most formidable'\" barriers (NOWLDEF, 2002:1) from leaving toxic - in some cases deadly - situations with serious consequences. This hole in the social safety net is short-sighted in both its financial and societal implications.",
        "background": "Domestic abuse is a horrific situation for anyone to find themselves in & especially difficult for anyone who has to make decisions not just about their wellbeing but for children in their care. 2 women are killed weekly in the UK-if people feel they can leave safely this number may be reduced.\r\n\r\n",
