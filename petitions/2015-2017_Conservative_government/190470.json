I had struggled with my sexuality probably all my life up until that point. Understandably we both want to move on, however current legislation prohibits us from divorcing based on grounds of my sexuaility and the fact I had sexual intercourse with someone else of the same sex. ",
        "background": "Under grounds for divorce, adultery is currently defined as your husband or wife having sexual intercourse with someone else of the opposite sex. The law recognises the act of adultery as sexual intercourse between a man and a woman. This is dated and discriminatory.",
