        "additional_details": " A distinction needs to be made between personal care provision and child care. Personal one to one care is extremely expensive (11-20 per hours) when compared to the cost of child care (3.50 - 6 per hour). Personal care is also on a one to one basis where older children with special education would benefit more from the extra social interaction, after schools groups can provide. This lack of provision leads to an increased likelihood in benefit dependency and social exclusion. ",
        "background": "This is a call for the government to review child care provision for older children, aged 11-18 with special educational needs. Due to the lack of childcare provision for secondary school aged children many parents are forced to reduce their hours or leave work all together. ",
