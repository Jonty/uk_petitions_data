Income tax is a tax paid by individuals, and is also paid by people who work in the public sector, so we are not sure what the link between income tax and government ownership of businesses would be. \r\n\r\nIf you mean that you would like corporation tax (the tax that businesses pay) to be abolished, and all companies brought into government ownership, then you could start a petition about that.\r\n\r\nIt might help if you gave a bit more explanation of your idea in the text of your petition, so that Government or Parliament can understand it better."
