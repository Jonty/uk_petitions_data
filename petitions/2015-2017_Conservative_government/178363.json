        "additional_details": "New schools are funded for bursaries on the assumption that 36% of students will be eligible, this is the national average. A higher level of deprivation area such as Newham will have a higher percentage that will need support whereas a Sixth from/College/Universities in an affluent area will have hardly any that need support. So, therefore, educational facilities in deprived areas must spread a small amount amongst many students, while educational institutions in affluent areas have more money than they need, which is not fair they should fund based on local needs, not the national average and in special cases fund specific students a lot more.
