        "action": "The government and parliament must not invoke Article 50 of the EU Lisbon Treaty",
        "additional_details": "For various reasons it would be irresponsible and a failure of government/parliament to proceed with the UK leaving the EU such that Article 50 must not be invoked:\r\nReferendum result too close to be taken as clear mandate for UK to leave EU.\r\nVoter turnout/demographics leave views of many unrepresented by overall result.\r\nExtent of misinformation from leave campaigners ahead of referendum.\r\nNegative impacts of UK leaving EU have become clear post-referendum.\r\nPeople regret voting for UK to leave EU.",
        "background": "The EU Referendum Act 2015, and the result of the referendum 23rd June 2016, give no legal obligation for the UK government to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and begin a process of the UK leaving the EU.  For numerous reasons (see below) this petition calls for Article 50 to not be invoked.",
