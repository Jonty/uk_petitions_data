        "additional_details": "The UK Government must allow all its citizens to believe or not believe in any religion they choose and not be subject to preaching from others. \r\nThese preachers publicly shame and condone others for living their lives as they wish and should not be heard on our streets.\r\nThis does not restrict the right to free speech as there are many faith zones where they can meet others and speak about their beliefs with those that share them.",
        "background": "Individuals/groups take it upon themselves to publicly preach their religion and messages of damnation and condemnation of others for their actions. This creates hostility in our streets and needs to stop!\r\n\r\nLet's move this country towards an enlightened and civilised world without religion.",
