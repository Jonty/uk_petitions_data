        "action": "Bring back 05 armed forces pensions. New employment model for new recruits only",
        "additional_details": "People join the armed forces for what is available at the time that includes the benefits and obviously the pension. This enabled people to start a fresh career after 22 years of service with a pension to help the transition. The contract should simply not be thrown out especially as members serving have no say in the matter. The new employment model is a betrayal on our armed forces just abandoning them after 22 years to go and start again at something completely different in life without support untill normal retirement age.",
        "background": "Armed forces pensions should not be altered from what people sign up for. Getting half way through your career and then to have the contract essentially ripped up is unacceptable.",
