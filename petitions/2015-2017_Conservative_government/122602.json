        "additional_details": "My own experience I am having a severely hard time at the minute trying to get my SEN child who should be attending a special needs school in September we are constantly been pushed away from our chosen school from our current LA because it's in the next LA even though the school is more suited to our daughter she loved it there on an open day and it is 1.3 mile away from home. No one from the LA is willing to help despite it being our request of school it's wrong and it needs to be adjusted",
        "background": "Because parents find it increasingly difficult to choose a school under another authority even if that school is closer to the child's home. There is not enough done to support patents especially if non of the schools in the child's current LA are suitable or not where you wish your child to go.",
