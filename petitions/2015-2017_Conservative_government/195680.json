        "additional_details": "It has been recently agreed in Supreme Court that disruption to the education of our children by removing them from school for even half a day is unacceptable (ref:Isle of Wight Council v Platt) yet the standard practice of using educational establishments as polling stations will cause unnecessary chaos to millions of students and parents / guardians at short notice if the snap general election goes ahead on June 8th 2017.",
        "background": "The government's call for a snap general election on June 8th 2017 will require a significant number of schools to close to students for the day with additional associated disruption to many parents who may need to take annual leave in order to look after children unable to attend school.",
