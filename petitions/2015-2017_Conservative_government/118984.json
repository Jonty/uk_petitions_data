But - and there is always a but, it's still the academic pathway that has the higher status. We should have alternate pathways that allow all students to succeed in what they want to do. The solution would be more rigorous vocational subjects to be offered alongside or as  alternatives to GCSE's but still have equal weighting on progress 8. \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "At the moment there is the EBACC consultation that requires students to be studying this pathway from 2020  Whilst academic, this is narrow and does not encourage our \"creators\" and \"doers\" that may later on be our Electricians, Builders, Plumbers, Carpenters, Digital Media experts, Artists etc.",
