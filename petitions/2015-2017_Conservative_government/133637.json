        "action": "Don't Hold a General Election on account of result of EU Referendum",
        "additional_details": "Uncertainty over the outcome of the EU Referendum already had a significant impact on the UK economy prior to this vote, with foreign direct investment being put on hold as well as stock markets and sterling becoming increasingly volatile. Now a vote to leave has prolonged this period of uncertainty and is likely to have a significant short term economic impact. It is vital that a General Election is not called to ensure that the financial fallout of Brexit is not prolonged for UK households. ",
        "background": "The UK has now entered a period of unparalleled uncertainty and this uncertainty is the biggest threat to continuing UK financial stability. \r\nFinancial markets are already unsettled as it is, and a General Election would prolong the uncertainty and economic fallout of Brexit, at everyone's expense.",
