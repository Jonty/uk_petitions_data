        "additional_details": "Republican and Democrat nominees have previously visited London ahead of US elections and been welcomed by successive governments.\r\nIn a campaign statement, Mr Trump advocated a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\", a proposal the White House said was contrary to US values and its national security interests.\r\nIn his candidacy announcement Trump referred to Mexican immigrants to the US as rapists. \r\nHe should not be afforded a platform in the halls of UK democracy.\r\n",

In response to his racist comments, this petition acknowledges his right to travel here but calls on the UK government not to permit him to set foot on crown property such as the Palace of Westminster or 10 Downing Street.
