        "action": "Offer a unilateral guarantee of the rights of EU citizens in the UK post Brexit",
        "additional_details": "No human being deserves to be used a pawn in negotiations between nations.  We have the opportunity to set a positive tone as we engage in Brexit negotiations.  No one seriously believes that a reciprocal offer will not be made; but it's hard for the EU to move fast. \r\n\r\nThe UK doesn't have to wait.  These people are our friends, neighbours, colleagues and lovers.  Let's make it clear the kind of nation that we want to be.",
        "background": "More than 900,000 EU citizens are resident in the UK; making a positive contribution to our dynamic, multi-cultural society.  Offering a unilateral guarantee of their rights, without waiting for a reciprocal guarantee will demonstrate to our EU partners our good faith in Brexit negotiations.",
