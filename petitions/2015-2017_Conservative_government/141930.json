        "action": "Keep the UK in the single market and continue to allow free movement of people",
        "additional_details": "The single market has obviously benefitted the UK economically. Freedom of movement, one of the four freedoms of the single market, is also a basic human right.\r\n\r\nImmigration to the UK has had a positive effect on our country. Keeping the borders open means people can continue to work and contribute in this great country and make it even better. And the people of the UK can continue to travel and contribute in the rest of Europe.",
        "background": "On 23 June 2016 the people of the UK decided that European integration had gone too far.\r\n\r\nHowever we believe that the UK must continue to be part of the single market and continue to allow free movement of people.",
