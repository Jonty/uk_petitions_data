        "additional_details": "Recently Brighton and Hove have been aggressively creating new areas of pay and display zones and permit holders only parking. This causes a knock on effect for residents in nearby areas without these zones as people are forced to park there instead. Recent areas that have had these zones placed are: Fiveways, Ditchling Road, Stanford Avenue, Preston Drove, Hollingbury Road, Coleman street, Milton Road... The aim of this petition is to force Brighton and hove to lift these parking restrictions.",
        "background": "Brighton and hove council in their infinite wisdom have decided to expand pay and display zones while also expanding permit holders only parking spaces. This has affected local businesses and working people the hardest.",
