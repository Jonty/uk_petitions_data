Rents didn't rise any more than they did in the rest of the UK, and now it's easier than ever for Scottish people to move properties when needed. \r\n\r\nIf we are going to move towards a 'generation rent' then we must strengthen the rights of renters and cut down on predatory practices whereby letting agents can charge tenants whatever they want because they have a monopoly on a given property. ",
        "background": "Letting agents charge 'referencing fees' that are completely and utterly arbitrary. They range from \u00a380-400 per person depending on where you're house hunting, however the actual cost of referencing is \u00a315-30 via dedicated services that letting agencies use. It should be the landlords that pay.  ",
