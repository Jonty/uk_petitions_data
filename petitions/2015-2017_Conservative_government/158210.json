        "additional_details": "News papers such as The Sun are owned by foreign companies & nationals, repeatedly we see headlines that are misleading or wrong & may sway the electorate.  When those falsehoods are proven to be inaccurate they print a small retraction inside the publication & carry on as normal.  In the EU referendum misquoted figures for immigration & spending could have influenced voters.",
        "background": "Recent events such as the Election & EU Referendum have shown undue influences from newspapers under foreign ownership.  Those owners may have their own interests at heart & show undue political bias towards parties which may put financial incentives above the best interests of the British people.\r\n",
