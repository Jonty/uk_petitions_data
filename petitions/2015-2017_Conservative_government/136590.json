        "additional_details": "To maintain freedom of expression we propose the code of conduct be applied to all written material and to broadcasts where there is no immediate ability to challenge a statement.\r\n\r\nWe petition that all statements made in both written and broadcast material meet the following criteria:\r\nStatements implied as fact should be truthful, evidence based and responsible and not misleading or inflame or incite fear or hatred.   Statements that are based on opinion should be clearly indicated as such.",
        "background": "Since 1999 party political advertising has been outside any code of conduct and is unregulated. The content of some written and broadcast material from both sides in the recent referendum would breach the Advertising Standards Authority's code of practice if it applied to political parties.",
