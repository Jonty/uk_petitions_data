For many however this is not the case and even when on this medicating we continue to suffer symptoms or medication side effects. Many sufferers report greater benefits from taking Natural dessicated thyroxine but due to cost it is not easily available on the NHS. Why should we suffer when an alternative is available!",
        "background": "Most newly diagnosed sufferers of Under Active Thyroid will automatically be prescribed Synthetic Thyroxine. When blood test redults show that TSH and T4 levels have stabilised they are 'fixed' and can continue normally with life. Many of us continue to suffer daily when an alternative is out there.",
