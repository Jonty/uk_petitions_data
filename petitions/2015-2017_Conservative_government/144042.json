        "additional_details": "There are many people who voted leave on Thursday who have now realised it was the wrong decision. There are also many people who voted leave who are uninformed as to the consequences of this decision. The decision to leave or stay should be made by people who fully understand the impact that \"remain\" or \"leave\" would have on the UK. \r\n\r\nDavid Allen Green (Financial Times Analyst) explains \"that no legal provision was included in the EU referendum legislation that requires the UK Parliament to act in accordance with the outcome of the referendum.\" He also states that \"The government could decide to put the matter to Parliament and then hope to win the vote\"\r\n",
        "background": "The EU referendum we had on Thursday is advisory, non binding and can be overruled. Therefore, I am asking MPs to make an informed decision on whether to stay or leave the EU by voting in parliament and overruling Thursdays outcome. \r\n",
