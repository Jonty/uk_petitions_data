        "additional_details": "The EEA has the same free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, meaning free trade and the ability to live, work, and study in any EU/EEA state. EEA states naturally have to adopt part of EU Law relevant to the Single Market, which they also help formulate and influence.\r\nAgriculture and fisheries are not covered by the EEA, so we would revert to our own national fishing quotas.\r\nEEA states don't bear the financial burdens of EU membership except mainly for access to the Single Market.",
        "background": "Ok, so 52% of us voted out, but 48% of us wanted to retain all the current advantages of EU membership\r\nThe EEA consists of the EU plus Iceland, Norway and little Liechtenstein. They have most of the advantages, without the big payments, fishery quotas, and political dominance. Sound good?",
