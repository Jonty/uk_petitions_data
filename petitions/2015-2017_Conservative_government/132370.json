The audit is published here:\r\n\r\nhttp://therealjunktoothproject.org/news/\r\n\r\nWe engaged with local people in need of help. \r\n\r\nWe have worked with The Real Junk Food Project Dewsbury CIC to engage with people who we are 'recruiting to eat food'. If they can't afford to eat, they can't afford private healthcare to sort out teeth. \r\n\r\nWe need a people focused response and positive action. ",
