        "action": "Following the Brexit referendum result, a General Election should be called",
        "additional_details": "Almost all political parties were divided on the EU referendum debate. There is no cross-party consensus on what happens next and the type of relationship the UK wishes to have with Europe going forward. The current Government's manifesto was costed based on the assumption of a remain victory. Now that the Brexit result is confirmed, this manifesto and its commitments are effectively worthless. It is therefore no longer democratic to govern based upon it and a General Election should take place.",
        "background": "By calling a General Election, the UK public can decide:\r\n- The type of Brexit that they want. \r\n- The type of relationship with Europe that should be negotiated\r\n- The leadership team that should undertake that negotiation.",
