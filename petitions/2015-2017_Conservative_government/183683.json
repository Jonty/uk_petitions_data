        "additional_details": "I want to start this petition to reflect the change in circumstances to a defendant.  It is not a petition to cease payments of maintenance but to allow the UK courts the power to overule that of a foreign government when requesting payments deemed too high or unfair.  My own circumstance is that I am a carer for my partner and 3 children, in receipt of carers allowance and income support.  The amount I have been ordered to pay would leave us in serious need.",
        "background": "I have received a reciprocal maintenance order from Poland stating I must pay \u00a3192 per month plus arrears.  My ex wife, took my daughter to Poland and I paid an amount each week/month which was fair.  However, I am in receipt of benefits now and the order should consider this.",
