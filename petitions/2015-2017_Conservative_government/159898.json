        "additional_details": "This may be considered as an amendment to the Fixed Term Parliaments Act. \r\n\r\nCurrent debate regarding the trigger of Article 50 for withdrawal of the EU is perhaps a good example of a decision beginning a time restricted process. It may be a similar such process could be applied, for example a PM resignation triggers a process during which the newly elected PM must call a General Election within 1 year of taking up post.",
        "background": "This petition is about democracy and no single political issue.\r\n\r\nIt is our view that should an incumbent Government Leader resign as Prime Minister and Leader of their party, this should trigger a General Election within a pre-defined period of time.",
