        "additional_details": "That\u2019s 270 thousand people every three hour peak right on the corner of Frith Street and Shaftesbury Avenue.  \r\n\r\nWe do not oppose CrossRail 2.  However, we oppose any decision to include Soho in the scheme.  \r\n\r\nI have supported the Save Soho movement since it began and have assisted Tim Arnold and the Save Soho group whenever possible. \r\n\r\nPlease join us by signing this petition for yours and our Soho.\r\n\r\nStephen Fry, chairman of Save Soho",
        "background": "The future of Soho could change dramatically this coming June when we anticipate the transport minister announcing the approval of CrossRail 2. It will allow the demolition of two blocks for a new train station that will bring double the footfall of Kings Cross Underground into and around Soho.\u00a0 ",
