        "additional_details": "The votes should be added on to the original totals and interpreted in the decision of whether to leave or stay in the European Union for the sake of the people of the United kingdom. We think this because the more information has been released after the original vote had taken place, and this information could alter the opinions of the undecided UK residents.",
        "background": "In the referendum only 72% of people voted for what to happen to the country, we believe that these people who might not have understood the circumstances should have the right to vote now. We are not asking for another referendum but for a continuation of the previous vote, for the 28% undecided.",
