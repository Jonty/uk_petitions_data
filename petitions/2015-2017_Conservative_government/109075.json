        "additional_details": "Free hot school meals for all schoolchildren between four and seven, regardless of their parent\u2019s income, were introduced by former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg in 2014. It was estimated that it would cut costs to parents by \u00a3400 per year, per child. Healthy eating campaigner, Jamie Oliver called the possible decision to cut the meals, a \u201cdisaster\u201d, saying the policy had been a \u201cmajor step forward for children\u2019s health and academic performance\u201d as homemade packed lunches often got \u201cnowhere near the nutritional standards set for school meals\".",
        "background": "The Government is looking into scrapping free school meals for all infants at lunchtimes and the cut is under consideration as part of George Osborne's November spending review. We ask that the government retain the funding and allow the meals to continue. ",
