        "additional_details": "If we are to continue to produce young talent in local areas to feed the nearby professional clubs, the grass roots clubs need support. Who better to provide this support than the professional clubs who directly benefit from the production of local talent year on year. Too many local clubs have poor quality facilities and badly kept pitches. Why can't we legislate to ensure professional clubs are responsible for the continued existence of these clubs. Without local clubs there will be no talent.",
        "background": "The media is full of stories about grass roots clubs who are in need of money to avoid closure, or who have to apply for lottery funding to help them build new facilities. I would like professional clubs to directly contribute towards their local grass roots clubs. ",
