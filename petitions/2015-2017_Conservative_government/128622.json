If they are just to target those who pay no attention place a sign before it can target a motorist let them know there is a police operation in progress! Show is proof that they actually improve road safety and reduce accidents in areas they are used! Modern technology on cars does though that has been proven time and time again! Raise speed limits of you are to continue to use these cash cows or give plausible warnings that they are in action",

Where I live accidents are minimal we have no speed cameras just the van that shows up and no warning signs before you see it",
