        "additional_details": "There are many, many women out there that have an incompetent cervix, yet the NHS and many doctors believe these length checks shouldn't be done unless the woman has previously suffered a second term loss. \r\nAn expectant mother should not have to lose her baby before something can be done the next time they are pregnant. If someone is checked and their cervix is shorter, they can be then monitored accordingly & receive a cerclage/stitch if needed; to help carry the pregnancy as far as possible. ",
        "background": "Cervical length screening checks are not routinely done during pregnancy scans unless there is a special specific reason for this to be done- ie. a previous second trimester loss or preterm delivery- commonly due to the incompetent cervix/cervical insufficiency. ",
