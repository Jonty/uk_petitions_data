        "additional_details": "But it does show that a large number of \"facilities and services\" will be paid for by the grantor - ie the taxpayer - and not the club.\r\nThese include the cost of stadium utilities, security, maintaining the pitch, and even the goalposts and corner flags.\r\nThe BBC understands other overheads that could also be paid by the LLDC include the cost of stewarding and policing on match days, which amounts to many hundreds of thousands of pounds for other Premier League clubs.",
        "background": "West Ham United will have many of the running costs met by the taxpayer when they move to the \u00a3700m Olympic Stadium next year, the BBC has learnt.\r\nThis is an outrage when Government complain they can not afford enough police offices to attend burglary calls\r\n",
