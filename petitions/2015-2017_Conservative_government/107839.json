You can read about his case here: http://goo.gl/Cocq4l.\r\n\r\nThis is important because he is just one of a countless number of vulnerable people. Ordinary people who care for their families and just try to do their job. Sadly, we live in a world where this hasn't been possible. Please, please grant this man and his family the right to live in the UK. For what he's gone through, he thoroughly deserves it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAvaaz petition: https://goo.gl/U2SYJf",
