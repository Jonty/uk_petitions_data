        "additional_details": "With increasing demands on the NHS through an ageing and increasing population, the NHS needs more money.   We spend 8.5% of GDP (based on 2015 data) against an average in Europe of 8.9% and are the 10th highest spender of 10 listed countries.   We are the 5th higher contributor to Overseas Aid of 10 listed countries.  Germany & France spend considerably less on Overseas Aid than the UK - but considerably more on their NHS.  \r\nSources:  Wikepedia & Kings Fund",
        "background": "The UK Overseas Aid Budget at 0.71% is the 5th highest of all European countries.   I suggest that it is reduced to 0.6% and that the cash difference be invested in our NHS.   The reduction amounts to approximately \u00a31.4bn p.a.and so would fund the increasing needs of the NHS on an annual need.  ",
