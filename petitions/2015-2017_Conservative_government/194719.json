A child with autism who already finds the world a scary place, who cannot speak, then has her ability to move, taken away from her by the person who is supposed to care for her. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-39513142\r\n\r\nThis teacher has now been given the all clear to go back to teaching. Words cannot describe my dismay at this behavior being deemed exceptable. \r\n\r\n",
