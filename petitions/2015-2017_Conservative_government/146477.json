        "action": "A second EU referendum to approve the government's proposed plan for Brexit",
        "additional_details": "The British public has voted to leave the EU. However no credible plan has been put forward to exit the EU and the public now has no further say.  \r\n\r\nThis is a matter of unique economic, political and constitutional consequence. For the sake of both Remain and Leave voters, and for the health of our democracy, the government must publish their plans and obtain a  popular mandate from the British public before proceeding with this momentous decision.",
        "background": "The offer made to the electorate by Vote Leave for us to take back control of our country can only be genuine and legitimate if it is based on a new EU referendum to approve the government's proposed plan for Brexit.",
