These members would judge the legislation by the standards of the time.  This would ensure that our elected representatives would consider posterity before enacting legislation.\r\n\r\nAny short-termism, opportunism, side-lining of data or lies will be penalised. \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "I propose a law that would be called the Posterity Law.  This law would create a rolling oversight agency that would audit the legislation after 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 years.  If the original legislators were found to be short-termist then they would be penalised by both loss of liberty and wealth.",
