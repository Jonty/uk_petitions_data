        "additional_details": "If our Government ignores this discrimination against its own citizens, it will only serve to increase the risk of radicalisation of our young people. Isn\u2019t there a danger that it might appear to  a young British Muslim that their Government cares more about trade deals than about their Human Rights? and in turn isn\u2019t that just good news for the terrorist recruiters? Of course nothing justifies terrorism, but many things make it easier for IS and similar groups to corrupt our children.  ",
        "background": "To allow President Trump to visit the UK whilst the ban is in place Is deeply offensive to British Muslims and those who stand in solidarity with them, the government should uphold the Human Rights of all its citizens equally, and state clearly that it will not put up with this discriminatory ban   ",
