        "action": "Change the law from late miscarriage to stillbirth.",
        "additional_details": "Many people don't realise that at this time the mother must give birth to their baby which is often fully formed. They hold them, love them and name them and yet they are non existent is the eyes of the law. They will not be offered a birth or death certificate or a funeral. This is heart breaking for the parents and family. I would like the law changed from miscarriage to still birth from the day any mother has to physically give birth to a baby.",
        "background": "I myself have had a stillbirth at 34 weeks just 9 month ago and I was outraged to discover that any children born before 24 weeks are categorised as a miscarriage. I want this changed.",
