        "additional_details": "Many of those who voted to leave did it because they had no other way to voice their frustrations. If the bureaucracy and the way the EU imposes laws to benefit them and not all is overcome, perhaps they would vote to stay? \r\nInstead of a referendum, the remain campaign should have worked harder - together - to put this right. Involve the people in all EU countries, not just the UK - the people who matter - to support it.\r\nThis leave vote has opened doors to do this. Brussels must listen now! ",
        "background": "48% of UK voters wanted to remain. \r\nA campaign must be delivered to:\r\n1. Block exit\r\n2. Develop plans to change the bureaucracy of the EU so that those who voted to leave can be comfortable about the change. \r\nThis must now be Cameron's obligation for doing this to our country.",
