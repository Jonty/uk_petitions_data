        "additional_details": "Children are like a sponge when soaking up knowledge. So if makaton which is an easier form.of sign language is introduced to children at a young age, it would mean that we would eventually all be able to.communicate at some point in life with someone who uses sign language every day. It means future generations can go ask that child thats sat on their own in the playground to come and play with them. They will be able to.communicate, instead of not knowing how to and the child not left isolated no more. ",
