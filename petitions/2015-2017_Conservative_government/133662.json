Our economy is already being negatively affected (BBC News) and to leave could spell disaster.\r\n",
        "background": "Referendums in the UK are not legally binding. The decision on BREXIT involves many complex economic factors and the  referendum has been fraught with political scaremongering, inflated immigration claims, and many outright fallacies. Please hold an MPs vote to save the UK from economic suicide. ",
