He is the only one who stands up for the people against the elitist groups who exploit us for our work and lives.\r\nWe the people have the power, if anything showed us that, it was the shock of leaving the EU. Lets vote in a person who can lead this in a positive direction for all people.\r\nSomeone who ties us together with Love and Care and does not set to divide us further for the benefit of the very rich.",
