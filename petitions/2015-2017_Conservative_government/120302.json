        "additional_details": "Ours and thousands of British families are affected by this July 2012 change in Immigration Law. Our British son married an american lady 3 1/2 years before the Law changed. They now have two sons. The present law will not allow him to return home to the UK with his family because he cannot fulfil the minimum income requirements. Our son has paid taxes in UK and gave 5 years of his life to the Territorial Army. We can afford to take in refugees and people from EU, so let our own people home too.",
        "background": "Theresa May changed UK Immigration Law in July 2012. UK Citizens must meet minimum income requirements to return home with a Non-UK or Non-EU spouse. MP's never voted on this change, because The 1971 Immigration Act gave any Home Secretary the power to impose changes, without Parliamentary consent. ",
