        "action": "Get the vote for 16 and 17 year-olds in a second EU referendum.",
        "additional_details": "In December 2015 the government rejected a bid to allow 16 and 17 year-olds to vote in the EU referendum on financial grounds; they claimed it would cost \u00a36 million to register young voters. There are over 1.5 million 16 and 17 year-olds in the UK. This works out as \u00a34 per registration. Is the future of our youth not worth even that much? Surely they themselves would consider it a very small price to pay for a say in their options and choices.",
        "background": "Many of today's 16 and 17 year-olds are already part of the workforce.  As tax-payers, they should have the right to vote. Those still at school will be working or training for work when Brexit would happen. Anyone affected by a split from the EU has a right to voice their opinion on the matter.  ",
