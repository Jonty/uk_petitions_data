        "additional_details": "We would like to see this loophole being closed and ensure regardless of whether a child has an EHCP or not children who are offered SEN support are still being provided with the same opportunities and rights as a child with an EHCP. There are examples which can be provided of children who have SEN support without an EHCP who have had professional outside agencies visit the school and offer recommendations but the schools have ignored these and not put them into practice. We feel this is unfair.",
        "background": "If a child has an EHCP the local authority and school and legally obliged and have a duty of care to ensure their needs are met. If a child is on SEN support but does not have an EHCP, legally the schools do not have the same obligations and so children are being let down and left unsupported. ",
