        "action": "Treat votes as a form of currency and make obtaining votes by deception a crime.",
        "additional_details": "In the world of commerce, when you make deliberately misleading statements or engage in misleading acts designed to persuade people to part with money goods or services you can be taken to court and prosecuted. If votes were classed as a non-transferable, time limited unit of currency, the same body of law and evidential tests that apply to monetary fraud could be applied to politicians and their supporters who use deception and falsehoods when marketing themselves to the electorate.",
        "background": "Votes are the currency of democracy. Those who solicit votes through false or misleading claims and actions should face the same legal sanctions as currently exist for monetary fraud. Treating votes as a limited form of currency allows those same laws to be used against dishonest campaigning.",
