        "additional_details": "My own 7 year old son, hardly gets any of his teachers time, because she is having to spend so much time trying to communicate with many non English speaking children in her class. I'm having to do home tutoring to make up for the lack of teaching received in class and through no fault of the teacher. Their jobs are incredibly important and so many good teachers have left their teaching profession, because its becoming increasingly difficult to do their jobs. Teachers are not translators",
        "background": "Our teacher's jobs are hard enough. British children's education is going downhill rapidly, because too much time is spent with the teacher having to do one on ones with non English speaking children. It must be the parents responsibility to teach their children a basic standard of English.",
