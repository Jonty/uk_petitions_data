        "additional_details": "Plastic straws are in the top 10 for most common found plastic on our shorelines.\r\n\r\nStraws contain BPA which isn't biodegradable. \r\n\r\n20 minute usage - 200 years to break down. Even then they're not totally gone! \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Around 3.5 million straws are served in the UK daily in restaurants and bars around the country. Most of these end up in landfill taking around 200 years to decompose.\r\nPlastic straws are an absolute blight on marine life, ending up ingested and killing aquatic life.\r\nBan them!\r\n\r\n",
