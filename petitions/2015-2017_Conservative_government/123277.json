We also have a stem cell bank at Cambridge, and we should expand that and make it the best in the world. That would be tremendously powerful for analysing health outcomes, risks and helping people prevent diseases. To that end we need only 30% percent reduction in military spending. Imagine what we can do then.\r\nWe can pay for science more that way.",
        "background": "Stem cell research at Cambridge and Imperial, Medicine at Oxford and London etc are all world-leading. Therefore, the UK has some of the best in the world.  We have pioneered so many new techniques and technologies here, we should be incredibly proud of it. We should fund it however difficult.",
