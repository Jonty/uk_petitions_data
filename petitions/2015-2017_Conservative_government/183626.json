        "action": "Help stop the government plans to decentralise ALL sexual violence funding.",
        "additional_details": "This plan in 2018/19 would be disastrous for many services, despite the evidence pointing to the problems this will cause for established services that rely on such funding for their core service delivery. It is likely there will be less support available for survivors, as decentralised funds are consumed by other priority local needs. We can already see a decrease in service levels and an increase in waiting times for support. We ask that the government urgently reconsider this proposed action.",
        "background": "During Sexual Violence Awareness Week 2017, we are trying to #shinealight into the darkness of the hidden horrors of rape and sexual abuse. More individuals are coming forward and asking for support. Recently funding for sexual violence support services has remained constant or dropped. ",
