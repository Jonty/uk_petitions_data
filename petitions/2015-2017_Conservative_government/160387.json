        "action": "Call a general election as a result of Conservative Party leadership election.",
        "additional_details": "Events of recent weeks have proven to the public that there is no unity within the party and so the party no longer represents the will of the people. In addition, the vastly differing views of the two candidates mean there is no longer a clear manifesto. It would be undemocratic to allow a prime minister voted in by the party's membership (representing 0.3% of the population) to see out the remainder of the term. We therefore call for a general election at the earliest opportunity to allow the public to reflect on such a very important change in the majority party.",
        "background": "The Conservative Party's decision to elect either Theresa May or Andrea Leadsom as leader of the party and, by extension, as prime minister represents a significant departure from the morals and policy of the Conservative Party that won by a majority in the 2015 general election.
