        "additional_details": "The recent referendum is not legally binding and parliament remains sovereign.  The constitutional changes being proposed are revolutionary in nature and constitute a sudden rupture with the very basis of our existing social contract.  Given the far reaching consequences of the vote for the integrity of the United Kingdom, its prosperity and well being, we feel that our current representatives need to renew their mandate before proceeding with negotations with the EU.",
        "background": "We are a parliamentary democracy.  A consultative referendum has just been held which proposes constitutional change of a revolutionary and uniquely disruptive kind.  A newly appointed parliament is the correct forum to discuss the consequences of this vote and to appoint a Brexit negotiating team.",
