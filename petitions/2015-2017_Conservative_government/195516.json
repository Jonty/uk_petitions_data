        "additional_details": "Only adults (18+) who register within a given deadline and are given a smoker's purchase card will be allowed to continue buying tobacco products, with new registrations to be stopped after a limited time. These measures will ensure that those who are currently smoking will be able to continue if they wish to do so, but it will make it legally impossible for new smokers and young people to get caught in the tobacco addiction trap which causes 80K unnecessary deaths per year in the UK alone. ",
        "background": "Smoking is a major cause of death in the UK and in the industrialised world. \r\n\r\nThis measure aims to effectively prevent non smokers and young people from purchasing tobacco products through the creation of a National register of smokers.",
