        "additional_details": "Biological research shows that circadian rhythms shift during the teen years, pushing boys and girls to stay up later at night and sleep later into the morning. The phase shift, driven by a change in melatonin in the brain, begins around age 13, gets stronger by ages 15 and 16, and peaks at ages 17, 18 or 19. Kyla Wahlstrom, director of the Center for Applied Research and Educational Improvement at the University of Minnesota Concluded from a research that schools that started later in the day concluded in more positive exam results. Therefore I ask you to change secondary school times to a later time.",
        "background": "We teenagers have thought about school times being later in the day and now I am taking action on behalf of the majority of the teenagers. I am due to include more information in the following statements.",
