        "action": "Full protection of treaty rights exercised by EU citizens and family post Brexit",
        "additional_details": "Many EU citizens and family have come to UK under treaty rights to build a new life in this country. All Brexit discussion was based on future control - not to revoke the rights and seek removal or 'application' of anyone already here. The decision made must not seek to revoke those rights to move, live and work here. These rights to remain MUST obtain and not be subject to any negotiated bi-lateral agreement. Those who are potentially affected must be given assurance over their future.",
        "background": "As no part of the Brexit campaign was to call for the removal of those currently in UK under EU treaty rights, anybody exercising those rights should be protected post Brexit and to not, under any circumstance, be required to 'apply' to stay under any new immigration control mechanism",
