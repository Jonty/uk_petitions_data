        "action": "Ban the use of non-recyclable plastic film and unnecessary packaging on produce.",
        "additional_details": "To be included in this petition:\r\n\r\nPlastic wrapped vegetables and fruit; \r\nSingle use plastic bags for purchasing fruit and vegetables (what happened to paper bags?)\r\nBubble wrap (sorry for those who like to pop the bubbles but the environment is more important); \r\nClingfilm; \r\nFilm lids from microwave meals; \r\nNon-recyclable crisp packets (metallic plastic); \r\n\r\nNext lets aim for abolishing single use water bottles and bring back water fountains - but that's for another day.",
        "background": "So much is wrapped in \"Film - not currently recyclable\" - the technology is there for this film to be compostable - and we could manage without most of it. Within 50 years there will be more plastic in the seas than fish - this must change. Make companies reduce their packaging and be responsible.",
