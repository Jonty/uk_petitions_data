        "action": "Change the NLA guidelines to allow mobile workers to be paid for travel.",
        "additional_details": "National law in this case is the NLA formely the National Minimum Wage which states that travel time between home and a place of work is excluded from the obligation to pay the NMW, including for mobile workers. This is unfair and mind boggling considering that a court has ruled that travel time under the WTD and WTR that safeguard workers to make sure they have regulated breaks and rest periods as work but does not govern pay for these hours. I therefore would like this to be addressed.",
        "background": "In September 2015 the CJEU ruled that the time spent by mobile workers - that is, those who have no fixed place of work - travelling between home and their first and last place of work each day counts as 'working time' under the WTD and WTR. However payment for these hours is down to national law.",
