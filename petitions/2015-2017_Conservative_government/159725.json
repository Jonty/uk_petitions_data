        "action": "Change the proposed route for the HS2 train that will destroy people's houses",
        "additional_details": "Residents affected by this new proposal were informed in the early hours of the morning that their houses may be destroyed should this plan go ahead. They \"sincerely apologise for any upset that this may cause\", as this problem doesn't affect them and they only care about saving money. This new route saves a mere 18 minutes and will severely affect people's lives. Help try to convince the government and HS2 that this proposal will cause multiple problems which will outweigh the benefits.",
        "background": "David Higgins intends to recommend that the HS2 line will run through Bramley before continuing onto Mexborough and Conisbrough. This means that many houses will be destroyed including a brand new housing estate in Mexborough which people are still moving in to.  ",
