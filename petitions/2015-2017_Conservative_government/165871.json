        "action": "Change all road signs to display metric measurements in the United Kingdom",
        "additional_details": "We buy our fuel for vehicles in litres, however the efficiency of cars is measured in \"miles per gallon\". Car manufacturers design the dimensions of cars in metric measurements however our roads signs display imperial. Old-fashioned measurements bring confusion to people from other societies and can lead to road accidents due to different measurement restrictions. Changing our road signage to display distance in metres and kilometres, vehicle restrictions in metres and speed given in kilometres per hour will help to end the in-consistency of measurements in the UK.  ",
        "background": "In the UK, we have an outstanding problem. The continued mix-up of both metric and imperial measurements in our society confuses the great British people, especially to the younger generation. Completing the change to an easy and logical measuring system would be both inexpensive and simple.  ",
