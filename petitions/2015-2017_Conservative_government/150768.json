        "additional_details": "This petition refers to the people trying to have a second referendum because they lost the first one. This is obscure and if the result went the other way, we wouldn't just vote again until the result we want occurs.",
        "background": "A vote is a vote. If a referendum is held yet the result isn't what everyone wanted, you cannot simply hold a second referendum. This isn't fair. This undermines the point of democracy and the values of people's votes. For the people who lost, the decision has been made so deal with it.",
