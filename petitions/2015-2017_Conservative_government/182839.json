This statistic that must always be used when describing the number of people who voted to leave.\r\n",
        "background": "52% of those that voted in the referendum voted to leave. 48% voted to remain and thus lost. However only 72% of the voting public voted at all, meaning that only 37% of those eligible to vote, voted leave.\r\n\r\nGovernment language when discussing the referendum result must reflect this statistic.\r\n",
