        "additional_details": "Following an incredibly divisive campaign it is the government's responsibility and duty to unite the people and considering all views will be a step towards that.\r\nI'm sure everyone wants the best for the UK and although we may all differ on what we think is best, through constructive dialogue we can and will find compromise and common ground.\r\nThrough our collective endeavour we can make the best of any situation. Only by considering all the people of the UK will we achieve any positive change.",
        "background": "The leave negotiations will shape the UK for decades. This is the most important time in recent UK history and is a bigger issue than just 1 party. Only 1 agenda shouldn't shape our future for decades.\r\nAll common's parties need to be included in the negotiations. Everyone needs to be represented.",
