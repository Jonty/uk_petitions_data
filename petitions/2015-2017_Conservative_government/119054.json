        "additional_details": "- In 2007 overweight and obesity care (both directly and indirectly) cost the NHS over \u00a35.1bn in that one year. \r\n- Obesity is now, according to a recent report, is costing the country nearly \u00a347,000,000,000 a year. \r\n- In the past 9 years that is an 821% increase and now obesity is a greater burden on the UK\u2019s economy than armed violence, war and terrorism. The study, conducted by McKinsey & Company, also reveals obesity is the 2nd largest impact on the UK economy... generating an annual loss equivalent to 3% of GDP.",
        "background": "In the UK, obesity is a major problem. Both care for obesity and related illness such as heart, liver or intestinal disease costs the NHS now close to \u00a350 billion and this needs to stop. The cost of keeping fit prevents people being able to be healthy and thus I propose subsidising access to fitness",
