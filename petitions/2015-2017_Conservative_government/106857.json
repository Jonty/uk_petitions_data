        "action": "Restrict booking fees to per transaction rather than per ticket.",
        "additional_details": "I propose that ticket companies operating the UK are restricted in what they are able to charge and a booking fee is limited to each transaction.\r\n\r\nThere are no additional labour costs for buying more than one ticket and the cost of the extra printing and card is negligible.\r\n\r\nThis unfair and highly profitable venture should be regulated to give the consumer more protection.",
        "background": "I believe that Ticketing Companies operating within the UK are unfairly charging people additional booking fees without justification, making it too costly thus depriving people the opportunity to experience live entertainment. It should be law that companies can only charge 1 fee per transaction.",
