        "additional_details": "We currently don't have a Prime Minister and when one is selected, they won't be someone we were given the option to vote for last year. \r\nI believe it is only fair to hear all political parties mandates since nobody was prepared for such a radical change in circumstances. We as a nation, need to be given the chance to vote for someone we can fully trust to get the negotiations and everything else right. The current fragmented, leaderless Conservatives are currently not fit for purpose.",
        "background": "We must prevent the Conservative right using the Brexit negotiations to reshape Britain into a rule-free space for corporations; we need to take control of the process whereby the rights of the citizen are redefined against those of a newly sovereign state.",
