        "additional_details": "The UK government is deciding the key outcomes of non-membership of the EU based upon unqualified assumptions about the electorate's decision. The UK government is assuming a mandate which has not been endorsed by the electorate, that is, a decision on membership of the European Single Market. Does neither Parliament nor the UK electorate now have a say on the further relationship with the EU? The referendum result implies further democratic decisions on membership of the European Single Market.",
        "background": "In June 2016, through an Act of Parliament, the electorate was instructed to vote in a referendum on the UK's relationship with the EU, through either membership or non-membership. A vote for non-membership does not imply a government prerogative power to relinquish membership to the Single Market",
