        "action": "Make Autism Spectrum training compulsory for all mental health professionals.",
        "additional_details": "Many MH professionals feel that they don't know how best to help us as they don't understand the differences in the MH problems we experience. They have indicated that individuals tend to get left to one side as they aren't sure of the best treatments/type of support for them. Dangers of lack of correct support and misdiagnoses can lead to permanent health problems or even death. Compulsory training would give staff awareness of ASD which would help them to understand how to support us better.",
        "background": "It is surprising how little knowledge mental health professionals, in general, have of ASD. Having ASD can affect how individuals portray their symptoms of their mental health problems and lack of knowledge of the spectrum can lead to wrong diagnoses and ineffective treatment plans.",
