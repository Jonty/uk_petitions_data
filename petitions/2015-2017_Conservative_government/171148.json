        "action": "A Referendum on whether the UK Government negotiates 'soft' or 'hard' Brexit",
        "additional_details": "This negotiation is consequential in so many ways for the United Kingdom - whether it be regarding Scotland's place in the UK, our trade relations with our biggest trading partner (EU) and with the rest of the world or the economic impact of Brexit. Brexit does mean Brexit but doesn't determine what kind of Brexit this is. I implore you to sign this petition - only if you sign it, can we make this possibility a potential reality. ",
        "background": "Britain will leave the EU - this petition simply proposes a referendum on whether Brexit should be 'soft' with greater free movement and access to the single market or 'hard' with greater restrictions on free movement and access to the single market. ",
