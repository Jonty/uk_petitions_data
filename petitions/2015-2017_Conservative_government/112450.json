        "action": "Decriminalize cannabis in Scotland.",
        "additional_details": "Keeping one offender in prison exceeds 40,000 per year. It's bleeding money and causing our prisons to become over crowded. If this law passes the police can focus on the real criminals. This will save money and put it to good use in Scotland whitch is suffering from 1 in 5 children living in poverty today.",
        "background": "By decriminalization in Scotland we can help to make it a better society. being caught with a small amount or growing plants for personal uses, would only result in a fine. compared to a prison sentence and a criminal record for a very minor offence. This ultimately dose not help when seeking a job.",
