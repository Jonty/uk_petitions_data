        "action": "Make MPs promise to protect certain EU legislation, including workers' rights.",
        "additional_details": "17,410,742 people voted to leave the EU in the referendum, but 16,141,241 voted to stay. If slightly over 630,000 had voted differently the remain campaign would have won the vote. Though the wishes of the majority must be accepted, it would be intolerable to ignore the wishes of the remain voters.\r\n\r\nIf the UK wishes to be an outward looking nation then a public statement must be made by MPs from all parties that EU legislation regarding workers' rights and the environment will be protected.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "I have never been a fan of the EU. As has been pointed out numerous times it is bureaucratic and its organisation has many flaws. That said I voted to remain because being a member has made the UK a better, fairer country. I fear this being undone and the country going backwards, not forwards. ",
