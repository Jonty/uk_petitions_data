Time  and time again I are denied properties because I am on benefits. I can't seem to find a place in council housing and the hoops to jump are insane and sometimes things are not looked at properly. So I am trapped in private renting that discriminates me just because I'm to disabled to work so I'm on Disability. \r\n\r\nI do not see how this is in anywat fair. ",

Trying to find a place I am constantly met with \"No DSS\". This isn't fair and automatically discriminates against people who need help and people on disability. ",
