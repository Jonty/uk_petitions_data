        "additional_details": "The UK streets and waterways are blighted by the littering of drinks containers. Big business gains from selling drinks in non returnable containers but society and nature suffers because these containers are often thrown away by the purchaser. A charge or Pfand levied on them will ensure they are returned to a point of sale or collected so they can be properly recycled. This will ensure that streets, public places and waterways like those in Germany are kept clean and safe for wildlife and us to enjoy for years to come.",
        "background": "I have visited Germany on three occasions and I was impressed how clean the streets and waterways are. They have a system called Pfand. A redeemable charge is placed on drink containers such as metal cans and both plastic and glass bottles. ",
