Landlords already have an obligation to ensure any property they rent out is safe and in a good state of repair. There are a number of pieces of legislation which require landlords to do this, including several Housing Acts, but your rights are not consolidated in any one place. You can read more about your rights and responsibilities as a tenant here: https://www.gov.uk/private-renting/your-rights-and-responsibilities.\r\n\r\nYou might also like to sign this petition, which we think is similar to yours:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/117539\r\n"
