        "additional_details": "The advertising standards authority, for example, seeks to ensure veracity and might have ruled that a balancing statement (or more) was required for fairness, had the referendum fallen under their jurisdiction. If this is required for sales campaigns, why not for more important decisions? Candidates who utilise such methods to achieve public office are not the representatives we deserve and should be barred from any and all gains so acquired. Additional penalties might also be considered.",
        "background": "The EU referendum result will have far-reaching consequences. Both campaigns were marred by misleading claims, such as the \u00a3350m per week that the EU is paid, but even after these were discredited they remained prominent as a visible backdrop to interviews. This could unduly influence some voters.",
