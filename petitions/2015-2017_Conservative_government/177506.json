        "additional_details": "Many 'Sabs' have evidence of these people cruelly murdering our foxes and yet still nothing is being done. These incidences are not accidents and these 'trails' they set up are no more real than the compassion these people show for their animals. \r\nIt's not on anymore, it's time as a country we moved forwards and banished this act completely. \r\nPlease sign this petition so we can have this issue addressed in Parliament and so the government can see how many people do care about animal welfare.",
        "background": "Ban fox hunting completely and stop letting heartless murderers; who are killing our native British wildlife, get away with it by using pathetic excuses. \r\nWe need harsher sentences. In fact a sentence full stop would be good in order to stop this barbaric and backwards 'sport'.",
