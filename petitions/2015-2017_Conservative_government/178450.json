        "additional_details": "The 'global gag rule' cuts off US funding to any overseas organisation that counsels women on access to abortion, even if the organisation does not use US funds to do so. \r\n\r\nUnsafe abortion is one of five leading causes of maternal mortality worldwide. Marie Stopes international estimates that, with the new funding gap, there will be an additional 2.1 million additional unsafe abortions and 21,700 maternal deaths over four years, while millions more will lose access to vital health services.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "US President Donald J Trump has defunded thousands of vital health projects worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe UK's aid budget is over \u00a311 billion for FY 2016-17. The Prime Minister & the Secretary of State for International Development must ensure that the UK helps to fill the US funding gap before it costs lives.",
