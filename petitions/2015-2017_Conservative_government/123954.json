        "action": "End the 12 month deferral period on men who have sex with men donating blood.",
        "additional_details": "Supporters of the current policy argue that there is a higher incidence of HIV/AIDs and other STIs amongst MSM than in other groups. Yet STIs can affect any person from any walk of life. At the moment, a man who has had unprotected sex with many different women can donate, whereas a man who practises safe sex with another man cannot. Not only is this illogical but it makes a dangerous failure to target the real issue: safe sexual practice. This ban could affect anyone of us.\r\n",
        "background": "Though there are blood shortages in the UK, blood that could save lives is being wasted and healthy men are being discriminated against. Scientific advances have meant that the current blood donation policy is no longer justifiable. Decisions on blood donor suitability should be made case-by-case.",
