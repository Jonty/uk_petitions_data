        "action": "Create a carbon dioxide emissions tax for industry.",
        "additional_details": "This tax would raise, not only awareness for the environment but also a large sum of money for the public purse. Any company complying with what was agreed at the Paris conference would not be penalised. Only companies who continued to ignore the blatant global warming issues would be taxed. ",
        "background": "A tax should be levied on industry equal to the amount of greenhouse gasses they release over British soil. This should increase every year to encourage them to go green and help the government's efforts in the Paris talks. Emissions below an acceptable level would not be taxed. ",
