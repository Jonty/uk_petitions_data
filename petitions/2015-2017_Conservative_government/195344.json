        "action": "Change the way student loan repayments include inflation from the RPI to the CPI",
        "additional_details": "The RPI (retail price index) is an inaccurate way of measuring inflation and gives volatile figures which is why it it no longer used by most organisations and government bodies. It does not meet international statistical standards and the ONS no longer includes it as a national statistic.",
        "background": "The Government should change the way the student loan repayments are adjusted to include inflation to use the CPI (consumer price index) as it is a more fair and stable way measuring price changes. Currently graduates are overpaying on their loans as the current method is using exaggerated figures.",
