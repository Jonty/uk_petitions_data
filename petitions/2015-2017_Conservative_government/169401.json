        "action": "Hold a referendum on abolishing on the Monarchy",
        "additional_details": "To make the UK more democratic, there has also been a push for a more proportional voting system. The monarchy is part of the same problem in which voters don't feel they have power because of how undemocratic and unaccountable our politics is. If we give voters a choice on whether we elect our head of state, this will get more people involved in politics and help increase voter turnout.",
        "background": "The UK voted to leave the EU to make our country more democratic and accountable. An unelected Head of State that can veto and pass laws is an affront to democracy. Most countries in the world don't have an Monarchy, so let's bring our democracy into the 21st century by having a referendum on it.",
