        "additional_details": "Whether supportive or against the UK's withdrawal from the EU, there is no doubt that Mr. Farage has been a tremendous ambassador for the independence movement, and has dedicated much of his life to achieving this goal for the British public.\r\nWe recommend Mr. Farage be considered for Knighthood status for his services to politics, and his dedication to what we (and millions of people across the country) feel is best for the future of the United Kingdom.",
        "background": "Nigel Farage has advocated for the UK's independence for over 25 years, and served much of that time as an MEP in the European Parliament.\r\nThe referendum would not have occurred without his leadership and dedication to the \"Brexit\" cause, and serving the interests of the British people.
