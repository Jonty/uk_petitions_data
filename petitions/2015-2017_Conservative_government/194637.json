        "additional_details": "Battersea dogs home and cats have been campaigning for such measures and 67 MP's are currently in support to stop backstreet breeding.  I feel though the measures need to be taken further and unless you are a registered and monitored breeder who declares your earnings then it should be mandatory for all pets especially cats, dogs and rabbits to be neutered.  Horses breeding should require prior permission and registering also as the passport rules are not being adhered and monitored enough.  ",
        "background": "Everyday needless amounts of pets are having to be put to sleep by charities and rescues due to the amount of backstreet breeding and owners who do not understand the importance of neutering.  There are to many animals and not enough good homes. ",
