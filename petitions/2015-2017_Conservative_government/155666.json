        "additional_details": "At the heart of democracy is clear information sharing & communication. MPs should therefore be held to account for the validity of information they share. We advise that the Independent Panel will assess MPs' comments upon request from the public. Each comment could be assessed as to whether it is factually correct/incorrect, verifiable/unverifiable, or misleadingly presented. There could be sanctions for repeat offenders of misleading information & an 'honesty' league table of MPs.",
        "background": "The EU referendum highlighted the damage that can be caused by false & misleading information. We the undersigned propose that an independent panel should be established to report to the public on the validity and accuracy of MPs' public comments.",
