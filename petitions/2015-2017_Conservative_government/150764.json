        "action": "Reject the result of the recent EU referendum",
        "additional_details": "A gov.uk petition widely headlined as being for a referendum re-run appears to have no chance of success because it fails to address the issue. It actually calls for majority rules to make success in the referendum more difficult for either side, which of course cannot be applied after the event. What is urgently required is a fresh petition statement with a clear call to reject the result: the issue of a further referendum could then be discussed. \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "We the undersigned call upon HM Government to reject the result of the recent EU referendum as promises made by some campaigners are now known to be false and events have demonstrated that leaving the EU is likely to be disastrous for our economic and political stability  \r\n",
