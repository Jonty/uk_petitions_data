It is therefore an affront to democracy that petition \"131,245\", located on this website, calls upon HM Government to retrospectively change the percentage required to win on either side, in addition to the turnout rules. Although we the people have absolute faith in HM's Government to respect the will of the people, we hereby wish to register our concern at petition \"131,245\".",
