        "additional_details": "Paedophiles should be forced to mix with the general population of a prison - why should they be kept safe? A child will never be able to forget what they have been through, while the paedophiles are set free after a few years to do it to another child. How can parents protect their children from a paedophile when they are so well hidden?",
        "background": "Paedophiles are protected by an out of date legal system. They are protected in prison and given a new identity once free. A paedophile or sex offender never truly faces their disgusting crimes, while the children and families have to deal with it forever.",
