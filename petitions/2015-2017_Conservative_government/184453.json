The decision to allow development on green belt land is the responsibility of your local council. \r\n \r\nYou could raise your issue with a local councillor, who represents you. You can use this page to find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them: \r\n \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors \r\n \r\nYou can also petition your local council - you can find out more here: http://epetition.havering.public-i.tv/epetition_core/community/page/index\r\n\r\nOnce an application is made for the development to take place, all local residents have the right to request that a planning application be \u2018called in\u2019 by the Department for Communities and Local Government. This means that it will assess the planning application against certain criteria and decide if a full inquiry is needed.
