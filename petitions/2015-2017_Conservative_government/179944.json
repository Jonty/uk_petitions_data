The American people voted him in and it it was right to invite him, and it would now be wrong and damaging to withdraw that invitation.  \r\n     ",
        "background": "There has been a ill considered social media, and mainstream media,  campaign for withdrawing the invitation made to President Trump. The number of \"signatories\" has now exceeded one million. This is detrimental to our national interests and not an act of friendship. ",
