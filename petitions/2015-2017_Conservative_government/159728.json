        "background": "The current Motorcycle licensing laws are dangerous for young riders and deter them from progressing to a higher licence. The 28MPH limit on 50cc's is extremely dangerous especially on duel carriageways. The A1 licence should be 250/300cc for motorway use, 125cc's are treacherous for motorway use. ",
