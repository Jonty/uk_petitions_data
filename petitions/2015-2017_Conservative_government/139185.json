        "additional_details": "Their voices should have been given more importance. In the Scottish referendum 16 to 18 year olds were rightly given a vote, another important vote for this country in which their age group was truly represented, and in my opinion added to the integrity of the outcome. ",
        "background": "The EU referendum which took place on the 23 of June did not truly give a voice to our youngest adults. The decision taken will impact upon the lives of young adults between the ages of 16-18, far more than the older generations, and they will be forced to live with the consequences the longest.",
