        "additional_details": "The UK government must not try to block another referendum on Scottish independence. This is because Scotland overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU and the SNP was elected with a manifesto explicitly stating that another referendum was an option if Scotland was \"taken out of the EU against our will\". As PM Theresa May has rejected she would seek a deal that keeps Scotland part of the EU or even the EU single market, the people of Scotland must be given a choice to shape their own future.",
        "background": "If the Scottish Parliament votes for another referendum to be held, it must not be blocked or delayed by the UK government and all terms of another \"Scottish\" vote must be decided by the \"Scottish\" Parliament.",
