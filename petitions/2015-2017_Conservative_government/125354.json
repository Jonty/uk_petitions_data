        "additional_details": "She could even be moored in the Thames to provide extra helo platforms and troop accommodation during major events or security alerts. General maintenance could be carried out by volunteers and they could also act as guides during Navy days and other events. Illustrious is the only ship left of her class. We strongly oppose the needless scrapping of HMS Illustrious and ask the government to reconsider.  ",
        "background": "HMS Illustrious is unique inasmuch as she is the only warship ever to commission at sea therefore a very historic vessel. She still as much to offer as either a heritage site or a training ship. ",
