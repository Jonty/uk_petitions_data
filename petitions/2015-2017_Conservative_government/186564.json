        "additional_details": "The solution would be as simply as placing a wind (or in this case movement) activated noise maker on the roof of the car. This is just a suggestion of course, the important part is to make electric and hybrid automobiles make a noise like a conventional car does to alert pedestrians to their presence.",
        "background": "We teach \"stop, look and LISTEN\" when teaching the green cross code. Also for people who rely on their sense of hearing to get about, electric cars are dangerous as they may believe the road to be clear when it is not. The sounds of conventional cars are a big part in keeping people safe",
