        "additional_details": "As distance learning students we have to study harder because we don't have as many face to face lectures with out tutor and those of us that choose to do our degree full time are not eligible for a maintenance loan to help support us through our studies like other full time students which then means since we don't have time for a full time job and sometimes a part time job either depending on out degree we have to find other ways to support us financially through our studies.",
        "background": "I'm a student studying at the open university and I have chosen to study full time, this means I don't have time for a job, however I am only eligible for a part time tuition fee loan as I am a distance learning student, this means I only get my tuition fee paid for.",
