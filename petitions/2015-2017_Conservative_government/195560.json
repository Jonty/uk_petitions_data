        "additional_details": "With only 64% of registered voters between 18-24 voting in Brexit compared to 90% of over-65s I believe the lack of time to research and form an opinion stops young voters from voting in this highly conflicted time in politics. Waiting until the end of summer also allows parties to form their own strategies for moving forwards and campaign.",
        "background": "As many young people with the right to vote will be focused on their exams it is unfair to expect them to have the time to make an informed and independent decision on the future of our country on the 8th of June. I propose delaying it until the end of summer so that they might make their decision.",
