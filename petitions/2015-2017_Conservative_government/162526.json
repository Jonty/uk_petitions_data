Good fathers should not be penalised for not wanting to be in a relationship with partners anymore. ",
        "background": "After a difficult separation, I was refused access to my little boy, despite being a 'brilliant dad'. Despite having parental responsibility, I have had to pay thousands in court and lawyer's fees just to gain the right to see my boy. It is a basic human right taken away by ridiculous family law. ",
