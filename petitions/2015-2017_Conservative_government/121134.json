        "additional_details": "An average room in a 5 bed student house in Birmingham costs \u00a3110 a week per person per week, totalling \u00a32200 per month. However, the same house would cost \u00a31300 per calendar month for a professional. Students are the ones who need reasonable prices as their loans have other living costs to cover and it is impossible without help from parents. Other halls of residences charge even higher prices, with around \u00a3130 per week being the cost for a single bedroom and this is still rising!",
        "background": "Call on rip off student housing companies who charge extortionate rates, tie you into a contract which is too long for the academic year and who continue to rise their prices! Student loans do not get any bigger, tuition fees do not get any lower. Student housing companies need to be regulated.",
