This could include trying to get in the way of a sportsman.\" \r\n\r\n\"Impeding or obstructing a person who is engaged in a lawful activity.\"\r\n\r\nIt's also an offence to scare away game so it can't be hunted.\r\n\r\nWe need similar laws in the UK to stop the harassment of those participating in legal fieldsports activities.\r\n\r\n",
