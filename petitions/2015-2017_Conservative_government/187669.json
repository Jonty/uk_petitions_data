        "action": "Simplify marriage law and remove references to sex or gender",
        "additional_details": "The law on marriage should be rewritten with all references to sex, gender and/or sexual orientation removed.  Terms for unions should be standardised and include a distinction between religious and civil unions.\r\n\r\nWhen changing legal gender a person should not be required to dissolve or convert an existing union.\r\n\r\nReligious organisations should be still allowed to refuse to perform weddings which would contradict their faith but this right should not be limited to same sex marriages.",
        "background": "Marriage in the UK is governed by multiple acts of parliament with specific laws for civil partnership and same sex marriage.  However, the legislation still sees same sex and opposite sex couples differently.\r\n\r\nThe law should be consolidated and simplified to correct this.",
