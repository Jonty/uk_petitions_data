        "additional_details": "The UK is a highly likely target for an imminent terrorist attack. Our current threat level is \"SEVERE\" which means, \"an attack is highly likely\"\r\n\r\nOne person with an AK47 can fire 100s of rounds within just 1 minute.\r\n\r\nThe public & our Police Officers need protecting NOW rather than waiting for the next attack & reviewing how many lives could have been saved. More Armed Police would also act as a deterrent.\r\n\r\nArmed officers should wear body cams to back up justification of any use of a firearm.",
        "background": "UK police forces are poorly equipped to deal with the current terrorist threat. A Nice, Orlando or Paris style attack in a UK city would see Police running for cover while they await the arrival of Armed Response units who could be tens of minutes away. Rural towns are especially vulnerable. ",
