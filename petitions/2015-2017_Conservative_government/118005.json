        "additional_details": "Wildlife crime is simply crime, and should be treated as such. It is also complicated, easily overlooked and difficult to prosecute, which is why it can\u2019t be left to overstretched and poorly resourced wildlife crime officers within local constabularies.\r\n\r\nThere are 35,000 rare plants and animals protected by Cites legislation, which gives a clue as to why we might need a few national specialists to tackle these crimes \u2013 the NWCU is currently assisting with 24 investigations into endangered animals illegally traded via the internet in Britain.",
        "background": "Crimes like badger baiting and the slaughter of wild birds of prey will go uninvestigated.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, the government announced only 2 years of support to the National Wildlife Crime Unit (NWCU), the unit will vanish if the government does not fund it beyond March 2016 (it's still undecided).",
