        "additional_details": "The integrity of our sport is on the line - if we allow the salary cap to become optional for certain clubs, then it ceases to be a fair competition where any club can and should be able to compete with the other and will become like football where a few elite clubs just outbid the rest - we all want our own club to win, but surely, as per the historic values of Rugby, we want to know we won or lost fair and square? If you support the true values of Rugby union then please sign this petition",
        "background": "Premiership Rugby union has had a salary cap each year since 1999 to ensure a level playing field for all the teams, which all the 15 clubs sign up to. The completed investigation findings were due out this year and need to be published in full, with sanctions applied for any club who breached it ",
