        "additional_details": "I feel that parents should be able to make their own choices on when they holiday.As many families are living across the UK & overseas,it is limiting to parents,only be allowed to holiday in Term Time.I work in Hospitality, therefore I am limited to taking holidays at less busy times,this would be at times when my children are at school.Where does this leave me?Many others have this problem too.We live in a democracy & I feel by fining parents,it puts us a step closer to becoming a dictatorship.",
        "background": "I believe parents are being deprived of our Human Rights by restricted on times they can holiday. I feel,along with many others, that by restricting our holidaying period, working people are being criticised and fined by taking their children on holiday, when I believe it should be our discretion.",
