        "additional_details": "The local government of the town of Collecchio, in the province of Parma in Italy, have introduced legislation forcing the exclusive use of silent fireworks in displays.  \r\n\r\nImagine an organised display, beautifully choreographed to music, which you can finally enjoy without the interruption of the 'bang'. If people still want to hear the bang, headphones could be hired at organised displays for those wishing to enjoy the fireworks in the 'traditional' manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "We all enjoy a good firework display.  Animals have much more acute hearing than humans and loud bangs can cause acoustic stress leading them to run frantically looking for a place to hide; some straight into the path of oncoming vehicles.  Many humans are also affected by acoustic stress.  ",
