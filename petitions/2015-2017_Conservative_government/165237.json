        "additional_details": "There is NO help for parents in this situation. Social services, cafcass are powerless to make able absent parents see their children. The only route is going through court and then you will be told \"well this parent doesnt have to if they dont want to\" The system enables and allows psychological abuse of thousands of children every day by allowing absent parents to shirk responsibility even when they have P.R! \r\n\r\nThis needs to change! Children are not 'ex children' just because you feel like it!",
        "background": "We hear alot of parents stopping absent parents contact with their children but never when an absent parent refuses to see their children. The psychological damage done to children is huge. No able parent should ever be allowed to walk away from their children. Its a whole new form of abuse. ",
