        "action": "Introduce a 'Safe Haven' law for abandoned babies here in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The Safe Haven law typically allows unharmed children under 3 weeks of age to be surrendered at a fire station, hospital or other designated place with no names taken and no questions asked. This ensures that babies are not abandoned in cold or dangerous conditions. \r\n\r\nWhilst this is a highly emotive issue and some will argue that it encourages irresponsibility, this law will not encourage pregnant women to abandon their children, what it will do is protect societies most vulnerable. ",
        "background": "Around 50 babies are abandoned each year in the UK, that's one a week. As it is illegal to abandon a baby in the UK, desperate women will often leave them in areas that are cold and unsafe, that is why the UK needs a law like the Safe Haven law that is active in all 50 States in America.",
