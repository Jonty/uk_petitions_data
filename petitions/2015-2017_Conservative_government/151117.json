        "additional_details": "Political advertising in elections or referendums has been exempt from the British Code of Advertising since October 1999. The Committee on Standards in Public Life said in 1998 that political parties adopt a code of their own, no progress has been made. \r\nPolitical statements and adverts can, legally, be untruths or opinions stated as fact with no recourse.\r\nWe call upon all parties to indicate FACT as such, and OPINION as such via a voluntary code, so the public is able to distinguish easily.",
        "background": "With some public disillusionment over recent political claims, the introduction of an all-party voluntary code of ethics for political adverts should be considered.\r\nA mandatory code or legal governance has been deemed impossible, so please sign a voluntary code to show respect for the electorate.",
