        "action": "Stop forcing Year 10 and Year 11 students to do PE once they begin their GCSEs",
        "additional_details": "We should be given the double period that PE fills to have a free period for revision or an extra lesson of English, Maths, Science and/or one of our option blocks. PE just fills a gap that isn't needed given that, once you get to Year 10, the PE teachers do not care what you do in lessons and wouldn't even realise if we weren't there. Most students tend to muck around in the lesson and/or just stand there doing nothing when we could be utilizing the time wisely focussing on our imminent GCSEs\r\n",
        "background": "I believe that it shouldn't be compulsory for Year 10 & 11 students to do PE twice a week. It is a waste of time for the majority of students and if we wanted to do PE at school, then we would've chosen it as a GCSE option. The periods could be used to utilize the time preparing for imminent GCSEs",
