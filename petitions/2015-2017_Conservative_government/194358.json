        "additional_details": "Many solutions have not been explored such as giving parents the choice how they want their child to catch up missed school work e.g: parent supported homework, reallocating fines to lunchtime/after school tuition (creating tutor jobs/work experience for older children at school), changing teacher contracts so they have 5 weeks holiday like everyone else whilst increasing their salary by 20% (the % time in holiday they lose) & finally legislating for a cap on % increases during 'peak' times.  ",
        "background": "The inequality between the freedom to enjoy to holiday where and when you want at a low cost and how family with children are penalised and demonised by the school system or robbed by opportunistic holiday costs must stop. ",
