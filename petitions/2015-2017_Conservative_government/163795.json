        "additional_details": "I feel that the construction of these signs is a danger to life and there appears to be more lightweight options available that are in use in other areas of the motorway system. A vehicle coming into contact with these signs supported on steel girders will quiet simply be cut in half by the force of the collision. I recently attended an incident on the m3 near Basingstoke where a driver lost a leg.",
        "background": "As a retained firefighter for Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service I have recently attended  an rtc where a van came into contact with a roadside motorway sign which was mounted on steel girders. This collision left the driver with life changing injuries. There are a number of these signs on the m3.",
