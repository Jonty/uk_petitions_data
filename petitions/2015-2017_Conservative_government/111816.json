        "action": "Ban the captivity of all cetaceans in the United Kingdom",
        "additional_details": "Some cetaceans can swim up to 100 miles per day. This is more than any facility would ever be able to accommodate and is perhaps why the UK has not held cetaceans in many years. Since the UK is already aware that it cannot meet the minimum legal requirements, let's change the law altogether by permanently banning cetacean captivity once and for all! ",
        "background": "It has been proven many times that cetaceans are far too emotionally, socially and physically complex to thrive in a captive environment. Their needs are simply too great for us to meet. SeaWorld, Loro Parque and many more facilities are constantly under scrutiny for their lack of welfare.",
