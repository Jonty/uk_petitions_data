The migrant riots in a number of EU states may well be the surfacing frustration of their anticipation of what is to come. this coupled with the weapons finds in Egypt and Greece, and the discovery of an ISIS fighter in Stuttgart, and boxes of fake Syrian Passports, gives reasonable grounds to conclude that ISIS did not make an idle threat. ",
