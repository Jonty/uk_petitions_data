        "additional_details": "Many carers have to give up jobs and careers in order to do a job that the local authority should be doing and get little or no thanks and support. Full time carers should be at least entitled to the minimum wage and statutory holidays with replacement care provided by local authorities. Anything less than this is just slave labour with the government taking unfair advantage of an unrecognized, unapreciated and valuable work force that, last year, paid for the NHS budget",
        "background": "Official figures have estimated that unpaid carers save the government \u00a3162 bn per yr. The cost of a local authority providing the same level of in home care is avrg \u00a317.20 per hr.\r\nThe threshold for someone claiming carers allowance is a min of 35hrs per week @ \u00a362,10 that is \u00a31.77p per hr !",
