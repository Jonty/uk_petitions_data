        "background": "Corrosive liquids can be bought easily in DIY stores or online and disguised in drinks bottles. In law, a stabbing is an attempted murder, while an acid attack is only GBH. There's no specific offence regarding acid attacks, even though the impact on the victim can be far worse than a stabbing.",
