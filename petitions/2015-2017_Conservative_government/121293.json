        "action": "Call a referendum on the NHS to be fully funded and to stop privatisation.",
        "additional_details": "I trained as a nurse in the NHS and it would seem that, other than voting out the present government, we need a referendum to ask the people what they think. \r\nThe NHS has been an important and essential aspect of many peoples lives and everyone in this country has either been treated, knows someone who has received treatment, or had a life saved by the NHS. It is one of the most effective and respected healthcare systems in the world. Unfortunately it is systematically being destroyed.",
        "background": "The NHS has been providing this country with an excellent health service for decades and now it seems it is more at risk than at any time in it's history. The present government seems to be selling off the NHS to private companies and under funding it as a means to undermine it. This has to stop.",
