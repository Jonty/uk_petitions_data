        "action": "Hold a second referendum on EU membership when the exit terms are made clear.",
        "additional_details": "Such a decision should not be decided by one narrowly won poll, especially where votes were cast without knowing the actual terms the UK will face. Many issues were compressed into this single decision, such as a desire to reform the EU or to reject orthodox views.  Surveys held since the referendum show many changed minds on the result.  Our democracy respects the concepts of checks and balances. The UK democratic choice can only be clear with a second vote when the exit terms are clear.",
        "background": "The UK referendum held in June 2016 on EU membership returned \"leave\" yet less than a 2% swing would have resulted in \"remain\". The exit terms were unknown, obliging voters to guess. Over 4 million petitioned for a 2nd referendum based on the close result. The lack of exit terms adds further reason.",
