        "additional_details": "Currently, even for the worst crimes, the max sentences available are only up to 6 months, with max fines of \u00a320,000, among other lesser sanctions. The Act was been designed to evolve over time and change people's attitudes towards animals. I believe increasing custodial sentences up to a max of 4 years, raising max fines to \u00a3100,000 and looking into other sanctions which could be improved or introduced would promote and strengthen the act, give it more weight and discourage offenders.",
        "background": "Magistrates have a range of sanctions available when finding someone guilty under the act. In the real world however these sanctions are not doing enough to stop offences occurring. They are not severe enough to act as a deterrent nor do they do enough to rehabilitate, educate and punish offenders.",
