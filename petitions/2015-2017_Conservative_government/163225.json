        "additional_details": "Estate Agents have to travel around a lot of the time and park in places where there are permits only. We then get ticketed for doing our jobs. Providing a permit for Estate Agents, you can still charge for them at a reasonable cost. Also, when we get a ticket for parking somewhere, it is only because we do not have a choice. Public transport is not cost or time effective. Also, when we get a ticket, we have to pay for these out of our commission, making it unfair for our earning potential",
        "background": "As an Estate Agent, it proves to be very difficult to find parking spots which are not permits only. Especially in London. If we get a ticket, it is down to us to pay for the ticket, sometimes costing a lot of money. I believe there should be a permit purely for an Estate Agent to purchase.",
