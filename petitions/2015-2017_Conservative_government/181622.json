        "additional_details": "If we close, the only way parents and children can get help will be through a social service system, and they wont step in until someone is actually in danger. Prevention is cheaper and BETTER than a cure. We are a community driven service meeting the needs of families.\r\nWe help parents going through domestic violence, abuse, money problems, disability, mental health issues - anyone who needs help, we are here. We provide CBT counseling, healthy lifestyle courses, CAP money courses and group too.",
        "background": "Children's centre's provide a wide variety of services to both children and parents/carers. They are here to help your children learn, develop and grow. We are also here to keep them safe. We put in preventative steps for people who are struggling rather than waiting for something bad to happen.",
