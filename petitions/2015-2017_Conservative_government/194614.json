        "additional_details": "On 29th December 2016, my brother became ill suddenly. I was able to perform CPR until paramedics arrived. As you can probably imagine, I felt so helpless in this situation but upon reflection, at least I knew what to do - so many would have been powerless with no choice but to sit and wait until help arrived.\r\nMy brother was then airlifted to hospital, where he was found to have an aneurysm on his brain. Sadly, my brother lost his battle on the 30th December - as the bleed had affected his brain stem function. \r\nEarly intervention is crucial in ensuring more people survive life-threatening illnesses this is why pupils should be taught as part of the national curriculum. ",
        "background": "I believe as part of the School syllabus, all KS3 pupil's should be taught basic First Aid and CPR so they know how to react if an unforeseen circumstance arises. \r\n\r\n",
