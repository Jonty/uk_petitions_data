        "additional_details": "it can be noticed very easily that if someone tries to park a vehicle on the very side of a space at one end of an array of spaces, the next driver parking to the next space tends to park away as much as possible from the other empty space next to it. This proves that there is a tendency to protect the vehicle. The nowadays size of parking spaces is too outdated. It would have been enough 50 years ago when sizes of cars were tiny.",
        "background": "parking spaces are too narrow, especially in recent times when drivers are preferring bigger vehicles (i.e. SUVs). With current parking spaces size vehicles very often get indentations and scratches from other vehicles parked nearby. It would make a lot of sense to widen spaces at least by 10 inches",
