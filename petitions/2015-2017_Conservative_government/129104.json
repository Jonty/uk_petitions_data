        "action": "The UK must renegotiate deal with EU regarding the cruel trade and import of fur",
        "additional_details": "On fur factory farms, animals are crammed into tiny cages, deprived of space, proper hygiene, and often skinned alive. Years ago, red paint was thrown on wearers of fur in protest. No penalties exist for some of the largest fur exporters on the planet - this industry should never have become acceptable. \r\nPrevious petitions for banning fur were rejected as the UK has no control over this issue. A condition for its stay in the EU should be a ban on the import and sale of fur in the UK is debated.",
        "background": "As the fur industry grows - worth $40 billion worldwide - the cruelty it funds is becoming clear, and a UK ban gains support. The 'in/out' referendum approaches for the UK, and upon the option of staying in the EU, the proposal to ban the trade and import of fur in the UK should be considered.",
