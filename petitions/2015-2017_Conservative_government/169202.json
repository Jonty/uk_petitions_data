They have published guidance in the measures to be taken to reduce this. DofE guidance is not statutory and this means staff are being put at risk as they are unsure what to do",
        "background": "In the UK there is no Statutory Guidance for the use of force for Education staff to ensure their Safety. The Guidance published by the Department of Education is non Statutory, this is placing education staff in dangerous situations as they are unsure what action they can take to protect themselves",
