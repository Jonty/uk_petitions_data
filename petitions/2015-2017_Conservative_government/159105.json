        "action": "Fully regulate Student Loans Company, with reform of the repayment process.",
        "additional_details": "Graduates leave education with thousands of pounds worth of debt that is repaid via their payslips. The money is collected by HMRC and passed to Student Loans Company annually to be credited to the outstanding balance.\r\n\r\nCurrent arrangements mean that money is frequently not credited to the loan, despite being paid by the graduate. This means it can take longer to repay a student loan, while interest is accrued.\r\n\r\nHMRC and SLC do not to have mechanisms to check/rectify mistakes in a timely manner.",
        "background": "Many graduates have been left thousands of pounds short by an administrative process that is not fit for purpose. This petition calls on the Government to reform the repayment process and regulate Student Loans Company in line with retail lenders.",
