        "additional_details": "Auto immune diseases such as IBS, Crohns Disease, Arthritis Fibromyalgia and Celiac Disease can be caused by years of undiagnosed food intolerances, Children can also suffer permanent damage due to constant infections the body can't fight as the immune system is always on high alert against what it sees as poison. A simple test and diet change can save our children from a lifetime of pain and save the NHS an enormous amount of money",
        "background": "Thousands of children are going into adulthood suffering from undiagnosed food intolerances which lead to serious auto immune diseases. With a simple finger prick blood test, we can keep them healthy and save pain, suffering and money all round. ",
