        "additional_details": "There are reports coming out of Marseille that an England fan was pushed under a metro train in Marseille, and many England fans were chased out of the stadium by Hooligan Russian fans. These hooligans also set off flares during the match, endangering the lives of many people. Russian fans were starting fights in the streets. Russia is a very xenophobic country which does not help to keep traveling fans safe.",
        "background": "Before their first match Russian fans had already started to attack fans of other nations. We would like the tournament to be moved so to protect fans of other nations. If a suitable location could not be found we would rather that the tournament be cancelled altogether to protect fans.",
