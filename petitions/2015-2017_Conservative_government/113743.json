        "additional_details": "Typically, I would not like isolate Halal meat but I have never come across restaurants serving Kosher meat to such a great extent.\r\nI think that there should be a balance and people should have the option to choose according to their dietary requirements and religious beliefs. Especially, in restaurant chains where the customer doesn\u2019t have an option. ",
        "background": "In recent years in the UK, many food establishments have been serving us Halal food as the only option. \r\nHowever, you live in a big city, you will be able to appreciate how hard it is to come across restaurants, takeaways, etc. where non-Halal food is not an option.",
