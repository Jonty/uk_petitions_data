        "action": "Create an offenders register for people who have been banned from owning animals",
        "additional_details": "Recently, the RSPCA have stated that they get a call every 15 seconds that involves animal abuse. Within half an hour, they will have received 10 calls. They are asking people to help them, such as creating petitions and reporting people suspected of abusing animals. Therefore, this is a petition for a animal abuse offenders list, which will be one of the first in the world. If the government were to go through with this, there will be less stress on the RSPCA, and can improve animals lives.",
        "background": "Year after year, hundreds of animals are being subject to animal abuse. People do get banned from owning animals for a certain period of time, but there is no way for people who give animals homes to see who is banned from owning one. Therefore this petition is to show support to the RSPCA.",
