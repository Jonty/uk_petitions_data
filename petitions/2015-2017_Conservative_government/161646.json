        "action": "Make transport to and from schools free of charge for all under 18's",
        "additional_details": "Even with reduced rates available, this is a large financial burden. Consequently, many students are driven to school by their parents, which is seen as a step backwards in terms of independence and maturity. In addition, this leads to increased congestion around schools and traffic on the roads, which is already a significant problem. There is no reason to treat 16-19 year olds differently to younger students, as they all have to remain in full time education.",
        "background": "In schools across the UK, transport to and from school is free of charge for students in year 11 and under. However, for sixth formers and college students, who also have to be in full time education by law, it costs \u00a3750 a year.",
