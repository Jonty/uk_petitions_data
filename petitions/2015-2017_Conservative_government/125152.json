        "additional_details": "The prime minister and his merry men are playing god with peoples lives and this has to stop and stop now. The prime minister is NOT medically trained therefore has no rights in demanding cuts to disability benefit for those who clearly need this financial help. The government are clearly happy to pay immigrants etc large benefit hand outs \"Yet\" will NOT look after our own.\r\nI have worked for 26 years and have now been told i need this help too.\r\nI've paid into the system, yet will struggle now!",
        "background": "This is a petition to our country's government to tell them to scrap the idea of cutting disabled peoples disability benefits. The prime minister is NOT medically trained and has NO rights telling them to work for their money if the person in benefit has been deemed unfit by a medical  professional.",
