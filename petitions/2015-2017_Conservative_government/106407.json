            "details": "The Government won the General Election in 2015 and is implementing its manifesto.\r\n\r\nThe Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, which came into force in 2011 under the Coalition Government, removed the power to set the general election date from the Government and gave a power to the House of Commons to call an early general election in certain circumstances. An early general election can only be called under the Act if either a motion (as worded in section 2(2) of the Act) that there shall be an early parliamentary general election is passed by the House of Commons with at least two thirds in favour of the motion; or if a motion of no confidence (as worded in section 2(4) of the Act) is passed by the House of Commons and the House does not pass a motion of confidence (as worded in section 2(5) of the Act) in the Government or an alternative Government  within 14 days.  Aside from these triggers there is no way to replace the Government through an early General Election.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister is required by the Act to appoint a committee to review the operation of the Act between 1 June 2020 and 30 November 2020.\r\n\r\nLeader of the House",
