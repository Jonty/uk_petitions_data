        "action": "Add LGBT education, in particular transgender education, to Year 6+ curriculum.",
        "additional_details": "By introducing LGBT education earlier in the last year of primary schooling, education about transgender and homosexual people will be increased and normalised. If we raise our children in a society that encourages self exploration and differences, the number of hate crimes will sufficiently decrease. Transgender and homosexual education should be legally introduced into the Year 6 curriculum and should be continued to be taught until the end of a child's education.\r\nStatistics: www.gov.uk",
        "background": "Hate crime against transgender people in the UK has risen significantly by 41% and hate crime influenced bt sexual orientation has rised by 29% since 2014. One of the main reasons why this has happened is due to ignorance and lack of LGBT knowledge within schools across the UK.",
