        "additional_details": "It is devastating how many teenagers not only do not understand the meaning of feminism, but also how many promote a feminism which exclusively supports the empowerment of white, straight, cis-gender, able-bodied and financially-stable women. Teaching secondary school children about the importance of inter-sectional feminism would help to raise a generation which believes in equality for women of all race, sexuality and class. ",
