        "additional_details": "The UK and it's Westminster Parliament are renowned around the world for being a sound and long lasting democracy. \r\n\r\nDuring the last General Election, there were many accusations of overspending by a number of political organisations. Many of those accused won their seats and now sit in the House of Commons. \r\n\r\nWith Theresa May calling a 'snap' general election, and police investigations still under way, it would be sensible to invite international election observers to monitor the next general election.",
        "background": "A number of MP's are currently being investigated by the police for overspending in the last General Election. It would be wrong for them to be allowed to stand without being observed. ",
