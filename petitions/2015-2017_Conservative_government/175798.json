        "action": "Force negotiations between company bosses and unions to be made public",
        "additional_details": "We request that negotiations, such as those taking place at ACAS be recorded and made public, so that we the people affect, often paying customers, have a clearer understanding. We believe unions and bosses alike will strongly endorse this measure as they have nothing to hide with regards to what their negotiating positions are.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it will give the public an opportunity to weigh in on what they think a fair deal is for staff at these organisations",
        "background": "In the run up to Christmas, unions have tactfully made yet another play for a pay rise using the holiday season as an opportunity to disrupt people's lives and demand better conditions.\r\n\r\nYet discussions at conciliatory services, such as ACAS, are rarely made public beyond their highlights ",
