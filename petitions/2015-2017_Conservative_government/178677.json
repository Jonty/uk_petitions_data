        "action": "Introduce minimum commission rates for shopkeepers processing utility services.",
        "additional_details": "Shopkeepers operate upto 24hrs a day making them ideal agents for utility payment companies like PayPoint and Payzone who hold the multi-million pound contracts. Processing these payments, shopkeepers are keeping the U.K operating. Recent years have seen shopkeepers forcibly tied into long term payment processing contracts or risk losing the service which would inconvenience their customers. Then in deliberate attacks on their businesses the commission rates are cut. This exploitation must end.",
        "background": "TV Licence, Telephone, Gas and Electric payments once paid at the Post Office have been passed onto shopkeepers to process for as little as 7p maximum commission no matter how high the bill being paid. When the cash is banked, charges levied leave them in financial loss. This must end immediately.",
