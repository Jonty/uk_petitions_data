        "additional_details": "Lord Justice Lloyd Jones and Mr Justice Blake in their decision said the government was entitled to adopt a cut-off period \u201cat which extended residence abroad might indicate a weakening of ties with the United Kingdom\u201d. This is of course nonsense to relate such a decision to the many UK citizens living in Europe whose lives depend on membership of the EU. If the disenfranchised had been allowed a vote, the result would have been very different.",
        "background": "Millions living abroad were denied a vote. The 15 year rule in this case is ludicrous, and the recent legal decision before the referendum should be challenged & dismissed as irrelevant. ",
