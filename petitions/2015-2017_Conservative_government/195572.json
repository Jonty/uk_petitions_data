        "action": "Remove reassessments for PIP for those already receiving Disability Allowance.",
        "additional_details": "This petition is in place to ask the government to only apply new rules and assessments to new applicants for PIP rather than put people who already suffer with disabilities - both physical and mental - through the traumatic experience of reapplying and reassessment when this was done by the DWP when applying for Disability Allowance. There is no need to inflict this on the disabled community and the government should look elsewhere to save money, not to those who are already suffering enough!",
        "background": "The government have decided to end Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for all people aged between 16 and 64 and asked them to apply for PIP (Personal Independence Payment). It is also asking over 70% of applicants to go through a reassessment, despite previous assessments being carried out by DWP",
