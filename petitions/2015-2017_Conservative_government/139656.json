        "additional_details": "The results of the EU referendum were skewed by deception. The public feel cheated and betrayed. This subverts democracy and reinforces the public's distrust in politicians.\r\n\r\nIf this is not addressed, it is going to be increasingly difficult for anyone to govern this country.\r\n\r\nI am 63 and currently developing a sustainable decision-making process that will transform politics, leadership, economics and business. Currently preparing patents for a product launch next year.",
        "background": "Hold MP's accountable during elections and referendums if they 1. Manipulate the truth, 2.  Offer false promises, 3. Directly or indirectly encourage public anger that could result in violence. A scorecard of all MP's could be accessible to the public.\r\n\r\n",
