        "action": "The FA committee needs to be wholey replaced for the sake of English Football.",
        "additional_details": "Historically, the FA has always been an insular organisation who does what they want rather than what a nation of football fans want.\r\nRon Greenwood as manager instead of Brian Clough. Roy Hodgson as manager instead of Harry Redknapp. Making large sections of new Wembley corporate so fans of clubs playing in Cup Finals cannot get tickets. Badly organised selling of Euro2016 tickets which meant 1000 got returned. Inconsistency in punishments and penalties.\r\nSimply, they are not fit for purpose,",
        "background": "The Football Association is hugely out of touch with the modern game and will never make the decisions we need to become an international footballing force.\r\nWe need a completely new committee with fresh ideas, rather than the current one whose main focus is on the money for TV rights etc.",
