        "additional_details": "Yes, you can make up the cost of a railcard easily, but you still have to pay the \u00a370 and then train tickets. A student ID would then act as a free railcard, but give you slightly more than a third off. Maybe something like 40 - 45% off, but this could be disputed at a later date.\r\n\r\nIt would not only benefit students over 25 who do not have access to the 16-25 railcard and students on a budget would more likely commute by train if they can which would bring ecological benefits.",
        "background": "As a student myself, travelling by train is the easiest form of travel (Birmingham New Street is 15 minutes walk). For a 3 year railcard it is \u00a370, plus ticket prices on top. (Return to Manchester is still \u00a320). If you are a regular commuter like me, this still adds up to a lot of money.",
