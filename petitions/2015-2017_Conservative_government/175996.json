        "additional_details": "The current increase to vehicle insurance if in a non fault accident no matter if a claim was made or not is a percentage of the total premium if no in accidents (Along with other equations).\r\n\r\nThey say you are more likely to be involved in an accident because someone else hit you. Even if you were stationary at the time of the accident and not a hazard.\r\n\r\nI would also like to see insurance policies for, at least, the last 10 year refunded for those who have been affected by this.",
        "background": "Currently vehicle insurance costs increase for 3 to 5 years because of any claim made no matter if non fault or not.\r\n\r\nThis adds to the stress of being involved in an accident and penalizes people when they have done nothing wrong and are not in any way the cause of the accident.\r\n",
