        "additional_details": "The current plan of the government of an uncharted hard Brexit or to return to WTO rules severely restricts our options for the future of the country. In the 2-year period of Article 50 negotiations the negative impact may become clearer and the demographics of the UK electorate will change towards the younger voters who are more pro-Europe and public opinion may change. So, the government should keep on the table this remain option so that Parliament and the people have a more flexible choice.",
