        "action": "Increase the BASIC PAY for nurses in the NHS in line with the rise in inflation",
        "additional_details": "NHS is struggling with staffing issues and I being a nurse primarily see this as an issue because young nurses don't earn enough in the NHS and don't want to toil hard for considerably lesser amount of money. They are desperately in need of a pay rise and be in line with inflation rate. They have only received 1% pay rise in the last revision which was not a substantial increase anyway. If we have to attract more people have to come to nursing and caring they would have to be paid better. ",
        "background": "Nurses and other allied health professionals pay have not had a substantial increase for many years now. We require the nurses and HCA's pay in NHS to be increased taking into account the inflation. They are a vital working group in NHS and deserve a better pay package than what they get at present.",
