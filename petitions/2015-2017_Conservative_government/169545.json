        "additional_details": "The present governor has demonstrated by track record that he is unfit for this office, and is overtly politically biased, which is totally inappropriate. He has also publicly stated that he will not obey any instructions from the elected UK government. That is insubordination, despite any semblance of supposed independence from government.",
        "background": "The present governor has demonstrated that he is unfit to continue in this role, by his actions and by his politically-oriented public statements. He has now stated that he will not pay any attention to the views of the Tory government and its Prime Minister. He thus is not politically neutral.",
