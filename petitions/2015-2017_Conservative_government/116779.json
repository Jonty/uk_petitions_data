IPSA conducted a public consultation after 2012 and decided what the salaries of MPs should be after the election.\r\n\r\nIPSA is also repsonsible for the rules about MPs' business costs and expenses. \r\n\r\nIf you would like to contact IPSA to make this suggestion, here\u2019s how to contact them:\r\n\r\nhttp://parliamentarystandards.org.uk/About%20Us/Pages/Contact-Us.aspx\r\n"
