        "additional_details": "Many \"Leave\" voters have expressed regret in their decision as they believed their vote would stand as a \"protest vote\". Also, the full consequences of a \"Leave\" decision were not fully understood or made clear to the Electorate. The current Government stands divided on this issue and therefore cannot be effective in negotiating the UK's future, and so must be replaced. We believe that if the EU Referendum were repeated today, a \"Remain\" decision would result.",
        "background": "The only way to keep the UK united is to elect a new Government with the democratic remit to reverse the EU Referendum decision. We the undersigned call for a Vote of No Confidence in the current Government and an immediate General Election.",
