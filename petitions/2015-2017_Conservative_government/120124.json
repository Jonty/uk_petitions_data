        "additional_details": "For example, once an offer is accepted a mysterious offer will come in and when you ask for details of course they are not allowed to say. This in turn forces you to up your offer to a level you are uncomfortable with based on the word of an Estate Agent whose sole job is to drive up prices.",
        "background": "Buying a home is stressful at the best of times but when you have to deal with Estate Agents who lie/bend the truth for their gain it only worsens. I believe its now time to regulate them more and curb this culture as we have with Financial Institutions. It's deplorable how they conduct business.",
