        "additional_details": "Foreign nationals working legally in the UK provide a non-negligible contribution to the country's economy. \r\nAccording to the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford (http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/migrants-uk-labour-market-overview), \"In 2014, foreign-citizens made up 10.5% of total employment\".\r\n\r\nThese people have been forgotten by the referendum, and did no get a say in the future of the country they are living in.\r\nTherefore, the referendum should not be binding. ",
        "background": "The referendum rules excluded foreign nationals living in the UK from voting. The so-called Brexit obviously affects everyone living in the UK, not just British citizens. In light of this, the referendum does not reflect the will of people actually living and working in the UK.",
