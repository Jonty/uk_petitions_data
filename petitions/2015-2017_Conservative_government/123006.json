        "additional_details": "Most PCTs offer Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Many ONLY offer this form of therapy. Whereas CBT can offer excellent results for many people, it does not for others.\r\n  It is distressing that all PCTs do not offer a substantial range of therapies. I know this would come at a cost to the NHS. However, it is well known that mental health diagnoses are increasing. It is also widely evidenced that treating mental health efficiently, would relieve stresses on the NHS, UK workforce, and economy.",
        "background": "The postcode lottery nature of health services must be stopped!! My personal concern is regarding mental health services & available therapies. \r\n\r\nThere currently seems to be a one cure for all approach which is ludicrous and ineffectual, and ultimately causes the tax-payer extra money.
