        "additional_details": "Many other EU countries have held referenda allowing the voting public to have their say on areas such as Irelands vote on the Lisbon treaty where by Ireland voters initially rejected the treaty and forced their elected officials to engage in further talks and negotiation.  \r\n\r\nArticle 50 has never been used and the U.K. will be the first country to do so.  We are entering unknown territory and no terms have been discussed yet.\r\n\r\nWe the British public have a right to have the final say on the deal.",
        "background": "Post the Brexit referendum vote, a process will begin on negotiating the terms of our exit from the EU.\r\n\r\nWith the terms now being negotiated, I believe the public should have the final say on the proposed package for the UK to leave the EU. \r\n",
