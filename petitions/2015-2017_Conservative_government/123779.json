        "additional_details": "This is not a topic that we should even be discussing. As a nation of good people. We see that there must be ways to house, feed and most importantly educate these children who are currently living in terrible and life threatening conditions in Northern France. We cannot stand by and watch them die. There are spare beds here. \r\n\r\nThis is the opportunity to do the right thing, as a nation, united. \r\n\r\nRemember the Kindertransport. Lives saved.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, will foster a refugee child",
        "background": "Evacuate every child under the age of 16, effective immediately. \r\nThese are innocent children. They must be saved.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of compassionate people in the UK, willing to take on a refugee child. We will literally open up our front doors. Our towns, villages, cities. Our homes.",
