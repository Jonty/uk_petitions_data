        "action": "Abolish the creation of free schools to ease the funding crisis in schools",
        "additional_details": "Schools in the UK are facing a huge funding crisis. Two thirds of schools are cutting staff. 40% are cutting GCSE subjects. The repair bill for crumbling schools is almost \u00a37 billion. Parents are being asked to contribute to their child's schooling. \r\n\r\nFree schools are often set up in areas where there is no need, leading to funding pressures on other schools. Free schools fail Ofsted inspections at a higher rate than state schools. Many free schools have failed to attract pupils.",
        "background": "\r\nThe Government are investing vast amounts of taxpayers money on free school projects despite there being no evidence of this improving the system. Meanwhile, millions of children in state schools are at risk of a poor education, unless more funding is urgently provided.",
