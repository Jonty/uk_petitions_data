        "additional_details": "Currently the conservative party is so divided that it may as well be two separate parties. The leadership contest taking place in wake of Cameron's resignation amounts to a choice between the two. With that in mind, surely the decision should be framed as the general election which, in essence, it amounts to.",
        "background": "David Cameron's resignation leaves uncertainty to the future direction of the conservative party, as it is currently a very divided party, and many people want a more unified party in power. Is a party currently facing a massive schism really the best choice to govern a country?",
