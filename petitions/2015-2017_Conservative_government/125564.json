        "additional_details": "It is the chancellor who is at the heart of cuts to the NHS, the undemocratic decision to change to academies and now targeting the vulnerable by cutting DWP budgets. It is a budget with unfairness at its core with tax breaks for the wealthy and cuts for lower income. After making a u-turn he is left with a \u00a34.4bn hole that is unaccounted for. So we now have a budget that doesn't balance which will lead to another failed target of a \u00a310bn surplus by the end of parliament. ",
        "background": "In the wake of the budget, the second time the chancellor has made a major u-turn, IDS has resigned when even he could see how unfair the cuts to disability benefit were on the most vulnerable in society. Failed budgets, failed promises and failed targets. George Osborne isn't fit for purpose. ",
