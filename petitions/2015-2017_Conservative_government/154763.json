It is scary how easy politicians find it to completely fail to follow through on promises and commitments they make during elections and it is becoming more of a regular issue. They are saying anything to secure votes, then once elected they fail to honor their promises to voters and they do this without consequence.",

Then as soon as this happens they reverse their commitments without reason or apologise.",
