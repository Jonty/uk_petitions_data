        "additional_details": "The demographic data from the referendum makes it clear that there was a clear difference in the voting of those under 44 and those over 45. The young will have to live with the implications of brexit for longer and the referendum should therefore have extended the right to vote to 16 and 17 year olds to allow them a chance to influence the decision. Therefore, a second referendum should be called with an extension to minimum age.",
        "background": "Given the long term implications of brexit, the EU referendum should have given 16 and 17 years olds the opportunity to have a say in their future. The precedent for this challenge was set by the Scottish referendum.",
