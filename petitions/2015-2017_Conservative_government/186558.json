        "additional_details": "The BBC's coverage of Brexit, the US election and treatment of President Trump has highlighted the constant contravening of it's own editorial standards:\r\n \r\n1.2.1 Trust\r\n1.2.2 Truth and Accuracy\r\n1.2.3 Impartiality\r\n1.2.4 Editorial Integrity and Independence\r\n\r\nLicence fees generated from the British public provide this organisation \u00a33.75bn per year.   This should not go towards funding a political bias and selectivity on news items that do not appear to serve the BBC's own political agenda. ",
        "background": "We request parliament urgently review whether the BBC has compromised it's charter, is fit for purpose and to look into it's political leanings and agenda. A tipping point for the organisation was the President of the United States calling out the organisation for it's political impartiality.",
