        "additional_details": "I would like to bring this petition to the attention of the U.K. Government. \r\nFor people like my brother, daily life is a struggle. They often feel like they don't fit in, struggle with their health and wellbeing. Every year they are asked to describe how their condition impacts their daily living, often this doesn't change. \r\nTo be assessed, people must fill in an application, followed by a face to face assessment. Often this adds more distress to the process. Change is needed. ",
        "background": "My brother is 19 and has Aspergers Syndrome. This is something he will have for his entire life. \r\nEvery year, he has to reapply for his PIP, a process which he finds humiliating and depressing. \r\nMany feel the same.",
