        "additional_details": "I (personally) am open to everyone having the right to their own beliefs, & I believe that people unfortunately associate religion with the likes of these extremist/terrorist attacks too often which is just wrong, but i do believe that extremism is becoming too prominent to that it is un-nerving to the likes of me and others alike, therefore I believe that a form of much stricter immigration or some form of closure will further solidify our safety in Great Britain",
        "background": "The Paris attacks tonight (13/11/2015) have been another tragic example of modern extremism affecting Western civilisation, with 140 dead as far. I believe the attacks are too close to home to overlook, and with the current refugee crisis, I therefore believe in imminent, much stricter immigration",
