        "action": "Postpone Article 50 until we know what Donald Trump is up to",
        "additional_details": "Many commentators and British citizens fear the direction President Trump is taking his country. This petition recognises that the Government has committed to removing the United Kingdom from the European Union. It does not pass judgement on the merits of leaving the EU, but considers it unwise to devote resources to doing so until the relationship with the USA has become more settled. ",
        "background": "This petition requests that the Government postpone triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty until the implications of the new US President's plans become clear. President Trump is making major changes to the US foreign policy and it's far from clear that these will benefit British interests.",
