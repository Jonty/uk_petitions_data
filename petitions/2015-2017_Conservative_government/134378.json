        "additional_details": "The majority of the MP's voted for remaining in the EU, and the majority of the UK voted out. This shows a clear disparity in views between the electorate and the MP's who represent them. \r\nAdditionally, any Conservative MP who may become Prime Minister now would only have been voted for by an incredibly small percentage of the population- this is clearly undemocratic and the UK electorate should be allowed to vote on who the new Prime Minister is.\r\n",
        "background": "Following the results of the EU referendum on 24th June 2016 and David Cameron's resignation, the UK parliament undergoes a General Election within 12 months. It is important that  a majority elected Prime Minister is chosen to lead the UK following the exit of the EU.",
