There is not enough cast iron proof from the Trust for the local community to agree with the proposed changes.  Do this and then we can review it and see if we agree but do not go ahead without consultation from us.",
        "background": "Oak Ward is set to close on the 5th October 2016.  The service it provides is set to move to an upstairs ward, the community and Oxford.  Presently without proper consultation are not acceptable changes.  Burdens of care will fall to Primary Care and relatives.",
