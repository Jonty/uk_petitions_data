        "background": "in april 2016 a new qualified state pensioner was allocated a state pension of \u00a3155 per week whereas if you were a state pensioner pre april 2016 you were only allocated your existing state pension of \u00a3125 per week a difference of \u00a330 per week so why should new pensioners receive more than me",
