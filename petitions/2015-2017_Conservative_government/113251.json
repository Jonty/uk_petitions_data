        "action": "Spend Trident money on public sector services and welfare (e.g NHS, schools etc)",
        "additional_details": "The Tories plan on making \u00a312 billion of welfare cuts per year in their term, even just the initial cost of renewing Trident is roughly \u00a320 billion (as estimated by the MoD), that's almost 2 years of welfare cuts could be saved. Over its lifespan it is estimated to cost upwards of \u00a397 billion. By getting rid of this weapon that is designed to kill millions we could afford to give so many struggling families in Britain a better life by not cutting things like working tax credits. \r\n",
        "background": "Instead of cutting the NHS services, funding for schools, welfare for disabled, things that affect everyone (particularly the most vulnerable) in the country, we should not renew Trident ahead of these and use the enormous amount (see additional details for figures) of money to look after each other",
