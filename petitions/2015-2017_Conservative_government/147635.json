        "additional_details": "The British Public have very narrowly voted to leave the EU. It is widely agreed that this has come about because of a rejection of the political class who have, for many years, ignored the views of a large proportion of the population. \r\n\r\nThis referendum would propose 2 questions: \r\n\r\n1. Would you accept a repeat referendum on EU membership in return for a CAST IRON guarantee of proportional representation in Parliament?\r\n\r\n2. Do you wish Britain to remain a member of the EU?",
        "background": "This petition would require the UK Parliament offer the British Public a CAST IRON guarantee or Proportional Representation in return for a second EU Referendum. I believe this would offer us the opportunity to correct the inequalities which have fractured this country.",
