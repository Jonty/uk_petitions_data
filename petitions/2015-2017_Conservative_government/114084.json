Tf this is also backed up by the need to have clients money protection insurance and to be a member of an independent redress scheme like say TPO.Then there would be no need for any further costly Welsh Gov involvement. ",
        "background": "The legislation proposes all landlords and letting agents are licenced\r\nto be able to let a property in Wales. This in principle does have merit However the scheme put forward is over complicated and extremely costly. ",
