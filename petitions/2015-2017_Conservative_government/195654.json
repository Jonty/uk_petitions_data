        "additional_details": "If a student fails a maths GCSE test, they will have to take it again, and for a student with learning difficulties having to do this over and over again multiple times, it can be really upsetting. Many students with dyscalculia and other special educational needs, find GCSE mathematics very CHALLENGING & even DISTRESSING. There should be other options, that teach students the kind of maths that is used in every day life, like functional maths.",
        "background": "Dyscalculia, it's a very trying condition for students & teachers. many students, have to develop important maths skills to help when adults. \r\nI myself have this condition, as a GCSE student, according to my support teachers functional maths is a lot simpler. BUT there is NO OPTION for it in GCSE!",
