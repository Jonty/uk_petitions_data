        "action": "Make Fibre Optic Broadband a legal right in the United Kingdom",
        "additional_details": "Many of us pay extortionately more money for a service which is unreliable and slow, simply due to where we choose to live. For example, being in a ONE MILE exclusion zone means we will never have internet speeds over 3-5MB per second. In larger households, especially families, this means the internet is unusable due to the global initiative towards movie streaming, gaming, and downloading. Without forcing the providers to provide the service, they will continue to overcharge and under deliver.",
        "background": "Despite the 'Superfast Britain' initiative, many are still in the relative dark-ages when it comes to internet speed. No consideration has been made for those placed in very rural zones. Make fibre optic broadband a legal right in the UK and force providers to give the service we pay for.",
