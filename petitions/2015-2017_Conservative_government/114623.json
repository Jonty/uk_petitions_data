        "action": "Introduce a revenue-neutral carbon tax",
        "additional_details": "Since the industrial revolution, we have been releasing vast amounts of carbon into the atmosphere and oceans. If we continue adding to the natural carbon cycle as we are today, climate change and rising sea levels will result in the loss of coastal cities which are home to the majority of people on Earth. The only way to stop this is to move away from carbon polluters, which requires disincentivising carbon polluting activity, while incentivising sustainable alternatives. Please support this.",
        "background": "In order to minimise further climate change, we need to move away from the use of fossil fuels that pollute our atmosphere and oceans with carbon. This can be achieved by introducing a tax on carbon producing activities, while lowering tax elsewhere to mitigate the overall cost to the public.",
