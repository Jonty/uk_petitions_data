        "additional_details": "Drivers who fail to challenge the increased premiums are being charged as much as \u00a340 more for the same policy than if they were a new customer.\r\nWith over 35 million vehicles licensed in the UK (DVLA; 2013), if each driver fails to challenge their increased premium, insurers could be tricking the public out of as much as \u00a31.4 billion a year.\r\nDrivers shouldn't be forced to search for the most competitive deal every year. This sneaky practice of overcharging existing customers should be illegal.",
        "background": "Car insurance companies are profiteering from British drivers by increasing annual renewal premiums far above those offered to new customers. Only those savvy enough, and who have the time and ability to challenge the increases or search for another deal, escape these unfair penalties.",
