The referendum is advisory rather than mandatory.\r\n\r\nWhat happens next in the event of a vote to leave is therefore a matter of politics not law. The UK government could seek to ignore such a vote; to explain it away and characterise it in terms that it has no credibility or binding effect.  Or they could say it is now a matter for parliament, and then endeavour to win the parliamentary vote. ",
