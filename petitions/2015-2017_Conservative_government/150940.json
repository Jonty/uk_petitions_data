        "additional_details": "Although there is no cure there is lack of understanding by healthcare providers to the point we either have to tell them what to do ourselves or get sent home with little to no treatment plan, we get passed from doctor to doctor who each give up on us, many dont even get to the stage of diagnosis. \r\nI am asking for a nation wide campaign to educate GPS , Consultants, Nurses and health workers in general on the importance of management and understanding of these conditions. \r\nWe should not be left to suffer with no one to listen, help or control the symptoms. \r\n",
        "background": "There is a huge gap in healthcare for conditions such as gastropareses, pseudo obstruction, dysmotility , intestinal failure etc\r\nThese conditions result in severe pain, bloating, vomiting, malnutrition and inability to eat to name a few.\r\nThis severly impacts lives, & quality of life is very low.",
