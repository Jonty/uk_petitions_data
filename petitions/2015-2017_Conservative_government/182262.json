        "additional_details": "By likening honour killings to murder shows a clear lack of understanding of the complexities experienced by women from minority communities. \r\n\r\nHonour killings are different to domestic homicide, in the same way as domestic homicides are different to murder. \r\n\r\nThis term honour killings acknowledges the complexities involved in these cases and the additional difficulties faced by the women experiencing these crimes. \r\n\r\nAn example of this was the murder on Banaz Mahmod, where an entire community was silent following her murder, this is not the case in other cases of murder.  \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Campaigners fought long and hard to get the term honour crimes recognised as a different form of abuse experienced by women within minority communities. \r\n\r\nHonour killings are different to domestic homicide, in the same way as domestic homicides are different to murder. \r\n ",
