Sometimes, even ending a long and often distinguished career protecting our country at home and abroad just prior to pensionable service being entered into, that is a scandal that should shame the UK \r\nService life doesn't prepare one for civilian life. No pre-exit course no matter how well intentioned can fill that gap either. On average 9000 ex-service personnel are homeless at any one time",
        "background": "I and my family are all ex-forces so can speak with authority on the challenges that face service personnel on leaving the service. However, in the main, many of our homeless end up as such due to the horrors they have witnessed in combat and an inability to cope with its aftermath, who wouldn't. ",
