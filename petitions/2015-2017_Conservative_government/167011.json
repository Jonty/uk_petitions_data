Justice cannot be bought or resolved by a deadline. Peoples towns and villages should not be at the mercy of a few councilors and Mp's. Parliament is the Office, the reception, secretary and accounts of the UK. The people can make decisions together. This is Inevitable. Mp's waste too much on the unrequired, while the corporate buisnesses hoard.",

We can do a fairer job ourselves and can stop them making a mess of the country. They cannot even tell the truth. Lets vote out the lot of them. A real United Kingdom voting together.",
