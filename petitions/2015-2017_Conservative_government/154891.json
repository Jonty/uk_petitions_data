He now has 24/7 access to my whole garden and is able to sit and watch us from his smart phone whenever he wishes! \r\n\r\nWe have asked him to move the cameras as we have children and would prefer that they are not recorded! He has refused and there is nothing we can about it but to create this petition in hopes that you will sign to help bring back our privacy. \r\n\r\nWe need to protect ourselves and our families! PLEASE SIGN",
