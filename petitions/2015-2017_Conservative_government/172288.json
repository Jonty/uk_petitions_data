        "additional_details": "I lost my little boy, Oliver-Rhys at 6 days old from MCADD which would have been picked up on in the heel prick, and we would have been able to save him. I have since had a little girl, Fjola-Rose since my loss and she was tested within 24 hours, it came back she did have MCADD too but we have been able to manage hers due to knowing. This shows that the test can be done this early. I want to change the dates so that less families have to go through the horrible ordeal.",
