        "additional_details": "The colour scheme would become second nature to people's views towards waste disposal. The colour scheme could even extend to public litter bins on the streets.\r\n\r\nWhilst this process could take some time, it could be implemented in a phased way, as and when bins are scheduled for routine replacement.",
        "background": "Each council area has a different colour scheme for rubbish and recycling bins. This often adds to confusion over what can be recycled, and recyclable waste is often thrown away, or recyclable materials are often put in the incorrect bins.",
