        "additional_details": "There are almost 1.5 million Carers at home who cannot claim the allowance because they are in receipt of a State Pension, which most paid through employment. Go to www.carersassociation.info which shows all the stats in care. The allowance must be paid free of tax or any benefit assessments as with PIPS , when claiming Pension credits or Housing benefits . Child Carers must receive Education credits for when they may wish to move on to College on University . This will help reduce their fees .",
        "background": "Mandy Bayliffe wanted \" The Carers Charter \" to protect all Carers from cuts and provide a framework of support via community care free at the point of need. Respite , home support and even sitting Services exempt from any charges or assessment. Many Carers die of exhaustion ,so we have to act now.",
