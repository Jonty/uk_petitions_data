        "action": "We demand no changes to our EEA terms without a clear electoral mandate for such",
        "additional_details": "Unlike some other referendums, the recent UK EU referendum was silent on membership of the EEA of which the UK is an independent signatory (Porto 1992). Addtionally there is strong evidence of a large majority (remain voters plus pro-EEA leave voters) in favour of remaining in the EEA. Therefore we the undersigned feel the UK Government has no democratic mandate to forsake, modify, or negotiate away the four freedoms of the EEA without democratic proof that this is the will of the majority.",
        "background": "The UK is a signatory of the EEA which enshrines the four freedoms (goods, workers, services, capital) independent of EU membership. We the undersigned believe 'remain' voters, combined with the many 'leave' voters in favour of the EEA, creates a large UK majority in favour of our current EEA terms.",
