        "action": "Give Scotland a referendum with option for independence ONLY if UK leaves EU",
        "additional_details": "Following the EU leave vote, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is seeking an independence referendum on grounds that Scottish people do not want to leave EU. However leave voters did not know that Scottish independence was a consequence of their vote. The fairest way to address this is to urgently hold a Scottish referendum which would be binding only if UK continues to leave EU. Then UK should be given second referendum in full knowledge of the consequences of leaving EU.",
        "background": "Many people in Scotland only want independence because the UK is leaving the EU and should be given this explicit option. If results of this referendum show that leaving the EU will lead to breakup of the UK, there should be another UK referendum on leaving EU as leave voters did not know this.",
