        "additional_details": "This was a referendum where everyone had an equal say on the question. It was one person, one vote. It was a national vote, not a regional or constituency based vote. Also it was a 72% turnout - the most for a UK, nationwide election. So democracy has been served and the people have returned an answer. ",
        "background": "We believe it is not fair to move the goal posts after the fact. Therefore we should not have another referendum on EU membership just because democracy didn't give the answer some people wanted.",
