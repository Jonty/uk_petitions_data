Regardless of your political orientation, by signing this petition you will help reinforce everybody's democratic right and ensure that the policies you vote in are seen through.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, propose that government pass legislation requiring politicians to keep promises made during campaigns, and provide the voting public with the means to prosecute individuals when these promises are broken.",
        "background": "To ensure our votes matter, we must have a way of holding politicians personally responsible for enacting the policies we vote for. We therefore need a more robust system that holds our politicians legally accountable to their statements.",
