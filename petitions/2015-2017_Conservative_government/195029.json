        "additional_details": "The broadcast of air traffic control (as on www.liveatc.net) has never caused a problem to the aviation industry or authorities in the USA and in other countries who allow the free broadcast of ATC. By allowing the online broadcast of it, aviation enthusiasts, hobbyists and others would benefit extremely well and would allow them to become more invested in their hobby. Please remove this outdated and irrelevant 1942 law.",
        "background": "Ofcom state that \"It is an offence to listen to any other radio services unless you are authorised by a designated person to do so\".\r\nAlthough not even relevant to the monitoring or broadcast of ATC, Ofcom still maintain that one mustn't broadcast ATC (to the dismay of many UK aviation enthusiasts).",
