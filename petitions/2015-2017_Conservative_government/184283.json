        "additional_details": "Why do we live? There is no fundamental law saying that we must all keep on going, but we do because we want to! Thus, should we live as we do not want? For the true meaning of life is not to learn of the men of old, but to do what one wishes and see this world truly, not through the eyes of \"greater\" men. Therefore, do not waste the very pinnacle of life with whiteboards and desks and pens, but allow our children to discover the world for themselves and come to love it, and not make them stress, toil and anger over copious works of other people. By this they will be more creative, making their own view, and will lead to a more advanced, happier and better society.",

It was designed for fast-paced reaction, cunning development, and sociable interaction, not to be sat in a classroom and given every known fact. The thrill is in seeking the truth for oneself; to experience every aspect of our universe!",
