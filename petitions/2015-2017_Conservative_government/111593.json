        "action": "The Government to rethink Social housing rent increase of 80% of market rate.",
        "additional_details": "George Osborne has stated that if people earn \u00a340000 in London and \u00a330000 outside London they will have their rent increased by 80% of the market rate. There will be many families unable to meet this rent increase. Social housing is there for people who cannot afford private rents for whatever reason and this safety net will be removed and up to 300,000 will be affected. This is planned to come into affect in April 2017.",
        "background": "300,000 people may be left unable to stay where they are. The upheaval for the very young and the very old will be immense. It is simply not fair. A huge majority of these people will be working and paying taxes etc. It sounds a lot but \u00a340,000 is not a lot if you are supporting a family.",
