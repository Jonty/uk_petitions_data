        "additional_details": "The UK government need to increase the budgets for our emergency services not reduce them further.  We need more police officers, ambulances and fire services to keep the British people safe from horrific attacks by terrorists.  If the government continue with these cuts they will be failing to protect the British people from such possible attacks.  We are currently dealing with horrendous threats from extremists and it would be dangerous to now make more cuts and make our country vulnerable!\r\n",
        "background": "The government has already cut the budgets of our vital emergency services such as the police, fire brigade, ambulances and the armed forces and proposes to reduce these further.  How can the UK defend itself from horrific attacks by terrorists and extremists if we do not have adequate resources?",
