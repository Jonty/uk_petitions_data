But it seems like they are getting away with it and not being held responsible for their actions. \r\nTrains have either been cancelled or delayed massively over the past month plus.  Southern blame this on strikes however even when a train is on the tracks and moving it still gets delayed?!? \r\nWe need to remove southern rail from their contract and get our trains in some sort of order. ",
        "background": "Southern rail are an absolute joke at the moment. Their blaming everything or everyone other than themselves for not getting trains on time. If it's not strikes or drivers pay, it's leaves, hot weather, floods ice or snow?!! \r\n",
