        "additional_details": "1. The OBR has a gloomier outlook for the future than he does.\r\n2. He will breach his own 'Charter for Budget Responsibility' as the GDP debt ratio rises in the coming year. . again.\r\n3. He will miss his welfare cap target in the coming year... again.\r\n4. His predicted budget surplus in 2019-2020 is more accurately predicted by the OBR as a 3.5bn deficit. His own accountancy on the matter is more based on 'creative assumption' than actual fact.",
        "background": "George Osborne has consistently failed to meet his own targets thereby proving beyond any shadow of a doubt the level of his incompetence. A vote of no confidence should be sought in an effort to have him removed from his post before he inflicts any further fiscal carnage on the British economy.",
