        "additional_details": "Employers are under no legal obligations to stick to start dates or maintain a worker for the duration of the initial assignment details. This means workers can be left unemployed with no notice, but temporary workers are still kept to a notice period if they want to leave. For people who have a job opportunity in the future, temp work is often the only option for them. There needs to be better protection for all workers, permanent or temporary. ",
        "background": "Currently there is no legal protection for temporary workers. A worker can be given an assignment and the employer can cancel it or change the start date at any point. You can turn up on a day and be told them and there that the assignment is over. This leads to unstable financial situations. ",
