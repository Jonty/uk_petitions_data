        "action": "Introduce a mandatory deposit on plastic and glass bottles to reduce waste.",
        "additional_details": "The system is foolproof. Bottles discarded by consumers are frequently collected and returned by people in need of money, thus benefiting all members of society, enabling the recycling process is consistent. The introduction of the deposit on one-way beverage packaging in Germany has been a huge success. 98.5% of refillable bottles are returned by customers. Deposit systems benefit the environment, increase producer responsibility and decrease costs for municipalities.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Buy a bottle. Pay a deposit. Return it - and get your money back. The simplicity of the system has the potential to positively affect consumer behaviour by encouraging them to return bottles to stores, who will then recycle them. This system combats our current throw-away culture.  ",
