The two little boys who washed up on a Turkish beach today died because we did nothing to help them in their family's desperate plight. \r\nIf you feel as sick and helpless as I do at the lack of humanity being shown by the UK government then sign this petition and make your voice heard 100'000 signatures will get this discussed in the House of Commons. Something must be done. Act now! ",
