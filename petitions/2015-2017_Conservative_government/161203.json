        "additional_details": "This would ensure that strong leaders with vision become the loudest voices, rather than those with financial backing from vested interests.\r\n\r\nThe Conservatives would cease to be hijacked by the interest of big business and lobby groups and Labour would cease to be highjacked by the Unions. \r\n\r\nThere would be a genuinely level playing field which would encourage radical, positive change.\r\n\r\nOnly then can we create a political system that is truly representative - and one that we can all be proud of.",
        "background": "Instead, all parties which command a minimum membership, should receive an identical sum from the state for all promotional activities. All eligible parties should be funded by the taxpayer. \r\n\r\nAccepting funding in any form from a third party would become a criminal offence.",
