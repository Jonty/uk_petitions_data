Unable to find transport to S.Korea, most escape to China in search for an end to the suffering they endured in N.K. \r\nInternational law states that China has an obligation to protect refugees but, despite this, a Chinese crackdown has refused to grant desperate families schooling, health care or citizenship. \r\nReferences: goo.gl/YEHKkq goo.gl/VoazhU goo.gl/bDkJVf ",

Chinese authorities repatriate N.K. refugees who then face torture and imprisonment. We implore our govt to intervene and stop China's repatriation of N.K. refugees.",
