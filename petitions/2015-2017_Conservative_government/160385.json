        "additional_details": "Many voted in protest against the loss of UK control in areas such as migration levels, law and uncontrolled EU bureaucracy. We feel the EU needs to change radically and the UK cannot accept it as it is. The referendum was a huge question to put to the UK and voters were persuaded by politicians using emotions rather than relevant arguments. We want a second referendum to make sure that we have made the right decision.",
        "background": "Although the UK voted to leave, numerous voters are now concerned that they have made the wrong decision. Prior to activating article 50 we want our government to go back to the EU and negotiate a better deal. If we get an acceptable deal then we want a second referendum.",
