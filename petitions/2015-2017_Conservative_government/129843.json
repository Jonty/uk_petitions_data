        "action": "Recognise the UK standard of firearm deactivation as equivalent to EU standards.",
        "additional_details": "The UK standard of deactivation is acknowledged as the best in Europe, and makes it impossible to re-activate a firearm without completely rebuilding the weapon. Imposition of the EU standard in the UK is a complete waste of taxpayers money, is disrupting a process previously recognised by government as effective in taking live firearms out of circulation, and penalises owners by making it illegal to sell or transfer safe UK deactivated firearms that will be unfairly classified as \u2018defective\u2019.",
        "background": "Proposed legislation in the Policing and Crime Bill intends to enforce the application of a EU standard that will result in firearms previously deactivated to UK Home Office standards being classified as defectively deactivated.  The EU standard is inferior to the UK standard and unnecessary here. ",
