        "action": "Inform the Prime Minister Mr Cameron we have no confidence in his leadership.",
        "additional_details": "The P.M. invited the President of the USA, Barack Obama, to make a speech on behalf of the Pro European stance. Obama stated that Britain would be pushed to the \"Back of the Queue\" as far as trade was concerned if we voted to leave the EU. A hundred years of \"Special Friendship\" almost destroyed in just a few minutes. \r\nWhile Obama was stabbing British Trade and the British people in the back, our P.M., was looking on very pleased with himself and then he applauded the damning speech. Shameful.",
        "background": "David Cameron's leadership with regard to the forthcoming EU referendum is based on lies, fear and deceit. The British people want and expect honesty and integrity from a man in his position and this is plainly lacking in The Prime Minister and his Pro- European colleagues.",
