        "additional_details": "Uber drivers are sitting outside pubs/clubs & gestering people toward their vehicles. For starters, touting is illegal even in the hackney carriage licensed trade, let alone the private hire trade. These are unlicensed mini cabs that are trying to make people think they are properly licensed taxis.\r\nBy doing this, they are also making their insurance null & void. They are insured only to pick up bookings using the Uber app.",
        "background": "Uber vehicles/drivers licensed by TFL are becoming a pest in local council Taxi licensed areas outside of London. They are also illegally touting for business in these areas. As a result, the local licensed hackney carriage & private hire trades are suffering loss of earnings.",
