        "action": "Build a new Parliament building fit for the 21st Century.",
        "additional_details": " Accommodation could be included which would eradicate the need for expensive second homes. At the same time the chamber could be large enough for all 650 MP's. Currently they can't all fit in the house of commons. Offices could be better designed and equipped. If the house of Lords is abolished that chamber could be omitted. The Palace of Westminster could still be used during construction instead of rehousing parliament with all the inherent security and operational difficulties.",
        "background": "Instead of spending a fortune on a decaying building that is build on extremely valuable land. Sell it for redevelopment and construct a purpose built Parliament building fit for the 21st century on cheaper land more central to the country.",
