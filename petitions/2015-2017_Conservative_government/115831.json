        "additional_details": "We are strongly opposed to the Government's plan to end lifetime tenancies for people living in council housing. \r\n\r\nThis will have a disastrous impact on communities across the country. \r\n\r\nWe urge you to think again and restore this long-held right for council tenants immediately.",
        "background": "The Tories have quietly removed the right of residents to stay in their council house for life in the Housing and Planning Bill.\r\n\r\nInstead councils will only be allowed to offer secure tenancies of two to five years and 'review' the tenant's circumstances before deciding whether to kick them out.",
