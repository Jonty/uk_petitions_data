        "action": "Seek UK exemption from article 20 of the EU Tobacco Products Directive (TPD).",
        "additional_details": "Article 20 of the EU Tobacco Products Directive (TPD)  will have a detrimental effect on users and suppliers of E-cigarettes. The TPD will limit user choice and ban advertising which may speak to current smokers. The TPD will also impose punitive regulatory costs and obligations on suppliers which will damage UK businesses, result in job losses and create an uncompetitive monopoly which favours the pharmaceutical and tobacco industries. ",
        "background": "This petition calls on the government to seek exemption from article 20 of the TPD. Exemption will save UK jobs, prevent the emergence of an E-cigarette black market, allow promotion of E-cigarettes to current smokers and encourage use of E-cigarettes by not limiting user choice. ",
