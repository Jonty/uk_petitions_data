        "action": "Ban Halal slaughter in the UK - set an example!",
        "additional_details": " Unlabelled Halal meat is currently circulating in our food chain, from supermarket shelves to restaurants. It is wrong to do this as I, and many others, would like to be given a choice to NOT eat this meat. Halal slaughter is performed either without pre-stunning, or using a reversible stun. Halal slaughterhouses are also exempt from prosecution for animal cruelty on the grounds of ''religious rights''. This needs to be stopped, as no ''religion'' usurps the rights of animals.",
        "background": "Halal slaughter has often been pushed as a humane way to slaughter animals, in accordance with Islamic ''law''. On the contrary, I think having your carotid artery sliced & being left to bleed out whilst gasping for that last breath is anything but humane, and is nothing more than animal barbarism!",
