        "additional_details": "I myself was a target, a victim of rape by an online sex predator. I have found myself that it is impossible to prove as unless youre into swinging or take a third person on a date with you its a 'your word against theirs' kinda crime. Deception itself is easy to prove as once these sexual predators have got their ego boost, theyre no longer interested and drop the act. Internet dating will soon become the number 1 way to meet someone, and as the law stands nothing stops these monsters!",
        "background": "Online dating has lead to an increase of rape incidents as its easier for sexual predators to target vulnerable people, even though rape is still massively under-reported. Convictions of this crime are still lagging behind others and changes to current law need changing to address this!",
