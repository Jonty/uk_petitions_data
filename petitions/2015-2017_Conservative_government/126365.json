        "additional_details": "By schools offering rewards and incentives to children that achieve 100% attendance records they are  penalising children with health needs and disabilities through no fault of their own. They may also have an underlying condition that make them more susceptible to illness requiring absence that they cannot control. We are asking that schools be required by law to make these reasonable adjustments so that children can still participate fully in attendance certificate awards, like their peers.",
        "background": "Imagine what it is like to always be the child that will never get an attendance certificate / reward, due to having ongoing healthcare needs & disabilities that impact on a full attendance record.",
