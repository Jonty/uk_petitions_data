        "additional_details": "Our country amongst others in Europe are faced with housing/ taking in thousands of refugees. But who are we letting into the UK? I believe in helping the ones in need of sanctuary, people that are fleeing their own war torn country. However I believe that each person should have vigilant background checks to keep our country safe from terrorists. ISIS have warned us of their plans to infiltrate the UK. Sign this petition to make our voice heard by parliament and ensure our safety.",
        "background": "ISIS warned earlier this year that they would infiltrate the UK with 5,000 disguised terrorists. Now we are faced with tens of thousands of immigrants trying to cross borders across Europe to reach the UK. ",
