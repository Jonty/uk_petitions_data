        "additional_details": "The rail service is largely subsidised by the numerous taxes and contributions we pay into public sector funds. It is absolutely absurd that think some of the taxes way pay, is then paid to a German company.\r\n\r\nWhen posting an operating profit of \u00a322,768,000, we demand greater reinvestment into the outdated infrastructure and equipment. A publicly funded company that's failing so badly should not be allowed to be profitable.",
        "background": "Anybody who has used Arriva Trains Wales understands that there are continual service failures that disrupt people's lives. They don't attempt to fix the problem yet still allow their business to profit massively. All these profits are sent over to the parent company in Germany, Deutsche Bahn.\r\n",
