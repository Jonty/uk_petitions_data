        "additional_details": "Parchment lasts: consider the Magna Carta - it's written on parchment. Documents made from parchment form part of our tangible cultural heritage. People still make parchment. The skills used to make, write, and print on parchment form an intangible heritage resource. In a period of rapid technological change and obsolescence, the use of traditional materials offer a sense of continuity with the past. Parliament's use of parchment has both practical and symbolic functions.\r\n\r\nLet's Keep Parchment!",
        "background": "For millennia the British Parliament has published its documents on parchment. Parliament may soon abandon parchment in favour of the cheaper but less permanent material of paper. If you value: heritage, craft, and/or civil rights please sign and share this petition.\r\n\r\nLet's Keep Parchment!",
