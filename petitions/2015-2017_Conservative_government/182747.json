        "action": "Stop the cuts to ESA",
        "additional_details": "The government thinks that disabled people looking for or working towards paid employment are simply lazy and slashing their benefits will push them into work. In reality there are many barriers to work for the sick and disabled and slashing benefits does nothing to remove these barriers.  Living with a disability costs and estimated \u00a3500 extra a month, these cuts will directly affect the health and wellbeing of those affected, meaning they are less able to find paid employment. ",
        "background": "The government has repeatedly targeted the sick and disabled with their \"austerity\" policies. Last year they planned to slash ESA by nearly \u00a330 a week, making it the same as Jobseekers allowance. This was followed by Ian Duncan Smiths resignation, but they are now pushing forward with these cuts.",
