        "action": "Gerard Batten, to lead the delegation negotiating terms for leaving the EU",
        "additional_details": "There are huge pitfalls if the Leave campaign wins the referendum. Article50 is the worst, the Norwegian and Swiss options are not necessary for the fifth strongest economy in the world.\r\n\r\nMr Batten has written an excellent book \u201dThe Road to Freedom: How Britain Can Escape the EU\u201d showing the traps and tricks that Article50 invokes so that we could be kept in each 'two year period' indefinitely. As Nigel Farage is a little like Marmite (people either love him or hate him) Mr Batten would be an ideal replacement.",
        "background": "Before I decided on this petition I spoke to five Conservative friends and three Socialist friends who were all for Leaving, and they said they could support my idea.",
