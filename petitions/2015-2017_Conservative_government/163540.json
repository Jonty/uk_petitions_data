        "action": "Make it UK law for cyclists using our roads to have basic insurance cover",
        "additional_details": "We have all witnessed cyclists jumping red lights, impatience on pedestrian crossings,cycling up one way streets in the opposite direction, mounting the pavements,cycling recklessly and speeding on pathways and pavements.They cause accidents in traffic and we have to give them the benefit of not being the cause. \r\nIt's time to call a halt on cycling on UK roads without a basic insurance cover. Metal and flesh do not mix when they come together. You might as well get hit by a tank as by a cyclist If you're a caring cyclist then you won't mind signing this petition.",
        "background": " Too many cyclists use the pavements and are a danger to young children, mothers with pushchairs, disabled and elderly people. No consideration is given by these cyclists. They think they can ride on any pavement or pathway with no care for others.\r\n\r\n",
