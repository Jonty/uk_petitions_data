        "additional_details": "The law in Canada means that drivers must slow down to at least 60kph (37mph) or move over giving a lane's clearance between themselves and the Emergency/Rescue Service vehicle when it is stopped and displaying flashing lights.   This includes police, fire, ambulance and recovery vehicles. \r\n\r\nThe Government are asked to introduce a similar law in the UK to make vehicles slow to 40 on national limit roads or 30 on restricted roads as well as making it compulsory to give a lane clearance when safe.",
        "background": "A law in Canada makes it safer for their Emergency & Rescue Services already and it's time to give ours the same protection.   Too many in the UK are injured or killed whilst trying to help others on the roads.  A law to make people slow down and/or move over will help keep everyone safe.",
