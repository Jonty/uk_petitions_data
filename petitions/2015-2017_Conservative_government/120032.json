After being to the vets telling me this & giving a shot & ongoing anti-inflammatories at a shocking cost of \u00a398 she has responded well to this medication. Now it has run out, the vet wants to charge me \u00a348 for more yet on line it only costs \u00a38.95 (with a vets prescription) for the exact same medication. Where do vets get their prices from & why???",
        "background": "I would like to see action done against the prices vets charge for not only consultation & treatment fees but also medication fees. I agree that if you cannot afford vets bills do not have a pet but sometimes circumstances change when you already have a pet/pets.",
