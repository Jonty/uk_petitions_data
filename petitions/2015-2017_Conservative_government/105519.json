        "additional_details": "The age equality act came into effect in 2010, after the minimum age act. No one can discriminate you because of your age, and the minimum wage act needs to reflect this.\r\nIncome tax payable is based on your income not your age.\r\n\r\nScenario: If a 17 yr old is stacking shelves in a supermarket and a 32 yr old is doing exactly the same job, should they not be paid the same?\r\n\r\nAlso this will give everyone equal footing when applying for job and stop employers only employing young people.",
        "background": "Since the minimum wage came into effect in 1998 it has had a tier system depending on your age. Currently the national minimum wages are as follows: \r\nUnder 18: \u00a33.79 ph\r\n18 - 20: \u00a35.13 ph\r\n21 and over: \u00a36.50 ph. \r\nEveryone should be on an equal footing, this is about equal pay regardless of age.",
