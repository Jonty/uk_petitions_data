        "additional_details": "Apart from the fact we do not eat our companion animals here in the UK there are also concerns regarding the safety of the meat as, unlike farmed animals, the ponies are roaming free and their grazing is not monitored, therefore their meat may contain harmful substances such as wormers, bute and contraceptives.  The ponies are wild and unhandled and will be terrified at slaughter, their slaughter is inhumane.   Please sign this petition and help save  Dartmoor Hill Ponies from such cruelty! ",
        "background": "Dartmoor Hill Ponies are now being slaughtered for meat for human consumption. We call on the Government to halt the scheme which is both promoting moorland ponies as a meat product and also supplying the market. The Government must  enforce effective management of the Dartmoor Hill Pony herds.\r\n\r\n",
