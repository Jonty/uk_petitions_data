        "additional_details": "This tiny change is called 'The Dutch Reach' as it is used in the Netherlands.  It saves people on bikes from being knocked into traffic when people open car doors. Using the opposite hand to open a car door forces the body to turn, so the driver sees the cyclist and fewer people are injured and killed on the roads. Such as this incident:\r\n\r\nhttp://gu.com/p/5g79g?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other \r\n\r\nVideo: see http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-09-27/easy-maneuver-borrowed-dutch-could-be-life-saving-cyclists\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "To simply and cheaply save cyclists' lives, we need to require a person to use their opposite hand to open a car door if they are to pass a driving test. This turns the body bringing passing cyclists into view. \r\n",
