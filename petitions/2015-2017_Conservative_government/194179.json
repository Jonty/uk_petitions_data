        "additional_details": "not only is this park now ruined by loud circus music and obnoxious menaces dredged in makeup), but the circus's advertising techniques are despicable! anything considered unacceptable is fine for them! Drive around blaring air horns playing music? Check! Post your gangs tag wherever possible, check, shine a bright, reasonably concentrated light into the sky? Check! if I did that with my laser I would be arrested, but since its only an extremely powerful spotlight owned by a circus its ok!",
        "background": "The circus is in town (Southport),  for 2 weeks. and it needs to go. its causing annoyance to many residence and is a menace that needs to be put in its place.  This egotistical nightmare has come into Southport between the 4th of April and the 17th of April and has placed itself in princess park.",
