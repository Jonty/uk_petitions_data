        "additional_details": "I like so many other members of the British public are appalled and deeply saddened by the almost daily atrocities that are happening on the streets of Britain. It just might be deterrent enough that a whole of life sentence reduces these most serious of crimes, but for those that do commit such vile acts should know that when they are caught they will serve the rest of their days in prison so that the public can live their lives with a little less to fear. Some criminals should be punished and not rehabilitated",
        "background": "We the British public would like changes made to the judicial system which would mean that the most serious of crimes including, children being abused and killed, sexually motivated murders, multiple murders and terrorist acts be punishable with whole of life sentences without the chance of parole\r\n",
