It should also be possible to share information about unfit owners, like those who continuously adopt and then rehome pets, or those who are known not to give the pets the care that is required.\r\n\r\nThis is the best way to help protect animals from owners that are known to mistreat the animals in their care.",
        "background": "Do you know if the person you just rehomed a pet too, has been banned from owning pets?  No, neither do the leading charities or pet shops.\r\n\r\nWhat is the point in banning ownership, if the people rehoming the pets cannot tell if someone is banned?\r\n\r\nA simple online database can fix this.",
