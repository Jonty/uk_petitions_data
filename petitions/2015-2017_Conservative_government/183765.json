However, despite a student turning 18, being a separate legal entity to their parents or guardians, parents are expected to help despite their outgoings. Annual household incomes over \u00a362,177 allow students to be entitled to a \u00a33,821 loan. With accomodation nearly always over this amount, parents are expected to help to the extent of \u00a35,000. ",
        "background": "When a student applies for a maintenance loan through Student Finance UK, they have to declare their total annual household income. Whilst this may be effective for the upper and lower class, many of the middle class families lose out substantially.",
