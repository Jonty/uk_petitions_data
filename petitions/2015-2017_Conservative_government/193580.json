Worse than that, parents may have to face the horror of a Court battle as the LA tries to take away their children and put them into care due to mistakenly believing the parents are inflicting emotional harm on their child by 'making up' the child\u2019s illness.  Even a diagnosis of the child\u2019s condition by a medical expert in rare diseases or genetics does not necessarily help and can be disbelieved and ignored by schools and the LA.\r\nEhlers-Danlos Syndrome exists; those with it suffer.  Families need support and recognition not unjust and undeserved persecution.\r\n",
