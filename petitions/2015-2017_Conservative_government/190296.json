        "additional_details": "The case for leaving the EU is too big for any of us to comprehend fully. It is economical and cultural. We can not allow the matter of British 'principle' and 'sticking to our guns' to allow the Government to dogmatically pursue the goal to take the United Kingdom out of the European Union. \r\n\r\nOffering the British people a second vote isn't 'going back' on David Cameron's assertion that this is a 'once in a lifetime vote', it is quite simply the right thing to do. The stakes are simply too high.",
        "background": "The majority vote from the EU referendum in June 2016 was 4% (51.8 Leave vs. 48.1 Remain). This margin is too small for the Government to take the United Kingdom out of the EU. Since June the people of the UK now know more about the terms of Brexit so we should have a 2nd vote.",
