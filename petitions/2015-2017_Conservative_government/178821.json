        "additional_details": "Having recently assumed the Presidency of the USA Donald Trump exhibits a fervent disregard for the basic principles of international law and decency by signing an executive order to ban entry to the USA of nationals from several Arab countries. We the undersigned see this as proof of his extreme racist and right wing views played out with inciteful gusto to a white supremacist constituency.  As citizens of the UK we reject racism and demand Trump be banned from entry to our country. ",
        "background": "Due to his discriminatory practices prejudiced against the entire populations of several Arab countries, and in complete contravention of UK cultural, legal and social standards we the undersigned wish to have Donald J Trump banned from entering the UK for personal, state or business visits.
