        "action": "Parents must be allowed access to their children unless a court rules otherwise.",
        "additional_details": "Local authorities can't make one parent allow the other access. The time it takes for one parent to regain access via the courts can leave lasting damage between a parent and child, who have then lost valuable time during crucial developmental stages, which can never be reclaimed. Unless there is good reason, such as the police suspecting physical abuse, then contact should not be denied, and the local authorities should have the power to ensure access is arranged by law, even if it's supervised",
        "background": "This petition is asking for it to be made illegal for one parent to deny the other access, without them being ruled as unfit by a court. \r\n \r\n This petition is designed to protect children from the emotional damage that occurs when parents use them as a weapon against each other.  \r\n",
