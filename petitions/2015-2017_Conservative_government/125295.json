        "additional_details": "James Wright of the Canary says \u00a322bn could pay for 103,000 nurses for 10 years, 150,000 new homes, 6,000 primary schools, or 40 hospitals.\r\n\r\nThese are better uses for this money, particularly considering the school places crisis in England, the austerity-driven welfare policy which harms the most vulnerable, and Tory efforts to privatise the NHS.\r\n\r\nIt is over ten times what Gordon Brown lost when he sold UK gold reserves as Chancellor - yet the Tories say others are fiscally irresponsible.",
        "background": "The most recent budget states that the government intends to sell its stake in RBS for \u00a322bn less than the \u00a345bn it was purchased for.\r\n\r\nThis is a callous effort to transfer mass amounts of taxpayer assets into the hands of a small number of already rich people.\r\n\r\nIt is unjust and must be stopped.",
