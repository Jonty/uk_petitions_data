        "additional_details": "\r\nThe need for reform of the Firework Regulations (2004) has been recognized by a number of organizations and charities. Current regulations are outdated and largely ineffective and we are calling for the improved regulation of fireworks use in the UK. The main need is to restrict fireworks use by the general public to the traditional dates around the Guy Fawkes, New Year\u2019s Eve, Diwali and Chinese New Year celebrations. Further discussion is at: https://www.facebook.com/groups/FireworkABatement/",
        "background": "Fireworks now occur at all times of the day and evening for many weeks during the autumn and winter. Pet and animal owners struggle to keep their companion animals safe during this extended period. We call for fireworks use by the general public to be permitted on traditional celebration dates only.",
