        "additional_details": "Some are calling, as in 2014, for the rest of the UK to have a voice in the question of Scottish independance. Many Scots, resident elsewhere in the UK or even Expats who were eligible to vote in the EU referendum, were not eligible for the 2014 independence referendum. ",
        "background": "Now the result of the EU referendum is known, the Scottish Government considers the prospect of a second Scottish independence referendum 'on the table'. A National referendum would allow for the will of the entire electorate to be known on the future of the Union formed in 1707.\r\n",
