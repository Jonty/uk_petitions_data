        "action": "Guarantee the free movement of people & labour in future EU trade negotiations",
        "additional_details": "Firstly, with our EU membership now certain to end, we must sign up to the European Economic Area instead, meaning that we enjoy at least some of the same economic benefits that EU membership brought us. \r\nSecondly, immigrants of this country have been made to feel unwelcome here in the days since the vote. The problems facing this country lie in inadequate housing and public service provision.  This petition must act as a sign that all UK immigrants are welcome to work and make a life here. ",
        "background": "The Leave campaign told voters that ending free movement and staying in the single market were both achievable after Brexit. They lied. So, any future UK/EU trade deal or renegotiation must include access to the single European market , meaning that we must sign up to free movement as well. ",
