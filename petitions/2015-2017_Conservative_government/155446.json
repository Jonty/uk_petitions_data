Evidence published by the BBC, 29.6.16 ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36641390 ) describes the falsehoods underlying the prospectus advanced. Consequently with its extremely narrow margin, the result should be considered unsafe and set aside by Parliament, until such time as a further referendum, if required, may be organised based on the ability of proponents to stand by their campaign pledges",
        "background": "Leave offered a false prospectus. With the narrow lead for leaving the EU, we call on Parliament to exercise its sovereign role and set aside the non-binding result, until those wishing to amend or abrogate existing settlements offer eligible voters a referendum informed by accurate, binding pledges",
