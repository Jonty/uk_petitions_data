        "additional_details": "Certainly evidence of functioning direct democracy exists the world over.\r\n\r\nMost recently a study in spain \"DIRECT DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNMENT SIZE:EVIDENCE FROM SPAIN\u0003\" indicates that direct democracy reduces the cost and size of government and better aligns policy with the preferences of the median voter.\r\n\r\nBritish Governance is the gold standard worldwide and is arguably one of her greatest exports. It is only right and natural that we be the first to adopt direct democracy.",
        "background": "In our technological world it is inexcusable that we accept representational democracy. We the people mustn't wait 5 years to effect change. Pass a law to make MP's become system administrators, freeing them from the spectre of self serving private influence and empowering the British people.",
