        "action": "Let UK government review its non-skilled work rule for tier 4 dependants",
        "additional_details": "I'm a tier 4 UK resident registered for a PhD programme. My wife is a nursery school teacher in Nigeria but I'm afraid she may not be able to get the same level of job in the UK. The new visa rule which implies she couldn't take low-paying jobs in the UK means if she comes to the UK, she won't be able to support my scholarship stipends to sustain our family. The trauma we have experienced within the little period of separation means our life cannot continue like this. ",
        "background": "The UK government certainly has more mechanisms to compel tier 4 immigrants to return to their countries upon completion of studies than painfully separating family members. The decision to disallow dependants of tier 4 students from taking low-paying jobs is unnecessarily separating families.",
