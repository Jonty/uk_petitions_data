        "additional_details": "If a second referendum is allowed it is possible that a third or fourth referendum could be requested ad infinitum. Further referendums would be expensive and create more, longer-lasting economic uncertainty (for possibly the same outcome).\r\n\r\nThe format of this referendum was known long in advance as majority win. People had much time to request a different format before it took place but they did not.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful many of those objecting now would have objected had the results been reversed.",
        "background": "The majority has spoken. According to the rules of the referendum, their voices should be heard and their wishes respected.\r\n\r\nLeave the EU!",
