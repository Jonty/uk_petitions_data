        "additional_details": "Today Michael Fallon announced under the 2015 DISP, we will be giving India cutting-edge military technology for \"co-production\" of weapons. Right. We've already given India the technology of the British BAE Hawk (worlds most popular trainer jet) which they're now building and exporting. Not us. Nice. Another UK Industry sold out and annihilated. Or the Advanced Hawk. Same story. Clearly the Government has ZERO comprehension of capitalising on one's strengths. BUILD and SELL. Not SELL OUT.",
        "background": "Over the years the British Government has, for some odd reason, seen it beneficial to willy-nilly, freely give away top tier British military technology and export OUR Military Industrial Complex to other countries where they reap the benefits of OUR manufacturing. We demand this UK selling out end.",
