        "additional_details": "It also forces existing council tenants earning above a certain amount to pay rent at inflated, unregulated market prices and extends the right to buy to Housing Association tenants, thereby greatly reducing the country's stock of homes to let at a reasonable rent.\r\nThis Act will exacerbate the hardships suffered by the most vulnerable who will be forced into costly and unstable private rented accommodation and will place many more in a vulnerable, insecure situation for the first time. \r\n",
        "background": "In times of increasing job insecurity & homelessness, instead of building much-needed council & social housing to create homes and jobs, this Act forces the sale of council homes, prohibits the building of new council homes, allows councils to sell off council estates and ends security of tenure.
