        "additional_details": "If people knew what animals had been through just for the product to be made this may stop the product from selling if there is a reduction in sales then there will be no funding to test on animals any longer, which will decrease the amount of animals being bred for testing. This will also increase the chance of brands finding alternatives as I believe testing on animals is not representative of how the product will react to humans due to being a completely different species.",
        "background": "Many beauty and cosmetic brands test on animals but it is not known by society I believe that any product that has been tested on an animal should be clearly shown on packaging so people know what they are funding, if they refuse then they should not be allowed to sell products legally in stores.",
