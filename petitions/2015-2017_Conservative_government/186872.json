        "additional_details": "The elderly deserve first rate care & respect. They have been the ones who have paid taxes, contributed to the country & should not be used as a reason for failing services. We have to address the problem of the open door policy to EU migration & the fact the UK didn't & still doesn't have the infrastructure to accommodate the increase in our population. The media are using the ageing population in a negative way & try to  blame all the ills of our services on them. ",
        "background": "Our public services are overstretched, due to any things. However the \"ageing population\" are used as a scapegoat. No mention of the vast increase in immigration. Can we really blame an ageing population on the problems in schools? Our elderly deserve better than to be used as a scapegoat.",
