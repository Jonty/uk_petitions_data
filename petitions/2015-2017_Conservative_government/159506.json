        "action": "Declare the EU referendum as undemocratic",
        "additional_details": "The outcome of the EU referendum could deprive UK citizens of their rights, including UK citizens who were deprived of a right to vote. The 15-year rule was wrong and arguably unlawful in the context of the EU referendum. Parliament's decision, that those who had lived abroad for more than 15 years should be disenfranchised, violated their rights. Therefore the EU referendum was undemocratic and potentially unlawful.",
        "background": "UK citizens living in the EU who had lived abroad for more than 15 years were not allowed to vote in the EU referendum. The government had agreed to scrap the 15-year rule before the referendum bill was passed, agreeing that it was arbitrary and undemocratic.",
