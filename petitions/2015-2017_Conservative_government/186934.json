        "additional_details": "By introducing an education programme in secondary schools, we can teach everyone, no matter what gender, about everyday sexism, how it affects people and how it can be prevented. This will lead us one step closer to getting rid of sexism once and for all.",
        "background": "Sexism is an everyday problem that should be a concern to all of us. Even if we think that it is gradually improving as time moves on, it isn't. Catcalling and gender stereotyping and targeting is a huge issue, and much of the younger generation seems to find it acceptable because of many influences",
