Please offer your support to this petition it really would mean a lot to the entire family and cat lovers everywhere.\r\n\r\nThank You",
        "background": "Britain is nation of animal lovers and I call upon you to support this petition. Our much loved family cat, Bruce, was recently run over and killed. We found out via an eye witness that the driver did not stop which seems cowardly and inhumane. Just stopping and checking could save cat's lives.",
