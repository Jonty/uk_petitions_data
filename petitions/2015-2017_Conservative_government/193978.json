        "additional_details": " Regardless of why police are at a property, making it a requirement for homeowners to be asked to secure dogs later to be retrieved by force dog section, will not only protect officers, but also the public if the dog(s) were to escape. Innocent dogs are destroyed due to police errors, Officers are trained to foresee hostile situations and in some cases things can escalate quickly and knowing that any dogs are safely secured will protect not only them but also the police and the public.",
        "background": "There are currently no Police protocols for dogs being secured before they enter a property. Dogs can not differentiate between a police officer or trespasser! Many dogs are destroyed for being labelled \"dangerously out of control\", when in fact, they felt threatened and are protecting their owner.",
