        "additional_details": "I have contacted Facebook many times, as I know others have but they say it's not breaching their rules. However what they are doing is promoting a culture of animal cruelty! It also gives a message telling people it's ok to be cruel to animals if it gets a reaction. By not allowing such upsetting posts, and not giving them a platform, means these people won't get the reaction they want and in the long haul, won't have a reason for doing such terrible things. ",
        "background": "People are hurting defensless animals as part of some kind of popularity prank! They post self recorded clips of themselves inflicting cruelty on animals for \"shares and likes\". For example: they'll beckon a cat, then kick it high in the air, or tie up mice to hit it, causing excruciating pain. ",
