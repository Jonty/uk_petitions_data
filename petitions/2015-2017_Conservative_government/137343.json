        "action": "Hold a second referendum once the terms of divorce with EU are agreed",
        "additional_details": "When the people voted 'out' in the referendum it was a step in complete darkness. This is an unprecedented move, never done before in the history. Once the terms of the divorce are settled with EU it is only fair that the people get a chance to vote in a second referendum to either agree to the terms of exit or halt the proceedings to leave the EU. At that point people will be more clear about the future outside the EU and they should have a choice to reject that future if they don't like it",
        "background": "The British population has voted to leave the EU. However this is a step in the dark. Once the EU exit terms are negotiated and agreed, the government should hold a second referendum. People should have an option to endorse (leave the EU) or reject (stay in the EU) the terms of the exit. ",
