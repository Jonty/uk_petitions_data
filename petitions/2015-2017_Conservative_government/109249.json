        "action": "Make all UK school kitchens serve free range meat and eggs",
        "additional_details": "Animals are kept in cramped and diseased conditions, often abused by farm workers, have no access to outside spaces, and are eventually inhumanely slaughtered. There are many health risks of eating battery farmed meat, including the increased chance of getting salmonella, the consumption of less vitamins and more saturated fats.\r\nMake school kitchens serve free range meat and eggs - they will become aware of animal issues, and be encouraged to be active citizens as well as living more healthily.",
        "background": "Battery farming is a cruel, unnecessary form of intensive farming. \r\nSchools are places of education, a crucial place for children to learn. \r\nWe should be setting an example to students by serving them free range food, so they can do the same themselves.\r\n",
