        "additional_details": "Marie Stopes International estimates that the loss of their services alone could lead to 6.5m unintended pregnancies, 2.1m unsafe abortions, and 21,700 maternal deaths. We call upon HM Government to increase its foreign health aid commitments and help mitigate the devastating impact of this legislation. The Dutch government has already launched plans for an international fund and we ask that the U.K. to contribute to this effort, and so help defend the rights of millions of vulnerable women.",

The right to bodily autonomy is a fundamental human right and we must not allow it to be threatened.\r\n ",
