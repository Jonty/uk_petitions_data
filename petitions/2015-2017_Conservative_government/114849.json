        "additional_details": "The allocation of marks in essay based exams are based on structure, written communication and content rather than just relevant content, showing subject understanding. Exams with 'sources' and 'case studies' mean that you spend time referencing question content for the specific case answer and structuring long winded answers - time is not allocated for this, leading to knowledgeable students getting below predicted grades in exams where they could have written more but didn't have the time.",
        "background": "Not enough time is given in exams for students to be able to apply 2 years of studying to an exam that is essentially asking you to complete questions with a minute per mark. Essay based exams should not be a test of reading and writing speed, it should be a test of knowledge and application.",
