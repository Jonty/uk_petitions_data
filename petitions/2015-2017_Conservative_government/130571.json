        "action": "Change the Childcare Act and enable childcare vouchers to be given for relatives",
        "additional_details": "According to the Childcare Act 2006 Childcare is deemed as care for a child that is not provided by a relative. There are many registered childminders who look after their relatives and therefore cannot claim the 15 hours free childcare. However if the child goes to a nursery where a relative works they are allowed to claim free childcare. If a childcare provider is registered and looking after a relative they should be entitled to claim for the free vouchers.",
        "background": "The Department For Education (DFE) allows some parents to claim free childcare for 2 years and for all 3 year olds. At the moment a relative of the child cannot claim this free childcare even if they are an approved childcare provider.",
