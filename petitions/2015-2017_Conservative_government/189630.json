Root and branch reform is urgently needed\r\n\r\nOur family has three generations of police service.\r\n\r\nUK police service has much to commend it but recent events throughout the UK show strong case for root and branch reform, enabling police to work and be managed more effectively and to strengthen morale and public respect.\r\n\r\nPoor management, recruiting, training and career incentives are evident throughout the outdated constabulary structure, and serious failings are identified by HM Inspectorate.\r\n\r\nCollege of Policing lists numerous police staff offenders nationwide. Violence, racism, homophobia, theft and sexual assault are also to be found reported across the UK, including officers targeting their colleagues. \r\n",
