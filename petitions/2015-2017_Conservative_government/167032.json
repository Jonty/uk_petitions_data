        "additional_details": "In the news today, Tues 13th Sept 2016, let it be noted that the privileged, and unelected members of The House of Lords, did make it clear to the Government of Great Britain, and the subjects of Great Britain, that their wish is for there to be Governmental approval of article 50, before it is invoked. Demonstrating a clear lack of democratic values upon which Great Britain has been built, the \"Lords\" think their few numbers are of greater significance than that of the people Of Great Britain.",
        "background": "The house of Lords are today insisiting Parliament should hold vote of approval from the Government before invoking article 50. \r\nNever has there been such and incredible disregard for the British public, from the very privileged peers that should otherwise be refraining from any intervention.
