        "additional_details": "Just like it would be unfair for a Christian to work on Christmas day it would be wrong for a Muslim to work on eid day too. England is open to diversity and it needs to acknowledge all the other faiths and help celebrate such important values of all of the different faitha and religions.",
        "background": "Eid is a holy day for Muslims.  It is compulsory for them to pray in the masjid (place of worship ) on this day. We should not have to book time off and make children miss out out on their priceless education. This day should be a bank holiday to relieve all pressures.",
