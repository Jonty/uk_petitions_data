        "additional_details": "The public sector pension liability arises from 4 principle sources:\r\n1. Unfunded state pensions\r\n2. Unfunded public sector occupational DB schemes\r\n3. Funded public sector schemes which are being systematically under-funded\r\n4. Rescue funding for private sector schemes unable to meet liabilities\r\n\r\nOf these action is being taken to make state pensions more sustainable (later retirement ages, changes to qualifying conditions). However no corresponding action has been taken to address items 2 & 3.  ",
        "background": "According to ONS 2015 statistics the total net public sector pension liability stands at an eye-watering \u00a31,493Bn and in 2014/15 alone increased by \u00a3190Bn. This liability will be shouldered by current and future generations of UK taxpayers the majority of whom have no access to DB pensions.  ",
