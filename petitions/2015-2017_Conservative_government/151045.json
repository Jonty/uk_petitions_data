        "additional_details": "Some people take the time to research politics for themselves but are constantly faced with biased opinions from newspapers, relatives and friends, meaning they end up with distorted and manipulated views. Politics becomes confusing and warped. \r\n\r\nYoung people need an honest, factual education about the government, so that when the time comes they are able to make an informed vote based on their views and feel like they can have a say about the country's future. ",
        "background": "Too often young people come out of secondary school or further education with very little knowledge about how the British Political System works. Many believe that due to their lack of knowledge, they shouldn't vote as they cannot make an informed decision. ",
