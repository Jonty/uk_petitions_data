        "additional_details": "They should be paid slightly more.\r\n\r\nIm not saying pop star wage, or even a considerable amount. Im talking a couple hundred pounds extra a month as lets say, danger pay and risk over reward pay. Give them that extra satisfaction that its worth the risk. Not everyone could do their job, it requires a different human being, so pay them that difference.",
        "background": "UK Armed Police are ranked and paid like normal police officers however, im sure we can all agree the two jobs are very different.\r\n\r\nGranted they volunteer for the role however, carrying firearms and being responsible for being the first in to terrorist threats to protect the public is different.",
