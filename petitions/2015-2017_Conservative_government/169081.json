        "additional_details": "Teaching philosophy to primary school children can improve their English and maths skills, according to a pilot study highlighting the value of training pupils to have inquiring minds. (From http://www.independent.co.uk)\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we leave questioning the models children have been taught until later in life, it could be too late,\" warns Professor Angie Hobbs. \"That is why we need to start teaching philosophy in primary school.\u201d (From http://www.telegraph.co.uk)",
        "background": "Philosophy provides a lifetime of vital skills in reasoning and critical thought. Children will learn how to make logical arguments and spot fallacies, to question accepted truths, and to discuss the nature of reality and ethics.
