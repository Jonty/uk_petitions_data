        "action": "Make single carriageway A-roads safer",
        "additional_details": "Research by the Road Safety Foundation concluded that single carriageway roads are 7 times more dangerous than motorways. Having been involved in a high speed head on collision on a single carriageway A-road, a physical barrier in the middle of the road would prevent unscrupulous drivers from overtaking, thus eradicating the possibility of a head on collision. Moreover, a reduction in the speed limit from 60mph would also further improve road safety.",
        "background": "Single carriageway roads are 7 times more dangerous than motorways. With a record \u00a36m investment in our road network, the Government should legislate for physical barriers on single carriageway A-roads to prevent head on collisions, and for a reduction in the speed limit.",
