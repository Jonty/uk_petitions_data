        "additional_details": "I would like for Hoverboards to be legalised on roads as they are quick and easy way to get around. They don't cause any CO2 emissions don't cause any eyesores or any noise complaints. There should be less restrictions on where you can use Hoverboards for example, using them on busy high streets or roads that have a high traffic count. This should be where restrictions are applied. Whereas small streets and parks should be places where people are able to use their Hoverboards.",
