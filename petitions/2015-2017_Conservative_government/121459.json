        "additional_details": "Wales. Scotland and Northern Ireland all have free prescriptions, it's about time PKU (phenylketonuria) was put on the exempt list so that ALL PKU sufferers get free scripts, this making home delivery of low protein food items easier to deliver.. And the saving of \u00a3102 a year could go into funding regular trips to specialist and dietician clinics.  Failure to stick to a low protein diet could lead to other issues such as epilepsy which is on the exempt list.",
        "background": "PKU (phenylketonuria) effects 1 in 10,000 people... It's a metabolic condition where the body is unable to breakdown phenylanaline which is in everyday foods. It's controlled via a low protein diet, be it 6.5g a day or 1g per day. Failure to stick to a diet will result in mental retardation.",
