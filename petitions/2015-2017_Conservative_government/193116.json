        "additional_details": "Lie detector tests are currently in use by the probation service, in respect of sex offenders released on licence. If it is permissible for the probation service, then it should be allowed within the judicial system as part and parcel of the defence and plaintiff armoury. The tests should be applied equally on both parties. Although these tests may not be 100% accurate they would provide more certainty when DNA and forensic results are negative. ",
        "background": "There are many dubious jury decisions made in court, in particular when there has been a media storm over a particular type of crime, i.e. the Saville sex offence case. In these circumstances no jury in the land would be immune to a preconception of guilt.",
