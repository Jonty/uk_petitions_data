        "additional_details": "This practice is limiting choice & costing the public money when they are forced to continue paying for a service they no longer require because companies make the process deliberately difficult to protect their profit.\r\n\r\nWe request the government impose a legal requirement on all services that provide on-line signup to also provide an easy on-line cancellation process with the same availability without unreasonable limitations. ",
        "background": "Many services such as insurance, credit record services and music streaming can be bought online, 24 hours a day. However in most cases customers are required to telephone between certain hours on certain days & speak to a salesperson who will try to convince the customer to stay.\r\n\r\n",
