        "action": "KS2 Reading SATs was unfair on pupils & shouldn\u2019t be counted in performance data",
        "additional_details": "The number of inferential questions was far higher, with fewer literal, than the sample. Both were inaccessible to lower attainers, who couldn\u2019t show skills learned. In past/sample tests pupils found key words in a question to retrieve information/infer answers. This test required pupils find synonyms of key words. Teachers would have taught this had it been indicated in sample materials/Programme of Study. It\u2019s unfair to test children on skills for which there was no indication to teachers.",
        "background": "Unlike other Key Stage 2 subjects, the Reading paper differed significantly from the sample test. We fully support a drive to increase standards, but the level of vocabulary was above beyond most 11 year olds. This poor communication of expectations by the DfE should not punish pupils or schools.",
