        "additional_details": "I have suffered with a UTI during NHS out of hours and had to travel (in pain) many miles for treatment. It can take 24 hours or more to receive treatment, much of which wastes NHS time and has caused myself and other women a great deal of distress. If I could be tested and treated solely at a pharmacy it would save many women time and pain and would save wasting GP time.",
        "background": "A UTI can be debilitating, testing and treatment at a pharmacy saves women the hassle of waiting for an appointment or call back from the GP for a prescription of antibiotics. It would save the NHS the cost and time of a GP testing and prescribing for a UTI. ",
