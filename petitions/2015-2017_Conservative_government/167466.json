        "additional_details": "Many people have since been in contact with us saying they have seen this guy selling all different breeds of puppies, he has even been seen kicking them. When the pups are sold their not vaccinated, micro chipped, some are incredibly skinny and dehydrated. We know of at least 5-6 dogs that came from this guy that have since died either due to Parvovirus or being so ill they had to be put down. If these sites had done checks in the first place no one would have suffered from this.",
        "background": "Me and my family got 2 puppies from Pets4Homes that recently died of Parvovirus because the 'breeder' wasn't looking after them properly. These sites need to do background checks on the 'breeders' or sellers wanting to sell puppies/dogs.",
