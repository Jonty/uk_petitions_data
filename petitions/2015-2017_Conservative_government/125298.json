As such the classic and modern classic vehicles caught up in 2010's scrappage scheme that have not yet been crushed ought to be auctioned off by the government to the general public.  This means we will be able to save many classic vehicles that will otherwise be lost and the government would gain a good source of revenue, this is a win - win situation!",

Unfortunately many classic and modern classic cars were caught up in this and are being lost to being crushed. The government should auction these off.",

The Government does not have the power to compel private companies or individuals to sell/save end of life vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe Government 2009 vehicle scrappage scheme ended in 2010. When a sale was agreed through the scrappage scheme, the dealer was responsible for disposing of the old vehicle through authorised treatment facilities (ATFs). Once a vehicle is handed over to an officially recognised scrappage yard it is up to that ATF to decide whether to repair and sell the vehicle or to completely scrap it.\r\n\r\nThe Government stated at the time that it would only approve or make payment on a transaction under the scrappage scheme where a Certificate of Destruction on the old car had been issued (see: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090721/text/90721w0150.htm#09072344004168).  \r\n  \r\nMore information about the 2009 scrappage scheme can be found in this House of Commons Library note about the scheme: http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN05177/SN05177.pdf \r\n\r\nIn relation to the destruction of classic cars under the 2009 scrappage scheme, the Government Minister at the time confirmed that it was up to the owners of a vehicle to decide what to do with their own property (see: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090721/text/90721w0150.htm#09072344004168"
