        "additional_details": "Patients are being prevented from choosing their own care setting under CCG red tape that prevents them from choosing a home that isn't on a predetermined list.  This is the case even when a patient or their family agree to pay the top up so the cost of the home of choice is no more than any other on 'the list'.  This red tape is preventing patients from choosing homes that are close to relatives and that have a better CQC rating than ones approved by the CCG for their list.",
        "background": "CCG's have cut the number of of care homes they will allow a patient to choose from to use their CHC Funding.  Patients cannot choose care settings not on these limited lists even if they are prepared to pay the top-up and they have a better CQC rating causing great upset to patients and families. ",
