        "additional_details": "RCN has identified potential effect of new law on number of non-EU nurses.\r\nDepletion of experienced nurses will result in staff shortages and reduce standards of care.\r\nDepletion of emergency services by the loss of experienced frontline personnel   will result in reduced ability to maintain essential services.",
        "background": "The new employment law will have a devastating effect on the number of non-EU overseas nurses working in UK because many will not meet the \u2018deportation salary threshold\u2019 of \u00a335K per year. Some 3,500 nurses could be affected resulting in loss of experienced personnel. \r\nAn exemption clause is needed.",
