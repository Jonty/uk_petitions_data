        "additional_details": "Almost everyone we know who had bought a home had this happen at least once. This is a huge problem and unfair for those trying to buy a home. \r\n\r\nThe seller can pull out of the sale at any time until contracts have been exchanged. The buyer can have spent lots of money before this and up losing hundreds, if not thousands,  of pounds. \r\n\r\nIn Scotland, once a sale has been agreed, then the sellers must go ahead. \r\n\r\nThe law on this country should be changed to save home buyers from this heartache. ",
        "background": "My wife and I are trying to buy our  first home. We have agreed to buy three different properties and the sellers ended up backing out on all three occasions. This is extremely upsetting and frustrating. This is not legal in other countries, so why should it be here? Home buyers should be protected.",
