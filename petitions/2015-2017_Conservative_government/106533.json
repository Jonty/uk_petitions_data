Similarly, today in The Guardian it was revealed that Turtlebay and Las iguanas have the following policy:\r\n\"that requires staff to pay back to their employer 3% of the table sales they generate on each shift. That figure rises to 5.5% in Las Iguanas\u2019s London restaurants.\"\r\nAs this bears no relation to how much they get in tips, staff are being asked to fund the difference from their pockets.",
