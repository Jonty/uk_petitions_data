        "additional_details": "It was promoted and stated on a campaign bus that \u00a3350 million a week would be put into the NHS. As soon as the result was declared Nigel Farage said on UK Television that this was a mistake. It was said that there would be stricter controls on immigration, which was also rebuked 24 hours after the result was announced. Daniel Hannan said free movement could result in similar levels of immigration after Brexit.",
        "background": "These signatories are asking that the EU referendum is declared null and void due to the fact that the voters were misled on two key points of the campaign regarding NHS funding and immigration control. ",
