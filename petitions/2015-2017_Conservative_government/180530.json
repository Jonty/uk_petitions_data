        "additional_details": "Losing your job, being elderly or disabled is financially hard enough. Many have to deal with unscrupulous bailiffs for non payment of utility bills, leaving some feeling suicidal. These vulnerable people should not be asked to pay for utility bills that they cannot afford. However, this also means that the government can pay them less benefits as their utility bills are already covered. Plus if utility companies are non profit and publicly owned, everyone's bills will be cheaper to begin with.",
        "background": "I want the government to make all Utility Companies publicly owned as Non Profit Companies & cover all Running Costs by the Tax Payer. This will ensure the disabled, elderly & people out of work can heat their houses & not have to worry about bailiffs coming to their door for non payment of bills.\r\n",
