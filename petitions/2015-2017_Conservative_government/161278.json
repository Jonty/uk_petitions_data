        "additional_details": "Requiring restaurants to state this information would allow customers to make a more informed decision on what they're eating, as many people like myself would rather not include microwave meals in their diet, especially when paying a premium for eating it in a restaurant.\r\n\r\nThis change would hopefully lead customers to ordering freshly made meals, encouraging restaurants to change their practices and perhaps helping their unskilled staff gain kitchen qualifications to help further their careers.",
        "background": "I propose that restaurants should be required to inform customers on their menu whether a meal is microwaved or prepared fresh.\r\n\r\nA large number of restaurants and pubs regularly include ready meals and microwave meals on their menu but are not required to inform customers.",
