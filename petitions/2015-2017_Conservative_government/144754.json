        "additional_details": "The above points were clarified AFTER the referendum (e.g. Newsnight interview with key Leave supporter, Moody's UK credit rating downgrade, Scotland results): voters did not have this information when voting, thus this is not a \"retrospective\" petition.\r\nThese points should be debated, possibly alongside Mr Healey's petition. A single joint statement of facts and/or assessed risks should be prepared by an impartial body (or agreed between Leave and Remain Leaders) and published in all media.",
        "background": "Voters may not have known:\r\n- new trade agreements may require freedom of movement for workers, significantly restricting ability to reduce EU migration level\r\n- <\u00a3350m saving may be offset by e.g. \"negative\" credit rating making National Debt interest higher\r\n- Scotland wishes to Remain in Europe",
