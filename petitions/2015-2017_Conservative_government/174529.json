        "action": "Deliver to the electorate a second referendum for the UK's membership of the EU.",
        "additional_details": "The referendum on EU membership is profoundly important. Events since 23rd June 2016 have demonstrated that leaving the EU will not save money but is costing billions in government administration and losses to the economy. The Richmond Park by-election result  demonstrates that there is sufficient doubt within the electorate about Brexit. The UK electorate deserve the same opportunity to reconsider as did the Danish electorate in 1993 and the Irish electorate on two occasions in 2001 and 2009.",
        "background": "The UK electorate must be given the opportunity to hold a second referendum on the membership of the EU. Other country's governments have returned to their electorate on three separate occasions to reaffirm previous mandates. Not holding a second referendum denies the UK electorate this right.",
