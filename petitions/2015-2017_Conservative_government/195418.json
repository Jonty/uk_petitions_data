T4 and T3 are hormones produced by the thyroid gland and are essential for life. The thyroid produces mainly T4, which is then converted to T3 in tissue and organs. T3 is the active hormone.\r\nI call on the government to continue  to allow the T3 therapy as for some hypothyroids  the benefits are enormous ",
