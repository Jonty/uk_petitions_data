        "additional_details": "Last year, the historians Dan Snow and Tom Holland attacked the proposals, likening them to vandals destroying ancient artefacts. \u201cWe have recently started to realise that the standing stones are just a beginning. They sit at the heart of the world\u2019s most significant and best-preserved stone-age landscape. The government\u2019s plans endanger this unique site,\u201d he said. \r\nHolland said: \u201cThere is so much waiting to be learned about how Stonehenge was built \u2013 if we decide, as a country, not to sacrifice it to road building. The battle to save our most significant neolithic landscape is an unending one.\u201d",
        "background": "Stonehenge is a World Heritage Site, famous worldwide. It is also a Part of OUR heritage and a Sacred Site to the Druids. The plan could cause irreparable damage to the site and cause it to be lost to future generations forever.",
