        "additional_details": "The referendum on the UK's membership of the EU is profoundly important. Events since 23rd June 2016 have demonstrated that leaving the EU will not save money but is costing billions in government administration and losses to the economy. The UK electorate deserve the same democratic opportunity to reconsider as did the Danish electorate in 1993 and the Irish electorate on two occasions in 2001 and 2009. Denying this right is undemocratic.",
        "background": "The UK electorate must be given the opportunity of a second referendum on EU membership. Other country's governments have returned to their electorate on three separate occasions to reaffirm previous mandates. Not holding a second referendum is undemocratic and denies the UK electorate this right.",
