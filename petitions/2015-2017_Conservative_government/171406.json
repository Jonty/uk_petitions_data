His mane has also been hacked off and left strewn all over the field.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis was was a very friendly little Skewbald Shetland pony, aged around 12-14 years.\r\n\r\nHe had twisted front legs so couldn\u2019t be ridden and was looking for a special home.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that someone would want to deliberately hurt him in this way. This was a truly horrific incident.\"",
