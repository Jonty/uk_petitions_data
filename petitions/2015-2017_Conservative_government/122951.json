        "additional_details": "The authors report 11,000 deaths on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday admissions compared to the other days. They also note there is a higher proportion of \"unwell\" patients. They do not suggest these are avoidable.  A paper published by Lord Darzi this year looking at avoidability of hospital deaths suggests that only 3.6% are avoidable. \r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister must abide by medical research ethics and confirm that the goverment are misrepresenting data for political kudos. ",
        "background": "The changes being imposed by the government regarding the Junior Doctor contract are based around the Freemantle Paper into weekend hospital admissions. The government frequently use these figures to justify claims for their changes to contracts which directly contradicts the authors conclusions.",
