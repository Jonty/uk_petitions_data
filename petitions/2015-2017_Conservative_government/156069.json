        "additional_details": "We feel that in the wake of the referendum vote to leave the EU, the current Government does not command the confidence of the people, given the divisions within said government and the lack of effective leadership. We therefore feel that HM Government cannot be trusted to lead us through the EU exit without a new mandate.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call upon Parliament to institute a vote of no confidence against HM Government, under Section 2 of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act of 2011, so that a new General Election can be called before Article 50 is triggered. ",
