        "additional_details": "Dogs around the world are being euthanized for how they 'look' (BSL) rather than what they've done. It is canine eugenics,it is canine profiling, it is canine bullying - all of which we abhor and fight against when it is enacted upon humans. We have come so far and yet in this aspect we have regressed to the witch hunts of the past. It is ludicrous and it has to stop. The majority of the caring, concerned citizens of the world, the voters of the world, the people who put you in power, realise this is ludicrous, cruel and needs to be repealed, David cameron gave us a referendum to leave the EU and now as animal and dog lovers we want a debate on getting this daft legislation removed!",
