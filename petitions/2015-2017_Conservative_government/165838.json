        "additional_details": "My 8 month old cat passed away by coming into contact with a lily. She was in intensive care for two days, her kidneys shut down, she was aggressively twitching, she could not move and as her kidneys could not process and remove her potassium levels she died of a heart attack. All it takes is a cat to ingest the tiniest bit of pollen and they will die. How can it be that all lilies sold do not come with a clear warning? It is disgusting. I lost my sweet young girl, don't let this happen again. ",
        "background": "Lilies are among one of the most common flowers sold in the UK. They are also toxic and fatal to the most common pet in the UK: cats. They are so lethal to cats that even just a cat brushing passed a lily and catching some pollen on its fur and then licking it off will shut down a cat's kidneys.",
