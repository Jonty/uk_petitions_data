        "additional_details": "Blair was explicitly warned by his Cabinet Office that a \u201clegal justification for invasion would be needed. Subject to law officers\u2019 advice, none currently exists.\u201d Then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw similarly advised Blair that none of the legal conditions for war had been met.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous examples of Blair lying, deceiving, and misleading, in order to hype the supposed threat from Iraq, and try and justify war. At least 108,000 Iraqi civilians have died as a result of the illegal war.",
        "background": "4 Reasons to Investigate Blair\r\n\r\n1) Blair knowingly launched a war of aggression that broke international law\r\n2) UN Security Council Resolution 1441 did not authorise war\r\n3) Blair lied to help fix the facts around the policy\r\n4) The illegal war on Iraq has caused huge suffering and death\r\n\r\n",
