        "additional_details": "There are many variations of bus lane times in London that you could be on a 24/7 lane, turn left and then your suddenly not allowed to without knowing! Motorcyclists especially are fined more and more but how are we suppose to tell the time while riding!? Nearly all Motorbikes don't have a built in clock and watches are covered up by our gear. All bus lanes should be 24/7 to save People being fined by councils over and over again for focusing on the roads and ever changing bus lane signs.",
        "background": "As a motrocyclist who travels in London 6 days a week I have become more than fustrated with the changing bus lane times which change on every different road in London And then the fines that follow for not even knowing your making a mistake! Motorcyclists can't look at the time while riding! ",
