        "additional_details": "There are many groups such as SME Alliance who's members have had their lives destroyed by failing banks trying to repair their balance sheets by either engineering defaults & subsequently asset stripping family businesses or charging exorbitant fees and charges.  Beyond this, banks then used scorched earth litigation tactics to cause extensive delays and to run up impossible costs.  These actions are beyond any doubt inequitable, unlawful and life changing to the victims.  ",
        "background": "The FCA doesn't investigate individual claims against banks, the Financial Ombudsman is incredibly restricted, legal aid was basically withdrawn and court costs on large claims were jolted up to \u00a350,000 making it impossible for victims of the banks from getting justice or compensation.",
