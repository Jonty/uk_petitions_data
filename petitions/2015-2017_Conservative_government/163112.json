        "additional_details": "The  Referendum, widely recognized to have flawed origins and severely compromised by misinformation, should be considered accordingly. There are now new opportunities first to renegotiate our relationship with the EU regarding border control, and then work to improve structures with democratic processes, openness and transparency at its heart.  ",
        "background": "Parliament is a representative democracy but should urgently respond to the disquiet over immigration expressed in the referendum. The implications of BREXIT are potentially horrendous for both the UK and EU and it is critical not to terminate, but to reformulate our membership. \r\n\r\n",
