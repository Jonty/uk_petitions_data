We need to be clear on one operating body that can regulate, vet and ensure that those who trade in this sector are of a minimum standard. This would help to eliminate poor standards of craftsmanship and ensure better security throughout the Uk",
        "background": "In the UK any one can trade as a locksmith. This means that the person you get to secure your property may not know the standards that are associated with the industry. It is time that this crucial trade is regulated to stop scam locksmiths from operating. ",
