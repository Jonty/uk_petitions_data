        "additional_details": "The RMT Union have caused severe delays due to their staff walkouts amid their upset for Southern Rails decision to introduce more driver only trains. Their continued un-reasonable behaviour, and their pure negligence, contributes to the fact that unions have too much power in the modern day. Governments should be allowed to overturn, and prevent, decisions for strikes where the unions claims are false or un-proven.",
        "background": "The current situation between Southern Rail/GTR with trade unions is a dire one. The RMT Union have performed continuous strikes causing mass delays, job loss and dangers to safety. Their concern, of the safety of driver only trains, is false, in use around the country, and is proven to be safe.",
