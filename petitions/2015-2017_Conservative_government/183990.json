        "additional_details": "Measured in cost per mile travelled\uff0c the UK train service is up to ten times greater than other developed countries. The public understand the environmental need to reduce dependence on cars but cannot afford to do so. Increasing taxes on car usage is laudable but the cash incentive to use public transport is missing at present. The UK citizens should be incentivised with hugely reduced ticket prices\uff0c on presentation of a passport or other UK ID card.",
        "background": "We have a chicken and egg situation with our bus and train services. The huge costs of using public transport discourage people from using trains and buses\uff0cpreferring to use cars instead. But the investment to improve the public transport system cannot be justified if not enough people use it.",
