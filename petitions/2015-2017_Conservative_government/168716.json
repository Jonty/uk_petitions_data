        "action": "Revert the decision to allow fracking activities in Lancashire.",
        "additional_details": "This decision, given the credibility of her position & that of her political party, goes completely against giving powers to local authorities. A decision that only favors the privately owned Caudrilla, and their shareholders.\r\n\r\nThe catastrophic damage caused on the environment, and upon local inhabitants is evident at the active fracking sites in the USA, and Australia.\r\n\r\nThe Tory party has shown complete disrespect to the powers of local council, and that of the people they are meant to represent. ",
        "background": "On the 6th October 2016 Theresa May, the unelected Prime Minister of a political party with no mandate to govern, decided that the U.K. was now ruled by dictatorship by overruling the decision of Lancashire County Council, and the people of Lancashire to block Fracking activities in the county.",
