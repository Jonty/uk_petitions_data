        "additional_details": "The justification for treating some crimes as hate crimes is to identify that being motivated by hatred because someone belongs to a class of individuals different from oneself makes the assailant more culpable and deserving of greater punishment. Although the detection, and therefore prosecution, rate is low and the deterrence effect arguably nil the message that a society sends by uniting in the face of hatred and standing with our brothers, sisters and non-binary siblings is powerful.",
        "background": "A hate crime is a crime motivated by prejudice on certain grounds i.e. race or religion. Homeless people are being victimised because of who they are, yet because it\u2019s not about their religion, the colour of their skin or their sexuality etc. these vile incidents are not counted as hate crimes.
