        "additional_details": "11,000 people in the UK have Cystic Fibrosis. It's caused by a faulty gene which affects the movement of salt and water in and out of cells. People with Cystic Fibrosis experience a build-up of thick sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the whole body. It causes chronic infections often requiring weeks of isolated hospital stays, and many people may eventually need lung transplants. https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk/",
        "background": "People with Cystic Fibrosis often take 50+ tablets a day just to help them breathe and digest food. It's a life debilitating condition with an average life expectancy of 41, yet Cystic Fibrosis is still not seen serious enough to add it to the medical exemption list. Help us help those with CF!",
