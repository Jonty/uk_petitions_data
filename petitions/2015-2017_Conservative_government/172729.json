        "action": "Guarantee that Nigel Farage will not receive any form of UK honour.",
        "additional_details": "On 16 November 2016, in PMQs, Theresa May refused to confirm or deny whether she has discussed giving Nigel Farage a peerage. Mr Farage has never been elected to the UK Parliament, but such an honour would would bring him into Parliament and could also potentially open the door to his appointment to the Government. Mr Farage, whose politics have been described as fascistic, dating back to his school days, is not of suitable character for such an honour.",
        "background": "Given his distressingly anti-British attitudes, hypocrisy, dishonesty and apparent indifference to the likely effect of his anti-EU lobbying on the future prosperity of this country, it would be manifestly intolerable for Nigel Farage to be rewarded with any form of honour.",
