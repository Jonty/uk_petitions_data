To simply ignore it, is beyond irresponsible. This decision must be overturned.\r\n\r\nLancashire Telegraph article:  http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/chorley/11637799._/?",
        "background": "Theresa May promised to give back control to local councils. However even though Lancashire County Council refused permission for fracking in their county, the Government overruled it. This is against the will of the people of Lancashire and the council they elected. Therefore it must be overturned.",

All relevant issues raised by local people, Lancashire County Council and others were carefully considered by the Inspector and by the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nThe decision letter explains how the Secretary of State has taken these issues into account and how he has reached his conclusions and decisions. The decision letter and the Inspector\u2019s Report are available at: \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recovered-appeals-cuadrilla-bowland-ltd-and-cuadrilla-elswick-ltd-refs-3134386-3130923-3134385-and-3130924-6-october-2016\r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to devolving powers to local authorities, and the vast majority of planning applications are considered by local authorities. However, for most planning applications there is a right of appeal where the local authority refuses planning permission or does not make a decision within specified timescales. Decisions on appeals are made by the Planning Inspectorate or the Secretary of State, and there is also a right to legally challenge these decisions. Further information on planning appeals and legal challenges is available in the national planning policy guidance at: http://tinyurl.com/AppealGuidance\r\n\r\nDepartment for Communities and Local Government",
