        "additional_details": "The calling of Article 50 will initiate a process that will have serious consequences for all of our citizens. Before such decisive action is taken, we have a right to demand a full public inquiry into the decisions actions and promises made by our politicians and the role of the Murdoch press in propagating falsehood and unfairly influencing the outcome. No action should be taken that leads to irrevocable changes in the relationship of Great Britain with our European partners.",
        "background": "The decision to call a referendum appears to have been made to appease a split in the Conservative Party. The British people have been politically misled via the dominant Murdoch press. As our society is more divided and at threat by this result, a public inquiry should held for national security.",
