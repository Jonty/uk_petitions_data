        "action": "Introduce a tax on nonrecyclable packaging.",
        "additional_details": "We have gradually improved matters as a nation. In 1990, Chris Patten, then Secretary of State for the Environment, aimed to have 25 per cent of domestic rubbish recycled or reused by the year 2000. Later, Lord Deben and Ken Clarke introduced the Landfill Tax as a result of the EU Waste Directive. Now the government has decreed that large shops in England will have to charge five pence for all single use plastic carrier bags. A tax on nonrecyclable packaging is the next logical step.",
        "background": "We're all familiar with the experience of having to discard packaging which the local waste disposal scheme cannot handle - for instance plastic tops for takeaway coffee. A tax should be introduced to tip the balance in favour of biodegradable or recyclable packaging.",
