        "action": "Provide a living wage to health care students.",
        "additional_details": "Many health care students struggle.to eat and pay bills, and are working clinical placements shifts, on rotation and without payment. I believe that we should support our future nhs by encouraging more students to join the NHS. Making a better financial support mechanism in place will ensure this. Health care degrees are unlike other, they are often unable to get paid work because of the shift pattern of they're placement. I hope you will support us and provide a living wage while on placement.",
        "background": "Nursing and midwifery students enter the profession with compassion, but are being left short! Over 2300 hours of clinical placements are required by the NMC, which can often make students feel like free labour, and forced to take on additional paid work to cover the basics. Give them a living wage.",
