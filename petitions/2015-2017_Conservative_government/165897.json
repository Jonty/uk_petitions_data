        "additional_details": "References to this scenario can be found through out the UK press and other media sources that Mrs May intends to deny our elected MP's their constitutional duty to determine the result of a Bill of Law, based on an advisory referendum (essentially an opinion poll) that was decided by too narrow a margin to warrant dismissing further discussion. This becomes even more relevant since the catalogue of mis-information that has been revealed post referendum.",
        "background": "The Prime Minister Theresa May has stated that she will trigger article 50 using Executive Powers, rather than allowing our elected representatives in the Commons to debate and vote upon the issue, and either pass or block the Act of Parliament constitutionally required to do so.",
