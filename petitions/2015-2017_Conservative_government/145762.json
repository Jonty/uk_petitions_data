        "additional_details": "The referendum result was 51.9 % in favour of leave - only 1.9% over the 50% mark.\r\nThe referendum is not legally binding, only advisory.\r\nThe vote in Scotland was 62.0% if favour of remain and Northern Ireland voted 55.8% in favour of remain.\r\nThe Scottish government has  already started preparing Holyrood legislation to pave the way for second vote to leave the UK.\r\nCountries with written constitutions invariably require a substantial majority for constitutional change, typically two thirds (67%) or three quarters (75%), this EU referendum falls well short of that and does not justify putting the Union at risk.",
        "background": "Scotland voted in favour of remaining in the EU and are now taking steps to leave the UK in order to stay in the EU, this means that the UK will break up and so threatens the future of the United Kingdom. The UK government should not cause the break up by leaving the EU.",
