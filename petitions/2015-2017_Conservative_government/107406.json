        "additional_details": "While nobody can deny the power and emotional impact of images of refugees fleeing war zones and the bodies of children on beaches, these images don't change the fact that we do not have the means to look after all of the people currently here, much less many thousands more. The UK is not in any way shirking its responsibilities, it is providing substantial amounts of money and support abroad for the refugee crisis. This should continue, but the passage of refugees into this country should not.",
        "background": "We cannot accept more refugees. The UK is already overpopulated. The welfare benefit system is under acute strain and the available resources are not sufficient for many of our own people, including the disabled and the old. Social services are in many cases stretched to the point of collapse.   ",
