        "additional_details": "In order for the UK to leave the EU, Article 50 has to be invoked by the UK Government, after which the leave process cannot be stopped.  Delaying Article 50 until after a General Election would allow a newly mandated Government to take action based upon its manifesto.  The delay offers the electorate a breathing space for reflection and an opportunity to gather information as to what is in the UK's best interests, whether the decision is for Uk to stay within the EU or to negotiate an exit.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Why delay? \r\n1. If a newly elected Government is Pro EU it could decide not to invoke Article 50 and thus keep the UK in the EU\r\n2. If a newly elected Government supports Brexit it would have a stronger mandate from the electorate and a better bargaining position in the negotiations to leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
