        "action": "Stop train operators using arrival at final destination as proof of performance",
        "additional_details": "Trains exist to get as many commuters as possible to work or home without disruption. Yet operators' obsession with statistical accountability has led them to abandon the needs of commuters in favour of meaningless performance figures. Anyone who commutes on Southern Trains knows the 'service' is not fit for purpose, yet their statistics show decent performance, on the up. This distortion of reality is wrong. Reliability stats must include every stop to incentivise real improvement.",
        "background": "The use of arrival time at final destination as the primary performance indicator for train operators has led to the cynical practice of cancelling stops along the lines in order to mask late services, disrupting thousands of London commuters on a daily basis.",
