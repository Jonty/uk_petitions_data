        "additional_details": "EE stated both on their website and on the phone, that the devices would be delivered on the release date. No information was given that this would be subject to change and customers were lead to believe that once ordered, their stock was guaranteed to arrive on the 16th. Customers were greeted with text messages on 17th September stating delivery could be up to 28 days but was uncertain. This cannot happen in the future to suck in customers with false promises to get them on their network.",
