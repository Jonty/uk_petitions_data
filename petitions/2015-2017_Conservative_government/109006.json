        "additional_details": "For years young drivers have suffered due to insurance. Our income is low: we shouldn't incur additional costs because we're young. It's ageist and isn't ethically right. Me and my father recently had storm damage, yet he had to pay \u00a3200 for the repair through insurance because of \"experience\" with only 1 years no claims and I, a 21 year old with 3 years no claims, had to pay \u00a3500 excess \u00a3200 additional +\u00a3150! For being 'classed' as a young driver at a total of \u00a3850? This needs to change!",
        "background": "Everyone under the age of 21 receives unjust costs from insurance companies, why do people aged 21+ get cheaper deals? This is completely ageist, there should be equality for everyone with variation due to car power, etc. Younger people shouldn't suffer because we're young? This is wrong!",
