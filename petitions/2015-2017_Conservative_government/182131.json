        "action": "Abolish public funding of the BBC by compulsory TV licence fee",
        "additional_details": "Many BBC news and current affairs programmes have become blatant organs for minority and elitist views on nationally important political subjects, such as Brexit, immigration, \"catastrophic man-made\" climate change, fracking, overseas aid, social benefits, the funding and management of the NHS, and the subordination of British courts to a foreign judiciary.  The people of Britain have the right not to be forced to pay for a politically biased broadcaster with whose views they may not agree.",
        "background": "The political bias evident in BBC news and current affairs editorial is unrepresentative of the views of the majority of its viewers and licence fee payers.  The BBC's \"politically correct\" corporate culture is out of tune with the majority of viewers, who are nevertheless compelled to fund it.",
