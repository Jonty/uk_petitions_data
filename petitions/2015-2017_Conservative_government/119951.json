        "action": "All overground rail companies should have to provide a seat for paying customers",
        "additional_details": "On many overground routes there are many stations which are too small for a long train with 12-15 carriages to be able to stop at whilst allowing access on and off for each carriage. However, it is general practice in some areas, and entirely reasonable to expect that customers can access rear carriages by walking through the carriages on the train. This frees the companies up to provide longer trains without worrying that some stations may not be large enough to provide access to all carriages.",
        "background": "Make it a legal requirement that all overground rail companies must provide a seat for all paying customers. In instances where this is not possible due to unavoidable problems on the line, customers should be reimbursed at the receiving station. ",
