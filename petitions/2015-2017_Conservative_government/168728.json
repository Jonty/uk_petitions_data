        "additional_details": "In my opinion, those who are affected by this are those that have had a family or are a dedicated caregiver. With years of unwavering service to their company & returning part time, how is it justifiable not to consider that service at a time when it is most needed. What if  the job specification never changed, what if you are supporting a full-time role on part-time hours, which is the majority of cases. Redundancy is based on a calculation, a formula, that formula can be adapted.  ",
        "background": "The law is very clear, It is defined as this \"it is your part-time position which is being made redundant, you are therefore being compensated for your current part-time position.\" This is regardless of any previous full-time service, even if that is 10+ yrs of dedication over 2 yrs of part-time.
