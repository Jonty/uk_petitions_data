        "additional_details": "The government is currently offering just \u00a37,500 towards the cost of a new zero emission taxi which is expected to cost around \u00a360,000. \r\n\r\nThis latest blow to the taxi trade means drivers who cannot afford to buy a new taxi will be forced into unemployment and strain our welfare system further.\r\n\r\nI propose a rolling phase out of older taxis, with new licensing being resctricted to new zero emission taxis whilst older vehicles are allowed in service as long as they are road worthy.",
        "background": "The British icon, the black cab taxi is in grave danger of being driven off our streets. \r\n\r\nDue to new emission regulations imposed by the European Union, TFL & Birmingham City Council are forcing up to 43% of taxis off the road.\r\n\r\nThus forcing drivers to fork out \u00a360,000 or find a new job.",
