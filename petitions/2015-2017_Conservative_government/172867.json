        "additional_details": "I am a registered care manager for a leading care provider who offers the highest standards of care with highly trained and qualified staff. Every week we have customers with specialist needs I.E. dementia, who do not have the time allowed by our local authority due to financial restrictions, or choosing a low standard of care agency who are non compliant due to funding.  This has to stop. This should not be a financial lottery.",
        "background": "The elderly should have the right to be entitled to remain in their own homes receiving a high standard of care with dignity and respect, until palliative care if required. This should include continuity of care & time to cover all tasks required for the individual with trained care assistants.",
