        "additional_details": "People claiming disability benefits are expected to lose out after George Osborne announced cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (PIP).The change is expected to save the Treasury more than \u00a34 billion by 2020 but Tory MPs have joined Labour in voicing their fury over the change. The Chancellor hinted he is willing to change his position on the plans, saying he was \u201calways happy to listen to proposals\u201d, but government sources played that down today.",
        "background": "The chancellor moved the goal posts on what it means to be disabled. It is estimated 640,000 people will be classed \"Non-disabled\" Once the changes come into effect, curing them (on paper) And removing their financial security. IDS leaving because of this speaks volumes as to it callousness",
