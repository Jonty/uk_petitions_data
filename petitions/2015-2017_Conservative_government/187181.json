        "action": "Encourage motorcycle manufacturers take more responsible for motorcycle theft.",
        "additional_details": "Many bikes are only able to be locked through the wheels which can be removed relatively easily. If there was a way to secure the frame on more bikes it would make it a lot more difficult to steal. \r\nManufacturers could also install trackers and alarms at the construction stage.\r\nMotorcycles can help reduce congestion in cities and have lower emissions than most 4 wheeled vehicles.\r\nThe problem is too many people are being put off riding a motorcycle because of the risk of it being stolen.",
        "background": "it is not easy to lock up a motorcycle on the street or your driveway however if there were more security features built into the bike, it could provide the additional protection required to do so. \r\n\r\n",
