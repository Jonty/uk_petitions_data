        "action": "No UK military intervention in Syria or Libya",
        "additional_details": "Mr Cameron & George Osbourne are incomprehensibly hypocritical. The War-ravaged parts of the world E.g. Libya & Syria are ONLY war-ravaged because of US military & coalition intervention, funding terrorist groups to take down Gadaffi & Assad leading to the growth of ISIS & ISIL and the devastation of these regions/ & the resulting migrant crisis. That being said western military intervention is the worst possible solution for these desperate parts of the world STAY OUT OF SYRIA STAY OUT OF LIBYA",
        "background": "Earlier this month David Cameron addressed UK citizens on the current unfolding migrant crisis saying, the focus should be on bringing \"peace and stability\" to the war-ravaged parts of Syria. George Osbourne also said \"We have to try and stabilise the countries from which these people are coming\" ",
