        "additional_details": "As evidence of a democratic deficiency in the UK we can recall the recent cash for peerages scandal. Further evidence of a lack of democracy is the way in which the UK adopts the laws made by unelected policy makers in Brussels. These two facts represent a corruption of our democratic principles and place decision making beyond the reach of the public, equating to a lack of accountability which simultaneously underscores the self serving nature of our politics. Referendums can address the issue\r\n",

We believe that the UK as a leading light in the international development of democracy should afford it's people this right.\r\nVoting once every five years seems rather outdated in an era of choice. Real democracy please.",
