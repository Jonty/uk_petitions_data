        "action": "Protect access to state funded benefits and services for humanitarian workers.",
        "additional_details": "In recognition of their contribution to the national interest certain categories of workers, like military personnel and public servants, have their access to benefits and service protected when living overseas in the line of duty. Thus they are treated by legislation as being physically present in the UK, even when overseas. This protection of rights to access state funded assistance or services, from discretionary or mandatory disqualification, should be extended to humanitarian workers.     ",
        "background": "Humanitarian workers who serve oversea with registered charities are discriminated against and do not have the same access to publicly funded benefits and services that UK dwelling people do. Their service in the national interest means that they no longer meet presence based qualification criteria.",
