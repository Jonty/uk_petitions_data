        "additional_details": "For the people of the UK to demand a general election now as a display of no confidence in the current government. \r\n\r\nWe do not want to stop the generation of individual wealth. We accept that the country needs a strong and stable economy.\r\nBut we demand a fair, sustainable, and open system that all help putting in place and all benefit from. \r\nNot the current system which is open to abuse, profiteering and manipulating to benefit the few at the expense of the many",
        "background": "By calling for a General Election now, even if the current Government get back into power, it will send a message that they cannot ignore. A message that lets them know, the people of the United Kingdom have had enough and want to see a fair and open government that benefits all and not just a few",
