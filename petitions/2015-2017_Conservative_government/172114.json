        "additional_details": "Some adults seem to get pleasure out of harming & even killing animals, children see this & think it is acceptable. \r\n\r\nI believe that if we educate children from an early age how to treat animals & how important it is to care for their environment, in years to come we will hopefully see a decline in animal cruelty & neglect.\r\n\r\nA lot of children grow up without experiencing the love of an animal. Some don't understand that animals feel pain & think it's ok to hurt them. \r\n\r\nWe MUST change this !!",
        "background": "Incidences of animal cruelty & neglect are increasing. \r\n\r\nWe must educate children better and equip them with the fact that the animals who share our planet need us to survive and live happy & safe lives. \r\n\r\nIf this was part of school curriculum every child would benefit from this valuable lesson.",
