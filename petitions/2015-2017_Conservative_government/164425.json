        "additional_details": "Personally & anecdotally, only 1 in 5 employers & agencies give acknowledgment of receipt. Of this 20%, almost all give basic, generic reasons why you weren't offered an interview. From interviews, only 1 in 2 potential employers give bespoke feedback. This means for every job applied for, you'll only get a clear reason you weren't considered for the role in around 1 in 40 occasions. How are you supposed to improve? We'd like to see bespoke feedback of at least 100 words given when asked.  ",
        "background": "When applying for jobs, directly or via an agency, there's often no acknowledgment of your application. If you're turned down, you often receive no feedback. There's therefore no transparency & no chance to improve. We'd like to see employers acknowledge receipt and give short, bespoke feedback. ",
