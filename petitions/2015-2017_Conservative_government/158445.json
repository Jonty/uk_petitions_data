        "action": "Guarantee EU migrants rights to live and work in the UK without discrimination",
        "additional_details": "There are 3 million EU migrants in the UK. They contribute to our economy, diversity and culture. It is imperative that their rights are to live and work in the UK are guaranteed. Many have British born children and spouses, including my father, a Dutch migrant of 36 years. \r\n\r\nThe referendum result and lack of certainty has generated fear amongst many migrants I have spoken to. Nicola Sturgeon has already spoken out seeking guarantees for those in Scotland, but we need a nationwide guarantee.",
        "background": "After the result of the EU referendum, there are many EU migrants in the UK that are understandably worried about their future in the UK. They have built their lives here, paid their taxes and many having familes. I ask that these people are guaranteed their future in the UK without discrimination.",
