        "additional_details": "75% of young people voted in the Scottish Referendum of 2015 aged 16-17. There was a 75% turnout of 16-17 year olds in the Scottish Referendum compared to 54% at 18-24 year olds (The Guardian). In 2010, Vienna had 64.2% turnout of 16-17 year olds compared to 56.3% turnout for 18-20 year olds. If 16 year olds were to have the vote, 78% would remain in the EU and 10% would leave. Also, 10% would not know and 5% would not vote (Constitution Unit Website University Liniked). ",
        "background": "16 and 17 year olds are still in education so they are constantly learning about the current world so they know more information about politics than older people over the age of 60. Young people have to live with the consequences of the votes so it is unfair not to grant them a say.\r\n",
