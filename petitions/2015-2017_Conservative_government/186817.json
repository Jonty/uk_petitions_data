        "additional_details": "Local CCGs in England have been holding public consultations to gain support to cease prescriptions of certain medications. Whilst there are special formulas for medical conditions such as reflux, colic and lactose intolerance available at a reasonable price from supermarkets, these formula are not suitable for the treatment of CMPA which requires EHf or AAf formula which is only available from a pharmacist at 8x the cost of standard formula.\r\ncowsmilkallergyguidelines.co.uk\r\ncmpasupport.org.uk",
        "background": "CMPA is the most common allergy in infancy affecting 1.9% to 4.9% of infants and young children. The only treatment for the allergy is total avoidance of cows milk protein, which is achieved through a maternal exclusion diet in breastfed, or by using specialist EHf or AAf in formula fed infants.",
