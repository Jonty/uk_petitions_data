I think that *EH want to hide the Stones from the A303, giving the traffic vibrations as cause of further damage to the site. Just how much vibration would be generated by excavating a tunnel? I maintained the A303 past the site for ten years and have sent a viable considerably cheaper route!",
        "background": "A feasibility study to include a twenty four mile detour to include a Salisbury by-pass would not only delay the work, it would also cost more than a tunnel. I have written to the PM and local MPs regarding the A303 but have received negative responses. ",
