        "action": "Outlaw male as well as female genital mutilation, equalizing children's rights",
        "additional_details": "This petition is founded on the idea that boys and girls have an equal right to a whole body, leaving aside good and proper medical reasons for removing a part of it. The barbaric cutting away of parts of the genitals of infants and children clearly violates this right, as is recognized in the current law against FGM. This petition merely asks that boys and girls be treated equally in UK law.  ",
        "background": "The crime of so-called FGM (female genital mutilation) is often in the news. But why is the mutilation of female children proscribed in law whereas the mutilation of boys is allowed to continue without question? Excepting rare medical cases, there is no rational excuse for this primitive practice.  ",
