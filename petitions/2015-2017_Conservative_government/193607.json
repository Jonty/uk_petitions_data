        "action": "Any referendum on Scottish independence should require a 75% majority to succeed",
        "additional_details": "Based upon the result of the previous referendum and opinion polls since, the indication is that if, in the unlikely event of a vote going the way of independence, it will be with a tiny majority. For something as important as this issue, a substantial majority is required to make independence workable. Ideally, this should be at least 75%. This is a fair figure. Once abstentions are taken into account, a 75% majority would show the clear will of the people. ",
        "background": "If Scottish independence is declared with a tiny majority, then there will not be sufficient support to make it workable and it will set the people of Scotland against each other. For independence to succeed, there needs to be a substantial majority in favour. ",
