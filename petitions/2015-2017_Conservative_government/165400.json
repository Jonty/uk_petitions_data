        "action": "Bring back funding for our healthcare students",
        "additional_details": "From August 2017 the government are cutting the funding for healthcare students. This means they will have to take out a student loan. This will result in approximately 2600 fewer students per year studying nursing in England alone. It will affect the lives of local people countrywide as there will be longer waiting times, less appointments available and a lack of emergency care.",
        "background": "We're are a group of young people who are currently completing our NCS challenge. We are passionate about national healthcare and we feel it is unjust that funding will be taken away from healthcare students.\r\nWe are starting this petition because we believe this funding should be remain available.",
