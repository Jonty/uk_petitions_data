        "additional_details": "The nice guidelines do not warrant funding for hair removal treatments like electrolysis and laser treatments. The management of PCOS is not straight forward and generally becomes a weight related issue, however losing weight is difficult for women who have to suffer with PCOS due to the insulin resistant hormones and imbalances. More research needs to be done and this should be an equality right due to the nature of such a condition that removes a woman's ability to feel feminine in society.",
        "background": "As a woman with PCOS I suffer the effects of hair growth all over my body and face. It is embarrassing and degrading that as a woman I cannot feel feminine yet men are afforded the funding to be female and females are funded for treatments to be male. I deserve the same opportunities as do others.",
