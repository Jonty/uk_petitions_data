        "action": "Restore Parliament's sovereignty by a debate and vote after the EU referendum",
        "additional_details": "1) No legislation exists to make the current vote binding on Parliament\r\n2) The threshold of 37.4% of the electorate voting to 'Leave' would be considered too low for strike action by a trade union. It is much too low for a decision of such national significance, and wildly unrepresentative of the UK as a nation\r\n3) Legal constitutional experts regard the referendum as democratically inadequate, see http://bit.ly/28WC52k and http://bit.ly/291Vpej",
        "background": "In the light of the minority EU referendum result, we call on our elected MPs urgently to restore Parliament's sovereignty by debating and voting against the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.\r\n",
