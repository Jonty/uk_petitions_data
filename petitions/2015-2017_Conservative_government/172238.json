        "additional_details": "From experience, I know that not many people know what pansexuality is. When coming out to my mum, I had to explain to her what my sexuality was. Nobody should have to do that. I first raised this issue at a Kirklees Youth Council meeting, where I found some other people who agreed. We were then advised by Lynn (Outreach Officer) to make an online petition. ",
        "background": "Education is provided on heterosexual relationships but not on any others. Gay and bisexual are briefly touched on in PSHE but not in detail & less common sexualities and genders such as pansexuality, gender non-binary & asexual are not meantioned. It should be compulsory to learn about these too. ",
