        "additional_details": "Many 16-24  year old wage workers are in a supervisory positions to their seniors which disproves the current age before wage system.\r\n\r\nWe have a certain fictitious view in society that 'young people don't need the money' however some of our young people remain the most vulnerable in society.\r\n\r\nThe young are less absent in work, NEET numbers have lowered post recession; Productivity statistics are inconclusive; and if used provide discrimination for all those but people of ages 25-44.",
        "background": "Age is not an over ruling factor on ability or experience;  Young workers supervise older workers with less pay purely based on age!\r\n\r\nWe have 'development wage' protections such as apprenticeships and trainees; a separate minimum wage gives permission to companies to discriminate not to develop.",
