If we do not recognise this atrocity, then we do not remember those 1.5 million who died during the first world war.\r\n\r\nIt's long overdue for the UK to recognise this act of mass genocide and joined the world in condemning this act.  \r\n",
        "background": "We as a country stand at the forefront of human rights. There are many nations globally that we look down on and criticise for abusing human rights, eg Russia, butility fail to respect that the Russian state has officially recognised the Genocide. ",
