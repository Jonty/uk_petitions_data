        "additional_details": "The EU flag as defined by the circle of yellow stars on the rectangular blue background. Once Britain leaves the political Union, this symbol will not only be outdated but will have no place on official documents such as the UK driving license. The symbol, appearing on official government issued documents, signifies the EU\u2019s power over those institutions issuing said documents. Britain leaving the EU means that the EU no longer has any jurisdiction over these British government institutions.",
        "background": "On 23rd June 2016 the British people voted to Leave the EU. Now MP's have voted to accept the PM's Article 50 bill and triggering the process of leaving is imminent, we petition the Government to order the removal of the EU flag from all newly issued UK driving licenses.",
