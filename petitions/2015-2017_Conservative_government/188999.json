        "action": "make it a criminal offence for teachers to give detentions in secondary schools",
        "additional_details": "These days our 12-17 year olds are  getting home late and tired in the morning because a teacher has once again abused their power and issued a detention for some stupid reason like \"he left his seat\" or \"she was turning around\". I think this is very wrong and that teachers should no longer be allowed to give detentions. Another thing is that detentions are being proven not to be working as pupils often get another detention for the same reason. Detentions are wasting time and should be banned.",
        "background": "Too many times teachers in secondary schools have abused their power and given children detentions wrongly.Highly inconveniencing them as they are being forced to  stay behind after school and often making them come to school on a Saturday morning for a wrongfully issued detention.",
