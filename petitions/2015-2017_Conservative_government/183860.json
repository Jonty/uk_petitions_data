            "details": "Until the UK leaves the EU, EU nationals living in the UK, as well as British citizens in other EU Member States, continue to have the same rights and status, and are subject to the same residence requirements under EU law, as was the case before the referendum.\r\n\r\nEU nationals who have lived continuously and lawfully in the UK for at least five years, automatically have a permanent right to reside under EU law. This means that they have a right to live in the UK without having to exercise Treaty rights. EU nationals are not required to apply to the Home Office for documentation confirming their status or their right to be here, although they can do so if they wish.  Guidance on the requirements, how to apply for documentation and details of the current application fee of \u00a365 can be found here: www.gov.uk/eea-registration-certificate/permanent-residence. \r\n\r\nThe Government fully appreciates the importance of giving certainty to EU nationals regarding their residency status.  That is why the Prime Minister has made it one of her 12 negotiating priorities in the UK\u2019s exit from the EU to secure the status of EU nationals already living in the UK, and vice versa, as early as possible once formal negotiations begin.\r\n\r\nEU nationals who have continuously resided lawfully in the UK for six years and who hold a document certifying permanent residence are eligible to apply for British citizenship if they so wish.  \r\n\r\nThe Home Office sets border, immigration and citizenship fees at a level that helps provide the resources necessary to operate the immigration system. The remainder of the funding is currently provided through general taxation. The Home Office aims to reduce the overall level of funding that comes from general taxation by reducing costs and increasing resources generated from fee income. This will enable it to work towards its ambition of a border, immigration and citizenship system that is fully funded by those who use it by 2019-20, as set out in last year\u2019s Spending Review. \r\n\r\nWhen setting fee levels, as well as taking administration costs into account, careful consideration is given to the benefits and entitlements applicants may receive. \r\nBeing recognised as a British citizen is an important and defining moment in a person\u2019s life and British nationality brings many benefits which applicants value very highly. \r\nThese benefits include:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tthe right to vote in general elections;\r\n\u2022\teligibility to apply for a British passport. This removes the necessity to apply and pay for additional visas to visit many countries;\r\n\u2022\teligibility for consular support when outside the UK (unless in a country of which they are also a national). This support includes issuing replacement emergency travel documents, providing help to victims of crime or people in hospital, and making special arrangements in cases of terrorism, civil unrest or natural disasters. This support is not available to other countries\u2019 nationals, even if they may have been legally living in the UK.  \r\n\r\nHome Office",
            "summary": "The rights of EEA and Swiss citizens in the UK remain unchanged.  The Government wants to protect their status, subject to reciprocal protection for British citizens living in other EU countries.",
