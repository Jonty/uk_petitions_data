        "additional_details": "Londoners recognised the substantial benefits of remaining part of the EU as well as the overwhelming risks of leaving. London should not be forced to exit the EU on the basis of a marginal victory for the Leave campaign and a starkly divided national preference. \r\n\r\nThe arrangement proposed herein, would also be complimented by Scotland\u2019s forthcoming course of actions to preserve the integrity of the Scottish vote to remain in the EU. ",

This arrangement would be in preservation of London\u2019s prosperity, global standing and democratic expression to remain in the EU.",
