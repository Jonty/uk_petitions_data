        "action": "Modernisation reforms to Sex Ed in the curriculum to cover sexual harassment",
        "additional_details": "Going through the primary and secondary education system and I believe the curriculum of Sex Ed is in need of serious reform in order to stay relevant to the young people of today and teach them how to identify sexual harassment and show them it's not okay or normal. \r\nPart of the reform would be to include lessons on gender & sexual identity, LGBTQ+ community and body image, all of which are distinctly overlooked issues that greatly concern young people in society today",
        "background": "Currently it's a purely biological approach, which has little application to young people and children, causing misunderstandings. Issues such as sexual harassment are very prominent in schools and very little is done to  educate people on it early on, which can cause serious problems later in life.",
