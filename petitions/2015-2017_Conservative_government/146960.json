        "additional_details": "During the EU Referendum untrue claims were made regarding immigration control and related future policies which were stated to be fact and were in reality only opinions.\r\nUntrue claims were made regarding the use of monies which would not be payable to the EU in the event of Britain leaving the EU. These claims were stated as fact and were misleading and in some cases dishonest.\r\nUntrue claims were made in other areas and these have been revealed in the news media subsequent to the result.",
        "background": "Important information provided  by the leaders of both sides during their campaigns and designed to influence the vote was deliberately untrue. The result of the referendum is therefore unreliable and should not be used to formulate future policy regarding Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU.\r\n",
