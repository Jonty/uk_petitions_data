This trend is increasing. \r\nThe cheapest provider is not always the best for improving services. Private companies withing to gain NHS contracts should have to provide EVIDENCE that they can deliver. They should be held to account when they fail. A halt on further NHS contracts to those companies would be a good idea. ",
