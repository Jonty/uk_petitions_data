        "action": "To have a nation wide standard verbal and non verbal reasoning tests for year 6.",
        "additional_details": "Currently councils all have their own tests over the country.  A standardised test for year 6 students that all councils can access through the high school application process would be a much better practise.  Having 10 and 11 year olds put through testing up to 5 times over a period of 6 weeks is not healthy nor does it promote better learning.",
        "background": "I currently have a year six student and have applied for 6 high schools in 3 different boroughs of London.  My daughter has had 3 different sittings of verbal and non verbal reasoning testing at different schools to band her for the schools entrance criteria.  ",
