        "additional_details": "The previous dat tag gave the option of discounted prices, not only for local residents but commuters and regular users.\r\n\r\nThere is no support for those crossing everyday, they are instead paying out Thousands a year, when those locally have the option of a \u00a320 annual fee.\r\n\r\nThe payments should have been scrapped once the cost of building was settled.\r\n\r\nThe Dartford Crossing is raking in \u00a33MILLION per week in fines alone as people can not afford this upkeep on top of their cost of living!\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The discounted price of \u00a31.67 is not good enough! As an everyday user I now pay roughly \u00a31219.10 a year in crossings, living 10 mins away in erith! Whereas a few roads away in dartford people have the option to pay a \u00a320 yearly fee! This is appalling - there's needs to be support for everyday users.",
