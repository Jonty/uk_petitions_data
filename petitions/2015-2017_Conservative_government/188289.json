        "additional_details": "After being buried alive, the dog was later discovered by a member of the public after hearing the dog moaning in agony.  The dog was taken to a vet, who had to put the dog to sleep and was quoted stating this is the worst case of animal cruelty he had seen in 30 years.  The pair were jailed for only 4 months.  This is unacceptable.  Where is the justice in such a poor sentence.",
        "background": "Michael Heathcock and Richard Finch were jailed today at the Teeside magistrates court for driving a nail through a 16 year old dogs head and burying it alive.  They were only given 4 months in jail.  This is  unacceptable and they should be serving much longer for such a hideous crime.",
