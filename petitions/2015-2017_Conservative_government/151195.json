This may take the form of a European Passport, or a fast-track to citizenship of a nation within the EU.\r\nWe are proud European citizens. We have supported and been supported by the EU for decades, and we fought to Remain in Europe with a right to travel, study and work in Europe. Please offer a way for us to keep our Citizenship of the continent we were born into.\r\n",
