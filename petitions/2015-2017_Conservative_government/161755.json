        "additional_details": "Engagement in politics is crucial for the success of our country. Young people need to be educated to make informed decisions about their leaders. As a teacher, I believe they are able to make mature choices.  \r\n\r\nWe need more policies that engage our young people into our communities. Currently, the voice of young people is too easy to ignore. Giving young people the right to vote, together with more education on politics, will help build a better and more inclusive future for the UK. ",
        "background": "The EU referendum demonstrated how political decisions are potentially being made against the interest of younger generations. Young people need to be trusted with the vote, to ensure they have a strong voice in a future they have a big stake in. ",
