        "additional_details": "Tony Blair's \"half apology\" in October 2015 is not considered enough for the relatives of those who have fallen victim to his wrongdoing.  Everyone deserves an explanation for the warmongering, harassment,  torture, deaths, trauma and not least the public's tax money to initiate over a decade's worth of instability that nobody asked for. \r\n\r\nThe world is still reaping the consequences of Blair's actions with the disastrous refugee crisis and a war in Syria no country wants to be involved in.",
        "background": "Tony Blair seeks refuge in USA to avoid legal punishment for his crimes in Iraq before the publication of Chilcot's report in summer 2016. \r\n\r\nTony Blair must be extradited to the UK to stand trial for his crimes and the mess he has put the UK and the rest of the world through.",
