        "action": "End gvt. contracts to companies which avoid UK tax, or advise on tax avoidance",
        "additional_details": "Many companies - including those running publicly-funded services - do not pay tax on the money they make in the UK, though their businesses & employees depend on the services & infrastructure paid for by UK taxpayers. Meanwhile large accountancy & management consultancy firms benefit from lucrative government contracts while also advising clients on how to avoid paying tax. Public money - grants subsidies & contracts - should not be awarded to tax-avoiding companies or those advising them.",
        "background": "Many large corporations are benefitting from huge government contracts, grants & subsidies while avoiding corporation tax in the UK. The law should prevent the award of government contracts or funds to companies that do not pay tax on ALL their UK income, or to companies that advise on tax avoidance",
