        "additional_details": "Leave campaigners have now said that they cannot guarantee that \u00a3350m will be sent to the NHS, immigration will not be reduced after Brexit, and the UK economy has been massively affected since the decision was announced.\r\nAs the electorate have been misled by some key Leave MPs and Ministers, the EU referendum result should be set aside. A second referendum should be organised as soon as possible, before Article 50 is invoked, so that voters can make an informed decision based on fact not lies.",
        "background": "In the run up to the EU referendum key claims were made by Leave campaigners, including if we leave the EU we can send \u00a3350m a week to the NHS, immigration will be reduced if we leave, and nothing will happen if we do decide to leave the EU. People voted to leave on the basis of  these statements. ",
