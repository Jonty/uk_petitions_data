        "action": "Reunite Britain with a reformed political system",
        "additional_details": "How? \r\n1) Devolve more power and money away from Westminster and into the regions.\r\n2) Introduce proportional representation so the electorate have a wider selection of candidates to choose from. Let's eradicate 'wasted' votes.\r\n3) Controversially, introduce compulsory voting. This would force our education sector to be more politically aware and engaging with younger voters.\r\n4) Make electronic voting available to further encourage accessibility. ",
        "background": "It is clear that the country is divided. England, Scotland, Wales, N. Ireland and London are seemingly at odds with one another and the Westminster elite are not helping. Let's reform the political system to give a fairer, equal governance and voice to the people of the 'United' Kingdom. ",
