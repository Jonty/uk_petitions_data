        "action": "Help from the NHS to provide more mental health support for people aged 16-18.",
        "additional_details": "Being left to find private services at the age of 17 can be very difficult for families as a result of the very high prices. The cost of services can prevent these people from getting the support they need. This time without care can be very detrimental to a young person with poor mental health, so therefore the gap between adolescent and adult services needs to be filled. ",
        "background": "The NHS have many adolescent services but long waiting lists mean that support is unavailable when people most critically need it. When people reach 17, they no longer fit the criteria for an adolescent patient, but don't fit in the age range for adult services, so they are left without support.",
