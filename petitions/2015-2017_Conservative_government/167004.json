        "action": "Standardise ID requirements for all public and quasi-public bodies",
        "additional_details": "For instance some PAs (eg the Bank of England if you want to exchange old bank notes) will accept a driver's licence as proof over address, others (eg my local authority issuing a parking permit) will only accept a utility bill less than 3 months old and not if it is copied from an on-line bill.   NB this is NOT a request for introduction of compulsory ID cards.",
        "background": "At present any public authority (or quasi public authority such as a utility company or railway) can randomly select what ID requirements are needed from members of the public to interact with them.  Surely this could be standardised for all such institutions through very simple legislation.",
