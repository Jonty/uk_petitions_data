        "additional_details": "How many reports have we seen this year alone about children being injured by other children launching fireworks at them? As usual to many.\r\nWhy are supermarkets allowed to advertise \"sales\" on Fireworks from 7/11/16? \r\nIn this day & age why can't fireworks be made to make minimal noise?",
        "background": "If the law was to change to make it illegal to sell to anyone under 25, I'm confident the constant noise on non celebrating days (Fireworks nt, Diwali & New Year's Eve) would dwindle away. Fireworks started 22/10 until 10/12 & back again 24/12 in Dagenham. They're a nuisance especially to Pets.",
