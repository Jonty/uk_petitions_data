        "additional_details": "The British Parliament contains one of the world's largest decision making bodies called the House of Lords. The peers of this House are un-elected. \r\n\r\nIn the EU, the British people could appoint European members of Parliament. But the elected European Parliament is also complemented by un-elected Institutions. The British confirmed they do not want to be apart of this. As the House of Lords is in the British Parliament, the British people have the capability to remove this un-elected House. ",
        "background": "As the UK has voted to \"take back control\" from the EU from what was claimed to be a democratically unaccountable Brussels, we propose that the UK should follow this line of reasoning and \"take back control\" from the un-elected House of Lords by dissolving it.",
