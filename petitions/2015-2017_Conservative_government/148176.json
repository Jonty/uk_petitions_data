        "action": "Hold a 2nd referendum on our membership of the EU to confirm the 1st result.",
        "additional_details": "All voters elegible to vote in a general election should be allowed a vote. The first result carried less than a majority of all elegible voters and only a small majority of the votes cast. So to confirm it as a mandate for Parliament at least 66 per cent of votes cast and at least 55 per cent of elegible votes must support \"leave\". If either or both tests are not met then Parliament may disregard the result of the referendum of 23rd June and choose to reaffirm the UK's membership of the EU.",
        "background": "The 23rd June referendum created division in the country without delivering a clear result. The narrow majority of votes counted is too weak a mandate to command wide public support. To be sure of such a major change in direction a second vote should be held.",
