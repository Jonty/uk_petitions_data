        "additional_details": "Polling information shows the age group 18-50 (those that have to live with this result the longest) is overwhelmingly pro-remain (68%). Their democratic will should not be ignored.\r\n\r\nMore than 1 million Brits were excluded from the vote for having lived outside the UK for more than 15 years. Had they been eligible to vote, this is very likely to have returned a different result. \r\n\r\nIt is appropriate in these circumstances for the UK Parliament to consider convening a second, more open referendum.",
