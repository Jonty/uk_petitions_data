The rate of Carer's Allowance undermines the value of the work undertaken (estimated at \u00a3119bn per year - Carers UK and the University of Leeds (2011) Valuing Carers 2011: Calculating the value of carers\u2019), and the additional expenses that caring can incur -  (Carers UK (2014) Facts about Carers).\r\nCA should be \u00a373.10 for 30 hours, and a lower rate introduced for 16 hours care.

Moreover, the eligibility threshold requires at least 35 hours of care provided. In contrast Working Tax Credit thresholds are 30 hours, and 16 hours for certain categories. ",
