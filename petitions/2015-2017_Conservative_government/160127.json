        "additional_details": "The UK electorate deserve a chance to reconsider their position in the light of emerging realities. It is increasingly clear that any 'Brexit' plan  must be a cocktail of compromises which will inevitably result in permanent disgruntlement amongst many 'Brexiteers' who will believe that whatever they voted for (whether this is based upon issues of immigration, sovereignty or economics, no-one knows) has been illigitimately watered down by the Government which has been left to implement an unclear agenda. ",
        "background": "The UK voted for an exit from the EU on at least 3 grounds, being immigration, sovereignty and economics. Any plan now devised will be a compromise in at least one of these areas which will leave disgruntled pro exit voters. Far better to secure a mandate in full knoweldge of this.",
