        "additional_details": "It's gotten to a point where I have lost all hope and can't sit back and watch more and more animals die at the hands of big companies and labs that prod at living animals like they are probes . I am aware that it is currently illegal for animal tested products to be sold in the uk but it still happens and with the proper paper work there are ways around it . There needs to be more tough regulations about what is considered cruelty to animals . Please help make a change.",
        "background": "\r\nRight now, millions animals are locked inside barren cages in laboratories across the country. They languish in pain, ache with loneliness, and long to be free. Instead, all they can do is sit and wait in fear of the next terrifying and painful procedure that will be performed on them. Stop this .",
