        "additional_details": "The nation still mourns - forget BREXIT, we lost to Iceland 2-1 out yet again from another tournament. The appointment of Roy Hodgson was a disaster from the start and a safe one by the FA who failed to pick the right man because they didn't like him - Harry Rednapp should have been appointed, something most of the nation wanted. \r\n\r\nThe England team need an English manager to put some fire in their bellies, some English pride not another grey suit with little substance who the FA feel is safe!! ",
        "background": "This is the only way I can think of to stop the abject mismanagement of English football. The CEO Martin Glenn announced that his is \"not a football expert\" after the Iceland defeat - SERIOUSLY! We need football people in charge of football matters to cease the sad decline of OUR beautiful game. ",
