        "additional_details": "The fact is that this season there will only be 154 live games on TV. This is out of a possible 760. So 20% of premier league games are on TV. This is completely unacceptable, in the USA 100% of premier league games are on TV, in China all premier league games are on TV.\r\nPretty much all over the world all premier league games are on TV. \r\nWhy can't it be like this here, the premier leagues home country?!",
        "background": "The problem that many people have is that they cannot get tickets to watch premier league games, especially with rising ticket prices.\r\nAnother problem is that so few games are on TV, in the UK. Meanwhile every single game is available all over the word. \r\nI believe that this needs to change.",
