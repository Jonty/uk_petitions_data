        "additional_details": "Production of foie gras is so cruel it would be illegal in the UK under several animal welfare laws, but it can be legally imported and sold despite this contributing directly to the exact cruelty we have laws to prevent? \r\n\r\nForce feeding begins when the birds are 12 weeks old, happens 3 times a day using a pipe forced down the throat, and lasts for 12-15 days. The birds are kept in small, individual cages. They can't stand, walk, preen or stretch their wings. \r\n\r\nAnd all of this for a 'delicacy'.",
        "background": "Foie gras is produced by the cruel and sustained force-feeding of ducks and geese until their livers become enlarged by up to ten times the natural size. This frequently scars the oesophagus and causes their organs to rupture. Many birds literally burst or choke to death on their own vomit.",
