        "additional_details": "All of those who we propose giving the vote to in the coming election would have been able to vote in the 2020 election, had the fixed term elections stayed in place. We also feel that this general election will be pivotal for young people, with many now taking a more active role in politics, and having heightened interest for the political world. This was put in place for the Scottish referendum in 2014, something which was proven successful, and something we would like to put in place.",
        "background": "Since this proposed election will be deciding the future for the whole country- not just for the next five years, but also for the coming decades- we believe that those directly affected by leaving the EU, and the terms on which we do this should be allowed to have their say.
