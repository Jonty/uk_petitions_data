        "action": "Make all breeders of animals carry a licence/permit.",
        "additional_details": "A breeding license would ensure that only respectable breeders would be able to breed, and would stop people putting strain on their horses and pets by repetitively breeding them each season. Rescue centres are having to put pets and horses down daily because of over breeding. Something needs to be done, for the welfare of the animals.\r\nOften these horses (and other animals) are sold at auction in a terrible state sometimes for less than \u00a350 meaning they can often fall into inexperienced hands.",
        "background": "Rescue centres across the country are overflowing with unwanted animals, especially horse & pony sanctuaries. Yet people continue to breed low quality, unwanted horses with serious defects, just to make some quick cash. The horses can be seen tethered on road sides and often abandoned.",
