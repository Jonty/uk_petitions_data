        "additional_details": "MPs have clear, irrefutable data on how their constituents voted in the EU referendum - if they chose to vote against their constituents, then they are not performing their service as our chosen representatives, and the public should have a chance to remove them.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for immediate by-elections in EVERY constituency where MPs voted against their constituents regarding triggering Article 50, regardless of which way they voted.\r\n\r\nThis petition asks simply for true representation.",
        "background": "Members of Parliament are voted to the Commons to represent their constituents views to the country as a whole. In most cases those views are left to the interpretation of the MP and their advisers. For their vote on the Article 50 Commons Bill however, this freedom should not have been allowed.",
