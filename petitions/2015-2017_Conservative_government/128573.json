        "additional_details": "People are very flippant when it comes to chickenpox but it is more dangerous than people think. Not only can you contract meningitis from it but also encephalitis. Both are fatal. The doctors are very quick to fob it off as just chickenpox without thoroughly investigating it. If the vaccination had been given my son wouldn't have contracted meningitis from a simple case of chickenpox. Fortunately he was lucky with no long term brain damage. The same can not be said for other babies and children",
        "background": "We are one of the only countries that do not offer the chickenpox vaccine during childhood. People are unaware of the dangers of chickenpox. Unfortunately I've recently found out when my 8 year old son was admitted to hospital with meningitis chickenpox. ",
