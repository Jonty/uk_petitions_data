        "additional_details": "Majority of council homes and flats in the Kent area belong to illegal immigrants. British citizens are no longer given priority for council housing I once saw two illegal immigrants being offered a two bedroom flat when they claimed to be homeless but when myself a British woman told the council I was homeless I was told to rent privately and not to bother for a council property. Council homes should be for families and people who deserve them not people who have them handed to them.",
        "background": "The whole point of bidding for and gaining a council property is to provide them to the working class so it's affordable housing. Let's keep council housing properties for the British and the registered British citizens. Illegal immigrants can easily rent privately most British people can not.",

People who are in the UK illegally aren't able to apply for council housing. \r\n\r\nLocal councils can only allocate housing to \u2018eligible\u2019 households. Eligibility is based on an assessment of the applicant\u2019s immigration status.  Applicants who are in the UK unlawfully and who have not been granted leave to remain, or who have overstayed their visa, cannot apply for council housing. \r\n\r\nThe eligibility requirements are set out in sections 160ZA and 185 of the Housing Act 1996 (as amended). You can read the Act here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/52\r\n\r\n"
