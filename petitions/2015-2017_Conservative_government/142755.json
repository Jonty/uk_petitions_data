        "additional_details": "There is dissatisfaction within the population about how our political leaders have handled the situation, on both sides.\r\n\r\nIn these challenging times the prime minister has now resigned and there is apparent dissatisfaction about the leader of the opposition.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances  it should not be left to  the political parties alone to resolve the near term leadership of the country. It is, therefore,  vital that the country as a whole should be asked who should lead us in the coming years and months. We must have a general election now.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The in/out UK EU Referendum has been deeply divisive for the UK and is controversial.\r\n\r\nMost of us in the last general election were not voting for or against the most important constitutional change that that we have faced in out life times.",
