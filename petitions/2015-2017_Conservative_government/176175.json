The help should also be regular and given as quickly as possible to reduce suicide statistics- another huge problem from being given inadequate help. ",
        "background": "There is not enough support out there for mental health. \r\nI myself was refused care in order to stop self harming- I was told that if I did want help I needed to pay for each session (around 50 pounds for an hour) and I was also told that I would have to drive an hour each time. \r\nThis has to stop.",
