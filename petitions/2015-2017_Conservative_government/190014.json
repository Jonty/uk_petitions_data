        "additional_details": "In March 2017 Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee published a report on the implications of the UK not securing a deal with the EU within two years of triggering Article 50.  \r\n\r\nChair of the Committee, Crispin Blunt MP, said: \r\n\r\n\"The possibility of 'no deal' is real enough to require the Government to plan how to deal with it. But there is no evidence to indicate that this is receiving the consideration it deserves or that serious contingency planning is underway.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://bit.ly/2mf3QUV",
        "background": "There is a high risk that EU negotiations could breakdown and or that a complex trade agreement cannot be secured within two years. Given the economic implications of this, the Government must seek a new mandate from the people before making a decision that will affect us for decades to come. ",
