        "additional_details": "The solidity of the base of information on which voters have made their decision has been called into question, in particular the claim of \u00a3350 million per week becoming available to the NHS post-exit, with Nigel Farage now acknowledging this widely promoted statistic was a 'mistake'. A petition calling for a second referendum has received more than two million signatories. It is imperative that we explore all avenues to halt the potentially catastrophic outcome of the U.K. leaving the E.U.",
        "background": "As David Lammy MP has pointed out, the referendum was 'an advisory, non-binding referendum'. The impact of this referendum has already significantly damaged our economy, may threaten the future of the Union, and has alienated millions. The option of a Commons vote must be considered.",
