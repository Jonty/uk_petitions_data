        "additional_details": "Some people may be unable to let their dog off lead, and want to give the feeling of freedom to their believed animal, this is understandable. However it's not only death or seriously injury to the dog which is at stake, a car swerving and avoiding the dog could cause harm to pedestrians and other road users, this has happened to me many times but luckily I've avoided any harm.  I know someone who's dog was killed when his wife used a retractable lead on a residential street, it's avoidable.  ",
        "background": "There isn't a day goes by where I almost wrap a dog around the wheels of my car because the owner fails to retracts the lead enough to stop the dog wandering into the road. I'm a dog owner, I love animals, walk them on a retractable lead by all means, but do it away from traffic and risk of death.",
