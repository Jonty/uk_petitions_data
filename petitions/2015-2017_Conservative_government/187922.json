        "action": "ALL hunting must be banned, including trail hunting.",
        "additional_details": "Members of the hunting parties have been caught on camera trespassing, riding over protesters, brandishing their whips, using discriminatory and offensive language and causing ABH. Video evidence has been passed on to the authorities, who repeatedly claim there is not enough evidence to convict. There is seldom 'sufficient proof' that an animal died, or a person was hurt.\r\n\r\nIf trail hunting were also banned, evidence of law breaking would be more clear cut. Hunting with hounds should be outlawed.",
        "background": "Hunting has been against the law for over a decade, yet foxes and hares continue to be killed by various parties which operate under the guise of 'trail hunting'. These hunting parties either deny killing the foxes, or claim that their hounds have killed 'accidentally'.",
