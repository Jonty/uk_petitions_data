        "additional_details": "Two ways to leave the EU - invoke Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union OR repeal the European Communities Act, 1972. Article 50 is Britain giving notice to the EC of its intention to leave - can take two years to finalise unless agreement is made with the EC on our withdrawal terms. Repealing the 1972 Act ends our membership immediately. The EU is taking more and more power away from Westminster and new laws to be introduced in early 2016 will make a referendum pretty much null and void.",
        "background": "Our membership of the EU depends on the European Communities Act 1972 and repealing this Act is the quickest way to get us out. Britain is to have a referendum on our continued membership of the EU by the end of 2017 - a long way off. Our membership depends on this Act, let's end that now.",
