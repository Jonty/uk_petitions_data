        "additional_details": "It seems unconstitutional that a small portion of the electorate (residing within the Conservative party) approx. 0.003% of the population should determine who should govern the country. \r\n\r\nI would also suggest that the EU referendum result now affects the Conservative party's ability to deliver its manifesto pledges & therefore the government now needs to re-approach the electorate to request a new mandate to govern which encompasses policies to deal with the aftermath of the referendum result.",
        "background": "Following the resignation of the PM post EU referendum result, surely a new conservative leader should invoke a General Election in 2016 (despite the fix term parliament) to allow the electorate to support the mandate of the new conservative party leader to continue to govern the country.
