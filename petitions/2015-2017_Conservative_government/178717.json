        "additional_details": "This is an issue that was seen in TV chef Michel Roux Jr's kitchen.. As he was making his chefs work up to 14-16hrs a day, & their shifts would result in them earning as little as \u00a35.50 per hour. At Le Gavroche restaurant a main meal will go for \u00a360.. This surely can't be an issue of restaurants not making enough money, Even if this was the case.. In no other industry would workers be earning less than minimum wage due to a business not making enough money. It would be illegal.",
        "background": "A lot of restaurants choose to pay their chefs \"Per shift\" & not by the hour. Which wouldn't be a problem if shift length was clearly stated E.G Shift = 6hrs. \u00a351 per shift. But this isn't the case.. Chefs are made to work 9+ hours per shift equaling \u00a35.66 the hour. LESS than minimum wage. ",
