        "additional_details": "1. Scotland is likely to have another referendum and may well leave. Ireland could do the same\r\n\r\n2. Leaving the EU will not mean the foreigners in Britain leave\r\n\r\n3. The Leave campaign had promised to spend \u00a3350m a week on the NHS but have backtracked on this, amongst other promises\r\n\r\n4. The Pound has plunged and Brexit has affected Great Britain's credit rating negatively\r\n\r\n5. It will have an adverse impact on British business and any trade deals between us and the EU as well as travel and holidays",
        "background": "Whilst I voted to Remain, I know of a lot of people that voted to leave and now have buyers remorse and would like the opportunity to change their minds. They either hadn't fully realised the consequences or weren't fully aware of the facts and would like to make amends and have a second chance.",
