        "additional_details": "Info from www.canoe-england.org.uk:\r\nOver 96% of river systems are without public access.\r\nThe legal situation is unfavorable for access.\r\nOwners of riverbeds and banks have riparian property rights, but do not own the water.\r\nRiparian owners can exercise control over access to inland waters where there is not a right of access.\r\nThe Govt has agendas for increasing access to coastlines, physical exercise, improving health and outdoor education. \r\n\r\nAccess to our rivers should be a right!",
        "background": "Currently if you'd like to enjoy English and Welsh waterways you're likely to be accused of trespassing because the bed and banks of rivers and canals are privately owned, unlike Scotland/the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nI believe our rivers should be open to all to enjoy.",
