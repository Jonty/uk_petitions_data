        "additional_details": "40% of the overseas aid budget multilateral organisations, such as the United Nations and is wasted.\r\nAid goes to countries that can well afford to look after their own such as  India.\r\nWhat is being done is equivalent to a family borrowing money on it credit card so it can give it away and hence continue to increase its debt year on year.\r\nThe overseas aid budget is forecast to reach 16 billion by 2020.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Currently the UK spends \u00a312 billion, all of which it has to borrow, on overseas aid. As a percentage of GDP this is four times that of the USA which is the largest aid giver in the world. In effect the UK is adding to its debt each year that it carries on this ludicrous policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
