        "additional_details": "Please support this, many people need your help. Not only gambling money they can't afford but hiding the truth from people who truly care about them. Making them feel depressed and not knowing where they can turn.",
        "background": "I think it should be illegal to gamble on credit cards as it allows vulnerable people to easily get into debt with money that they should have never been allowed to gamble with. People with the addiction can easily use the full amount of credit chasing the previous bet they lost. Puts lives at risk",
