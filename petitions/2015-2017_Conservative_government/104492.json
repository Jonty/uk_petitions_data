        "action": "Reverse the Health & Social Care Act 2012, and stop clinical commissioning",
        "additional_details": "The introduction of non-centralised clinical commissioning groups has dismantled vital NHS infrastructure, by diverting NHS budgets outside of the NHS. The ability of individual health authorities to benefit from the NHS's collective buying power, and thus lower prices, has been vastly diminished. Commissioned health services are more expensive, and less connected. The ability of local health services staff to implement change for the better has been diminished. Clinical commissioning must STOP!",
        "background": "The coalition government introduced the Health & Social Care Act into law in 2012. This act of parliament has been responsible for the dismantling of Primary Care Trusts and Strategic Health Authorities, who now are required to commission local NHS services from independent organisations.",
