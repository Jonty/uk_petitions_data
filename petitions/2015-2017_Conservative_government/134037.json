Apparently nobody likes looking at pictures of 2yr olds and knowing we've sentenced them to death! But it's not just toddlers who can die crossing the Channel. The sight of emaciated 30yr olds huddling on the ground, trying to keep warm should hurt too! Where is your compassion Brits? Where is your pity?",
        "background": "Five years a war has been raging in Syria! Thousands of innocents are being killed! Millions more are pouring out of Syria, desperate to get to Europe. Instead of doing our utmost to help them we have barred them from our doors! The amount of refugees we've admitted would fit on a train!",
