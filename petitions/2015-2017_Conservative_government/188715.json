        "additional_details": "Rexie came to the UK after a hellish start in Romania. Although 14 years old, he was in good health. He had a painful limp due to an earlier break in his leg that had gone untreated. On his arrival in the UK, his new foster parent took him to her vet. It was decided to amputate his leg, after several assessments and x-rays, and Rexie came through this operation well. He adapted to his 3 legs and was able to lead a normal, enjoyable life. His new owner had him pts without the Rescue's knowledge.",
        "background": "A potential adopter made enquiries to adopt Rexie, a golden retriever, from Safe Rescue, a dog rescue charity. After a homecheck, she collected Rexie on Sat, 11.02.17, initially staying in contact with the fosterer to say how well Rexie had settled in. On Monday Rexie was put to sleep for no reason.",
