The petition at https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/make-royals-pay-for-palace-renovation already has 121,000 signatures but the government will simply ignore that, so I have started this petition.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and share it!!!",

We should not be made to pay for the luxuries of the privileged.",
