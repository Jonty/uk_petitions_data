        "action": "Introduce legislation to protect officers tackling motorbike & auto crime",
        "additional_details": "Many crimes are carried out on motorcycles, robberies, shootings & drug dealing. Police wont pursue in case the criminals hurt themselves & officers are scared to use stop stick in case the criminal gets injured & they get blamed. Recent incidents in Merseyside have seen up to 60 motorbikes causing mayhem at one time, many on stolen bikes, riding on pavements, through red lights etc. Legislation is needed to protect officers so they can tackle this problem effectively & put blame on offenders.",
        "background": "Police officers have high levels of training in pursuit driving & tactical resolutions yet are afraid to use tactics i.e. Stop stick on motorbikes. There is no protection in law if something goes wrong and an offender is hurt. Motorbikes fail to stop regularly, commit crime & police can't pursue.",
