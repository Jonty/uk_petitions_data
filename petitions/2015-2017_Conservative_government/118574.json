        "additional_details": "The NHS is at breaking point. Funding per capita is falling in the face of rising demand, fewer beds, staff vacancies and dwindling morale. We spend less as a % of GDP than most rich countries despite having some of the best healthcare outcomes.\r\n\r\nWhilst some efficiency savings are needed, the NHS is crying out for more money. That's why we need a referendum about its funding so YOU, the people who pay for and use the service, can decide what you want in the future.\r\n\r\nRefs: http://bit.ly/1P2AnLg",
        "background": "The NHS is a cherished institution. In recent years it's faced huge pressures due to rising demand and an ageing population in the face of falling budgets.\r\n\r\nAs a country, we need to decide if we want to fund the NHS by increasing tax/creating a new NHS tax or co-pay/switch to an insurance model.",
