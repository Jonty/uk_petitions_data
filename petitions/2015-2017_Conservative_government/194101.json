Period\" I was somewhat comfortorted to know that at least the tax money will be used to address women's specific needs and inequalities. How can funding anti-abortion promote my right, as a woman?! Women need more support to deal with this difficult situation rather than trying to be guilt tripped! Stop using my money to disadvantage women!",
        "background": "Abortion is a difficult decision a mother makes for the sake of her child. This can be a joint parental decision. Funding organisations that are anti-abortion already put women in a disadvantaged position. The point of tampon tax distribution was to address women's specific needs and inequalities.",
