        "additional_details": "The idea of this campaign is to provide children with a better education of the web itself. This being manipulated in to giving personal details e.g: mobile numbers, home addresses, where they school, & photographs of themselves. Some believe children are easily drawn in by the internet and mystery of it all, I agree! So I think it's only fair we educate children on how to use the web safely, how to report situations they feel uncomfortable with, and to protect themselves. ",
        "background": "Educating children the basics on how to stay safe online is probably being done as we speak. However, the web is now scarier than ever as we all know. Bank details are being hacked, social media accounts, email's, photos, & text messages are no longer safe. So what is safe for our children? ",
