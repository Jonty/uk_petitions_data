        "action": "Submit the negotiated settlement of the relationship with the EU to a referendum",
        "additional_details": "It was stated repeatedly during the campaign that Free Movement of People would be ended, that \u00a3350m pounds per week would be paid to the NHS, that the UK would leave the Free Market. Since these were prominent proposals of the Leave campaign, it is likely that voters will have been persuaded by them. It now appears that there was no clear plan by the Leave campaign for an alternative to EU membership and that the proposals will not now be fulfilled.",
        "background": "It was not clear what constituted the Leave option in the EU Referendum. Promises and proposals were made that appear to be undeliverable. The eventual alternative to EU membership could be less favourable to the UK than continuing membership. The electorate deserves a clear and concrete choice.",
