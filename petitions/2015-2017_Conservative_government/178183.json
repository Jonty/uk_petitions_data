        "additional_details": "https://youtu.be/0WlVMeIEYpk\r\nThe PM repeatedly avoided a clear question on this issue, providing no reassurance to the public or the Commons about the safety of Trident.\r\nThe Trident Comission estimates that \u00a32.9 billion will be spent annually on Trident. If it is not in working order, it poses a massive risk to the world, as well as being a waste of taxpayers' money.",
        "background": "The Commons voted to renew the \u00a32.9b/year Trident nuclear missile program. We, the taxpayers, respect the outcome of democracy. However, if Theresa May made clear that Trident had malfunctioned, the result of the vote may have changed. Impeach the PM for dishonesty and a disservice to the people.",
