        "additional_details": "A hastily called referendum with an outcome teetering on a 4% margin, excluding the 16 /17-year-olds whose futures hang in the balance, is not the way in which permanent decisions with the power to permanently affect lives should be made in this country. \r\n\r\nWe wish to remind our elected representatives that referendums are not legally binding elections; particularly in the case of such stark, emotional division and such tiny margins, with such potentially catastrophic permanent consequences.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "In light of such an overwhelmingly narrow referendum result, with so much at stake for British citizens here and abroad, we the undersigned now call upon our elected representatives to do their job - honouring our system of representative democracy.\r\n\r\nWe call for an immediate Parliamentary vote.",
