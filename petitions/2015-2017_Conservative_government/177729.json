        "additional_details": "During the campaign for Leave those involved in the campaign, including Daniel J. Hamman, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage all stated their belief that the UK should remain a member of the single market. The government was elected on a manifesto that stated the UK would remain in the single market.\r\n\r\n16,141,241 people voted against leaving. Recent polling by the Sunderland Echo showed increasing support towards remaining in the European Union.",
        "background": "The Prime Minister has announced that the exit by the UK will be made on the worst possible terms. Government will take us out of the single market and the Prime Minister lied when she claimed that all British citizens supported this. We do not and we condemn a PM who would lie in this manner.",
