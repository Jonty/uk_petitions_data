        "action": "Make non-partisan political education compulsory in schools up to the age of 16",
        "additional_details": "In the run-up to elections and referendums, media sources and politicians sometimes prey on voters' bewilderment by propagating false information or distorting the facts.\r\n\r\nIn the longer term, the situation could be improved if citizens are equipped in schools with a basic knowledge of the structure and functioning of the UK political system and other bodies, and key skills such as the ability to assess the credibility, reliability or bias of information sources and to debate issues openly.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "UK citizens are asked to make decisions on matters of immense national concern, but many of us have been given little or no political education in school. A society cannot be considered truly democratic if its citizens are not all equipped with the knowledge and skills to make an informed decision.",
