        "additional_details": "Over 170,000 packs were supplied in 2014-2015 than in 2013-2014.\r\nThose figures only cover the 445 food banks in the UK run by the Trussell Trust. But it's not the only organisation running food banks in the UK. There are many independent local initiatives & other providers of emergency food assistance too, E.G soup kitchens or 'Meals on Wheels'. In total the estimated emergency food assistance providers in Britain is 1,500.\r\n\r\nIt's time the poor are fed by the rich, not the rich fed by the poor.",
