        "action": "Increase expenditure on antibiotic research to create new bacteria killing drugs",
        "additional_details": "Antibiotic resistent bacterial infections are a major threat to life on earth. Annually, more people die from sepsis every year than lung cancer. That's 37,000 to 35,000; and the numbers will only increase as bacteria mutates in order to become resistent to our most advanced antibiotics - as according to Antibiotic Research UK. Only 2 new antibiotics have been developed in the last 40 years and as a result infections are mutating faster than scientists can develop new drugs.",
        "background": "Antibiotic resistant infections are becoming a bigger and deadlier threat to life on earth. By 2050, a simple cut on the finger will leave patients in hospitals, fighting for their life. Help by signing this petition to develop new bacterial killing antibiotics by increasing expenditure on research.",
