        "additional_details": "I do not think that Mr Cameron can renegotiate our terms of membership, the British people are being ignored. \u00a312 billion in cuts to the British people, a million people using food banks yet we give \u00a320 BILLION to the EU & \u00a312 BILLION in foreign aid. A BILLION pounds has gone to Syria. Nearly 200,000 homeless in the UK yet we can take in thousands more? \r\nSign this petition so your voice can finally be heard, we want a referendum, not renegotiation of membership. ",
        "background": "Mr Cameron has said he will hold a referendum IF he cannot renegotiate terms of our membership. We don't want renegotiation, we want out. The referendum should be held in 2016 and the people that elected him should be listened to. It's not for Mr Cameron to decide what the British public want.",
