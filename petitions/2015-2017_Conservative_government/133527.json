There is still time to iron out the problems we face in Europe, ie: immigration control. \r\n\r\nAccording to Yvette Cooper prior to the polls opening, 72% of 16-24 year olds wanted the United Kingdom to remain within the European Union. We are the ones who will have to live with this decision and we aren't the ones who wanted it. 48% is too many to ignore. \r\n\r\n#DontIgnoreThe48 #WeAreThe48\r\n",
