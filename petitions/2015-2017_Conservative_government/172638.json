        "additional_details": "1.5 million young people have been affected by bullying in the past year, 145,800 young people are bullied EVERYDAY. This causes mental issues like anxiety and depression, even suicide. Suicide is the 3rd cause of death among young people. Which is why we want the government to give out harder punishments to those who bully others, those who think it's okay to make someone feel like they aren't good enough. Please sign this petition and hopefully we can change this and help those suffering. ",
