        "additional_details": "In light of what has just happened in Paris and the constant threat in the uk I believe police officers should be equipped to not only protect themselves but also the public. Every officer in Paris had their guns drawn the other night with terrorists on the loose. What would have happened if a similar attack happened in the uk ?? Police tape off the area and await an armed unit ?! This is not good enough. Sign the petition to arm British police.",
        "background": "Enough Police have died in the line of duty over the years. Almost all nations around the world have armed front line police. Why does Britain not have front line police who can protect themselves against guns, which criminals can get easily. Lets protect our public and brave police officers. ",
