        "additional_details": "Historically Scotland have always been very reluctant members of the UK. Nicola Sturgeon & co. continue to undermine the UK economic outlook with constant threats to break up the Union. I believe,(should a 2nd referendum be petitioned), that the rest of the UK should be entitled to a vote on whether we want Scotland to remain part of the UK or not.",
        "background": "Why should the Scots determine the fate of Sterling & to some extent the UK economy as a whole with a 2nd independence referendum? Shouldn't the rest of the UK have a vote on whether WE want Scotland to remain part of the UK?",
