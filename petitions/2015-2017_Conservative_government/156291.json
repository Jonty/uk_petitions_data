For any democratic action, the electorate is the decision maker and therefore must be well informed.\r\nIf the political and economic class knowingly provides incorrect information, if they are not held to account by a free media, the law must hold their words to account.\r\nIf our democracy is to function effectively, it cannot have an uninformed electorate.\r\n\r\n",

The Iraq War, the Conservative Manifesto, now the EU Referendum. \r\nWhichever side of the debate we are on, our political leaders choose to further their own goals through a general deceit of the electorate.",
