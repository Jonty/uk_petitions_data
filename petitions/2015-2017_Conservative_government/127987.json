        "action": "Repeal section one of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991",
        "additional_details": "The RSPCA, Dogs Trust, KC, British Veterinary Association and many more organisations state that Breed Specific Legislation does not protect the public. With the additional powers under the Anti Social Crime and Policing Act 2014, the powers now exist to deal with any potential issues or nuisances before any dog injures any person. This also promotes education if used correctly. Millions of pounds saved by repealing BSL should be directed into ensuring these new provisions are properly enforced.",
        "background": "After 25 years prohibiting dogs based on breed type has proven illogical, ineffective and costly. It fails to protect the public and can never achieve its aim of eradicating the four types of dogs as legal crossbreeds can be deemed illegal regardless of parentage or behaviour.",
