        "action": "Change the law to ensure the safety of children crossing roads near schools",
        "additional_details": "On gypsy lane in Nuneaton, 2 crossing patrol staff members have unfortunately been unable to fulfil their roles due to extremely sad circumstances. As a result children are having to cross an incredibly busy, dangerous road, resulting in children nearly being hit at speed by dangerous drivers. Due to the current legal requirements, the police nor the council have to provide safe passage which is putting children at serious risk. The duty of care is non existent and this needs to change.",
        "background": "Make it compulsory for local councils to be held accountable for ensuring that children can cross busy, dangerous roads safely when walking to school.\r\nLocal councils currently do not have to provide a solution for children crossing busy roads and it is at their discretion.",
