        "additional_details": "A lot of young people from rather poor backgrounds are not being able to get insured on a vehicle meaning they are resorting to illegal ways just to get car insurance, insuring a vehicle will cut insurance crime in half. A lot of other countries use this method and it works quite well. Everyone should be able to drive a car if they have a full uk driving licence it shouldn't be about how wealthy you are and where you live. ",
        "background": "I would like insurance company's to be able to insure a car it self instead of each driver that uses it having to be insured, so anyone with a Full U.k. driving licence will be able to drive the car aslong as it's insured. This will reduce crime as less people will be driving with out insurance. ",
