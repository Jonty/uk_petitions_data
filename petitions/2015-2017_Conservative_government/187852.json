        "action": "I want you to change the law of cancer smear tests for women!! It should be 18+",
        "additional_details": "From the interview I gather the only reason smear testing isn't eligible for under 25s is because they are not at high risk of cervical cancer because they don't have as many sexual partners as over 25s. This is the 21st century and people are nieve if they don't think girls as young as 15 have multiple sex partners. I have read over 5 story's in the news about women under 25 dying of ovarian cancer because they were denied a smear test. I have a lot of women supporting me behind this.",
        "background": "I lost my mum to ovarian cancer, for the past 6 months I have volunteered my time to work closely with cancer patients up & down the uk. I am attending & speaking at the Macmillan cancer conference in Manchester on the 25th march. I interview a doctor about smear testing for women.",
