        "action": "Make MPs resign if they oppose the will of the majority of their constituents.",
        "additional_details": "This is not so with those of us who are rich and powerful. These people have the means to influence government decisions through lobbying and legal challenge, both not readily available to the general public.\r\nThese methods of changing government actions are a challenge to the democratic processes of a nation and introduce inequality into a democratic society. To meet that challenge and rebalance democracy  this petition asks parliament to introduce a bill that holds members of parliament to immediately resign from office if they are found to be opposing the will of the majority of the constituents they represent.\"",
        "background": "The British people vote for their preferred members of parliament every five years. During the five year period of government the average British citizen has little influence over decisions and actions of the government of the day.\r\n",
