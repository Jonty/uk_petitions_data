        "additional_details": "UK Government policy on immigration should be changed to take due account of the following:\r\n\r\n-     Where people have resettled here at considerable personal expense under a previous immigration programme.\r\n\r\n-      Whether people come from Commonwealth countries where the Queen is Head of State.\r\n\r\n-      The opinions and recommendations of their local elected representatives and of the Leader of the democratically-elected devolved Government should carry an appropriate level of weighting by UK Gov.",
        "background": "The Brain Family in Dingwall moved over from Australia under a visa programme that was subsequently revoked without any exceptions being made for them.  After much publicity and support from their MP and the First Minister of Scotland, their stay has been extended but are prohibited from employment.",
