        "action": "Allow all people diagnosed with an ASC to access concessionary travel passes",
        "additional_details": "The DSMv (diagnostic standards manual) effectively did away with the distinctions that had previously been drawn between autistic spectrum conditions. For several years now the standard diagnosis is for ASC and IQ is no longer routinely tested. This means that children are unable to meet the criteria for concessionary travel, despite their genuine social and sensory difficulties in accessing public transport. The guidelines must be updated. ",
        "background": "The law as it stands regarding concessionary travel passes is discriminatory and outdated. For people with an Autistic Spectrum Condition there is a postcode lottery of access depending on their local council's definition of a \"learning disability\". This discrepancy must be resolved. ",
