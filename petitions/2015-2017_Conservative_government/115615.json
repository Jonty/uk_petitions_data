        "additional_details": "To summarise, nobody, or - at most - incredibly few people treat petition.parliament.uk seriously, and the government certainly don\u2019t.\r\nThe \u201cBan Donald Trump\u201d petition - seen as a joke by signatories. The \u201clegalise cannabis\u201d and \u201csack Jeremy Hunt\u201d petitions - seen as jokes by the government.\r\nWhat purpose, other than theatre, can a website that achieves nothing serve?",
        "background": "The petition to end all petitions. Literally.\r\nThis website is a farce. People use it for posting jokes, and things that will never, ever be considered by government.\r\nNot only that - the threshold for government response is so low, it\u2019s undemocratic; yet few petitions even reach this pitiful level.",
