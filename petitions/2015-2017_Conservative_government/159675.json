        "additional_details": "A law should be introduced that ensures that before any violent engagement all other options are exhausted.\r\n\r\nA rushed decision should not be made just to silent the public due to an incident or tragic event but rather full procedures should always be followed and the aftermath of the engagement should be given great consideration. \r\n\r\nA vote in the parliament is not enough and can not justify the loss of millions of lives especially when it is apparent like in the Chilcot report that the UK led by Tony Blair was rushed, mislead and ill-prepared for the aftermath. There must be more public involvement in such  decision making. Full responsibility must be put on the Prime Minster of the time. \r\n",
        "background": "The Chilcot report has now made it clear \"the UK chose to join the invasion of Iraq\"  and \"Military action at that time was not a last resort\".\r\n \r\nA step by step process should be adopted and implemented before the country goes to war with a country or a people.\r\n\r\n",
