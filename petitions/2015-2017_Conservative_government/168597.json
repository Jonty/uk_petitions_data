        "action": "To keep the Four Freedoms as defined by membership of the EEA even after Brexit.",
        "additional_details": "For example, many small businesses voted Leave in protest of excessive EU regulations. Many more individuals voted Leave because they believed it would help fund the NHS. Plenty voted Leave to give the UK sovereignty over its own Laws. Others voted in protest of the Tory policy of austerity. Only a MINORITY of the voters voted Leave to control migration. The Government should, therefore, keep the Four Freedoms in the Brexit negotiations as is the wish of the voting majority.",
        "background": "All those who voted Remain and many who voted Leave are in favour of the Four Freedoms and accept that this includes Free Movement of People. These voters are the true majority. Restricting European migration was NOT an option on the ballot paper and should not, therefore, be a Brexit \"deal breaker\"",
