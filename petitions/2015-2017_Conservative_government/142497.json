        "additional_details": "Universities do not actually know how the program will be affected as there were no contingency plans put in place. Therefore while there is no guarantee it will be affected in the likely event of Brexit it is an EU funded scheme and so it is likely that the program will be heavily affected. Furthermore it is still unclear how Brexit negotiations will work and so the aim of this petition is to make Erasmus a priority. \r\nAround 3.7 Billion is generated every year by EU students. \r\n-The Independant ",
        "background": "The Erasmus program is an EU scheme which has helped students gain experience studying abroad since 1987. This is at risk due to the likely 'Brexit' and regardless of your stance on the referendum it remains brilliant opportunity that students are at risk of missing out on. ",
