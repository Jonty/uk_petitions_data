        "additional_details": "For instance I'm an 18 year old who has passed the HGV course, I hold a CPC card and drive professionally every day, yet i am paying more money for my second year of driving (even with the HGV entitlement) using the same car, with no crashes and no claims, then i did when i first started driving.  \r\n \r\nInsurance companys should be FORCED to lower prices and take into consideration the experience people have. Not ALL young drivers are bad drivers, older people can be just as bad! \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Insurance premiums for young driver are extremely expensive and insurance companys do not take in to consideration each person, they are putting us all under one label. It is unjust that a young person, who works for minimum wage to be charged thousands of pounds to drive.\r\n",
