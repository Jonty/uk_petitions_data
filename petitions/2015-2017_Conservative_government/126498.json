        "action": "Introduce topics about gender equality and racial equality to the curriculum.",
        "additional_details": "I know first hand that the majority of boys in school will continue to think it is acceptable to objectify and show little respect to girls. In addition, many of the students will think it is okay to make racist remarks because they don't know any better. There is a platform that reaches these students' minds and can influence their thinking. We need to make it so they won't leave school uneducated on basic respect and social issues.",
        "background": "School is supposed to provide people an education so that they be ready for the 'real world'. What is the point when people aren't educated on social justice matters? The lack of education on racial and gender issues leaves a lot of people growing up with narrow-minded and ignorant opinions.",
