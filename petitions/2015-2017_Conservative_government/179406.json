People are already having the essential care they need being reduced dramatically. The government will put no more money into social care, but the government can make all councils raise council tax by 10% and put all of this extra revenue straight back into the care system. In this country people should not have to beg for help. It needs to end now. ",

The government are capping the amount of money it pays care providers at \u00a315.64 per hour. The social care industry will collapse under the strain.",
