        "additional_details": "We need a fresh approach with a manager who will transform the club, from being boring to an adventurous and successful club. Fans pay for expensive tickets to every game, just to be disappointed and leave the Emirates Stadium with anger. The club is OURS, not his and we need him OUT! The board needs to be changed, as the lack of resources being invested produces nothing but failure every season. A team such as Arsenal should be challenging for the tittle, yet we challenge for 4th place.",
        "background": "He arrived in 1996 and transformed the club, helping it develop into a consistent Top 4 team and winning almost every possible trophy available, making him one of the most accomplished managers around. However, he is destroying OUR club and his own legacy, going trophyless for 9 years.",
