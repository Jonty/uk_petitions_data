        "additional_details": "It is deeply inefficient for employees to repeatedly redraft their contact details, educational qualifications, and job histories, during every single job application. \r\n\r\nIt would radically increase labour market efficiency if companies accepted CVs containing general information, followed by more specific questions about the candidates aptitude for the advertised role.\r\n\r\nCandidates could then apply for more jobs in less time, shrinking their level of requirement for tax funded welfare support.",
        "background": "The government should be working to make getting a new job as fast and simple as possible, yet those seeking work have to fill out forms that outline the same information in slightly different formats over and over again. The government should incentivise streamlining the job application process.",
