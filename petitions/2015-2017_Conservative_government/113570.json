        "additional_details": "Fines for parking on zigzags already exist.  Police and councils do not have the capacity to enforce them. It is therefore left to schools to ensure the safety of children & adults. This is unacceptable & unmanageable. A 2013 report showed 1,000 children a month were injured around schools. 37% of schools had at least one child road injury annually from 2006-11. There were 85,814 child injuries on roads within 500m of schools & 557,200 vehicle collisions;  6 collisions per school per year. ",
        "background": "We are a large, outstanding primary school in Erith, in the London Borough of Bexley.  Parking on zigzag lines is dangerous and compromises the safety of children travelling to and from school.  Our aim is to make parking on zigzag lines carry a penalty of 3 points on driving licences and a fine. \r\n",
