        "additional_details": "In the first minute of trading after the referendum \u00a3122 billion was wiped off the value of FTSE 100 companies and the pound has plummeted 10% in the first day. \r\n\r\nThe USA has the hamburger, Germany has it's cars. Britain has it's... cake according to Boris Johnson. I strongly disbelieve the fact that Britain's economy will thrive without trade agreements as we seem to have no signature products to trade with. Remaining in the single market will allow the free movement of goods and people.\r\n",
        "background": "Staying in the single market keeps many of the benefits of the trading agreements in the EU. We will still remain out of the EU and still have full control of most laws not related to trading. \r\n\r\nTensions are growing in Europe and they may not welcome us in three months time. We must act fast.",
