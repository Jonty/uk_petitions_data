        "additional_details": "\r\n\r\nThe prime minister has already branded refugees escaping the horrors of civil war and traversing the Mediterranean as a \u2018swarm of migrants\u2019 but this new language from May is pushing the debate around immigration to dangerous new levels.\r\n\r\nThe language, which conflates refugees and other migrants, and the lack of understanding about immigration, risks pitching communities against each other while demonising people who contribute so much to our country.",
        "background": "It's Theresa May - not immigrants - who's really damaging Britain.           Theresa May\u2019s claim that Britain cannot have a cohesive society which includes a certain level of immigration is yet another depressing escalation in rhetoric from the Conservatives.\r\n\r\n ",
