        "action": "Implement more effective regulations for football agent (intermediary) activity.",
        "additional_details": "Between 2011 and 2013 the Commons Culture Media and Sport Committee investigated Football Governance and expressed concern on several matters (including agents). The chair stating \u201cIf football cannot reform itself, the Government should introduce legislation as soon as practically possible\". \r\nGiven the diminished regulations governing agent activity, Government should now act, working with the national football associations, leagues and other affected participants on more effective regulation.",
        "background": "In April 2015 FIFA implemented their long awaited plan of \u2018abandoning\u2019 the agents licensing system, replacing it with what many consider a \u2018dumbed down\u2019 model of regulating \u2018Intermediaries\u2019. The old system was by no means perfect but many agree the new system is inferior and damaging to the sport.",
