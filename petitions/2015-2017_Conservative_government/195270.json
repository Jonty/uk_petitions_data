        "additional_details": "Despite the fact that a dog is a \u2018natural accompaniment\u2019 to users of rights of way, the law doesn\u2019t require stiles to be \u2018dog friendly\u2019 as it\u2019s the dog\u2019s keeper who has the right of passage, not the dog. Stiles with \u2018dog latches\u2019 or 'dog gates' can however be provided and can occasionally be seen in popular dog-walking areas but only in certain parts of the UK.",
        "background": "Since dogs have been taken on highways since time immemorial, it\u2019s generally assumed that they can be considered a \u2018natural accompaniment\u2019 and that therefore dogs can be taken on public rights of way.",
