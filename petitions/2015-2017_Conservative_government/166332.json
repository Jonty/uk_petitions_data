        "additional_details": "The rules do not distinguish between judicial case management and judicial case manipulation. Judicial misconduct is now defined as little more than rudeness.  A judicial decision is now almost any personal decision made by a judge in  court. There is no constituted body which ensures everyone's basic right to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, or the right to an honest, accurate and unbiased record or that judges must be impartial and seen to be impartial.   ",
        "background": "\r\nThe rules which govern judicial misconduct exclude any decisions made by a judge in the course of proceedings. For example, the personal decisions of judges knowingly and purposively to falsify a claim or to make misleading records in court documents are all classified as \"judicial decisions\".\r\n",
