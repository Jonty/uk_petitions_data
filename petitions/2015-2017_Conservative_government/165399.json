        "additional_details": "Castleton is a beautiful Derbyshire villiage and a hugely popular centre for outdoor enthusiasts (in particular for caving, the castleton show-caves also representing an important tourist attraction).\r\nAccording to the proposed parking restrictions, much of the village will be double yellow lined and parking meters will have a maximum stay of 4 hours.\r\nThe deadline for written objections is 02 September 2016, thus we have very little time to act. Please sign this petition and tell us why you care!",
        "background": "Derbyshire County Council have proposed to restrict and charge for parking in Castleton.\r\nMuch of the village will be no-parking and parking meters will be short stay.\r\nThis will seriously affect businesses in a rural villiage which relies heavily on the trade of tourists and outdoor enthusiasts.",
