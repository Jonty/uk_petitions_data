        "additional_details": "It is grossly wrong to keep saying that the majority voted to leave the EU, when in fact it was just over one third of the British electorate.  The referendum is not legally binding, it is an opinion and the result should be debated and lessons learned. But it should not lead to the UK leaving the EU.",
        "background": "In the Brexit referendum, over 17 million voters were in favour of leaving the EU, 16 million were against, and 13 million did not vote. This effectively means that only 37% of the electorate were for leaving. There is therefore no majority of people wanting to leave. There is no mandate for Brexit.",
