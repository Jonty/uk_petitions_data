        "action": "Don't consider 2nd EU referendum. Invoke Article 50 for Leave proceedings soon",
        "additional_details": "Politicians and other members of the public should respect the will of the 17,410,742 people and allow us to leave now, and a second referendum should not be on the cards when a \"decision of a generation\" has been made. The EU leaders want us to begin proceedings soon, and therefore it would be a ridiculous breach of judgement to even consider another referendum, which would divide Britain further and cause more strain and uncertainty.  I am a young person and I believe this country must unite together: Remain, Leave and undecided voters of all backgrounds and beliefs for the future.",
        "background": "On Thursday, 23rd June, the people of the United Kingdom spoke their views in a tough and divided referendum. However, the British people chose to leave the European Union by 51.9%, and so this decision should be carried out without change. ",
