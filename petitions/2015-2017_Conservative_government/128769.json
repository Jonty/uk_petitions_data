        "additional_details": "At this age children are given very basic levels of numeracy and English that can easily and capably be provided people who do not have any GCSEs at all, or fall below the required minimum. Childcare and nursery work is about nurturing, caring and creativity. Providing a safe and enjoyable environment for children to learn about the world they live in and themselves. \r\n\r\nMany talented and passionate people will be lost from this field and the nations children will lose out as a result.",
        "background": "Plans have been announced to require minimum of grade C in GCSE maths and English for nursery workers. We feel this is an unnecessary requirement which will preclude talented and capable practitioners of entering the field and will not in anyway improve the provison of childcare in nurseries.",
