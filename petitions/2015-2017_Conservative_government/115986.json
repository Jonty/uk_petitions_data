        "additional_details": "It makes absolutely no sense to allow them is some bus lanes and ban them in others. For a motorcycle rider, reading every bus lane signage is additional seconds wasted and adds hugely to safety risk, unlike a car driver who is absolutely protected by cocoon of airbags. \r\n\r\nIf bicycles which are slow compared to vehicular traffic, can be allowed in Bus Lanes, motocycles and scooters MUST be allowed too. This will go a long way to improve safety of these riders and keep traffic flowing.",
        "background": "Motorcycles and Scooters are congestion-busting, most economical and eco-friendly way of getting around. For the SAFETY of riders and COMMON SENSE, the policy of allowing motocycles and scooters MUST be uniform across all bus lanes in the country. ",
