        "additional_details": "My daughter works in London and over the past 3 weeks has had to endure several train cancellations, bus alternatives and when she is travelling home at 1900 hours, this is not safe. She was refused entrance onto a train on 2nd July along with 3 other passengers as the doors were closed. She then had to wait for a later train and did not reach her desired destination and had to be collected, by car at 0300 hours from Southampton to be returned to Emsworth. Compensation is not the answer!",
        "background": "Southern Railway have announced on 5th July 2016 that they are cancelling 341 trains a day for the next 4 weeks. This has a massive effect on commuters from all over the South West travelling to and from London to work to support their families.",
