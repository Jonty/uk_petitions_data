        "additional_details": "Children should be allowed to grow and make up their own minds about religious/metaphysical issues without being brainwashed at an early age to believe any particular political or religious dogma. Countless children are essentially forced into believing silly, superstitious nonsense, which itself could lead to other issues based on the teachings of whatever religion they are indoctrinated into. Allow children to make up their own minds, protect their young minds from this infection and free them",
        "background": "Children, vulnerable as they are, must be protected from indoctrination and brainwashing into any authoritarian or dogmatic system, be it political or religious. There should be no religious schools or religion-based schools for the same reason there should be no conservative or marxist schools.",
