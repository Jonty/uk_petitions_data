        "additional_details": "It is vital that Brexit is revisited properly. This time with the benefit of hindsight that comes from the last winter in the NHS, hate crimes, slashed school funding, a depleted Police force, and spiralling costs of living. The pound is low, big industries are seeking to leave, children's prospects are blighted by loss of access to Europe to learn. People's families are being split down the middle. But both main parties support Brexit. Brexit MUST be voted on again, but out of party politics. ",
        "background": "Whichever party wins the general election on the 8th of June this year, they will have a mandate to continue Brexit. The previous referendum was conducted poorly, and dishonestly. Many people who were dissatisfied with the present government showed this by voting to leave Europe. We need a redo. ",
