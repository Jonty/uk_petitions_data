        "additional_details": "Trump has issued many executive orders already, one of which is in contravention of the Geneva Convention on refugees. In retaliation at the ban on nationals from seven Muslim countries, Iran and Iraq are already discussing banning US nationals. This could produce further instability in an the Middle East. It would be naive of the UK to exit the single market and rely on trade with a country that not only disregards international norms but could alienate our other trading partners. Wait a year.",
        "background": "The USA president has issued several executive orders some of which are in contravention of international norms. There could be repercussions internationally and until we know the long term outcome we should not trigger Brexit just now which would mean reliance on an unstable trading partner of USA.",
