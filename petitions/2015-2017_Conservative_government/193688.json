        "additional_details": "The CSA assessed but were unable to collects maintenance from my ex partner who evaded them for 14years, for which I have clear recorded evidence.  The Child Maintenance Service have advised there are previous child maintenance arrears from the CSA but are unable to collect these for various reasons including being unable to legally take arrears in isolation from any benefit payments. Priority should be given to the child not the absent parent and money owed should be paid upon assessment and the Government responsible for collecting outstanding amount.  I work two jobs however as a result fall just out with the threshold for working tax credits but do this in order to support my child. Absent parents should be made to be equally financially responsible.",
        "background": "Obtaining child maintenance is a difficult process if the separated parents are unable to agree an amicable means for this.  Currently the services in place to work out, collect and distribute child maintenance are ineffective and large amounts of child maintenance is going uncollected. ",
