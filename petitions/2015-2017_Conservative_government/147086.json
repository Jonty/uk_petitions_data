        "action": "We need a cross-party government of national unity to lead our great country.",
        "additional_details": "Westminster must now dispense with two party politics - there is no space or time to rely upon either the Conservatives or Labour to navigate this country to a place of safety. The purpose of this petition is to request that Parliament debates and concludes the terms upon which a government of national unity could be formed, comprising a cross party cabinet of the best and brightest centre ground politicians to meet the great challenges that lie ahead. Our people deserve great leadership - now.",
        "background": "Our country is confronted with its greatest challenge since WW2. The risk of a second great recession in a decade is upon us. The break up of the Union is likely. And the  complexity of the impending negotiation with the EU is far beyond our current government's capabilities.",
