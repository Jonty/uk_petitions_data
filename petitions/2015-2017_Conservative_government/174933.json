        "action": "Prevent the censorship of online adult material by the Digital Economy Bill",
        "additional_details": "The Digital Economy Bill has been put forward as a means to prevent children from accessing online adult material. In doing so, the Bill will block access to websites that host adult content, those which do not prescribe to the guidelines set out by the BBFC, to everybody. This Bill has the potential to censor large parts of the internet to the entire British population. We are slowly seeing our personal freedoms taken away; please sign this petition to try and prevent this fact from worsening.",
        "background": "The Digital Economy Bill sets out to censor areas of the internet which the British Government deem aimed at an adult audience, except not only for children, but for all. We must prevent this form of censorship, an illiberal ideal that has no place within a functional Western Democracy. ",
