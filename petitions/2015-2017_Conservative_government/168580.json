        "additional_details": "In 2015 PCS provided 2474 general counselling and assessment sessions. The Service is very cost effective; counsellors are volunteers, mostly qualified and accredited. PCS ensures counselling is accessible and affordable to all irrespective of race, gender, social or financial circumstances. Individuals suffering social isolation, at risk of exclusion with marginalised lives are able to access counselling and make real changes to their quality of life. ",
        "background": "After 23 years of providing the city of Portsmouth with an affordable counselling service, government funding has been withdrawn. Portsmouth Counselling Service will close in December, unless a miracle occurs. PCS needs a fraction of the \u00a3780,000 per day the government spends on anti-depressants.",
