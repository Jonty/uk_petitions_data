        "additional_details": "This petition originates from a planning application submitted to a local authority.\r\n\r\nObjection to the application was submitted and the planning authority admitted procedural error; however granted permission to the applicant. The decision was complained about on the basis of a procedural impropriety however the planning authority refused to quash their decision.\r\n\r\nAn escalation to the Local Government Ombudsman was declined on the basis of time, even though the complaints process was followed.",
        "background": "The Local Government Act 1974 currently requires the complaints process at local level to be fully exhausted before cases are brought to the Local Government Ombudsman. The Local Government Ombudsman will not investigate cases that are more than 12 months' old. These constraints can be incompatible.",
