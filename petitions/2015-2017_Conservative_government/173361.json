This included a large reduction in cases on sexism, racism and disability. \r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37868410  \r\n",
        "background": "Many people are discouraged from making a claim about discrimination in the work place, because of fees they may have to pay to bring a case to court. This is bad as it allows unscrupulous employers to discriminate with very little done about it. This is against human rights and democracy.",
