        "additional_details": "This government promised to protect tax credits and enable people to work rather than live a life on benefits. Broken. The EU referendum leave campaign encouraged many to vote to protect the NHS. Broken within hours. During the coalition the lib dems promised to protect students. Not just broken, shattered. The list goes on and on, how can anyone be expected to make an informed decision if the promises made to us are so meaningless?",

Any party that pledges to make a change for the better and does not follow through should not be allowed to continue to govern. Make these promises binding.",
