This interferes with some public on a daily basis. The efficiency of our services on a regular basis needs the reward in the times we live in now. We had a country vote on Brexit, I suggest we now agree a deal with the emergency services that they are happy with. Then put a vote to the country to agree to pay for this. We need them in these times more than ever. Let us show them what they mean to all of Great Britain.",
        "background": "Agree deal with all emergency services and then let the public vote if we want to pay that much to protect us. Today and many other times show we need them more now than ever. It's time for people to say that we are willing to reward them properly. ",
