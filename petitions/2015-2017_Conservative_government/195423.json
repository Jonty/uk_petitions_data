We all know that there has been an increase in asthma in children and that Oxford Street in London is heavily polluted but we're not doing anything positive to help.  I'll let the boffins come up with the stats.  But by signing this petition you'll be doing your bit, even if you have got one of those cars that turns itself off!",
        "background": "An idling car creates as much pollution a moving one. These pollutants have been linked to serious human illnesses including asthma, heart disease, chronic bronchitis, and cancer. More children are suffering from asthma than ever before. It is also the primary contributor to global warming.",
