The ASA should also be compelled to broaden their mandate to include political ads. This would prevent the misrepresentation of facts and allow people to make better political decisions. The recent EU referendum, and regret from some parties, is testament to the fact that, currently, people feel they are not getting all the information and are being misled, manipulated or simply lied to.

Political messages are exempted, and this is largely responsible for the misinformation of EU referendum. This should be changed.",
