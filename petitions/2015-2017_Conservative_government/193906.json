        "action": "Accept all forms of student/child identification on public transport nationwide",
        "additional_details": "Me and many other young people live close to the border between counties and often need to travel between these areas. When using public transport in counties other than our own we are denied of the local child fare and are forced to pay a full adult fare, which is very expensive, especially for a young person. It is ridiculous to deny a child of a reduced fare just because their bus pass is from the wrong county. All forms of bus passes should be accepted on public transport everywhere",
        "background": "Currently when buying a child fare on public transport you need to own a valid bus pass from the area you are travelling in. When young people travel on public transport in counties other than their own they are charged a full adult fare which can often be very expensive. This needs to be changed.",
