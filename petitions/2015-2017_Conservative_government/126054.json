        "additional_details": "Of the 7 UK GIC's, only 2 have waiting times below 1.5 years (http://uktrans.info/attachments/article/341/patientpopulation-apr15.pdf). The legal requirement is 18 weeks from referral. Once seen initially it can take months or even years to start treatment. There's often no contact from GIC's during this wait. This is unacceptable due to the effect on mental health and the suicide risk. Regular contact must be had to reassure people they are still in the system, and the wait MUST be reduced. ",
        "background": "The current wait time for Transgender people for appointments and treatment at Gender Identity Clinics is regularly over 18 months. This has a negative effect on mental health; around 48% of the Trans Population have attempted suicide . Sign this petition to support a reduction in waiting times.",
