        "action": "We the undersigned call upon HM Government to vote against the UK leaving the EU",
        "additional_details": "The referendum was advisory and non-binding. Brexit is unachievable without an enormous amount of pain and destruction. Scotland will break away, there will be upheaval in Ireland and Gibraltar, a crisis at Calais, recession and broken trade agreements. That's just the tip of the iceberg. It would be irresponsible of MPs to allow us to leave the EU with many Leave voters now wishing they had voted to Remain. 74% of MPs are in favour of Remain and now they should bravely stand up for our future.",
        "background": "The Leave campaigners have acknowledged that they made deliberately misleading promises on NHS spending and immigration that they now admit are unachievable. Taking into account that voters were misled the 51.9% in favour of leave is not a significant enough margin to determine the future of the UK",
