But it is not clear what you would like the Government or Parliament to do to address your concerns.\r\n\r\nIf you would like the Government to change the rules to make it easier for people with certain conditions or difficulties to receive benefits, you could start a petition asking the Government to do that.\r\n\r\nIf you would like the decision about your partner to be looked at again, Citizens Advice may be able to help you to challenge the decision:\r\nwww.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/benefits-introduction/problems-with-benefits-and-tax-credits/\r\n\r\nIf you would like to complain about the way you and your partner have been treated by the benefits office or an advisor, you can find more information about how to do that here: \r\nwww.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions/about/complaints-procedure"
