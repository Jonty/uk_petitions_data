        "action": "PM Cameron to withdrawal resignation - not leave a leadership vacuum.",
        "additional_details": "Many did not vote for the Conservative party, many did not vote to leave the EU, but a great many more are horrified by the prospect of the government being led by a eurosceptic or opportunistic Conservative politician in PM Cameron's place. The upcoming two years of negotiations will be vital to the UK's future - the UK must become more outward looking whilst not giving away reams of concessions for access to the EU. Leaving the EU would be best implemented by the current leadership.",
        "background": "PM Cameron is asked to withdrawal his resignation and not leave a leadership vacuum at such an important time to the advantage of a buffoon and/or eurosceptic. He should see out his term in office, to ensure balanced leadership and continuity during the process of extracting the UK from the EU.",
