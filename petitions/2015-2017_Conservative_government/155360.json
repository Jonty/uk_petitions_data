        "additional_details": "The 2016 EU referendum was an advisory and not a binding one.  The The UK political system is based on representative democracy, with sovereignty residing in Parliament. To make the decision to leave the UK a fully democratic one, Parliament therefore needs to take a decision on whether to repeal the 1972 Act.  In deciding the true national interest in this regard, MPs will be guided by the outcome of the referendum and other circumstances surrounding it.  Ideally the vote would be a free one.",
        "background": "The UK entered the EU under the 1972 Act, and therefore cannot lawfully  leave it without repealing the Act.  A vote in Parliament is therefore necessary before any notification to leave the EU is issued under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (the \"Lisbon Treaty\").",
