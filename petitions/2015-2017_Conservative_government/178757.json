        "additional_details": "Other plans such as the increase in prices for SFA to bring it into line with the private housing market are evidence of the mindless eradication of the few remaining factors that keep todays service men and women HAPPY to remain in the services. Pensions, pay, accommodation cost, catering contracts, SFA standards, the CarillionAmey contract for the MoD estate. ALL of these points need addressing in order to provide the level of retention the army needs to function.",
        "background": "Early terminations from the armed forces is at an all time high. The priorities of the chain of comand are certainly proportionally aimed at staff retention. However new legislation brought by the Army2020, such as, the planned scrapping of the commitment bonus scheme contradicts this completely.",
