        "additional_details": "Our education system is in turmoil. The decision to force schools to become academies and the recent changes in the SATs are just two highly contentious issues upsetting parents and teachers. Teachers are trained to teach the curriculum and encourage pupils to feel valued and achieve their potential. Teachers are qualified but the person in charge of our education system is not!  The Education Minister should have at least ten years classroom experience and understand the needs of children. ",
        "background": "All employers expect their employees to have the relevant qualifications, knowledge and skills in order to be proficient in their work. Teachers are highly trained experienced professionals and yet the Education Minister has no teaching qualifications and no experience in the education system! ",
