        "action": "Make the swegway/hoverboard no longer governed by the highways act of 1835.",
        "additional_details": "At the very least they should be legal in public parks as bikes, being much faster than a swegway, are allowed to be in parks but swegways are not. ",
        "background": "The highways act of 1835 was clearly not written with the swegway in mind. They are smaller than a baby's pram and a disability scooter and people are allowed to use them in public, so it is unjust for the swegway to be singled out and banned in public places. ",
