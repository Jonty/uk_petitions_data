As an example the UK Government Healthcare UK initiative works to directly promote the UK healthcare sector (including the NHS) abroad and to strengthen the sectors\u2019 capacity to operate and succeed internationally.\r\n\r\nTrade deals do not threaten Government policy-making regarding delivery of public services.\r\n\r\nTrade and investment agreements do not force Governments to privatise the delivery of any public services.  Similarly, such agreements do not prevent governments from introducing new legislation to safeguard public health or safety.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government is committed in particular to the principles of a NHS, free at the point of use, based on clinical need and not ability to pay.\r\n \r\nIt will always remain for the UK Government to decide how public services are run and, in particular, who is best placed to provide NHS services on the basis of patient need.\r\n\r\nDepartment for International Trade",
