        "action": "To withdraw the invitation to the President of the United States Donald J Trump",
        "additional_details": "We believe that his actions go against all the principles of fairness,  inclusiveness that we cherish in the UK.  The executive order is basically a \"Muslim ban\" and has been called such by Democrats, human rights organizations and advocacy groups. We believe Trump is instituting a policy that cuts against US values and America's image around the world as a sanctuary for those fleeing oppression.",
        "background": "In light of President Trump's Executive Orders banking religious groups from entering the USA,  including British Citizens and Refugees fleeing Persecution And War, we the undersigned would ask the Government to withdraw OR not invite the President to a State Visit to Great Britain.
