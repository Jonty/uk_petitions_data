        "additional_details": "This is the third increase in just 19 months.\r\n\r\nThis means for every \u00a31,000 in premium paid, the government takes \u00a3120 in IPT and this could make the difference between someone maintaining health insurance or returning to an overstretched NHS.\r\n\r\nStop penalising people for prioritising their health - make health insurance exempt from IPT.\r\n\r\nSign this petition to help healthcare insurance be part of the solution to the growing health crisis - visit http://amii.org.uk/ipt-petition for more details.",
