        "additional_details": "The people were lied to during the brexit referendum, the referendum result was not supported by the four nations of this supposed equal union.  No mandate was given by the people for a hard brexit  and therefore Mrs May has no idea what the wish of the people is and cannot claim to speak for or act on behalf of the people.",
        "background": "Theresa May has constantly refused to listen to the people and in particular the people of Scotland over the UK Brexit deal she wishes to obtain from the EU.  With this fact in mind and as a citizen of the UK i do not give Mrs May permission to speak for me or act on my behalf within these talks.",
