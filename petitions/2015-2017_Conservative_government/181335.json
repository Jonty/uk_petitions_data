        "action": "Vote of no confidence on Theresa May and Boris Johnson over brexit & Trump visit",
        "additional_details": "This is proven by the clear mandate in the form of a petition that was posted and now has over one million signatures against the visit. The government are also choosing to ignore the will of the citizens in Ireland and Scotland where there was a clear mandate that people wished to remain in the EU by not allowing them have a separate vote in Brexit. We the citizens therefore have no confidence in Theresa May or Boris Johnson and ask them to resign and call for an early general election.",
        "background": "It has become clear in our opinion that the government are choosing to ignore the will of the people and continue to go ahead and invite president Trump here in the UK on a state visit, When there is a clear opinion that we the majority of the citizens of the UK do not wish him to visit.
