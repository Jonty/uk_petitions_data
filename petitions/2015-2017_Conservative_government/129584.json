        "action": "Change electoral policy to allow a refused ballot, a 'none of the above' option.",
        "additional_details": "In some elections (notably provincial elections in Canada) it is possible to register that you refuse the ballot. Bringing in such an option here would allow people to formally state their dissatisfaction with all candidates. It would increase voter engagement and distinguish between apathy and despair.",
        "background": "Electoral turnout in UK elections is often disappointing, at times less than 25% turnout. Some of this is because people feel there is no one worth voting for. Currently there is no way for people to register their legitimate despair. This petition gives it voice.",
