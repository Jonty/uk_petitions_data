        "action": "Restrict the speed of cyclists on mixed pedestrian/cyclist paths to 4 mph.",
        "additional_details": "The figures for death and serious injury to pedestrians involved in accidents with cyclists is very low. But there is a perception of danger especially from inconsiderate riders.\r\nIf cyclists were restricted, to 4 mph as are class 2 mobility scooters, this would reduce the perceived threat from cyclists. This would create a compromise in mixing pedestrians with cyclists. This accepts the inevitable use by cyclists of the footpath and protects pedestrians as vulnerable road users. ",
        "background": "It is becoming very common for local authorities to improve provision for cyclists, at the expense of pedestrians, by making footpaths multi use. By the simple expedient of painting a bicycle on the footpath pedestrians lose the exclusive use of the footpath.\r\n",
