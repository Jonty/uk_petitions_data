        "additional_details": "I have depression and the options for me on a bad episode are go to A&E and hope im not sent to urgent care & wait to be seen, or try and find a charity open in the middle of the night which is hard. If a person is sectioned and there is no place for them to goto (hospital) they are housed in a police cell and get a record because of it. There are not enough services or help available for people with Mental Health issues both minor or major and this needs to change. We cant ignore it any more.",
        "background": "August 2016 a paranoid schizophrenic who was suffering a break stabbed 5 people in Russell Square. We need much more support and places for people with mental illnesses that can be dangerous if medication is stopped and help for minor mental health issues so they do not get worse.",
