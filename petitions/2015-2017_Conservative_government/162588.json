        "action": "Give England its own National Anthem",
        "additional_details": "A National Anthem is about identity, which is particularly important during major sporting fixtures, as well as any public fixtures and competitions between the countries of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nEngland is too often left behind, and it is surely time, that in common with her neighbours, she has a National Anthem which is her own.  I want to petition Parliament to consider my proposal, and I suggest 'Land of Hope and Glory' as something everyone can get behind.\r\n\r\nPlease consider supporting this.",
        "background": "Wales, Scotland, and Ireland have their own National Anthems.  In fact, all our neighbours do, but not us, not England.  \r\nDuring England's football match, the Welsh were able to sing their proud and stirring Welsh National Anthem, but they also sang ours, because it belongs to the UK, not England.",
