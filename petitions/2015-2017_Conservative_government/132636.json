        "additional_details": "The issue of land banking (which involves the purchasing of site/land/property with the sole purpose of holding onto it until its value increases) often results in sites being left to waste away for many years. Giving local authorities greater powers would put an end to this practice and in theory, ensure sites are either redeveloped or at least brought back into use more quickly. ",
        "background": "There are many towns and cities in the United Kingdom with derelict properties that are allowed to waste away unchallenged. The legal and financial implications surrounding compulsory purchase orders, which in theory should allow local authorities to stop this issue, is often an unviable option.",
