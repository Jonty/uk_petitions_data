        "additional_details": "Whatever the new immigration rules with the EU will be, we ask the government to keep the Leave campaign accountable to their promise to give Indefinite Leave to Remain or a special long-term visa to EU citizens settled in the United Kingdom before the 23 June vote, with no requirement for a minimum duration of stay.\r\nThis would ensure the EU citizens currently in the UK do not face deportation and reduce the uncertainty around their employment, residence, and rights to access public services.",
        "background": "The UK voted to leave the European Union on 23 June 2016. While we respect the democratic will of British people, 3 million EU citizens with livelihoods, mortgages, children etc. face uncertainty. We ask Parliament to guarantee EU citizens established before the vote won't face deportation.",
