        "additional_details": "As a 16 year old myself I feel strongly on the matter, a matter which I feel is over-looked when considering the vast amount of people that it affects and have an issue with it. After a brief conversation online, I decided to do something. We are at the age of preparing for university costs, driving lessons and car costs, the costs of living which are all in the near future. The government should support our plea for treatment on public transport as children until 18.",
        "background": "16/17 year olds are paid a child wage so why should we pay an adult fare for a bus or a train? Until 18, we are not treated as an adult by the law. Until we are 18, parents and doctors can legally consent medical treatment which over rules our say. It seems to be all that's cared about is the money.",
