        "additional_details": "It is shameful that every time we have something great we throw it in the bin or sell it for peanuts. The Harrier comes to mind. The worlds only viable V/STOL jet until the F-35B... It was also our last full British jet which needs to change. We should NOT opt for the Anglo-Franco joint EU UAV program but develop on Taranis to create a beacon of British aviation engineering marvel. It can then be exported, capitalised on. Show what we can do. France dropped out of Typhoon so we can do the same. ",
        "background": "I look at our industrial capability and it annoys me dearly to see our nations skills not utilised as they should be and instead squandered and thrown aside in favour of the purchase of American hardware or EU International projects. BAE Taranis UAV should develop into a sole, FULL British aircraft.",
