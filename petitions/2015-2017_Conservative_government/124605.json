        "additional_details": "The Royal Commonwealth Society\u2019s survey showed that most people are in support of removing barriers to live and work in the four countries, with support among New Zealanders as high as 82%. Some 75% of Canadians, 70% of Australians and 58% of Britons are also in favour. Support has skyrocketed among young adults aged between 18 and 35, with 90% of New Zealanders and 80% of Australians in favour. Great mobility will contribute to greater economic growth in the UK.",
        "background": "We share a language, a legal system and a Queen. The number of Commonwealth nationals working in the UK has fallen significantly due to a crackdown on migration from outside the EU. Let citizens of these 4 countries live and work freely. The UK should change its immigration policy to be more fair.",
