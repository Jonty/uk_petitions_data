        "additional_details": "A second referendum would make the UK a laughing stock and greatly exacerbate the economic fragility caused by the decision of the first referendum. We need to get on with it so the uncertainty and instability is supplanted by a secure social, political and financial footing as quickly as possible. If we vote again this will not happen and make things exponentially worse. If another referendum does happen and we vote to leave a second time, then what? Will democracy and the majority be accepted?",
        "background": "Democracy is based on the will of the majority. The majority of the UK decided to leave the EU via a democratic vote. All of us are incumbent upon the outcome of a majority vote whether we like it or not.\r\n\r\nWe don't call for a second general election just because the leader we support didn't win!!!",
