        "additional_details": "This vote has caused economic and political uncertainty within the UK impacting nearly every facet of our joint future, a large division also now exists between UK voters. The EU exit negotiation is possibly the most important action to undertake for a safe, prosperous future. We must build bridges with Europe and the world, heal internal wounds, and move forward together irregardless of political allegiances. The future is more important and we need the best deal possible going forward.",
        "background": "Nigel Farage (MEP and UKIP leader) should be explicitly excluded from all and any European Union exit negotiations on behalf of the UK. He has insulted his EU Council colleagues and his position at the negotiating table is untenable; he cannot possibly negotiate the best deal possible on our behalf.",
