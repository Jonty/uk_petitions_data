        "action": "Class mysogynistic verbal harassment or physical approach as a hate crime in UK",
        "additional_details": "Nottinghamshire police have started to record these instances of mysogynistic abuse as hate crimes, and this should be implimented nationwide. Whilst walking I was verbally harassed by a group of men in a car last night; the exact same thing happened to a friend. In this last week I have been yelled sexual comments at in the street by a man, and objectifyed so much on a busy train that I had to change carriage. Everyone has the right to live without being the target of sexual inappropriateness. ",
        "background": "Whether they are sexual or racial slurs, all verbal harassment and physical approaches are hate motivated. They are done to intimidate and cause upset/distress to the victim. Sexual harassment is still too often regarded as trivial and there is no current law that protects the public against it.",
