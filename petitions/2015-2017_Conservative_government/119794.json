        "action": "To include lgbt sex education as a compulsory part of national curriculum",
        "additional_details": "It's common knowledge that the porn industry is giving our countries youth an incredibly warped image of what sex should be like. This is even more of a problem for individuals that receive no sex education that's relevant to them in school at all. With attitudes towards sexuality rapidly changing, and more of us experimenting with our sexuality, the inclusion of lgbt sex education is paramount. Even more so with things such as HIV reaching record highs within the gay community in recent years.",
        "background": "Currently in the UK, schools are under no obligation to offer sex education for those who don't identify as heterosexual. Necessary changes need to be made to promote safe sex within communities that are at higher risk and destigmitise the topic within our schools.  ",
