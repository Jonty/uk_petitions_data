        "additional_details": "It is said that the mornings are too dark in Scotland.  On the current regime, it is broad daylight in Edinburgh at 8.00 am by the end of January.  As a Scot, I am sure that mid February would be a good moment to move to BST.  It is a long haul through to the end of March. \r\n \r\nLight at the end of the day is far more useful for healthy recreation and exercise, and environmentally, less energy would be used with lighter evenings, because more people are up and about in the afternoon.  ",
        "background": "Almost nobody looks forward to the clocks going back, at the end of October, and despite this, we persist with this oppressive schedule.  \r\nMy proposal is to adopt BST from Mid Feb to mid Nov. shortening the dark winter evenings.  I believe this would be very good for national morale.  ",
