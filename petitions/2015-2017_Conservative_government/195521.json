        "additional_details": "16 and 17 year olds are not represented by Westminster. They are often ignored, and policies which affect them (such as university fees) are often treated as less important. \r\n\r\nBrexit will definitely affect the futures of every 16 and 17 year old in the country, but not all older voters. It would be undemocratic not to allow younger people to vote on their future, allowing those who are not in the 'firing line' of any potential Brexit mishaps to decide how our lives will pan out.",
        "background": "As it's an election based on ensuring a successful Brexit, the policies the next government have will affect the negation process with both the EU, and other nations. It's therefore vital to lower the voting age as these people will be gravely affected by these changes.\r\n#VOTESat16",
