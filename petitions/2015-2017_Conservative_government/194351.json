        "action": "Allow the practice of assisted suicide and/or euthanasia in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "As mentioned before, I do believe people of ill-health and who have a short time to live already, do deserve the right to die. In dire circumstances, it should be available for UK citizens to have the choice or their families to have the choice for the ill individual to die with dignity, to end suffering for the person of ill health and their families too. I have done much internet research and have found many countries around the world and states in America which have allowed euthanasia.",
        "background": "I believe assisted suicide and euthanasia should be a human right for those who need and deserve the right to die. No human being deserves to suffer from an illness. It should be a choice of all critically unwell individuals if they wish to be euthanized or have the help to commit suicide.",
