        "action": "Stop any public sector employee from being paid more than the Prime Minister",
        "additional_details": "The petition calls for a change in the law to restore common sense and fairness to public sector pay grades. Local council chief executives and senior managers are being paid absurd sums for roles like \"Director of Community\" (\u00a3387,000 PER YEAR in Fareham), far more than their ultimate employer the Prime Minister (\u00a3143,000). These obscene salaries are paid for by taxpayers, through ever increasing council tax bills, while services are reduced, and this must be stopped. ",
        "background": "A report by the TaxPayers Alliance found that 2,314 council employees are paid over \u00a3100,000 a year and more than 500 are paid over \u00a3150,000 a year. The salary connected to a role should be based on the level of responsibility and accountability, of which there is none greater than the role of PM.",
