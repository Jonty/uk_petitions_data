        "additional_details": "Membership of the House of Lords is not democratically elected but attained by inheritance, by appointment or through positions within the Church of England . The majority of members are life peers who are appointed by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister. All decisions made by the House of Commons have to then pass through the House of Lords which can amend or reject them, all by people we did not elect and who have nothing in common with most of the voting people in this country.",
        "background": "After the recent referendum I have seen lots of post saying that people voted out of the EU to 'restore democracy' but we don't live in a true democracy .We live in a country which has officials elected by us (the house of commons) and unelected officials (the House of Lords).",
