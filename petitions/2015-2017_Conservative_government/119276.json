        "additional_details": "EG: Receipt of DLA or PIP Mobility is an appropriate \"short cut\" for decisions on the distance someone can walk as the benefit is itself a measure of walking distance\r\n\r\nReceipt of DLA/PIP Care/Daily Living is a inappropriate test of a person's need for concessionary bus travel for a companion to push a wheelchair or carry shopping, as the benefit tests only the help required with cooking, bathing, dressing and toileting, not pushing a wheelchair. It explicitly bans including help with shopping. ",
        "background": "Receipt of benefits is used as a test for providing other services. This is acceptable only if the tests have *substantial* overlap with the concession. The law should require independent criteria where there is not *substantial* overlap so concessions go to the appropriate people",
