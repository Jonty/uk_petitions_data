        "additional_details": "Since moving house and relocating the children to a new school two and a half months ago we have had to treat our 3 children and ourselves for head lice 7 times. We check their hair every evening as a precaution so why can't other parents do the same?! \r\n\r\nNot only is it costly each time, it is very time consuming and our child is absent from school through no fault of their own. \r\n\r\nEither reinstate the nit nurse and give schools the power to approach the individual parents or make treatment free. ",
        "background": "Not nearly enough is being done to rid our schools of head lice infestations. During my childhood we had 'Nit Nurses' that were present at the school and now nothing. The whole subject is taboo, the school aren't even allowed to contact the parents of an infested child. Something needs to change. ",
