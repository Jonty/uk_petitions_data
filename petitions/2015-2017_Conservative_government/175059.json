        "action": "Increase sentences for animal cruelty convictions",
        "additional_details": "Even the most horrific cases of animal neglect and abuse have resulted in non custodial sentences. Even those that have been imprisoned, it has been only for a matter of weeks. The current maximum sentence for animal cruelty is 51 weeks. A sentence very rarely given and not a proper deterrent since most offenders end up serving much less than half the term. The current maximum for theft is 7 years. We want animal cruelty sentencing in-line with other criminal offences.",
        "background": "As backed by many Councillors, MP's, National Newspapers, The RSPCA and many other Independent rescue organisations as well as huge support from members of the public, we ask you to increase the punishment for animal cruelty.",
