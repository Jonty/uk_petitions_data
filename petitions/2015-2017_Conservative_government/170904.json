        "additional_details": "Consider not only his behaviour but that of the crowds he whips up.  Racially motivated assault is common at his rallies, Trump supporters have \"lynched\" black dummies, and lately his rallies have featured chants of \"Jew.S.A\" and \"lugenpresse\" - a term which isn't used in modern German for its association with the Nazi party.  He's rallying the worst of the worst behind his banner and it is easy to suspect he would take us to war to maintain his following.  We can't afford to associate with him.",
        "background": "Donald Trump has surged ahead of Hillary Clinton in the latest polls and we are faced with the possibility of a Trump Presidency.  Trump might nuke a country if a poll told him it would be popular.  It is not in the best interests of the British People to be in bed with such a man as Donald Trump.",
