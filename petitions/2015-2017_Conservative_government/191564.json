        "additional_details": "Enemies of the United Kingdom are free to burn our flag and incite hatred against the crown, its authorities and the population of our union of countries, whilst fully aware that they are completely protected by our very own freedom of speech laws. This is unnaceptable, and should be a punishable offence. \r\nPeople such as Anjem Choudary should not have been able to spread such vile hatred for so long, whilst the crown prosecution were unable to do nothing to stop it.",
        "background": "I believe that sedition and seditious libel should be reinstated as criminal offences into UK law. \r\n\r\nSedition is defined as conduct or speech inciting people to rebel against the authority of a state or monarch.\r\n",
