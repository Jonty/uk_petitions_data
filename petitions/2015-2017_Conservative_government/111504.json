        "additional_details": "Factory farming exists to produce meat, eggs and dairy products as quickly and cheaply as possible. They live in huge, dirty, cramped sheds and deprived of everything that makes life worth living. They can hardly stretch their wings or legs and will never be able to roam and in a lot of cases end up in poor condition and often die. \r\nThese factories also spread diseases like E. Coli and salmonella and pose a threat to human health. \r\n\r\nFind out more at http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/AA/HOME/\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Factory farming is a form of rearing animals for meat and other products and is used in many places in the UK. It is inhumane and cruel and on top of this poses a huge threat to human health as it increases carbon emissions and diseases spread in these factories like wildfire. We must ban it NOW!",
