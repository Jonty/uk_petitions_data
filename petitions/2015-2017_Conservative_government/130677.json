        "additional_details": "I understand that many people do use BBC and are happy to pay for it. But I believe in choice, People have a right to reject a corporation's product and not be penalised by law for doing so. So, please make the BBC a subscription service like most other broadcaster's and let people who want to use it fund it, and let those who don't opt out of all BBC services.\r\n\r\nThe license fee is archaic and unjust, it has no place in the 21st century.",
        "background": "While the BBC is loved by many, the licence is hated by just as many. It is a tax which hits the poorest most. Forcing every household to pay a licence for their tv, pc, phone or tablet is unfair because many only use these for games, shows which they have already bought and do not use the BBC.\r\n",
