        "additional_details": "The leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, has said the reports are false because \u201cyou can\u2019t detain and harass someone who doesn\u2019t exist in the republic\". \r\n\r\nDenying that certain communities even exist is the first step a dictator takes toward destroying that community completely. \r\n\r\nThe fact that Theresa May has not spoken out about this is disgusting. If she supports LGBT rights she should be among the first to publicly condemn what is happening. ",
        "background": "Reports are circulating of gay men in Chechnya being sent to \"concentration camps\". In these camps they are subjected to humiliation, torture and treatment which has resulted in 3 men dying. \r\n\r\nAsk Theresa May to publicly condemn what is happening and show she cares about LGBT rights.
