        "action": "To make the A15 a dual carriageway road from the M18 to the A46 north of Lincoln",
        "additional_details": "This improvement to the A15 is needed to stimulate trade for the area and will see economical efficiency increase. The access from the Humber Bridge, Grimsby and Scunthorpe will be greatly improved and the journey to work times decreased. This will also impact on traffic coming off the A1 onto A46 at Newark. \r\nThe Department of Transport will confirm the high number of accidents on this stretch of road. It is also open to cyclists to use and is frequently used for time trials. This must cease.",
        "background": "An undulating road with plenty of accident blackspots. New Junctions required at  Caenby Corner, Hibaldstow, and a new junction at the A15, A46 Lincoln end. Levelling off the road to eliminate blind spots especially in the night. A major road which is used by all classes of transport.",
