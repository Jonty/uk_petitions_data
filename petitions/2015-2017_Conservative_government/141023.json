The longer term consequences are unknown but it is clear the a break up our United Kingdom is a significant risk, and the longer term impact on our economy is potentially devastating. Some of us voted Remain and some voted Leave but are now having second thoughts. Let us call on our Parliament to reject any proposed legislation to withdraw us from the EU. There is not a majority for \"Brexit\" in Parliament.",

Our historic tradition of Parliamentary Sovereignty means only Parliament can decide. Please oppose any attempt to invoke Article 50 to leave the EU.",
