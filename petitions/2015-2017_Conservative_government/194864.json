        "additional_details": " After visiting many fertility clinics we found that starting a family is very costly, with the cheapest option being Intrauterine insemination (IUI) with only a 15% success rate. On average this costing between \u00a32,000-\u00a33,500 for one single cycle. This times by six is an unreasonable amount to pay before even being considered for funded treatment. Many same sex couples like myself are missing a great opportunity to start a family.",
        "background": "Me and my partner (female same sex couple) desperately want to start a family together but were refused funding for fertility treatment unless we self fund six times and was unsucessful however, a heterosexual couple can receive funded fertility treatment without paying other fertility clinics.
