        "additional_details": "In the last three years, we have followed all the procedures and guidelines available to us.  We have complained to the GMC and The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman and we have attempted to take Addenbrookes to court with no success.  Today we were informed that because we have not followed the Addenbrookes complaint procedure to the letter the Ombudsman cannot proceed with their investigation and there is nothing they can do.  It is not right that the NHS Trusts are able to investigate and report on their own practice and when challenged by external organisations set up to protect the patient they are able to delay the process.  ",
        "background": "Our sixteen-year-old son Elliot died three years ago following an operation to correct a broken collar bone.  Addenbrookes spent 18 months investigating and reporting on their own practice.  The report was incomplete, inaccurate and a number of discrepancies were highlighted by the Coroner. ",
