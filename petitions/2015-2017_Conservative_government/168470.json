        "action": "Hold a regional vote whether to keep Southern Rail guards in their current roles",
        "additional_details": "Commuters who rely on Southern Rail to travel to their job and earn their livelihood have been offered no say in this change of public service and safety provision. This is not good enough. Public taxes built the railways, and our ticket purchases keep them running. Please sign this petition to demand a regional referendum in the affected counties as to whether commuters and their communities want guards to remain on Southern Rail trains and continue their current safety and services provision.",
        "background": "Not all modernisation is for the good of the people. Removing conductors/guards from Southern Rail trains will reduce essential security and onboard services to hundreds of thousands of commuters; younger, older, vulnerable, disabled, and even regular able-bodied commuters who require assistance.",
