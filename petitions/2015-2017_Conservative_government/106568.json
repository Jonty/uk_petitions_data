        "action": "Make the U.S. Federal Law 'Stolen Valor' a law in the United Kingdom.",
        "additional_details": "It is way too easy for non-military personnel to purchase a uniform along with awards and medals etc. therefore allowing them to pose as either serving personnel or veterans. I've personally seen many people wearing a British Military Uniform and being praised by the unsuspecting public, and receiving 'military discounts' in retail stores and I believe this is wrong. It should be illegal for somebody to fraudulently pose as Serving Personnel.",
        "background": "The government should make it a crime for a person to fraudulently claim having received any of a series of particular military decorations and awards with the intention of obtaining money, property, or tangible benefit from convincing someone that he/she did rightfully receive that award.",
