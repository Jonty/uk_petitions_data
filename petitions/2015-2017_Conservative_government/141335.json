If this demographic can be given that much responsibility, why can they not be given the ability to democratically affect the future that affects them more than anyone else.",
        "background": "75% of 18-24 year olds voted to Remain in the EU referendum held recently. This indicates the result was swung almost entirely by the older generations, who the decision affects much less significantly.",
