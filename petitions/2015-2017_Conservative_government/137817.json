        "additional_details": "It is of great concern if an unelected PM would have to steer the UK in the next phase of negotiations with the EU and the rest of the world markets. The numbers of \"Remain\" electorate and feedback from \"leave\" voters regretting the result, are such that a democratic exercise  is paramount in order to elect a new government reflecting and considering the pro-european general opinion. ",
        "background": "The EU referendum result has shown a clear divide in the country opinions over the future relationship between UK and EU. Following Cameron's resignation, we call for a general election to democratically decide who will have to negotiate the UK future relationship with the  EU and other markets.",
