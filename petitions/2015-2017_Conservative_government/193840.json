        "additional_details": "We as parents believe that health visitors or hospitals should teach every parent basic first aid. We are aware there are baby grows you can purchase that tell you what to do in a choking episode. But, in the heat of the panic how many people out there who have one of these have the time to read instructions on what to do? Does every parent know basic first aid? The team of professionals that look after you after being discharged never bring up this issue. This simple practice can help save a child's life. Luckily a few years back I'd attended a basic first aid course but strongly feel it should be mandatory that every parent whether experienced in children or not should be taught this simple procedure.",
