That they are, rubs in the face of millions of decent people. \r\n\r\nThe next class of English footballers should donate all but a modest remainder of their salaries to social causes, including the remuneration of their perennially let-down supporters, proving their commitment to their sport and to their country.  ",
        "background": "A group of players collectively earning millions committed a total embarrassment on the nation. These are our footballers. Meanwhile our rugby players, earning barely a fraction of this, covered themselves in glory and made their country proud, in considerably more difficult circumstances.  ",
