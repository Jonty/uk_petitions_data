        "additional_details": "Mr Nigel Farage has failed three times to win a seat in the House of Commons and, as such, does not represent the British public. Furthermore his service as a MEP lacks any distinction whatsoever.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned are not only Remain voters. Many are Leave voters who voted in spite of Mr Farage not because of him. We wish to present a united front to make it clear that we oppose Mr Farage having any role in a future Government until such time as he is democratically elected as an MP.\r\n",
        "background": "Throughout recent history politicians have, on occasion, been appointed to the Cabinet despite not being elected members of the House of Commons. Lord Mandelson is one example. We the undersigned believe it would be inappropriate for Nigel Farage to be given such a role.\r\n",
