        "additional_details": "I was told before Christmas we would have Ivf on the nhs as we are both in the age bracket, we both don't smoke and my husband and I don't have any children. However after Christmas this has changed I feel like we have had a door slammed in our face awaiting for our referrel appointment! How can the nhs go from 5 cycles to 3-2-1-0! This has left us devastated we work so hard but yet our tax money go to jobless teenage mothers who didn't mean to get pregnant and we can't afford to get pregnant!",
        "background": "South Norfolk has now stopped funding for any cycles for Ivf! I've been going to the doctors for the past year, my husband and I have had various tests and we finally got our hopes up as our gp said we can be referred for further help. Bad news on 1st Jan they have stopped funding for this!",
