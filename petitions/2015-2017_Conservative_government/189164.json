        "additional_details": "To deny someone of their basic rights of freedom and life is morally wrong. To take away a life for reasons of greed and pleasure, for reasons of gain/profit is morally wrong. We have a moral obligation to teach children that killing all forms of sentient animals is wrong. Children need to have the choices of not wanting to eat,wear,or exploit those who rely on us for protection and defence. Children need to be taught all about the profit making industries who exploit and kill non human animals.",
        "background": "All children need to be educated about sentient beings and how non human animals are capable of having the same senses as us. Every one feels pain,including all non human animals. Everyone feels love,pleasure,joy,loss,fear frustration and depression,including non human animals.",
