        "additional_details": "All blood samples used for donation are subject to rigorous testing to ensure that various illnesses, including HIV/AIDS cannot be transferred to a recipient of blood.\r\n\r\nThis also draws away from the fact that a promiscuous heterosexual male who has multiple partners is in fact a higher risk of infection than a monogamous homosexual male.\r\nEvery minute in Scotland, someone is receiving blood yet only 5% of the population donate. Lifting such a ban could change that percentage dramatically \r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "In the UK, many people in the LGBT community are not able to donate blood. Presently, sexually active gay and bisexual men are banned from donating blood unless they do not engage in these acts for 12 months, prior to donating.\r\n",
