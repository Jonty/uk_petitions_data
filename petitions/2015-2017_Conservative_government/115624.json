        "additional_details": "ISIS/ISIL or whatever it is called now, shouldn't be called this, they are neither Islamic, nor a state, so why are media outlets calling them this.\r\nCalling them Daesh is perfectly adequate. Media outlets are supposed to consist of journalists, and those alike who look into sources. If they actually looked into the Quran, they would know it doesn't preach terrorism, giving a reason to denounce Daesh yet they continue calling this group Islamic. This fuels hate & division! #WordsMeanEverything\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Media outlets should not be claiming that ISIS is Islamic, or anything a-like. Daesh are a terrorist group with no religion, they are simply a death cult. Media outlets are feeding Islamophobia by simply calling them the \"Islamic State Of Iraq/Syria\", they are not Islamic so why call them Islamic. ",
