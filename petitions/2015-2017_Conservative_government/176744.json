        "action": "Require the final Brexit deal with the EU to be approved by the UK Parliament",
        "additional_details": "The Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 details requirements around International Treaties being put before Parliament, prior to ratification.  The Government has yet to confirm its intention in this regard in respect of the final Brexit deal with the EU. (This is despite repeated requests for clarification by the Select Committee for Exiting the EU).\r\n\r\nThe UK Parliament is sovereign and its endorsement of the final Brexit deal should be required before ratification and implementation.",
        "background": "The formal process of negotiating the exit of the UK from the EU includes 'consent' by MEPs in the European Parliament to the final deal. MPs in the UK Parliament should be afforded the same right as well.\r\nIf the UK Parliament fails to consent to the final Brexit deal, the UK should stay in the EU.",
