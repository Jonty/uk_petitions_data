        "additional_details": "The overall cost for this procession should be reduced as it is a fundamental tradition within Sikhism that all can partake in, it also helps educate people about Nagar Kirtan and Sikhism. It also allows for the concept of equality to be put in action as all are welcome to the festival and all can carry out acts of servive. We should be able to continue our religious traditions by reducing the total cost of \u00a360,000 to at least being under  \u00a330,000 as this is more realistic and practical. ",
        "background": "Nagar Kirtan is a Sikh street festival that happens in May every year, which celebrates the birth of the Khalsa, however this year the festival is unable to be carried due to the street hire costs of  \u00a360,000 for only 3 hours. Therefore, the cost should be reduced to atleast \u00a330,000. ",
