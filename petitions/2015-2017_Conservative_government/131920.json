        "additional_details": "The statistics that those aged 18-21 can be paid 26% less for the same work as over 25s and those aged 21-24 nearly 7% less are worked out by calculating the percentage difference between the NLW and current NMW pay levels. Current NMW levels: 18-21(\u00a35.30ph) and 21-24 (\u00a36.70ph)\r\n\r\nLink to the poll by Survation: http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/09/26/poll-under-25s-should-be-given-national-living-wage_n_8194992.html",
        "background": "The National Living Wage only applies to workers aged 25+, meaning those aged 18-21 can be paid 26% less for the same work and those aged 21-24 nearly 7% less.\r\n\r\nIt also goes against the UK electorate. A Survation poll in September 2015 shows 66% of voters believe the NLW should apply to under-25s.",
