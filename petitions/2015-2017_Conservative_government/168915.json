As the driver could have been drunk, or speeding. Maybe the police, oh wait not them because it's only a Cat. Then the person at fault should be punished like a crime from a human to a human, so long as it could have been prevented. Also to allow for accidents caused by stopping for animals to be a little flexible. ",
