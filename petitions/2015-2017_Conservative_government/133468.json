It's hard enough as it is to count carbs as you go, however is made more difficult by not knowing exactly how much is in the food. The Internet can be misleading and conflict information so I feel this is so so important especially for health reasons. Eating out should be made more of a relaxing/enjoyable experience. ",

It's extremely important to get this right.",
