        "action": "Extend sentencing powers to allow the use of lifetime bans from driving.",
        "additional_details": "The kinds of cases I am thinking about include repeated use of mobile phones and repeated cases of drink- or drug-driving resulting in injury/death, or killing/injuring someone while driving at more than 20 per cent over a speed limit. \r\n\r\nWhile a long jail sentence is not always good for society, a short sentence and lifetime ban would emphasise the seriousness of an offence and give victims/relatives a stronger impression that justice had been done. Jail would be an option for breaches of a ban.",
        "background": "Many motorists obey the law till they get behind a steering wheel. They don't ever think of going to jail but would relate more to the possibility of being banned from driving for life. Such bans would be at the judge's discretion and only used for repeated bad driving or the most heinous incidents.",
