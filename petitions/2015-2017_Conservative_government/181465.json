        "action": "Give Au Pairs employment rights in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "The laws for Au Pairs & Host Families need addressing as they are non-existent. AP's can work in excess of 60 hours per week, being paid anything from \u00a335 per week, with no paid holiday or right to minimum wage. The Gov states AP's ''are unlikely to be classed as a worker or an employee.'' But why? A Nanny or cleaner are entitled to employment rights so why not AP's? It will protect both host families and AP's to have employment law to fall back on should either side need it down the line. ",
        "background": "Au pairs come to the UK to learn English and experience a new culture living in with a family. In return for ones accommodation, one will help in the home and with the children for a small 'pocket money' token. In reality, this is a job and should have employment rights like all other employment. ",
