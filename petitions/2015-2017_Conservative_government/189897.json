        "action": "Change the Examination System for Mathematics in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Why don't we have one exam containing addition, multiplication, subtraction and division for the less able students allowing them to at least leave school with a qualification and a more in depth exam for those wishing to study mathematics or wish careers where complicated maths is needed. Even my sons maths tutor could not finish the higher GCSE exam and he has a degree in maths. Why doesn't the government take notice of what is happening -  The Exam system is broken.",
        "background": "My daughter had five attempts at passing her GCSE Mathematics and I see from TV reports that many children are struggling to pass leaving us with a generation of children who may never pass due to the rigours of the examination containing techniques that none of us ever use again.",
