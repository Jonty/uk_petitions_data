        "action": "Uphold democracy & allow the British people to vote on the final BREXIT deal",
        "additional_details": "Over 4 million people have so far signed a petition calling for a 2nd referendum. But it is based on retrospective legislation which cannot work. And it ignores the current will of the people, which is to back BREXIT. The will of the people must be upheld, BREXIT negotiations must take place. But it is only right that once the form of BREXIT is clear (as well as its consequences) the people decide. We call for a committee of civil servants & independent experts to provide non-partisan analysis.",
        "background": "The British people must make an informed democratic decision over the final BREXIT deal. It is now clear that a possible consequence of BREXIT is the break up of the UK. Therefore the British people must vote on the package once they are informed both of its contents, &  likely consequences.",
