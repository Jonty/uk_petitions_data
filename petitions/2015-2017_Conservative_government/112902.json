It's a strategy that seems to work surprisingly well for these countries. Police officers there have saved lives -- exactly because they were unable to shoot.\r\nIn Iceland, one third of all citizens are armed -- but police officers are not.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The U.K. Is one of only five countries where the Police are not armed, after the recent attacks so close to the uk borders it is about time that the police forces across the country are armed or have access to firearms.",
