        "additional_details": "The EU referendum is a prime example of this deception. A large proportion of statements made on the lead up to the referendum were untrue or exaggerated. This goes for both sides of the argument. How can anyone make an informed decision based on this information. People will only find out the truth when time reveals it to them, this is usually too late as in the case of the referendum. The same is true of election. ",
        "background": "It seems that many politicians find it acceptable and par for the course to say anything, true or false to get their way. We all know this happens on a daily basis but hardly anyone is held to account for what the claim even when what they are saying is proven to be wrong.",
