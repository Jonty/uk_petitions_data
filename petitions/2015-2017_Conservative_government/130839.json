        "additional_details": "The Chinese government says Yulin does not exist, or that it is on the decline, but the horrific pictures and press reports from 2014 and 2015 say otherwise (#stopyulin). It is time the UK government put pressure on the Chinese government to intervene and stop this barbaric event. It's not enough to sit back and disapprove, or pretend it's not happening. \r\n\r\nPlease add your signature to this petition asking the UK Parliament to take urgent action to stop the Yulin Dog Meat festival going ahead.",
        "background": "Thousands of dogs are tortured to death during the Yulin Dog Meat festival. They are skinned alive, beaten to death, burned with blow torches and dismembered while they are still alive. Many dogs are stolen family pets - still with their collars on. Yulin began in 2009, it is not 'tradition.' ",
