        "action": "Disapprove plans to frack in North Yorkshire",
        "additional_details": "Campaigners have reacted with fury and dismay after North Yorkshire county councillors approved plans to carry out hydraulic fracturing at Kirby Misperton, near Malton. The eleven-member Planning Committee voted 7 votes to 4 to grant planning permission to Third Energy to frack just \u00bd mile from the picturesque North Yorkshire village. Over 1,000 people attended an anti-fracking rally outside the meeting at County Hall on Friday 20th at Northallerton, but to no avail.",
        "background": "Plans to frack just half a mile from the picturesque North Yorkshire village have been approved by North Yorkshire County Council, despite 4000-strong opposition. This isn't ruling on popular opinion; instead this is elitism and these plans have to be disapproved, for the safety of the local people.",
