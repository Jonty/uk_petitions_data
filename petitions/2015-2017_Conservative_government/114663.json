        "additional_details": "This may be the solution to compliment sugar tax, if it were to be introduced. Water and soft drinks aren't far off in terms of price. I noticed in shops that alternatives had approximately a 20p gap in price which makes water less appealing. If the sugar tax was to be introduced as well as a cap on Water prices there would be a big gap in price, for example 50p for a litre of water or a fizzy drink for \u00a31.50 the water would be more appealing. This could be the solution to obesity.",
        "background": "Water is an essential to life, everyone should access wherever paying as little as possible. Thames water calculates that their water on average is 0.097p each litre and that bottled water on average is 500% more expensive than tap water. This is the equivalent of paying \u00a31,500 for a glass of wine.",
