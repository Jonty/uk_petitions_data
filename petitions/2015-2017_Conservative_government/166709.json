They are now all covering up and withholding records, the child\u2019s education has been put in jeopardy and false information generated on the child\u2019s and family\u2019s records by all parties\u2019 involved. The system does not protect innocent children/families",

The expression \"vote of no confidence\" is used when talking about a vote in the House of Commons which tests whether or not the Government of the day has the confidence of a majority of MPs in the House of Commons. The concept of the House having \u201cconfidence\u201d in someone does not apply to Police and Crime Commissioners. \r\n\r\nAt least one local council has held a vote of no confidence in their local Police and Crime Commissioner. You could raise your issue with a local councillor, who represents you.
