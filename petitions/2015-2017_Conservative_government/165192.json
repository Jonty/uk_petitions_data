        "additional_details": "You need to stop waste where it\u2019s created to reduce waste.\r\n\r\nIf all packaging is recyclable, it\u2019s easier to recycle, increases recycling rates, improves the quality of the recycling, improves our environment, and reduces landfill tax Local Authorities pay.\r\n\r\nZero packaging waste sent to landfill offers cost saving benefits, and the use of resulting recycled materials are cheaper and more resource efficient than using expensive virgin sources.\r\n\r\nThere are already solutions for non-recyclable packaging.\r\n\r\nIt encourages the move to a circular economy.",
        "background": "14 million tonnes of rubbish went to landfill in 2014 and space in our landfills is rapidly declining. If products were packaged in materials that are recyclable or biodegradable then no packaging waste needs to end up in landfill and there would be less confusion on what can be recycled.",
