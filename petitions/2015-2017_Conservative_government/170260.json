        "additional_details": "The numbers say that foreigners positively contribute to the UK revenue. The last Governments have pursued austerity policies, and have not invested this additional income to fund health, education, and housing systems. Instead, foreigners have been blamed to put pressure on these systems. The Government is not accountable to foreigners because they have no right to vote. This is against the spirit of John Hampden, English great patriot, who first claimed \"no taxation without representation\".",
        "background": "There are millions of people living, working, and paying taxes in the UK, but with no right to participate to national politics with their vote. All taxpayers should be given political representation, to make the Government fully accountable for its decisions on how to spend tax revenues.",
