        "additional_details": "I believe it has now become unfair that the rest of the UK is continually being asked to fit the bill in Scotland. \r\nIt must be remembered that Scotland has free University education, free nursing home care for the elderly.\r\nI do accept these are it would be good for all the UK to have these however, others accept these are affordable because of the subsidies Scotland receives. The latest request for half a billion pounds is the latest demand.    ",
        "background": "For the past 300 years England has been held responsible for all the failures that has beset Scotland. A referendum was held and the people of Scotland decided to remain in the UK. I believe the concessions given to the people was unreasonable and very expensive for the rest of the UK.    ",
