        "additional_details": "Netting often traps birds and therefore they should be easily ACCESSIBLE for rescue. Trapped birds are protected under the 2006 Animal Welfare Act and should be released or handed to wildlife rescuers. Further, ALL wild birds, together with their nests, are protected under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act. It is the responsibility of the owner of the property to ensure compliance with the law. \r\nThere are alternative deterrents which are more humane and effective.",
        "background": "Wild birds often get trapped in or behind netting put on buildings and under bridges as a deterrent and they suffer long, painful deaths from starvation or strangulation.\r\nMake all netting which is faulty or not fit for purpose ILLEGAL.\r\nIf netting cannot be maintained it should be REMOVED.",
