        "additional_details": "The government should be spending more than 2% of our money on the armed forces which isn't enough. A football player makes millions in a year with no disrespect to them the armed forces are more important to this country so they should have their salary's raised to a much higher amount. and spend less on TV entertainment, not all football players believe themselves to be higher up than everyone else,id like them to experience what  soldiers can go through on a daily basis.and see what they see.",
        "background": "Our Armed forces are willing to risk their lives for the protection of our country and its interests. On a daily basis in some countries, they will have to protect our country to the last man not enough respect is given. without these men and women the United Kingdom wouldn't be the United Kingdom.",
