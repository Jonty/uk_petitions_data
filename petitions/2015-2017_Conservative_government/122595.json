        "additional_details": "Wales have reduced incidents of bovine TB by 48% without killing a single badger.\r\n\r\nThe Randomised badger culling trials undertaken by the last government killed 11,000 badgers and proved that culling badgers will not reduce the disease\r\n\r\n95% of the disease is spread by cattle ",
        "background": "Bovine TB is a devastating disease for farmers and cattle. However, the badger cull is proven to be unscientific Inhumane and ineffective.At a cost of \u00a320 million pounds so far a roll out across the country can not be justified.Move away from culling and focus on cattle based measures.",
