        "additional_details": "Any discussions previously held about the future funding of nurse training were, no doubt, pre-Brexit.  An Act of Parliament that serves to ensure the recruitment of talented people into nursing must be considered an essential and positive step.  The reliance on young people (and others) to borrow in order to fund their nursing care training renders this much-needed recruitment uncertain, and therefore at risk from external forces.  The State as priniciple employer must ensure adequate funding.",
        "background": "There is a recognised shortage of nurses in this country.  There exists the possibility that Brexit will have a further impact.  Nurses are essential to the health of our nation.  It must be an imperative of government to implement a future-proof plan to ensure the ready supply of qualified nurses.",
