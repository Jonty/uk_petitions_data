        "additional_details": "Sixteen year old people are in fact very mature, and this law would benefit there lives, giving them the ability to access more resources, benefiting the economy. Plus, since the law states that 16 year old youths cannot drink alcohol, fewer drunk drivers will be on the road. The government will benefit from the road tax paid, and as the amount of electric cars are on the increase, pollution will not rise visibly.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "We are calling to the government to change the legal age of driving from 18 to 16.\r\n\r\n16 year olds are becoming mature and need transport other than unreliable public transports to get to schools and jobs",
