To tear this dog away from the person she has bonded with and trusts is tantamount to cruelety. What a way to thank a police officer for his loyalty to the Queen and his country!",

To thank him for this, the police have taken away his Police dog to be given to a new handler. \r\nThis is not only an abhorrent act to the handler, but cruel to the dog, tearing it away from it's family.",
