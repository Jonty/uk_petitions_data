        "action": "Review the exempted conditions and ages for NHS prescription charges",
        "additional_details": "1. Some of the biggest killers are not currently covered by exemptions such as heart disease. This can mean that people may miss medication to keep them well.\r\n2. The current system encourages those exempt to visit a Dr to obtain prescriptions for minor illnesses when medication is available over the counter. This costs the NHS time and money.\r\n3. As retirement ages increase and people are working longer it is logical that other benefits should remain aligned to the same age.",
        "background": "The list of exempt conditions and age limits have not been reviewed and inequalities now exist.\r\n1. Some life-long life-threatening conditions make sufferers eligible for free prescriptions even when not related to their condition, others receive no support.\r\n2. The age limit of 60 is out of date.",
