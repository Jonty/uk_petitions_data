        "additional_details": "According to some experts the estimated cost of HS2 has risen dramatically and could now be as high as \u00a390bn. Why not invest in the NHS and build new efficient world class hospitals. At the same time the government should invest more in recruitment and training of doctors and nurses so that they do not have to work all hours of the day. I have been advised that it takes 7 years to build a new hospital from inception to completion. We need our government to address the shortcomings of the NHS NOW",
        "background": "The Department for Transport says the HS2 project will cut Birmingham-London journey times from 1hr 21min to 49min. Big deal - how about cutting patient waiting times in A&E departments by 32 minutes! Austerity measures should include cancelling non-essential investment - Get the NHS back on track! ",
