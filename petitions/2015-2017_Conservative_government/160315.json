        "additional_details": "Involuntary cancellation of citizenship on this scale seems never have happened before, anywhere in the world, except by defeat or tyanny. \r\n\r\nOver 40 years, UK and EU citizenship have come to complement each other: together they now define our sense of belonging. \r\n\r\nAbsent a new referendum, only Parliament or Government can work with the EU to protect this birthright. Without an attempt to protect this interest of the Remainers, I suggest that divisions and resentment in our society will worsen.",
        "background": "The 38% of the electorate who voted for Brexit may soon inadvertently deprive up to 16 million of us of our EU citizenship. Many of us profoundly value or even depend on what was a birthright until June 23. Citizenship of the EU does not lessen our pride in being British; rather, it enhances it.",
