        "additional_details": "I know some of you will disagree with my view as the government offer a loan which pays the fees however as a Muslim i cannot take this loan as it is considered haram (forbidden) and therefore i will not be able to go to university because i will not be able to afford the \u00a39000 a year. I am not the only person in this situation there are also many other students who will not be able to go to university for this reason only and i want this to change so everyone gets a chance to go to university.",
        "background": "I want the government to reduce university fees to \u00a32000 a year. The reason i want this change is because many people are not able to go to university because of the cost of tuition fees. These fees need to be reduced so that more people can go to university and pursue the career of their choice.",
