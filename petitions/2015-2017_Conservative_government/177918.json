        "additional_details": "This is because successive governments have been changing the proportion of the rail bill paid for by passengers. It used to be around 50%. Today it's around 70%. The original idea behind the government regulating around half of our rail fares was to protect passengers from big price rises imposed by train operators. Yet it's often been government ministers who have used the mechanism to put fares up. Source - BBC NEWS http://bbc.in/2hEqcgt",
        "background": "Train passengers are constantly facing issues with trains being delayed, trains being cancelled and overcrowding on carriages. We are hardly seeing any improvements but are still being forced to pay more. Even with inflation, rail fares have gone up by around 25% since the mid-1990s.",

The price of train tickets is the responsibility of train operating companies.\r\n\r\nWhile the UK Government and Parliament do not directly set the price of train tickets, the Government can set the rate by which train operating companies can raise some ticket prices. These are called regulated fares. You could start a new petition calling on the Government to set the rate at which regulated fares can rise at zero, or a petition asking for other changes to the way in which train fares are set."
