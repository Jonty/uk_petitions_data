        "additional_details": "This petition calls on the UK Government to grant a second referendum on the UK's EU Exit as given the small margin win for the Leave campaign, and the following public outcry at people wishing to change their votes, it is becoming increasingly clear that public opinion may well have shifted significantly in a short space of time and therefore the initial vote no longer represents majority public opinion. ",
        "background": "Following the EU Exit referendum there has been a huge outcry of voters who wish to change their vote based on early broken campaign promises, regret for votes, impact following the vote (e.g decline of the sterling) and a lack of real understanding at the time of voting. ",
