        "additional_details": "Research by Feline welfare charity Cats Protection found more cats are killed in air gun attacks than 20 years ago -  In 2016 46 per cent of air gun wounds proved fatal for cats compared to 11 per cent in 1996.The findings are particularly concerning, given a leading criminologist has warned that some people who shoot cats could go on to commit similar crimes against humans. We are calling for stricter regulation on the ownership of air guns, as we strongly believe this will help to protect cats and other members of our communities from attacks.",
        "background": "The Air Weapons and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2015 comes fully into effect on 31 December 2016.  The new law will require any person who possesses, purchases, uses or acquires an air weapon to have a certificate to hold them legally. We ask that the same be introduced in England and Wales. \r\n\r\n",
