        "additional_details": "In 2014 the Cardiac Arrest consensus in the UK showed that attempted resuscitation's(out of hospital)were approximately 28,000-only 8.6% (2,408) of this number survived. Research suggests if more people were trained in CPR 50% of deaths caused by cardiac arrest could be prevented. The earlier CPR is administered the greater chance a person has of survival - they do not always have the time to wait for first response teams. We desperately need life saving skills taught as standard in our schools.",
        "background": "My husband suffered a cardiac arrest and without my CPR training would not have survived. He is only here today as I had completed a CPR training course. Only 8-10% of out of hospital cardiac arrest cases survive in the UK as opposed to 25% in Norway where mandatory CPR training is given in schools ",
