        "additional_details": "Since the referendum result, there has been a sharp rise in racial abuse. After Nigel Farage\u2019s European Parliament, I had a flashback to the 1985 Hysel Stadium disaster when rampaging English football \u2018fans\u2019 killed Italian fans. The English sense of shame lasts to this day, reinforced now by this.\r\nI believe the unquantified will of the British people is expressed, not in the referendum result but in this quote by the late Jo Cox MP: \u2018Far more unites us than divides us.\u2019 \r\n \r\n",
