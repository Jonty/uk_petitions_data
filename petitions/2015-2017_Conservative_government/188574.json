I am outraged that the government find it acceptable to pay less despite how hard working we are. I work equally as hard as all the other employees at my work place, yet I am underpaid for the work I do. This is unfair and I wish to put a stop to it!",

I am 16, I work part time as a housekeeper while I am on a study programme in Engineering. This includes cleaning toilets and bedrooms for \u00a34 an hour. Being the youngest, I get paid \u00a33.20 less than others.",
