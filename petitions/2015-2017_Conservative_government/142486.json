        "additional_details": "Therefore, the people who sign this petition would like a law to be passed where the same duty of care applies to politicians as apply to other professions or general advertisers.  Should a politician knowingly make a false statement or, with reasonable diligence, should have known such statement was false then there should be a criminal sanction to prosecute and that the Electoral Commission be responsible for such prosecutions.  Politicians, their staff and their parties should all be liable.",
        "background": "We have just witnessed a truly shocking campaign by both Remain and Leave during the EU Referendum.  The British people deserve a greater duty of care from politicians that statements or facts represented are true.  To ensure this, it should be a criminal offence to knowingly mislead the electorate.",
