        "additional_details": "The referendum was held as a one off action, so it would be more legitimate to negate its harmful consequences by Parliamentary means with a General Election. If MPs were elected specifically saying that they would not go ahead with the procedure to leave because their constituents wanted them to remain, there could be no argument here or within the EU administration. If a majority of MPs were still elected on a Brexit platform then there could be no further argument that way either.",
        "background": "The recent referendum result will blight the lives of the young who mostly voted Remain. In the long term it threatens the security of all Europe.\r\nA new Parliament with majority of MPs on a Remain platform could legitimately override the referendum result as they express the will of the people.",
