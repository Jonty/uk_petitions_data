Mortgage offers only last 6 months and often these cannot be renewed, causing the chain to collapse.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe law needs to be re-looked at to prevent the possibility for people pulling out at any time or to at least make it possible for the affected party to claim back their financial loss from the person who caused it.\u00a0",
        "background": "Buyers and sellers can pull out of the property buying process at any stage prior to exchange. The innocent party/parties will then be liable for solicitor's costs and disbursements, which will often be large sums if matters have gone all the way to near exchange. They cannot reclaim these costs.",
