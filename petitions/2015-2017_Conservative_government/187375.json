        "action": "Remove 2+ lane from M606 joining M62 (Eastbound), West Yorks during peak hours",
        "additional_details": "The 2+ lane is free flowing while traffic builds on the roundabout and it cannot be beneficial to the environment having large amounts of vehicles on the road for up 15 minutes longer than necessary.\r\nDuring recent roadworks the 2+ lane was temporarily removed and didn't create any problems. During peak travelling hours Monday to Friday (morning and evening), the 2+ lane should be removed.",
        "background": "As a single driver not in a position to car share, I have to approach Chain Bar roundabout to access the M62 eastbound, direct access being a 2+ lane only. This adds time to a journey, often backs up traffic on the sliproad to the M606 and only increases traffic on the already busy roundabout.\r\n",
