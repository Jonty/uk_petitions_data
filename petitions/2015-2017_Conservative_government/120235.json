Do not fall foul of our English tendencies and delve into the therapeutic moaning tendencies that we are all accountable for. Instead stand up and be counted, let\u2019s make a change, embrace all things English and pay the respects to the nation in which we reside. Sign our petition now!",
        "background": "England is one of a very select few who do not yet hold the privilege of being granted their National Patron Saints day off work as a Bank Holiday. We are suggesting that St. George\u2019s Day be introduced as an interchangeable national bank holiday, in exchange with the May Day national bank holiday.",
