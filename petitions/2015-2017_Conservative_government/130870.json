        "action": "Stop 'pooling' the sovereignty of the people of UK & NI with a foreign power.",
        "additional_details": "As the question of sovereignty has arisen in discussions about the referendum, David Cameron has said that if we leave the EU, we will have 'an illusion of sovereignty, but no more power'.  This may be the case for the political class but it is my understanding that the people of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland will have an illusion of sovereignty but no power at all if we vote to remain in an anti-democratic European Union.",
        "background": "The British Government is elected to govern the people by the consent of the people.  The people are sovereign; we are, as Mr Cameron has said, \u2018The Boss\u2019.  We demand that the British Government stops sharing entirely or in part sovereignty and lands of the people of the UK & N Ireland with the EU.",
