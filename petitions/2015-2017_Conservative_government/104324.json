        "additional_details": "34% of registered voters didn't vote in the last 2 UK General Elections. \r\nIn 2005 it was 38%. That's almost as many as the Labour and Conservative vote combined!\r\nThe UK's single-party governments are elected by less than a quarter of registered voters. \r\nWe need a PR system to give us better democracy to remedy the demoralised non voters as they feel there votes won't count in an undemocratic first past the post system.\r\n\r\nStats taken from http://www.votenone.org.uk/uk-unheard-third.html  ",
        "background": "The first past the post system is out of date now that there are far more than 2 parties in General Elections and the outcome of a PR system will reflect a fair democratic society rather than one that has a concerning amount of voters disillusioned with the UK Government's version of democracy.
