        "action": "Introduce a temporary visa scheme for refugees",
        "additional_details": "Many of our allies in the world use visa systems to control the influx of refugees and immigrants into their countries. It is made perfectly clear that the visa is temporary and this cannot be appealed. The UAE is an example. Visas there are only issued as temporary time limited visit or residency visas. \r\n\r\nIn the case of refugees, once the situation is deemed to have improved in their country they return home to re-settle and rebuild their own country. No appeal to stay should be allowed.",
        "background": "The introduction of a temporary visa scheme would allow safe temporary refuge to people escaping war and persecution. This would allow each case to be reviewed and when circumstances allowed, the refugees could be returned to their home country.  The visa would be granted for up to 3 years.\r\n",
