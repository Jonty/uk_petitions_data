        "additional_details": "The proposed boundary changes are in a sense 'undemocratic', local residents vote for a candidate to represent their constituency as their local MP, but changes are confusing local residents and angering some.\r\n\r\nMy source for this information is local media and other sources, I recommend googling about it, to find more information to prove this.",
        "background": "There has been proposed boundary changes around the UK, one including my local constituency 'North East Derbyshire', it's been proposed that the constituency be scrapped but replaced with two new ones, which obviously doesn't make sense and is completely unnecessary. ",
