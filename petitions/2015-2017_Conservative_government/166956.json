        "action": "Increase the age of 'Adult' public transport tickets to 18 instead of 16",
        "additional_details": "On most public transport services the price of an adult ticket is commonly double that of a child ticket, exceeding that of the low incomes under 18's earn. According to society adolescence ends and one becomes an adult at 18, therefore why on public transport are people under the age of 18 regarded as adults and are made to pay double the fair of a child's ticket when they are in fact not regarded as adults in society and commonly referred to as young people and/or children? ",
        "background": "Persons under 18 years of age have the lowest minimum wage standing at only \u00a33.87 per hour, but from the age of 16 they are expected to pay for Adult priced tickets on public transport. With such little income at such a young age, 'Adult' fares must be priced from the age of 18 upwards.",
