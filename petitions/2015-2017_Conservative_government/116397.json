The shift does not affect the homeowner a great deal as they will likely have to pay for a survey either way. It does however aid first-time buyers who may suffer greatly from collapsed sales due to a survey. ",

A buyer may then have a survey carried out and find issues that deter them from purchase. This is not held against the house allowing the scenario to repeat. This seems a waste of time and money. ",
