        "additional_details": "There is something happening and this government appears to be blind. The rise in hate crime (political assassination of Jo Cox linked to white supremacist terrorists), the obvious instability of the US President,  recent extreme immigration order and failure to follow legal process, rejection of expert advice, civil servants removed for disagreeing,  the removal of top military and security advisors from the National Security council's principals committee, and replacing them with Steve Bennon.",
        "background": "Abandon political posturing and differences to stand together to withstand the rise of violent nationalism across the world in the light of the maneuvering towards a coup in the USA political system. Is the government set on appeasement or blind to what is happening? \r\nUrgent action is needed. ",
