        "additional_details": "After the SOS twice refused planning permission for a SRFI development on 300 acres of green belt in St Albans, Hertfordshire, Eric Pickles changed his mind and approved it in July 2014 without allowing a conjoined enquiry with Colnbrook. Greg Clark in turning down the Colnbrook development concluded \"that the benefits of the scheme do not clearly overcome the harm. Consequently very special circumstances do not exist to justify the development.\"(on green belt) ",
