        "additional_details": "In addition, there is evidence to suggest that many people used their vote not for its intended purpose but to register a protest with the government.\r\n\r\nAlso, in law the referendum result is not legally binding upon the government; it is merely advisory.\r\n\r\nAs such, the result should not be followed blindly, with no intervening steps between the result and the government acting to leave the EU.\r\n\r\nThe Government should establish a Royal Commission, or other suitable body, to investigate.",
        "background": "The referendum was enacted so that a simple majority would be sufficient to establish a decision. For deciding the future of a union refined over 43 years, this would not make sense unless the result was advisory. Since the majority was 52% over 48%, the result should not be followed blindly.",
