        "additional_details": "walking through London these days for non-smokers is very unbearable.\r\npeople smoke walking pass you puffing as they go along not knowing the wind just blows the cigarette or sometimes even weed right up your nostrils. bearing in mind there are also babies and young children using these roads too. fair enough everyone has a choice and can choose to smoke whatever they like if they want to but can they please do it in designated areas? the cigarettes package itself warns that smoking kills.",
        "background": "The background of this petition stems from literally not being able to walk on a London road without someone walking pass you and puffing a heap of smoke in your face. I mean it's like you cannot breathe in fresh air any more.",
