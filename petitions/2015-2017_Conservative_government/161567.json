        "additional_details": "It is estimated that as much as 25% of homeless people are ex service personal.\r\n\r\nPeople in derived areas are doubly jeopardised by not having life chances of an affluent, structured, stable upbringing and are more susceptible to finding themselves on the fringes of society.\r\n\r\nThis is the age of one nation Britain and we need to care and nurture all.\r\n\r\nWe would like to see Parliament open up homeless rehabilitation centres to be able to accommodate everybody on the streets, to get their life back ",
        "background": "The homeless situation in Britain is a terrible stain on our home nations.  Having anybody living on the streets in such a developed society is deplorable.\r\n\r\nTo let it happen because it is felt that people have fell through the cracks, don't try or have chosen their misfortune is unacceptable.",
