        "additional_details": "An increasing amount of time is spent by fire crews dealing with flooding  with 70% of fire & rescue services involved in the aftermath of UK floods 2013-14. 6,000 firefighter posts have been lost since 2007, seriously undermining the service\u2019s ability to deal with floods, fires & other incidents. There has been a lack of investment in flood defences. Fire & rescue services need to be properly resourced, with sufficient staff & equipment to deal with more frequent flooding due to global warming.",
        "background": "At present, there is no formal expectation for fire and rescue services to attend floods in England and Wales. A statutory duty for them to do would help fire and rescue services, other emergency services and the government as a whole to plan effectively and reduce risk to life and property. ",
