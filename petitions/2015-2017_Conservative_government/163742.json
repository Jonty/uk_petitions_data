        "additional_details": "During WW1 HMS President 1918 was a secret German U Boat Submarine hunter (a 'Q ship') shadowing the Atlantic convoys with concealed guns. In WW2 She was used to protect St Paul's Cathedral from the Luftwaffe.\r\n\r\nThe Charity's last resort is an appeal and application to The Treasury for Government funding and it is hoped that our new Chancellor, Philip Hammond who was previously Defence Secretary and aware of the importance of The President to the nation and military, will now step in and save her.",

Grants made to successful applicants will be monitored throughout the lifetime of the grant, both to measure the outcomes of the project funded and to ensure that value for money is delivered.  \r\n\r\nThere has been significant interest in applying for support from LIBOR funds and the funds available are limited.  Therefore, and as made clear in the LIBOR grant application form, although all funding requests which fall within scope will be considered fully, not all are guaranteed to be successful in receiving funding.\r\n\r\nApplicants for the current LIBOR grant scheme will be informed whether funding has been committed, as part of the Autumn Statement on 23 November.\r\n\r\nHM Treasury",
