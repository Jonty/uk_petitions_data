        "additional_details": "The UK finds itself in the position of being the 2nd largest guarantor of security of Europe whilst being attacked by the same EU & national leaders we are protecting. \r\n\r\nThey are seeking to drive the financial sector from London to Paris & Frankfurt, refusing a deal unless a tax of \u00a360bil is paid, annual tax payments, threats to our fishing zones, a refusal to give UK nationals security of tenure in the EU\r\nThese are not the acts of \"Allies\" but an attempt to punish us for our democratic choice",
