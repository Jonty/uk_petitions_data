        "action": "Give social landlords timely and efficient access to complete gas safety checks",
        "additional_details": "The law doesn\u2019t allow social landlords a swift and efficient way to make sure that they can carry out the checks they are legally required to do. In fact, it can take as much as 4 months. It\u2019s vital to keep people protected both those living in the home where the gas appliances are and those living in neighbouring homes who could be unwittingly at risk if checks don\u2019t happen. Amend the law and end the waste of \u00a350m each year. Visit our website www.gasaccesscampaign.org.uk for more information.",
        "background": "This is a significant problem \u2013 each year almost 14,500 properties go unchecked. It\u2019s vital to keep people protected from the threat of gas explosions and carbon monoxide poisoning. We are campaigning to save lives by giving social landlords the right legal access to carry out annual checks. ",
