Better help them sort their own lives locally, let them fight, let them decide, offer our knowledge, experience but not our bodies. Refugees.. rubbish, if all they wanted was safety there are a lot closer countries with similar cultures, climates than treking across Europe, its all money.",
        "background": "Rather than us looking after people so fit they can walk across Europe for a better life AND us paying for the pleasure to do so, let them sort out their own countries issues, Yes some will die BUT they must develop themselves, create their own society, offer advice & help not our soldiers lives",
