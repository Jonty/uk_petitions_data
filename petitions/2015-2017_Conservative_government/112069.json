        "additional_details": "The current electoral system has not been so clearly proved as unrepresentative then in the recent June 2015 General election where the SNP who had 4.7% of the vote gained 56 seats and UKIP who received 12.6% of the vote gained only 1 seat. The Parliament was established so that the views of the electorate could have a voice but under this current voting system these views are not properly represented.",
        "background": "The current system of voting in the United Kingdom during general elections is first past the post, this is an unrepresentative system and the views of the electorate are not represented. Instead of this system we should adopt the Alternative vote, which would represent the electorate better.",
