        "additional_details": "Instead of having two 'bank' holidays in May, we should designate an alternative one day 'Met Office' day every year. This would not be a day that the Met Office gets to chill out, but a day that is designated at short notice when the 'experts' at the Met Office are confident that we will all be able to light the BBQ and actually make the most of time with family and friends. \r\n\r\nIn summary, exchange one of the May Bank Holidays for a moveable holiday to coincide with good weather. \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "We all know that the public holidays in the UK are unevenly distributed and usually coincide with periods of very poor weather. We can't blame the government for that, however, we do have the power to change it! ",
