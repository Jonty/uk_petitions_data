        "action": "Legislate for a Guarantor system (like Germany & Canada) to handle refugees.",
        "additional_details": "While the government doesn't wish to accommodate refugees at tax-payer expense, private citizens should be free to provide accommodation at their own cost.  We envisage something similar to a guarantor system whereby individuals/households could voluntarily house a refugee/family & help them find a job etc. A minimum ratio of guarantors to refugees would provide a level of confidence that the refugee concerned wouldn't end up as a burden on the state.\r\nOther countries have done this successfully.",
        "background": "Imagine a refugee solution which:\r\n- reduces welfare claims\r\n- reduces taxpayer expense\r\n- reduces the burden on the state\r\n- promotes better integration of refugees into society\r\n- reduces ghettoisation & attendant social problems\r\n- brings security benefits.\r\n\r\nSign this petition!
