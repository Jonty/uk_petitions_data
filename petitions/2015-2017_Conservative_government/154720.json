        "additional_details": "The Broadcasting Act 1990 is a good example of regulation and prohibits the broadcasting of:\r\n\r\n\u2022 any programme which offends good taste or decency;\r\n\u2022 material which incites crime or disorder;\r\n\u2022 matter which is offensive to public feeling;\r\n\u2022 news which is not impartial and accurate;\r\n\u2022 religious programmes which are not responsible; and\r\n\u2022 any illegal content, such as obscene or racially inflammatory material\r\n\r\nIndependent regulation is important. Self-regulation clearly does not work.",
        "background": "The public rely heavily on media to inform them of the news and make many decisions based on it. It is often biased, incites hate and manipulates people.\r\n\r\nThis is often evident by reading a number of newspapers, all of which have conflicting articles against each other.",
