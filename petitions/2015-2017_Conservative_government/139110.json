        "additional_details": "Theresa May has demonstrated on several public accounts that she does not have the people's views as an interest. To lead the country the PM must respect the feelings and views of the people.\r\n\r\nBoris Johnson may have led and won the Leave campaign, but this does not qualify him as a person to lead the county.\r\n\r\nRemember all government members are civil servents, they are here to serve the people of the U.K",
        "background": "Given the EU referendum and the resignation of David Cameron, this petition asks that Thereas May and Boris Johnson not be allowed to lead the Conservative party and become the the prime minister in 2016.",
