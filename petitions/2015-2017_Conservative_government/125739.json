        "additional_details": "I wrote to the Department of Health in July 2015 outlining my concerns for Diabetics if a sugar tax were to be introduced, and received a reply which said: \"The Government has no plans to introduce a sugar tax.\"\r\n\r\nMy concerns were obviously not taken into account when the announcement of a sugar tax was made.",
        "background": "Diabetics with a low blood sugar level need to consume glucose to stop progression to unconsciousness and possibly death. A glucose drink can be used, which can cost around \u00a33.80 for a pack of 6. The sugar tax will increase the cost. This is unfair to the Diabetic population who need these drinks!",
