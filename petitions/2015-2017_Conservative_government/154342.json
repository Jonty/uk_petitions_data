        "additional_details": "We were misled about the impact of a leave vote. We didn\u2019t vote for the break-up of the UK. We didn\u2019t vote for economic meltdown. Concerns of people across the UK have to be taken much more seriously \u2013 and now. But not this way. Give the UK another chance to vote in a referendum on EU membership.",
        "background": "The people of the UK were gravely misled. Nigel Farage admits the Leave campaign misled voters on a key campaigning message: extra money for the NHS. Claims by the Leave campaign that warnings about economic impacts were just \u201cscaremongering\u201d have already been proved catastrophically wrong. ",
