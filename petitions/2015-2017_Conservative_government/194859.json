        "additional_details": "My partner aged 28 was playing touch rugby on a field when he collapsed. Teammates attemped CPR as an ambulance took 15 mins to get there. If a defibrillator was available at the time, my partner could still be alive. He was young, fit and healthy. He should have had every chance like those on a professional football pitch. Every person should have the BEST chance of survival. Defibrillators should be readily available just like fire extinguishers. Please sign this petition to save lives. ",
        "background": "Young, physically fit people are at risk of cardiac arrest. Defibrillators MUST be available in ALL schools, sports grounds, bars, shopping centres and workplaces. If a defibrillator is used & effective CPR is performed within 3-5 minutes of cardiac arrest, survival chances increase from 6% to 74%.",
