Many company's employ apprentices because they are a cheap wage but produce the same level of work as anyone else so why not pay a good wage to what there work 'qualifies' for. ",
        "background": "In most company's apprentices are undertaking the same work load and level of work as someone with 2-3 years experience who of which are already qualified in that field of work. Everyone is still learning even the very best of us so why should apprentices earn less than those who are newly qualified",
