        "additional_details": "We are loosing the last of our ancient to developments\r\nI'm aware of at least 400 ancient woods currently under threat in the UK. I point to the examples of Oaken Wood in Kent, Smithy wood near Sheffield. HS2 will cost us (74 acres) in phase one alone.\r\nTaken from the forestry.gov website: \r\nFull planning permission for a development automatically provides an exemption for felling trees.\r\nIn reality ancient woodland has no legal protection from development and we need to save then before there gone",
        "background": "The UK has one of the lowest tree cover percentages in the world with only 13% of the UK covered by woodland. Ancient woodland makes for about 2% of the total cover. Give Ancient woodland full legal protection and stop woodlands from been cut down for development of Roads and buildings.",
