        "additional_details": "In the UK, 600,000 or one in every 103 people has epilepsy. Every day in the UK, 87 people are diagnosed with epilepsy. Only 52 per cent of people with epilepsy in the UK are seizure-free. It is estimated that 70 per cent could be seizure free with the right treatment.  There are more than half a million people with epilepsy in the UK. Around 600 people die each year due to Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. ",
        "background": "This month (November) it is National Epilepsy Awareness Month in the US.  In the UK we only have 8 days a year for Epilepsy Awareness and this clearly is nowhere near enough. I have decided to support the US in their amazing efforts and help raise awareness and funds during the month of November.",
