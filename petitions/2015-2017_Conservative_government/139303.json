        "action": "Reject ALL current petitions to call a 2nd referendum into force",
        "additional_details": "I believe by allowing this petition to successfully be heard in parliament and hence the discussion on whether to hold a 2nd referendum will be tainted as foreign nationals will be able to sign it. I believe under current legislation foreign nationals who are resident within the UK are allowed to sign petitions on the government petitions site as any affairs also affect them. This therefore means that they have a possibility of affecting the outcome of any petition regarding a 2nd referendum.",
        "background": "I the undersigned hereby call Parliament to reject ALL current and future petitions calling for a 2nd referendum regarding the UK's membership of the EU.\r\n\r\nThis petition WILL be manipulated by foreign nationals to persuade the outcome by signing it when they have no legal remit to do so.",
