        "additional_details": "In order for the nation of Wales to fully embrace and celebrate such a momentous occasion, the government should declare a one-off day of celebration. A bank holiday allow will allow families with young children to stay up to watch the match, it will reduce poor attendance levels at schools and employment, and will afford the Wales FA the recognition their hard work and dedication have deserved. It will inspire a generation of young people to follow seemingly impossible dreams. ",
        "background": "For the first time since 1958, Wales are competing in their first international football tournament. The team have inspired a nation with their dedication, enthusiasm and passion. Their success deserves national recognition and celebration. ",
