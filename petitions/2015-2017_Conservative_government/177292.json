        "additional_details": "Police can impose a \u00a3100 fine for \u201cBeing drunk & disorderly\u201d. Someone so drunk requiring NHS services is defacto \u201cdrunk & disorderly\u201d and so should be automatically fined at least \u00a3100.  Ideally introduce a new charge of \u201cBeing drunk & disorderly to the extent of requiring NHS services\u201d with a minimum fine of \u00a3500, increased annually by \u00a3500 until the problem has been eliminated \u2013 with all monies going direct to the NHS. 31 Dec. fines should be double to fund Emergency staff double time.",
        "background": "Introduce legislation automatically fining drunks requiring NHS ambulance/medics, to stop their NHS abuse, by turning it into the National Hang-over Service.  Ambulances and medics attending drunks are services unavailable for genuine and so more worthy emergencies, with consequential risk to life.",
