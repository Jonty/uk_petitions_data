        "action": "Start dredging our waterways in the UK to assist in preventing flooding",
        "additional_details": "Riverbeds overtime gain a build up of a lot of rubbish,silt etc. Cleaning this away will increase the water capacity of our waterways which will go a long way to prevent flooding.This will also give people jobs to help the unemployment figures.Some say that dredging damages the flora and fauna of our waterways.But surely not dredging causes more damage to flora, fauna etc when not carried out? Water animals suffocate when they get washed up on to the land during floods, dredging would help lives",
        "background": "Dredging needs to be carried out in the UK to increase the amount of water our waterways carry. This will help prevent flooding which destroys a lot of businesses, homes, lives (human and animal). Building up banks will only push the water further down river & cause flooding there. ",
