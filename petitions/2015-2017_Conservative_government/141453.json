He should not be our next leader unless he is democratically selected by the British public as a result of our vote.  Whoever becomes the next conservative PM will make vital decisions on our exit of the EU and therefore financial security, this should be someone that we democratically choose. ",
        "background": "After Cameron's resignation, the next prime minister will be internally voted for at the Conservative Party Conference. This means Boris Johnson could likely be the next leader. The British public must be able to vote for the next Conservative to be Prime Minister, as ultimately it's our future.",
