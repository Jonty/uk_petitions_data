        "action": "Call for Turkey's removal from NATO",
        "additional_details": "Erdogan publicly flaunted his support for Hamas & ISIS while accusing Israel of crimes against humanity, violated an arms ban to Gaza, bought an air defense system from the Chinese in defiance of NATO, and denied America the use of its own air base to conduct strikes during the Iraqi War & ISIS in Syria. Turkey has been tacitly fueling the ISIS war machine. There is evidence to show that Turkey has allowed jihadists from around the world to swarm into Syria by crossing through Turkey\u2019s territory",
        "background": "The North Atlantic Council, should formally oust Turkey from NATO for good before its belligerence and continual aggression drags the international community into World War III.\r\nUnder Erdogan, our NATO ally has arrested more journalists than China, jailed thousands for the crime of free speech.",
