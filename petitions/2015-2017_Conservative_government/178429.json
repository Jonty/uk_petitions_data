        "additional_details": "Statistics are rising and people are becoming even more vulnerable. Safe camp sites will allow people to commune to support each other, protect each other and have minor shelter from a tent. If this was legal there would be less crisis on the streets as support agencies will be able to access a larger volume of people and the vulnerable can get the help they require. This could also improve many social factors. Those with no homes should not be punished for looking for somewhere safe to sleep!!",
        "background": "I have worked with homeless people who have been badly treated and ended up in dangerous situations sleeping on the streets. None asked to end up in this situation. Nobody asked to be beaten or spat at or to become ill due to the freezing temperatures. Safe camp sites to help temporarily.",
