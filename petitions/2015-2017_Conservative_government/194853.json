This from the Express.\r\n\r\nThe Beeb has raked in more than \u00a3300,000 worth of EU grants since the referendum alone, with the money being paid out for \"research projects\" carried out by BBC staff. \r\n\r\n The BBC insisted the cash has \"no influence\" on the editorial content of its news programmes. \r\n\r\nThe row blew up after it emerged that Brussels has agreed to hand \u00a3352,750 to the taxpayer-funded broadcaster for its role in a research project.",
        "background": "The BBC is haemorrhaging support due to its continual and visible bias towards the EU.  It is obvious to a large number of the citizens of the UK that this bias is fuelled directly by grants and continuing subsidies from the EU.  This negates the principle of funded by the people for the people.",
