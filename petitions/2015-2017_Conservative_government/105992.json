        "action": "mothers refusing access to fathers with no safeguarding issues should be illegal",
        "additional_details": "there needs to be much more support put in place to help keep fathers in children's lives as and where it is safe. A mother should have to prove by means of professionals ie children's services, police reports or court order that a father is a direct threat or risk to the children before she is allowed to stop contact, if a mother tries to stop father contact with no good reason then she should face a sanction of some kind, a fine and for continued offences a small custodial sentence.",
        "background": "a lot of fathers Can't afford to go to court to fight for their children as well as pay for every day living and child support, so more and more children are growing up without their fathers.  Fathers are supposed to be equal but in reality if mother says no, and you are not well off then that's it",
