        "additional_details": "Houses are constantly being built in this village. The village has two of the largest schools in the region. \r\nChildren and parents are actively encouraged to walk to school. \r\nThe two roads that Sean - the lolly pop man - patrols have no pedestrian crossings or safe areas to wait on. \r\nThe speed limit hasn't been reduced to 20mph like it has around other schools. \r\nThe police constantly patrol to monitor the atrocious driving and parking along these roads. \r\nIn short:LINDLEY NEEDS ITS LOLLYPOP MAN\r\n",
        "background": "Lindley NEEDS its lollypop man; not only does he cheer everyone who sees him, but to cross Lidget Street & Hollybank Road safely would be impossible without him.\r\nKirklees are threatening to cut all school crossing patrols. There are over 860children at the schools; and yet more houses are planned.",
