They have shown deep contempt for the people they purport to represent by using and building on these fears and concerns without any intention of addressing them.",
        "background": "The leaders of the EU Referendum Leave campaign misled voters, claiming a vote for leave would reduce immigration and make \u00a3350 million additional funds available for the NHS.  They have now disowned both these statements.  They are therefore not fit to hold public office or to lead this country.",
