        "additional_details": "I saw some fish while I was at a fairground, at least three of them were either dying or dead.\r\nThe \"healthier\" fish were swimming around trying to breathe, trying to get the air they need.\r\nIt broke my heart to see this little fish gasp for air.\r\nI was angry when the owner said \"who cares, they're fish.\"\r\nMy mother owns fish and knows how they should be kept, fish need air, fish need food, fish need entertainment.\r\nThey're living things like you and I.\r\nI am shocked as to how we can let this happen.",
        "background": "Fish are living things, fairgrounds buy them and keep them in small bags until they die or are given away.\r\nThese fish are treated so badly at fairgrounds, we wouldn't allow dogs or cats or any of our household pets to be kept like this, so why let fish be kept like this?\r\nThis is cruelty.",
