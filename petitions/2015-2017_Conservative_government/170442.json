I believe this act is should be illegal as it affects so many, some of which are sadly grieving due to the loss of their beautiful children. The theft of these photos alone are enough to cause, and are enough to cause heartache and pain to families and I feel this is a breach to confidentiality. Mothers should not have to water mark their images in fear of someone stealing their photos. ",

These photos include baby bumps, scan and pictures of children who are still alive but also have sadly passed away. It is a vile \"crime\" and should be illegal.",
