        "action": "Stop the sale of kittens and puppies in pet shops",
        "additional_details": "We can prevent this drastically if pet shops stop selling puppies and kittens. It will force people to go to the shelter and adopt an animal from there or make them think about it instead of buying them on impulse. Some pet shops won't vet the home it is going to, to make sure it's going to the best home possible.\r\nWe ask for urgent action to raise awareness & encourage the public to choose a responsibly bred puppy/kitten with history information, or adopt from a legitimate rescue organisation.",
        "background": "It is devastating to see that there are so many stray dogs and cats on the streets these days. Many are due to the fact that people go to pet stores, see an adorable little baby kitten or puppy and buy it on whim then further on down the line become bored and they end up in shelters up for adoption.",
