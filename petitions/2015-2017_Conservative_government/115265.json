        "additional_details": "The case of Chunky the Chihuahua is one of the worst the RSPCA has ever seen. He was beaten, force fed drugs, had his neck broken and was set on fire by a gang of teenagers. Somehow he survived, but those teenagers have only been prevented from owning pets for five years. This is not enough. The names of those who commit this kind of abuse need to be placed on a register which prevents them from owning pets again. Animal abuse is indicative of serious maladaptive personality and psychopathy.",
        "background": "Inspired by the incredibly successful 'Justice for Chunky' campaign to raise awareness about animal abuse. There should be an Animal Abuse or Animal Offenders register similar to that of the Sex Offenders Register, to stop those guilty of animal abuse ever owning pets again. ",
