To help you get what you want, it is important that your petition has a clear action for the UK Government or Parliament. \r\n\r\nFrom reading your petition, I think that you are dissatisfied with the process you need to go through to collect disability welfare and, in particular, the amount of explanation you need to provide. \r\n\r\nIf this is correct, you could for example start a new petition asking to: stop or reduce the number of steps disabled people have to go through to get disability welfare, or stop people having to explain their disability or mental health and the restriction it has on their lives in order to claim welfare. In the additional information you could give your own experience as an example.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may wish to petition for an impact assessment to be made on, or an investigation into the effect the process of applying for disability welfare has on applicants, again using your own experience as an example. \r\n"
