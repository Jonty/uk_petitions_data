        "additional_details": "Usually fathers are the absent parents, there are many examples of fathers being blocked by mothers from seeing their children and this is stressful to not only the fathers, but the children too. Being estranged from a loved one, especially a parent should not be allowed under any circumstances, the courts are backed up, family courts can take some time, during the usual wait, the child's relationship with the absent parent can break down, a law to guarantee visitation will stop this happening. ",
        "background": "Absent parents when separating should automatically have the right under law to see their children for a minimum amount of time, I propose two days every week assuming it is safe (under current laws) for the children, until formal arrangements are made for their custody and care.",
