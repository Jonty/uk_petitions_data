        "additional_details": "Some women choose an independent midwife because they have had a  previous traumatic birth, or simply because they want continuity of care which is rarely provided in the NHS.\r\n\r\nWomen have a legal right to choose where to birth and with whom.The Nursing and Midwifery Council's decision means that qualified, NMC registered, independent midwives no longer have the legal right to practice.",
        "background": "On 11th Jan the NMC suddenly banned independent midwives from attending their clients in labour leaving them without  a livelihood and their clients with no-one to help them birth their babies. This removes choice for women and is an assault on their human (birth) rights",
