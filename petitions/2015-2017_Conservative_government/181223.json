        "additional_details": "Lets not be shutting people out because of blanket information or feeling, that is what he does. Lets take action, but be clear in it.\r\n\r\nI am not worried about the Queen's embarrassment, I am against celebrating someone who upholds unethical values.\r\n\r\nWe should welcome him as human and a political leader, and not shun him. We do this to learn from each other, accept him, as we hope he will accept others. \r\n\r\nBut not celebrate his arrival with a State Visit.",
        "background": "I am making this petition because I do not want President Trump's actions to breed further segregation and separation of people. I believe we should fight against what is real and what is wrong, and therefore I want to be specific about why I don't think he should be allowed to make a State Visit.",
