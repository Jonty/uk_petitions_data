        "additional_details": "Due to school rules we are not able to bring our own meals in, I feel hungry in lessons after lunch because I didn't get enough to eat as there are no vegan options. My concentration is also affected. Vegan meals are easy and cheaper to produce as you exclude meat and dairy from your budget. Many kids are also in the dark of what it means to be vegan and the cruelty behind the meat, dairy and egg industry. By having a vegan option you're encouraging a cruelty free lifestyle and promoting it.  ",
        "background": "As a vegan my school lunches are restricting. We have a vegetarian option but no vegan option. The amount and food I am eating is not good value for the price that is being paid as school lunches are included in the fee. A vegan option would also promote healthy eating and an ethical lifestyle.",
