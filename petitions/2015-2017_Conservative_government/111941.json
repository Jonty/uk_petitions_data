        "action": "Stop the government denying military personnel automatic incremental pay rises.",
        "additional_details": "All three Services are short-manned, most units around the country struggle to maintain a high operational output with gapped billets. The MOD risk losing highly trained and motivated personnel if the next SDSR moves to stop incremental pay increases. Military pensions have already been reduced as well as thousands of jobs lost. The government is spending billions on new equipment but risk not being able to operate it effectively without retaining a pool of highly trained and motivated people. ",
        "background": "Military personnel from all three Armed Forces are prepared to sacrifice their lives through service to their country. Incremental pay increases for long service and automatic promotion somewhat counterbalance the sheer inconvenience of military life; some spend up to 9 months a year away from home.",
