        "additional_details": "While seeking access to the Single Market Government should seek to mitigate the effect of disproportionate total migration into the U.K. from other EU member states.\r\n\r\nFurther, in the absence of a negotiated settlement being ratified by Parliament the Government must put the final agreement to a referendum of the British people for a simple vote either to accept the negotiated terms for leaving the EU or to remain within the European Union.\r\n",
        "background": "Any settlement negotiated by the Government must also be ratified by the British Parliament. Negotiations must seek to maintain full membership of the Customs Union while also seeking access to the single market for service industries including the Financial and IT sectors. ",
