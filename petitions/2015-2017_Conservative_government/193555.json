        "additional_details": "Losing FoM damages business, forces relocation to the EU, loses tax and jobs. \r\nFoM benefits UK citizens, travelling to  other countries in Europe. \r\nStopping FoM damages the NHS. Vital skilled NHS workers are leaving. \r\nKeeping FoM gives stability to EU Citizens in the UK.\r\nLosing FoM damages UK Arts and Culture. \r\nThe UK is a global leader in Higher Education and Science. Withdrawal from FoM damages its international standing and financial viability. That will damage the economy in the long term. \r\n",
        "background": "Article 50 has now been triggered.\r\nThe only question on the EU Referendum ballot paper has been honoured.\r\nWithdrawal from the Single Market was not on the ballot paper and was promised by the Leave campaign.\r\nFoM is a fundamental requirement of the EU Single Market. \r\n\r\n",
