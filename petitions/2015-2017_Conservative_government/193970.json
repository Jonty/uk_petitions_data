Therefore, the UK has never legally been a member of the EU under UK laws. This should be conveyed to the EU, complete with a notice that states that we are  NOT bone fide members of the EU and that all monies paid into the EU, minus that which has been paid to support EU projects in the UK, should now be repaid and that we should forthwith start trading under WTO rules and regulations.",

Thanks to Gina Miller, the UK courts decided that the Royal Prerogative was an illegal mechanism through which to activate Article 50. ",
