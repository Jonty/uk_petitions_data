        "additional_details": "I cite falls in the pound which correspond exactly with Mr Carney's speeches particularly his call for interest rate cuts in a period after Brexit when economic indicators showed better than expected results.  Mr Carney is obsessed with low interest rates which hit savers badly and the pound worse. A weak pound means a higher cost of raw materials for UK business which will ultimately result in businesses folding. It is time for him to go.",
        "background": "Mark Carney is having a detrimental affect on the UK economy and particularly on the pound.  Each time Mr Carney makes a statement the value of the pound falls.  The UK needs a strong pound as many food items are imported and a weak pound results in higher prices for basic essentials.  ",
