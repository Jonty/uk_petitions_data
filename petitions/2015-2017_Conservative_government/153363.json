        "additional_details": "A publicly elected body must seek to represent those they have power over. Both campaigns are guilty of abusing the public's trust, and have in doing so undermined their causes. We are not calling for another referendum, and we are not discriminating against one or the other campaign. Boris Johnson, David Cameron, Michael Gove, George Osborne, Nigel Farage, and Hilary Benn must all be subject to investigation over their claims regarding our position in the EU.",
        "background": "Both campaigns, led by publicly elected officials, of the EU referendum were reliant upon misinformation and misleading statistics. This in turn has left the British public feeling misrepresented and has contributed to the continued divide currently apparent throughout the United Kingdom.",
