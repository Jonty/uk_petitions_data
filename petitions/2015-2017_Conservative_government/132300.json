        "action": "Make it illegal for a vehicle Driver or Passenger  to Smoke with a Window Down !",
        "additional_details": "People have been blinded on several occasions by moving vehicles/cars/vans & stationary hgvs by ash blown into thier eyes. \r\nDrivers appear oblivious to the impact of their actions on other road users. For a driver this is also effectively 'not in control of the vehicle' driving with one hand. The main problem is the holding of a cigarette outside the vehicle where the forward motion or wind carries the ash into the eyes of other road users. The way to enforce would be to ensure no external smoke",
        "background": "Drivers & passengers that smoke with a window down hold their cigarettes outside of the vehicle with ash & smoke going into the eyes/faces of following motorcycles, bicycles etc. This can blind people in following vehicles causing accidents & fatalities. This should be made illegal on safety grounds",
