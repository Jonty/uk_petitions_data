        "additional_details": "When they're on it's like driving through road works with no actual roadworks in place,because of too many motorist speeding up an slamming on aswel as making it more unsafe for anyone who has broken down.Changing the signs from 60,50,40,60,40 is clearly a way to catch people out an putting the 40 sign on at the bottom of a hill causes HGVs to use a lot more fuel to drag the load up the hill instead of maintaining speed.",
