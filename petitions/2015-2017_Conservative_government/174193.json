        "additional_details": "The catastrophe of the Palestinian people is a direct result of the failure of the British Government from the time of the mandate. It is also due to the fact that the Balfour Declaration itself had no legal basis. The Declaration did not in any way preserve or protect the rights of the indigenous population as it originally aimed. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we call on our government to step its efforts in solving the Arab-Israeli conflict by apologising and amending for Balfour Declaration and work out a peace deal agreed by all the parties in the conflict.\r\n",
        "background": "The British Mandate of Palestine failed to protect the rights of the people it governed. Since then Palestinian have been living under immense suffering and catastrophic conditions. They have experienced many wars, sufferings and became a displaced nation in the Diaspora.",
