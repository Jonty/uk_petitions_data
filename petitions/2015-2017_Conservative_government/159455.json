        "action": "Provide bursaries for mental health training",
        "additional_details": "The UK has a teacher shortage. As a result, the Government introduced incentivised bursaries to attract more people to train as teachers. The mental health profession has an even bigger shortage, yet training is both lengthy and very expensive. If we are to help deal with the deficit of appointments and patients on waiting lists, then access to training needs is a necessity.\r\n\r\nPlease support this important campaign to help provide more professionals in such an underresourced sector.",
        "background": "Psychotherapy and counselling training is lengthy and expensive. Mental health is crying out for more trained professionals. I would like to see incentivised grants to help attract more people to the profession, and to help those attracted, but without the funds to study.",
