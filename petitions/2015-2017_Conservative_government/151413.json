        "action": "Delay invoking Article 50 until Expert Commission reviews impact of Brexit on UK",
        "additional_details": "\"Leave campaign\" MPs claimed that leaving the EU would mean: more money for the NHS; improved job prospects for UK residents through lower immigration; greater economic prosperity through reduced red-tape and renegotiated trading agreements with the EU and the rest of the world. Since the Referendum, these claims have been significantly reduced, and there is no Brexit plan. Parliament now needs to take responsibility to ensure that the outcome is as beneficial as possible for the British people.",
        "background": "MPs should respect the wishes of the 63% of the electorate who did not vote to leave the EU, and demand that Article 50 not be invoked until Brexit proponents provide a fully developed plan for the process of leaving the EU, followed by an Expert Commission to assess its economic and social impact.
