        "additional_details": "He is an extremely inspirational figure, motivating us through the tough coursework included in the GCSE D&T course. He often tells us stories about his childhood in the 'dark age', as well as those from his time in the SAS to motivate us.  He is so kind and heartfelt, without his kindness and help we would be lost. He never repeats himself, and has a new story everyday. There is something really special about this man, and we would hate to see him go. Please help our Rutters boiz in their quest",
        "background": "Lord Sir Geoffrey Rutter OBE has been teaching at Dulwich College for over 33 years. He plans on retiring at the end of this year, abandoning Rutter's boiz half way through their GCSE course. He has just turned 26 and has been teaching he was -18. We would be so upset to see him go, please help us!",
