        "additional_details": "Food adverts majority advertise meat products, or products containing animal byproducts, this means that the people of our society depend more upon these products. A bill which would require supermarkets to advertise Vegan and Vegetarian options on a bigger scale would mean an overall reduction in the amount animal products are depended upon.  This serves are environment as the production of meats has a server impact on our environment, but also reduces the amount of animals unnecessarily killed.",
        "background": "I think a bill should be introduced whereby advertising of foods should be equally distributed between Carnivore, Vegetarian and Vegan options. This will provide education to all, people will gradually move away from animal based products due to a wider knowledge of what alternatives are available.",
