        "additional_details": "From 6 April 2015, immigrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who are coming to the UK for longer than six months will be required to pay a \u2018health surcharge\u2019 when they make their immigration application. \r\nIt is acceptable to make immigrants who do not work or pay income tax and NI to pay NHS surcharge to avoid extra burden on NHS funding; But it is unreasonable and discriminatory to make immigrants who pay income tax and NI to 'double contribute' in NHS. ",
        "background": "Immigrants who pay income tax and NI every month have already made their contribution to NHS and they should have the right like any other working British citizens to use NHS without being double charged. ",
