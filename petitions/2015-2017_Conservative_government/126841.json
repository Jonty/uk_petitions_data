        "action": "Introduce a mandatory driving ban if caught using a mobile phone whilst driving",
        "additional_details": "An automatic, mandatory ban, perhaps one month for the first offence, one year for the second, will help to reduce this practice in the same way that mandatory bans have done for drink-driving.  This practice may well be just as dangerous, and is far more widespread than drink-driving.  It has to be addressed before more people die.",
        "background": "The danger caused by the use of mobile phones is well-documented, but the current penalty is not an adequate deterrent.  It's possible to see a huge number of drivers using their phones every day.  A serious, significant deterrent is needed in order to curb this extremely dangerous practice.",
