        "additional_details": "Dog farms produce one in three dogs bought in the UK, but animal rights campaigners want the \u2018shady business\u2019 banned. While some farms are run by licensed breeders who must adhere to minimum standards, many are run illegally, supported by organised crime.\r\nDogs have often been smuggled into the UK without their proper vaccinations. This, paired with the filthy conditions, means disease is rife and many animals die, sometimes shortly after being bought by their new families.\r\n",
        "background": "We all know or have heard of the horrific conditions in which some legal & illegal dog farms keep puppies locked in filthy cells and starved of human contact, we need to put an end to it now, putting pressure on the goverment to look & act on the puppies behalf now \r\n",
