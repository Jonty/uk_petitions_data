        "additional_details": "Being on the road also means that the highway code needs to be followed. Cyclists do not take a theory test, therefore most will not know what road signs mean, putting themselves, pedestrians and other road users at risk. There has been many disputes and fights between cyclist and motor vehicle users on the road in the past over faults. If cyclists pay road tax and take a theory test, cost of road modernisation could be recouped. Cyclist use the road, they should also pay to use it like others.",
        "background": "Cycling is a popular and healthy way of travelling. The government is currently investing millions in changing road layouts so that they are safer for cyclists. Unfortunately, cyclists are not paying for these works. Other road users such as cars and motorbikes are required to pay road tax. ",
