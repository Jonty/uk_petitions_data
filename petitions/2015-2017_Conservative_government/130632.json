It is not the Government's BBC, it's the public's BBC.\"\r\n-said Peter Kosminsky at the 2016 BAFTAs \r\nSee: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36245724 \r\n\r\nBBC licence fee money is money the public gives to the BBC to make programmes & content.But the Government believe it is public/tax money so they should appoint BBC Directors, use the money for other initiatives or give it to other broadcasters/newspapers ",

Any Directors or Chairs of BBC should be appointed by a transparent process using a public commissioner completely independent from the Prime Minister or Culture Minister.",
