If they want to go to college they cannot claim benefits, so no income even though they want to get off jobseekers. We have low skilled people being forced to remain that way.\r\n\r\nI am from a working class town, hundreds of people on job seekers. Many I meet want to go to college and do different courses, not only the basic courses, to achieve skills. If they choose to go to college they won't meet the 35 hours a week for seeking jobs and can\u2019t claim help, so they are not allowed to improve as they won't be able to live without benefits. They become trapped in a life that has little sign of improving.",
