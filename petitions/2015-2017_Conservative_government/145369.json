        "action": "To implore Parliament to vote against triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty",
        "additional_details": "I want our MP's to vote against triggering article 50 which would see us leave the EU. Our PM has resigned leaving it in the hands of our MP's who are there for this exact reason; to make decisions for us based on the facts, using their experience and knowledge of the situation. Sometimes people are wrong, they are biased or swindled by propaganda, sometimes they vote wrong and sometimes it is the responsibility of our elected officials to protect us from ourselves. This is one of those times.",
        "background": "So we voted to Leave the EU and nobody is happy. Millions of people who voted Leave are upset about the lies and propaganda told by the Leave campaign, the economy is collapsing and investors are already pulling out of the UK. Those who voted Remain are protesting and rightly so. Read on to help.",
