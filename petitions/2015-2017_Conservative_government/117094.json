        "action": "Create equal rights for unmarried parents.",
        "additional_details": "Currently where parents are unmarried, the father has to be present during the birth registration to be named on the child's birth certificate. Where an unmarried father is not named he will have no parental responsibility in the eyes of the law. Many mothers use this as leverage to strip fathers of their rights by registering their children alone, particularly where there has been a relationship breakdown. Please discuss how to change the laws so unmarried fathers are given equal rights.",
        "background": "The laws concerning parental responsibility and how births for unmarried couples are registered is outdated and does not reflect societal changes over the last few decades, where a large percentage of babies born in the UK are to unmarried couples. ",
