For example, any request should first be approved by a court.\r\n\r\nTo see what a British assisted dying law could look like if it were approved, see the \"Assisted Dying (No. 2) Bill 2015-16\" in the link below.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2015-2016/0007/16007.pdf\r\n\r\nThere was a national referendum on the Alternative Vote in May 2011. A referendum on assisted dying could take the same form.",
