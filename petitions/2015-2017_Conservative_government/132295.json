This discrimination means that two adults doing the exact same office job can now be legally paid different amounts.Young adults trying to stand on their own two feet and make their way in society are being told once again that they are worth less and don't deserve the same rights as their contemporaries.\r\nhttp://www.livingwage.org.uk\r\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/31/low-paid-young-people-pay-rise-national-living-wage http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/living-wage-85-of-people-think-under-25s-should-get-a-pay-rise-a6956271.html\r\n",
        "background": "The government has disgracefully excluded young adults once again with the latest \"living\" wage.
