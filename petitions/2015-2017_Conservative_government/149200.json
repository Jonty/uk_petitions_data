The flag combines aspects of three older national flags: the red cross of St George of the Kingdom of England, the white saltire of St Andrew for Scotland (which two were united in the first Union Flag), and the red saltire of St Patrick to represent Ireland.\r\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Jack\r\n",

It's time we showed the world we really are the UNITED kingdom!",
