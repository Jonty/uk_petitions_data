        "additional_details": "The penalty charge is reduced to \u00a335 if you pay within 14 days and increased to \u00a3105 if you don\u2019t pay. You also have to pay the crossing charge.According to the BBC UK drivers have had about 1.5 million penalty notices this means that if they had all payed within the the 14 day period the dart charge has taken more than \u00a352 million pounds in fines and where does that money go ? we pay road tax,car insurance ,petrol tax so we should be given a more reasonable time frame to pay the charge .",
        "background": "The dart crossing only allows until midnight the next day to pay a \u00a32.50 charge(more for larger vehicles)but if you forget or are unable to pay in time the penalty charge is \u00a370 and must be paid within 28 days.We should be given at least 3 days from crossing to pay the charge before receiving a fine",
