            "details": "The policy not to allow the formation of new polygamous households in the UK is enshrined in s.2 of the Immigration Act 1988. Even if a polygamous marriage is recognised as valid in the country in which it was enacted, the 1988 Act prevents a man from bringing a second or subsequent wife with him into this country. As a result the Home Office has not issued any visas to allow the formation of polygamous marriages since 1988. \r\n\r\nUniversal Credit is calculated on a household basis and so does not recognise polygamous relationships. As a result they will have no impact on the amount of money individuals receive. \r\n \r\nUnder legacy income-related benefits, those wives in polygamous marriages who entered the country prior to 1988 are treated as dependants.  Across these legacy benefits, entitlement is based on the personal allowance for a couple at the normal rate. The additional money that a couple receive compared to a single person is then added to this allowance for each additional person who is part of the polygamous marriage. If a claimant is in a polygamous marriage then the income of each of its members is treated as the claimant's, or joint claim couple\u2019s income and included in the means-test in the normal way. \r\n\r\nThese rules mean that there is no financial advantage for those in polygamous marriages under legacy income-related benefits. Benefit entitlement for any additional partners is restricted to an allowance which is less than the rate for single people.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions",
            "summary": "Marriages which take place in the United Kingdom must be monogamous. Polygamous marriages which take place abroad may be recognised but will make a household no better off under the benefit system. ",
