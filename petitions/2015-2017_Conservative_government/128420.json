This will keep people in a working routine and also encourage them to progress onto better opportunities. \r\n\r\nJobseeker's Allowance should be treated as a wage, therefor if the claimant fails to work in these voluntary positions their money is to be stopped. \r\n\r\nThis will save money within the benefit system as well as getting claimants into a routine of working for their money.
