        "additional_details": "This will ensure that all voices from Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England are considered equally and follow the interests of each country.\r\n\r\nThis would ensure that a majority vote in one or more countries could never result in a divided United Kingdom which opposes the views of other members amongst the people of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe interests of each nation must be followed to keep the United Kingdom United together.",
        "background": "The EU referendum could result in the separation of the U.K and the government needs to act in the interest of each member.\r\n\r\nTherefore this petition demands that the United Kingdom government in all referendums past and present can only act when a majority vote is found within each country.",
