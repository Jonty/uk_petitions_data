        "additional_details": "The original name given to the project in Sefton Council was The Core Strategy.\r\nAll the residents that knew about it raised objections that have not been addressed.\r\nThe plans have now been given the go ahead after a huge amount of money has been used for our supposedly cash strapped council to implement.\r\nThere reasons for the housing do not stand up to scrutiny. \r\nThere is no infrastructure in place to accommodate the large estates. \r\nThe dessicration of green belt land is therefore not required.",
        "background": "The government has pushed local councils to open restrictions on developing green belt land for large estates to be built.\r\nThis ignores brown field sites and housing that can be redeveloped.\r\nI support the brown field development.",
