        "additional_details": "We want a single tier weekly state pension which allows every pensioner to not only exist but, which gives them ability to live an active social life. Wrapping all benefits into the guaranteed weekly income will save significant sums in housing benefit, income support, and administration. The simplicity of the system, and the scrapping of means testing, will allow for the dismantling of a great deal of bureaucracy. Almost every pensioner will be better off at almost no net cost to the Treasury.",
        "background": "How the elderly and vulnerable are treated is said to be a true measure of the values and morals of a country. Currently they\u2019re are many contradictions within the UK from what is stated, promoted and the actual facts. We are the seventh richest nation and yet 1 in 4 pensioners now live in poverty.",
