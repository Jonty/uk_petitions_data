        "background": "Parliament is a symbol of the nation but a \u00a35 billion+ refit is excessive + shows it is no longer fit for purpose. A virtual parliament could holographically project debate into civic spaces, cut costs, improve voting, attendance + access to data. Our parliament would once again lead the world.",
