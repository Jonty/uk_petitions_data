        "additional_details": "The F35 is not capable of dog fighting and is not suitable for providing a close air superiority role. It has been beaten by the F16 jet in close air combat situations and dog fights, this aircraft has been built since the 1970's. This shows just how bad of a multi-role jet it is. It is to expensive for what it is and would save the government and tax payers millions by canceling a large amount of orders.These canceld orders should be replaced by the better Dassault Rafale M or F18 Super Hornet",
        "background": "The F35 is not capable of being an Air Superiority fighter and would put Royal Navy pilots at a high risk of loss in air combat situations against super sonic soviet era jets with modern avionics packages.The Royal Navy needs carrier based fighters capable of defeating Sukhoi and Mikoyan (mig) Jets.",
