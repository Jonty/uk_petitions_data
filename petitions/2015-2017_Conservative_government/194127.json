        "additional_details": "Article 50 can be revoked if the parties agree. Major companies are to move operations from the UK (e.g. Lloyds of London). Loss of workforce is a reality if EU staff are forced to leave, as is a loss of jobs if companies relocate. The Govt are offering a \u00a3500million tender to redesign the passport! Brexit is already costing a fortune. \u00a3350million a week will not be given to the NHS. The UK is just going to adopt EU directives as they stand. We should not be complacent and just let this happen.",
        "background": "The reality of Brexit is only just beginning to hit the Nation. The Govt failed to provide us with the facts beforehand & we are only just facing its future negative impact. Would you really vote the same now? The Govt should ask if we would vote differently with what we know now.",
