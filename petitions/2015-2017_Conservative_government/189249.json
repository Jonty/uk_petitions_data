        "background": "I think Jaywalking should be illegal in the U.K as i was involved in a bad accident, knocking somebody over because they were jaywalking. I obviously got the blame as i was the driver. Although there was a zebra crossing they could have used which was about 20ft away from them but they chose not to.",
