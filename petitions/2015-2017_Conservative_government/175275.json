        "additional_details": "Ferry road has become a racetrack for some drivers/bikers. Several residents have had pets killed in RTA's on Ferry road due to careless driving. More importantly a child was knocked down in December 2015 on the bend by the scout hut. Luckily the child was not badly injured but it is a matter of time before someone is seriously hurt. Motorbikes have been seen wheelying past houses and drivers speeding up to 60 MPH. We need to come together to stop this and see our Village gets some respect.",
        "background": "Eastham Village is a conservation area with a small village and a mediaeval church at the centre. It is a tourist attraction down at Eastham Ferry and has Woodlands, a visitors center and tea gardens. It is steeped in local history and is a popular walking spot and for motorbikers at the local pub.",
