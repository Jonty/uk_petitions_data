        "action": "Cats not in an approved breeding programme should be microchipped and neutered.",
        "additional_details": "At my local rescue centre alone, there are presently around 40 kittens, and things will most likely get worse as the summer progresses.  It happens every year, and the situation is repeated in rescue centres up and down the country, mainly due to owner ignorance and/or lack of responsibility.  Compulsory microchipping and neutering of cats would go some way towards preventing this, and would result in happier, healthier cats.",
        "background": "Female cats can become pregnant at 4 months and give birth at 6 months.  This is not good for anyone involved. A legal requirement for neutering, plus compulsory microchipping to enable cat owners to be identified, would prevent this happening, and also take the pressure off cat rescue centres.",
