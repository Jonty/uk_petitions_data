In November 2002 Gibraltarians voted on a UK proposal to share sovereignty of the Territory with Spain, and 98.5% rejected this proposal.  \r\n\r\nThe right of all peoples to self-determination is one of the core principles of international law and it is the responsibility of all states to ensure that this right is realised. The obstruction or violation of this principle constitutes a very serious violation of international law."
