        "additional_details": "Europe has a long history of independent city-states. However, none of them come come close to the population, financial or political & cultural influence of London.\r\n\r\nLuxembourg is a tiny state with a population of around 500k and a GDP of $50-60 billion. They're also a successful member of the European Union. \r\n\r\nLondon's population is about 8.5m and has a GDP of $500-850 billion. \r\n\r\nLondon clearly has the will, the population and the finance to go it alone.",
        "background": "In the recent referendum, Londoners overwhelmingly voted to remain a part of the European Union, unlike large parts of the rest of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nLondon could become an independent city-state that remains within the EU. It has the size, finance and will to do this.",
