        "additional_details": "We are told that taking our children on holiday isn't educational therefore they won't authorise it, whereas we see it as they are learning modern foreign languages, geography, history, culture and maths all of which are being taught in our schools. Also what is the difference between us taking them away, to the school taking them away to places like Paris and Derwent Hill ",
        "background": "As the government can't authorise 10 days of absence during term time, the law should be changed so travel agents can't inflate their prices during out of term time. It's daylight robbery and normal working class families can't afford to pay the extra 100's of pounds they add on",
