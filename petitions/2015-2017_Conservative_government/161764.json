The media and government officials regularly call the terrorist attacks by individuals, such as the recent attack in Nice, France, as \"Lone Wolf\" attacks and this is unjustified. The Wolf is a majestic animal and the association to cowardly terrorists is just wrong.\r\n\r\nBy calling the attacks: \"Stray Dog\" attacks, there would be some reluctance by the perpetrators to be associated with such cowardly action.",

This glorifies the terrorist and their supporters by associating them with the majestic Wolf rather than a more mundane association such as a stray dog.",
