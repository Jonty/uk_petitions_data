        "action": "Free up our curriculum to teach more about global history, culture and societies",
        "additional_details": "Instead of separating black history to one month why don't we just teach history from a global perspective. After all we don't do one month of European or Asian History. It's all intertwined. \r\n\r\nThis is something that will benefit every child as having a greater conception of world history means we can learn lessons from it and see how it informs the present.",
        "background": "London alone encompasses more than 270 nationalities and 300 languages yet we are teaching history from a very narrow perspective. \r\n\r\nThis is no longer compatible with the diversity we have in our cities. What we need is a new approach that is more holistic.",
