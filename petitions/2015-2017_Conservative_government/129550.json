        "additional_details": "The right to vote and be represented in parliament is a fundamental privilege of citizenship, not of residency. Millions of lifelong citizens of Britain only are currently barred from voting in national elections even while individuals with dual citizenship and new citizens may vote. This anomaly shall be remedied by welcoming new Members of Parliament elected solely by those British citizens living overseas who are unable to vote in a geographic constituency.",
        "background": "Millions of British citizens who live and work outside the country are unable to vote in national elections and hence are deprived of representation in parliament. New Members of Parliament shall be elected by, and will represent, these citizens.",
