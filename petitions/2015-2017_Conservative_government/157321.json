We would NOT therefore accept Theresa May or Stephen Crabb who opposed this view to be the PM to implement Brexit and we would NOT trust them to follow through Britain's FULL exodus from the EU.  This would be a violation of the democratic right of the British people who overwhelmingly voted for BREXIT.  ",

These were a points based Immigration system, NO free movement of ppl.  FULL return of sovereignty which no EUCHR court could overrule and immediate triggering of Article 50\r\n\r\n",
