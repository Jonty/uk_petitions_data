This is too small to be a government mandate to leave the EU with the dire economic consequences already seen. The MPs Code of Conduct obliges them to do what is best for the NATION i.e. Scotland, NI, Wales and England.If a deal which is more favourable to the whole of the UK than EU membership cannot be reached, MPs must vote not to leave.",

Both Houses of Parliament passed the EU Referendum Act, which approved this decision, with large majorities and cross-party support. \r\n\r\nOn 23 June 2016, the people of the UK gave the clear instruction that they wanted the UK to leave the EU, and it is the duty of the Government to make sure we do just that. The Government was clear in the run up to the referendum that it would honour the result, whatever the outcome. So this Government is now fully engaged in fulfilling that mandate to leave the EU. \r\n\r\nThe people have spoken in the referendum offered to them by this Government and confirmed by Parliament, and we expect Parliament to deliver on this. There must be no attempt to delay, frustrate or thwart the will of the British people. \r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to delivering an exit that is in the best interests of the whole of the UK, however, the Government is equally clear that no deal for the UK is better than a bad deal for the UK. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Exiting the European Union",
