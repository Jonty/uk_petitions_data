        "additional_details": "\u2018Bid to Save a Stray\u2019 is a Registered Charity who rescue and rehome Romanian dogs and cats in peril. Cruelly caught by uncaring public workers, the animals are left suffering, often within barbaric cages with no food, water or medical treatment for painful injuries sustained. The majority are then killed inhumanely within a period of time too short to allow interjection by those willing to help. The horrific treatment of innocent strays must end before we commence any trade negotiations.\r\n",
        "background": "Theresa May must gain the unconditional agreement of the Romanian Government to cease the barbaric treatment of animals in their public shelters before Brexit negotiations commence. As a nation of animal lovers the UK should not partner with a country whose government publicly condones such cruelty.",
