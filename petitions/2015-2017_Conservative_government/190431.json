        "additional_details": "If they are found by the Chinese authorities they are sent back to North Korea where they are punished as defectors (e.g. life imprisonment in deplorable conditions). Repatriating refugees in this way is a clear violation of human rights and they should be allowed safe passage through China to a country who will accept them (e.g. South Korea).\r\nhttp://www.libertyinnorthkorea.org/\r\nhttp://www.nkfreedom.org/index.aspx\r\nhttp://www.northkoreanrefugees.com/\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei-gGvLWOZI",

Many do not have access to basic commodities, are not free to talk or act as they choose and are in fear of severe punishment. Many escape to China to find freedom, they are often exploited by traffickers or sold.",
