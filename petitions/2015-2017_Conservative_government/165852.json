        "additional_details": "'Brexit means Brexit', the Prime Minister says, but the government has barely begun working out what that means. What is possible on the economy, movement of people, trade, education or research cooperation? Which option best protects and maintains the United Kingdom? What is \u2018hard\u2019 and what is \u2018soft\u2019 Brexit? How can negotiations begin on such vital issues without the government publishing an objective assessment of risks, opportunities and impacts of each option, and how they will be managed?",
        "background": "Despite the referendum result in June we, the public, have no information from government on Brexit options. A consultation paper setting out realistic choices and their consequences is a vital step to inform debate and restore public confidence ahead of negotiations and decisions in parliament. ",
