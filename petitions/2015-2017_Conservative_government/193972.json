        "additional_details": "Whilst London is currently the home of the British Royal Family and the seat of Government, there are already plans afoot to relocate the workings of Parliament to Yorkshire while they refurbish the Houses of Parliament.  We petition that the seat of the non-EU \"Sovereign\" Parliament remain in Yorkshire and that these buildings be opened as a tourist attraction or are used for the home of the new EU Parliament of the free EU state of London",
        "background": "It has become apparent that the will of the people must be respected and it is in this vein that we, the people of London, ask that \"our will\" be respected and that we be permitted to secede from the UK in favour of becoming an independent EU nation state.",
