        "additional_details": "In the example of Chunky the dog who was stolen, who had his leg and neck broken, was set fire to and fed drugs and these people were given a ban is not just. If it was a person the sentence would be different. I understand that animals are not people but the owners are. There was another case in the same town where a man stamped or bludgeoned his Staffordshire Bull Terrier to death and also received a ban for 5 years. Ban for life. And give a prison sentence. This behaviour must stop.",
        "background": "In light of the near death of Chunky the dog, I am calling for support for tougher sentences rather than a ban on owning animals for perpetrators of violent crime and attempted or actual murder of animals.",
