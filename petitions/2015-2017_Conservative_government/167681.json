        "additional_details": "There is much scientific evidence to suggest that crustaceans feel pain.\r\nAs crustaceans are not in the animal welfare act, they can be killed in any way. This usually involves boiling them or hacking them to pieces whilst they are still alive. \r\nAnimal welfare organisations are calling for greater protection for these animals, based on sound scientific evidence and the provision in the Act.\r\nReference: RSPCA, Animal Aid and Shellfish network\r\n",
        "background": "Crustaceans are not covered by existing animal welfare legislation. \r\nThe Animal Welfare Act 2006 states that its protection can be extended to other types of animals if it can be proven that they are capable of experiencing pain.\r\nScientific evidence proves that crustaceans do feel pain.",
