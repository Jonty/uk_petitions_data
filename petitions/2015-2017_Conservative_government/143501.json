        "additional_details": "Due to the expansion of social media, viral ideas are able to spread globally in minutes.  As we have seen in several recent petitions that have exploded overnight, that people on twitter, Facebook, 4chan, etc. are actively promoting petition fraud by having people sign using false UK addresses, and fraudulently declaring themselves to be eligible UK voters.  THIS MUST BE STOPPED.  It would be easily implemented (reduced) if Geographic IP filters are introduced, and IP addresses logged. ",
        "background": "The petitions system is being blatantly abused by people who feel it is OK to use false data and sign a petition multiple times (and even write scripts to automate it), and that most critically non-eligible voters, outside of the UK are being allowed to steer our democratic process through fraud.",
