        "action": "Stop holiday companies raising their prices during school holidays.",
        "additional_details": "Why should families and even individuals who don't have any children have to pay more to go away on holiday during holiday periods affecting the prices massively in comparison to term time in which you can now receive a fine for anyway! Sometimes there is even a 99% increase from term time to holidays, how are less fortunate families able to ever get any kind of break? Please sign this petition if you agree, if we receive enough, we will propose this to the government and may provoke change.",
        "background": "Our aim is to help reduce prices concerning holiday and airline tickets. It is unjust that parents can't take their children away because it is too expensive around summer time. Yet prices are lower during term time so are they unable to take their children away without the threat of a fine.",
