        "action": "Reform the law on the defence of Insanity to benefit the mentally ill",
        "additional_details": "The current law on insanity was made in 1848 when psychaitric illness was hardly understood. \r\nDespite huge developments in understanding, diagnosis  and treating mental illness, the M'Naughten Rules on insanity have remained unchanged. \r\nReintroducing the proposed reform by the Law Commission would mean that people with actual medical conditions won't be excluded by the law and will stop the mentally/physically ill from pleading guilty to avoid the stigma of being classed as insane.",
        "background": "The Law Commission Report in 2013 recommended a new defence with a special verdict of \"not criminally responsible by reason of a recognised medical condition\".\r\nUnfortunately this slipped through government policy making and has been ignored since.",
