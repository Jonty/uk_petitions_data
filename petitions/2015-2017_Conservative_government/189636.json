        "action": "Ban male circumcision for under-16s on non-medical grounds",
        "additional_details": "The age of consent to any form of sexual activity is 16 in the UK. Circumcision will heavily affect the sex lives of any males, why should parents have the right to mutilate the penis without the child being of sound age or mind to give permission, as after all it is his body that will be changed. If changed, it allows males to be able to make a responsible decision on whether they wish to be circumcised and means a child doesn't suffer pain from such operation for unnecessary reasons. ",
        "background": "Circumcision has many consequences including loss of nearly 20,000 nerve endings, decreased sexual sensitivity, can lead to infections and even death. Most supposed benefits of this procedure have been proven to be myths. In some cases, males are circumcised at 8 days of age and without anaesthetic.",
