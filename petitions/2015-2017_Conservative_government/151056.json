Older voters have no right to blight the future for the younger generations.\r\n\r\nThe claim that the UK pays \u00a3350 million pounds per week to the EU and could be better used on the NHS, was a huge lie, because they deliberately confused gross and net payments.  \r\n\r\nSince the vote, Leave campaigners have admitted that the can do no more about immigration than the current government is already doing.",
