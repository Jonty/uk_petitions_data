They'd be less likely to quickly move or cause damage or infection and you'd know there allergies (I.e Gold) by then, a child should be able to ask, especially as if they choose they don't like them they'll be left with either holes or scars on their ears all because there parents pierced them without permission while so young. It's assault. ",
        "background": "So by law if you were to put holes in another human beings body without permission then you'd be arrested for bodily harm, but parents believe they have the right to be doing this to babies and children, why can't a child have the right to ask for it to be done and choose to ruin their own bodies.
