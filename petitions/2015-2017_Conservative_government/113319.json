        "additional_details": "Government's plan for a private plane is a false economy and a vanity project. Landing, parking, boarding, leaving and take off fees have not been considered. David Cameron is the only leader in the G20 who doesn't have a plane. Meanwhile public services have suffered severe cuts. David Cameron has flown out to meet President Barack Obama on British Airways in a more cash conscious move. \r\nSOURCES: http://goo.gl/tTVIKE    http://goo.gl/J1EVki http://goo.gl/UJzj\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Our government is spending \u00a310 million to turn a military plane into a private plane for David Cameron and Senior Ministers. They made damaging cuts in the name of austerity. They also tell us, we are all in it together. A private plane is not an example of us all being in it together. \r\n",
