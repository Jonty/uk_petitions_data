That power was given by Parliament to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) in 2010, so that after 2012 MPs no longer had control over their own pay. IPSA conducted a public consultation after 2012 and decided what the salaries of MPs should be after the election.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contact IPSA to request a further review, here\u2019s how to contact them:\r\n\r\nhttp://parliamentarystandards.org.uk/About%20Us/Pages/Contact-Us.aspx\r\n\r\nWe are not sure exactly what you mean by your request about MPs' working hours. If you mean that the sitting hours of the House of Commons should be changed to be the same as those of junior doctors, we could accept a petition asking specifically for that change. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, MPs do not have set working hours. It is for each MP to decide what hours he or she wishes to work. If you think that MPs should have a formal contract setting out their working hours, you could start a petition about that. \r\n\r\n"
