        "additional_details": "Those who voted \"Leave\" on June 23rd did so without knowing what the exact terms of withdrawal would be - and whether promises made on issues such as immigration, trade, NHS spending etc would be realised. \r\n\r\nOnce negotiations have concluded (and terms/implications are clear), it's only fair that British people are allowed a vote on whether they want to Remain in/Leave the EU. \r\n\r\nThis empowers the British people to make a more informed decision on the pros/cons of continued EU membership.",
        "background": "Whilst we fully respect the collective will of the British people in voting to withdraw from the EU, the terms & implications of that withdrawal are not yet clear. \r\n\r\nOnce negotiations have concluded, we request a second referendum to make a final, more fully informed decision on EU membership",
