        "additional_details": "Anecdotally, only 1 in 5 employers & agencies give acknowledgment of receipt. Of this, almost all give basic, generic reasons why you weren't interviewed. \r\nFrom interviews, only 1 in 2 potential employers give bespoke feedback. This means for every job applied for, you'll only get a clear reason you weren't considered for the role in around 1 in 40 occasions. \r\nHow are you supposed to improve? We'd like a law to make employers give bespoke feedback of at least 100 words given when asked. ",
        "background": "When applying for jobs, directly or via an agency, there's often no acknowledgment of application. If turned down, there's often no feedback. It's therefore not transparent & gives no chance to improve. We'd like a law to make employers acknowledge receipt & give short, bespoke feedback when asked.",
