        "additional_details": "eBay and Paypal's working practices need to be investigated. They hide behind 'Terms of use' to effectively extort more profits from their customers.\r\n\r\nOnce an eBay transaction has been satisfactorily completed i.e. consignment tracking shows delivery and the buyer has left positive feedback there is no argument of protecting anyone's interests yet funds can still be held for up to 21 days for casual sellers. This only serves to increase the profits made by a service you had no choice but to use.",
        "background": "Whilst the basic premise of most of eBay & Paypal's policies are reasonable and ensure good practice to protect both sellers and buyers, withholding funds after a sale is successfully completed is unreasonable, can cause undue hardship, and serves only to increase the profits made.
