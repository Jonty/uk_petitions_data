        "action": "To change the laws on criminals being prosecuted on the account of rape.",
        "additional_details": "Personally, I don't think that community service is an appropriate sentence for someone being convicted of rape. The victims and their families would have been put through hell and the perpetrator receiving community service for however long is basically letting them get away with it, when the victims deserve a lot more justice for the crime that was committed.",
        "background": "This petition is to change the minimum jail sentence length and to rule out community service as a legitimate charge. Victims dealing with cases such as this deserve to be able to go about their lives as they wish, without having the fear of running into their offenders.",
