        "additional_details": "More than a third of council tax payments will go towards paying workers\u2019 pension schemes within five years; pension schemes only. There are then wages, expenses and so on to be taken into account.Council Tax is no longer being used to pay for what it was intended; it is now used to fund wages. The public sector use the excuse of we must pay the most to get the best: but who among us believes our public services have improved in any way shape or form since the rise of these massive wages: no one",
        "background": "Public sector wages, gold plated pensions and expense allowances have run wild since the Labour governments of Blair and Brown. Public sector pensions in particular are effectively a Ponzi scheme with more and more contributors needed to meet demand; they will collapse eventually causing chaos",
