        "additional_details": "Why should the conservative government do the deals they want, after all we voted out and now they want to do deals that mean we stay in, for example retaining the Single Market which entitles Free Movement of people and goods. We have never really been 'IN' Europe, we have only ever paid into it, if we were truly in then we would have been forced to have the Euro! The people voted for out for a reason, and this should be completely upheld and adhered to, lets go back to ruling our own country!",
        "background": "We voted to come out of Europe, we did not vote to remain in on issues that the government decide ie free movement, trade deals, immigration. Big businesses are NOT going to tell us what we can and cant have, we are the consumers and without us they don't survive",
