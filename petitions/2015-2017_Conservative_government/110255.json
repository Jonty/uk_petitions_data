        "additional_details": "I appreciate the local authorities are under great financial pressure. However, I feel that such astronomical costs to the public for waste disposal leads DIRECTLY to fly tipping, I think there can be no doubt on that subject. I would like to see a system in place allowing the public to use van companies to dispose of their waste, without the enormous costs involved.",
        "background": "I run a \"man and van\" company, south shields man and van services. Part of my work involves removing waste from the households of the general public. The cost to dispose of such waste is currently \u00a3144 per tonne for me. Therefore the cost to the public can be \u00a3200 per tonne. Or up to \u00a350 for a sofa.",
