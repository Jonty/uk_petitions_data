        "action": "Hold a 2nd EU referendum as it's proven that campaigns lied & misled the public.",
        "additional_details": "There are numerous examples of dishonesty and unethical campaigning by both sides, including:\r\n\r\nVote Leave claimed \u00a3350m is spent on the EU per week but this is not an accurate figure and has been admitted by Nigel Farage.\r\n\r\nVote Leave claimed there will be a European army with the UK in it.  There are no such plans and the UK would have to agree to this.\r\n\r\nVote Leave claimed Turkey are about to join the EU.  Turkey joining would require the agreement of all EU countries, including the UK.",
        "background": "The UK voted to LEAVE the EU in a referendum on 23 June 2016.  It has been proven that both campaigns lied to the public and misled them on the issues and thus there should be a second referendum, asking the same question, now that the public are aware of this and better understand the issues.",
