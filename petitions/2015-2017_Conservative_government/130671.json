        "additional_details": "BBC funding model should be changed to a subscription based model so that its viewership and funding is based on its performance, need and demand. \r\n\r\nIt should operate in a pure democratic way and people should have a right to choose if they really want to pay the licence fees and view BBC channels or not. \r\n\r\nPeople should not be forced to pay the licence fee.",
        "background": "As of now people are forced to pay the TV licence and cannot opt out. \r\n\r\nThis is not a democratic way of doing things, it is more like dictatorship where everyone is forced to pay for the service irrespective of its performance or need.\r\n\r\n",
