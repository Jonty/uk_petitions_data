        "additional_details": "LED lighting compared to conventional lighting not only saves on maintenance but also has a better quality of light and is better for the environment, a conventional light bulb is 48watts and an LED equivalent is 6watts..huge consumption saving. for every lightbulb you change you will save around \u00a320 per year....imagine ALL bulbs changed...payback is normally 6 months on one of these bulbs.",
        "background": "The government is very wasteful in all of its buildings or is very slow in the uptake of LED technology (Lighting) by just changing a light bulb they could save 90% on electricity. It's a simple process and a quick win for the electorate..less money to energy companies & more for the NHS!",
