        "additional_details": "In some areas as many as 50% of children do not have a father  on the birth certificate, what right does a mother have, to do that to a child. We live today in a society that makes it easy for women to have children for all the wrong reasons, sometimes not even informing the father until the issue of money is raised.  Many mums ask dad to leave the home, which devastates dad and young children.  it isn't always dad at fault, often it's mum. Equal parenting has to be the way forward.",
        "background": "Children have a right to know BOTH their parents. It is unacceptable that family courts are so steeped in tradition that they cannot make decisions based on the best interest of the children and continue to rule in favour of the mother rather than award equal parenting. It's not always Dad's fault.",
