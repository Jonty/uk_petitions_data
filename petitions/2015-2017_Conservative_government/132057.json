        "additional_details": "If people were made aware and given a full understanding of Feminism and gender inequality from a young age, they would be far more tuned in to these issues in adult life. This would be effective in helping society to become more equal and tolerant in terms of gender, which would benefit everyone, including men. The main factor inhibiting the achievement of gender equality appears to be a general ignorance of the fact that inequality exists. The way to address this ignorance is education. ",
        "background": "As a female sixth form student, I have come across few male peers who fully understand feminism. Many refuse to accept that gender inequality is still an issue both nationally and globally, and see feminists as man-hating groups advocating female superiority. This ignorance must be addressed.",
