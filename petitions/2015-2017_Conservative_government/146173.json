        "action": "Open negotiations to join the Schengen Area.",
        "additional_details": "The UK has voted to leave the European Union but many people, especially young people in Britain, value being able to travel and work freely across Europe. We value the contribution that visitors and residents from elsewhere in Europe make to our economy and society. We will likely be required to agree to freedom of movement as part of any deal to join the European Economic Area or EFTA. We could start negotiating to join Schengen before triggering formal negotiations to leave the EU.",
        "background": "Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are in Schengen without being in the EU. Schengen allows for free movement and common visa policy across Europe, without requiring welfare support for immigrants, and provides for police and judicial cooperation to fight transnational crime.
