        "additional_details": "To qualify for the death sentence the nominal must be over the age of 18 and for the that person to have proven beyond all reasonable doubt to have committed the offence of murder, rape or child molestation.   The sentence should be the same regardless of ethnic background or gender and should be law that applies to all people in our country.  The victims are so twice. Firstly, by the perpetrator and and again by the judicial system with the weak sentences they give.  This has to stop.",
        "background": "With the growing murder and rape pandemic, it is necessary to have a deterrent.  Too long the government and judges have trivialised murder, rape and child molestation with poor sentences. The victims have been ignored by many judges and politicians are too quick back the criminals",
