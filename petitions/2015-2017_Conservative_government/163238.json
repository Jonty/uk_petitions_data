We need to focus on the bigger picture. This will always be an issue unless we stop the cause of it. There is absolutely no need for someone to breed animals, other than profit for themselves. This is not acceptable. These animals in shelters are here because of us. We have made them, now it's our responsibility to stop future animals facing the same fate. ",
