        "additional_details": "The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommended that the MenB vaccine be offered to babies at 2, 4 and 12 months of age in March 2014. It was announced that all UK babies would be vaccinated against meningococcal B (MenB) disease as part of the national childhood immunisation programme in March 2015. \r\n\r\nWhy did it take till 1/9/15 for the immunisations to start and why only for infants born from the 1/5/15? \r\n\r\nMore information can be found at: http://www.meningitis.org/menb-vaccine",
        "background": "The NHS is only funding vaccinations for infants born after the 1/5/15 and is forcing parents of infants born before this date to pay privately for 3-4 doses; costing approximately \u00a3130 each. All infants deserve protection against this serious illness and it should not have to come at a price.",
