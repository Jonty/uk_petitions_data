If it wasn't for her periods stopping she would of never have found out that she had abnormal cells and would of had to wait till she was 25 by which it would of been to late. 65 out of 3,207 women diagnosed with cervical cancer before the age of 25. Could be you or someone you know. ",
        "background": "We need to lower the age of the smear test from 25 to 16. I believe that as soon as you become sexually active you should be able to have a smear test. Females are having the HPV injection that stops the cervical cancer virus whilst in school, so should be allowed a smear test when sexually active.",
