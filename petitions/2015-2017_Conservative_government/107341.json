There are already more people per square kilometre than most other European countries.\r\n\r\nSaudi Arabia and other oil-rich Gulf nations have enough money and resource to house all the refugees fleeing the war in Syria yet proportionally they do much less whilst Europe gets criticized for not 'doing enough'.\r\n",
