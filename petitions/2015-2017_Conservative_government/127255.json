        "action": "Make it mandatory for elderly people to have an equal standard of medical care",
        "additional_details": "Anyone who has spent any time around their elderly relatives in hospital will notice that there are insufficient resources to cater for their needs - they have to wait for support with toileting, often left in discomfort when bed pans and commodes are not forthcoming. If they are too ill or find it too hard to feed themselves with food or drink there is insufficient help available. When they are in pain they may be given pain relief but the source of the pain is not investigated-this must change",
        "background": "Both my parents suffered unnecessarily at the end of their lives due to a failure in the NHS to provide them with an equal level of care.  Effort is not made to help feed patients who are too ill or infirm to feed themselves, nurses are too stretched and their shifts are too long - change is needed",
