The offence is committed where a witness under oath willfully makes a material statement in a judicial proceeding which they know to be false or do not believe to be true. The penalty for perjury can be a maximum of seven years imprisonment, or a fine, or both a fine and imprisonment.\r\n\r\nIt's therefore not clear what you would like to change. "
