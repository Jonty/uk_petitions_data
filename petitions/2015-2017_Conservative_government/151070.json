        "action": "If another Scottish referendum is to be run, widen the constituency to the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Sturgeon shouldn't be allowed to hold 'neverendums' until she gets a result she likes. \r\n\r\nAs this is a matter that will effect the whole of the U.K, I propose that the constituency for any further Scottish independence referendums is widened to include all UK citizens. \r\n\r\nThus ensuring a fair and balanced result is provided from a democratic society.",
        "background": "Nicola Sturgeon has already tried and failed in gaining independence from the UK. By clutching at the results from the EU referendum, Sturgeon is pushing hard for a second Scottish independence referendum. This will most likely lead to a yes vote, and see the collapse of the UK as we know it.",
