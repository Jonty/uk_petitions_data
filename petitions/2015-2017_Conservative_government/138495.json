        "additional_details": "The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act prohibits the calling of an early General Election. This act must be repealed, or a vote of no confidence called in the current government, in order that an election can be held in October 2016. The alternative is a replacement Prime Minister not voted for by any of the people, which is unacceptable. The \"lack of control\" over who governs us was a major factor in many people deciding to leave the EU in the first place.",
        "background": "David Cameron is resigning as PM in light of the EU referendum results. This will leave the UK with a new PM who was not voted for by the people, merely members of the Conservative Party.",
