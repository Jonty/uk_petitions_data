        "additional_details": "This is an honest call for calm. The people who voted for our place in the EU with open hearts and minds.  We had the facts and saw through lies on BOTH sides. There is absolutely nothing to be gained by whipping up false hope of a second referendum and the UK government must I believe firmly and clearly state that the result is what it is. No matter what people may think or believe we live in a democratic society. The UK government must reassure the people that democracy will and must prevail.",
        "background": "The UK has decided. This was not taken lightly in the face of threats from polititians, the UK prime minister, the current government and EU member states. The people have spoken. Stop scaremongering and stop petitions relating to the EU referendum. Get on with the result. It will not change",
