        "additional_details": "https://www.gov.uk/guidance/british-forces-post-office-services#announcements\r\n\r\nE-Blueys are the 21st Century version of the beloved Blue Aerogramme.\r\n\r\nThis service is still needed, as personnel serving overseas on operations are often unable to use social media and personal devices for security reasons. \r\n\r\nPosting letters overseas takes time, and often cannot keep up with the fast pace of movement of personnel on operations.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to ask Parliament to reverse the decision.",
        "background": "The E-Bluey service lets the family and friends of service personnel quickly send messages electronically to then be printed out at a local base. This saves huge amounts of time for personnel to receive, and reply to messages.  The MOD is cancelling this crucial service to save \u00a31M per year. ",
