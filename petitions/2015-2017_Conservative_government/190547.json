        "additional_details": "The volunteer scheme would involve people being able to let the Court Service know they are interested and available to take part in this interesting and important civic duty.  It could be run in addition to the summons scheme.  This would allow UK citizens who want to commit to Jury service let the Court service, who need jurors, know they are interested.  ",
        "background": "Having completed jury service I'm surprised that you cannot volunteer.  I have shared my experience with friends/colleagues and the overriding response is 'I would love to do Jury service'.  During my jury service I saw others who had been summoned drop out meaning the whole case was abandoned.  ",
