        "additional_details": "The MP has a job with an investment firm, a university, chair of the Northern Powerhouse, speaking engagements and now editorship of a paper. There are not enough hours in the day. MP's should have approval like public servants. They should detail work patterns to show they will spend at least 35 hours a week on parliamentary business and still manage the other job. They should outline how they will avoid conflicts of interest. The application and decision should be published.",
        "background": "With the recent revelation the Tatton MP has 6 jobs, we believe rules on second jobs should change. Public servants require approval, so should MP's. A new approvals body should scrutinise applications and MP's must evidence how they will spend at least 35 hours a week on parliamentary business.",
