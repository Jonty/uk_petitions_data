        "additional_details": "With the introduction of compulsory micro chipping it is unjust that authorities can then defend failing to scan any animal that has been killed on a Council road.  Each year 1,000's of pets are killed on England's Council roads and no effort is made to scan for a micro chip.  Owners are left searching for their pet not realising that it could, in fact, already have been sent to land fill or has been incinerated.  As recommended by John Hayes,  this Mandate should to cover all roads in England",
        "background": "March 2nd 2015, Westminster enforced Harvey's Mandate. This ensured that any Dog or Cat killed on England's highways will be scanned for a micro chip, a detailed log report created, photographs taken and the animal kept in cold storage.  We now request that the Mandate covers all of England's roads.",
