        "additional_details": "From 2007 smoking was banned in all public houses. Since this has happened thousands of small family run pubs have been closed down and never reopened. Local communities are suffering through this and so are the owners of the pubs. Allowing a smoking room would be a great space to go for a cigarette allowing people who don't smoke to be well away from it, or make some pubs smoking (at a charge made by government) so that people then have a choice which pub to attend ",
        "background": "I think landlords/lady's should be able to turn there pubs into smoking or non smoking pubs. As we know pubs are closing everyday and this I believe it due to the smoking ban. If we had both smoking and non smoking it then would be down to the individual which pub they decided to go in. ",
