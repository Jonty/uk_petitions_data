        "additional_details": "The government will reduce the amount of corporation tax paid by businesses to 17% by 2020, yet if you are an employee on a standard PAYE system you're taxed at a basic rate of 20% which can increase up to 45%. How is this right?\r\n\r\nYou can not take advantage of these rates, tax is taken automatically from your salary every month. The government continues to give tax breaks to the people that own these companies, not the employees that are paying a disproportionate tax rate to their employers.\r\n",
        "background": "Companies making billions in revenue from operating in the UK can take advantage of tax loopholes, government deals and reduced tax rates, yet the burden of the tax bill is being paid by the average employee being taxed on a basic rate of 20% and national insurance at 13.8%. PAYE needs to be fairer.",
