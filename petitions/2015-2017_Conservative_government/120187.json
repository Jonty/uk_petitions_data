        "additional_details": "The ambulance service are attending more calls for help. Paramedics and Emergency care assistants they are being subjected to over runs, reduced or no breaks and continual pressures of being short staffed with not enough ambulances to cover the number of calls. All are actually underpaid and overworked for the role they now take on, many paramedics earning the same as a newly qualified nurse but making life changing decisions about patient care. We need to give them the recognition they deserve.",
        "background": "Currently the ambulance service is not an emergency service it is classed as an essential service. This is the same as the gas, electricity etc yet retain the 999 status and drive under blue light conditions. The workload is increasing but funding and staff levels falling due to working conditions\r\n",
