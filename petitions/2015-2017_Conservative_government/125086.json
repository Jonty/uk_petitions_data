        "action": "Make having the School Logo on uniforms optional not mandatory.",
        "additional_details": "Some schools insist on the correct uniform complete with school logo being worn or the child is penalised.  As long as the child wears the correct school colours, it shouldn't matter where the uniform is purchased.  Parents struggle with the uniform costs - especially when they have more than one child to buy for.",
        "background": "The rising costs associated with purchasing school uniforms leaves parents massively out of pocket - especially when forced to buy direct from the school.  Having the school logo on increases the price of an item by up to 75% compared to the same coloured uniform without the logo attached.",
