        "action": "The UK to work with other EU-member States to ban overbooking of flights",
        "additional_details": "In my eyes, there is no reasonable justification to this practice: \r\n- Airlines are well aware an aircraft has a finite number of seats. \r\n- Customers have paid for their tickets in advance. \r\n- If a customer decides to cancel a booking, the cost of the ticket is not refunded.\r\n\r\nTherefore, airlines are not covering losses, but rather increasing their profits, while customers bare the stress, loss of income, extra costs and/or ruined holidays.\r\n\r\nEU Legislation is in place, but clearly not enough.",
        "background": "Overbooking a flight is legal and, regardless of current EU Law Compensation Schemes, airlines are still taking advantage of this practice and it is their customers who end up facing the consequences.",
