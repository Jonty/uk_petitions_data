        "additional_details": "According to the British Plastic Federation (BPF) the UK uses 5 million tonnes of plastic per year and estimates that 29% is recovered or recycled. With a recycling target of 57% by 2020 the UK needs to look for ways to reduce its plastic consumption. The UK needs to join with France in banning disposable cups, plates and cutlery to stimulate supply of sustainable plastic alternatives and encourage other countries to follow suit.",
        "background": "Plastic can take 5,000 years to decompose - long after we are dead and forgotten our plastic waste will still be hanging around. UK needs to join France and pass a new law to ensure all plastic cups, cutlery and plates are replaced by compostable and biologically-sourced materials by 2020.",
