        "action": "Improve LGBT education in all schools to help combat homophobia & transphobia.",
        "additional_details": "As I just left secondary school last year, I wasn't taught anything about the LGBT community. The only time anything related to it came up was during a R.E lesson where same-sex marriage was debated; which actually caused a lot more discomfort as ignorant answers were shared. The way to help eradicate hate crime is through education. The UK is a place of equality and diversity and we should be showing that through our education system.",
        "background": "It should be made compulsory for all schools to teach about the LGBT community. At the minute there is just not enough being said about it in schools. Pupils should be taught about this from early on towards secondary school. Gay & lesbian relationships also be included in sex education lessons. ",
