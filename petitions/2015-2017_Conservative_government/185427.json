        "additional_details": "Graham is currently the caretaker, a job in which he is exceeding the standards to an impeccable extent. I think that after a few years of proper education in running a school, Graham could make Sir John Nelthorpe thrive as it once did.",
        "background": "Sir John Nelthorpe is currently an under-achieving Secondary School in Brigg, North Lincolnshire. The current headteacher is adamant on keeping the standards of the school as they were 300 years ago. Graham the caretaker is such a lovely man, and I feel that the school would become a friendly place.",
