        "additional_details": "We need harsher sentences for those who cause death whilst driving on the road, as simply by the death occurring during a vehicle collision the driver at fault can escape simply with a fine. \r\nWhilst other factors such as drug use and mobile phone use are often taken into consideration, the perpetrator can recieve less for a theft in the crown court than you can for causing death by careless driving.\r\n\r\nBeing killed in a car by a driver at fault should be no different than manslaughter. ",
        "background": "Current UK Law means that people who cause death by \"careless\" or \"dangerous\" driving often recieve sentences which are less than theft.\r\n\r\nThe maximum sentence for someone who causes death by careless driving is 5 years in prison, and death by dangerous driving is 14 years; maximums rarely given.
