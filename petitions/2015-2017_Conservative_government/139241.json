        "action": "Block any second EU referendum as it was decided fairly and democratically",
        "additional_details": "As the EU is viewed by millions of people, not just in the UK but Europe and worldwide, as anti-democratic, a second referendum on this issue would undoubtedly be seen the majority and the millions of people who voted democratically for Great Britain come out of the EU, as an anti-democratic motion by the government.",
        "background": "The Brexit result was decided after months of campaigning, by a democratic vote. People went to the polls and exercised their democratic right and voted democratically. There are no grounds for a 2nd, as those marking ballot papers knew beforehand exactly what would happen if it didn't go their way.",
