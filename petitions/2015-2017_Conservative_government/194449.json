Telephoning them is invariably met with indeterminate feedback regarding where one is amidst a mystery process.\r\nAsking for the same forms again is not uncommon.\r\nSpace precludes me from giving elaborate details concerning the inscrutability of this department\r\n\r\nA shake up of this Department is now long overdue in order that the public can have confidence in a system that is universally perceived to be transparent and equitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "\r\n\r\nThere remains a culture of unhelpfulness and evasiveness.\r\nThere is no protocol or service charter from which drivers can be aware of their rights and expectations. \r\nWe need to know how this Department operates. \r\nThe DVLA simply having a Complaints Procedure does not cut the mustard.\r\n\r\n",
