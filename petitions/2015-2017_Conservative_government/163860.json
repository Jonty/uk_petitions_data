If there was more of a proactive police presence within Harworth and Bircotes, crime levels would decrease and there would be a higher percentage of offenders being dealt with by the police or courts. \r\n",
        "background": "Many residents are no longer feeling safe, and are concerned for their safety. Slow or no response to calls regarding criminal activity has appeared to increase criminal activity. More action is needed to make our police force more proactive, rather than reactive.",
