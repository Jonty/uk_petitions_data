The government is proposing a \u2018scale fee\u2019 based on the value of estates:\r\n\r\n\u00a350k - \u00a3300k = \u00a3300 \r\n\u00a3300k - \u00a3500k = \u00a31000\r\n\u00a3500k - \u00a31M = \u00a34000\r\n\u00a31M - \u00a31.6M = \u00a38000\r\n\u00a31.6M - \u00a32M = \u00a312000\r\n\u00a32M+ = \u00a320000\r\n\r\nSome tax payers may feel the proposed fees are unreasonable & unfair.",
