(rainn.org) Consent is the most important part of learning about sexual relationships and should be covered in the syllabus. 85,000 women are raped in England and Wales every year and 400,000 sexually assaulted. Meanwhile, according to the NSPCC, 25% of young women over 13 experience physical violence and and 72% experience emotional abuse in their own relationships.",
        "background": "BBC3 recently aired the show \"Is This Rape? Sex on Trial?\" which showed young people discussing the issue of consent. The show makes it VERY clear that young people need to be educated on consent. For sexual assault to be tackled as an issue we need to be educated!  The time has come to change this!",
