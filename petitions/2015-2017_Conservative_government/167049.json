        "action": "Seek a UN treaty on mutual recognition and enforcement of telephone privacy laws",
        "additional_details": "TPS = Telephone Preference Service\r\nITU = International Telecommunications Union, a UN agency\r\n\r\nTo understand what gave me this idea, see: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-creepiest-phone-call-or-voice-message-youve-ever-received/answer/Peter-Charlot and my (Charles Stuart) comment.\r\n\r\nOfcom recognizes that people outside the EU are beyond their control. I would like a treaty to address this and set up mandatory reciprocal recognition of cold calling laws among ITU member states. ",
        "background": "Despite using the TPS, I have been bombarded with spam telephone calls from India and some other foreign countries. Many of these calls are barely disguised scams. Within the EU there is mutual recognition of such schemes and it works well. This should be extended by treaty to all nations in the ITU",
