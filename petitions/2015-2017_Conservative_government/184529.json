        "action": "Legalise the sale & use of cannabis for people over the age of 25",
        "additional_details": "Studies have shown that continuous recreational use of cannabis coincides with a slight gradual lack of IQ development but only up to the age of 25. Clinical scientific research has also shown conclusively that cannabis has a wide range of health benefits including the ability of the THC molecule to kill some cancers while leaving normal healthy cells unharmed. Criminalising the cure for cancer amounts to genocide. Experienced users know how to use it safely. The government should just back off.",
        "background": "The only reason it's illegal in the UK is because the government says it's bad for your health. They don't seem to mind that drinking & smoking is bad for your health & can actually kill you, unlike cannabis. There is no reason why the government should intervene if over-25's choose to use cannabis.",
