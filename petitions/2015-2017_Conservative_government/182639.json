        "additional_details": "And once a child has used up their allowance of ten days then the councils can look to fine the parents for holidays taken over the ten days. It would have saved the isle of wight council the \u00a313,000 they have just wasted, chasing a \u00a3120 fine, to later be rejected by a high court",
        "background": "Its not always possible for working families to take children on holiday during school holidays, sometimes a family holiday can only be planned during school term, so if all children have a allocated amount of holidays per year to take during school term (10days) 2 weeks it would seem fair.",
