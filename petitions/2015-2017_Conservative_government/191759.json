        "action": "Adapt law so all businesses charge for plastic bags",
        "additional_details": "In one shift (6.5 hrs) I would hand out 100-150 plastic bags for free. More often than not, 2 people are on the till at one time, 2 shifts are run per day, 7 days a week. This amounts to 2,800-4,200 bags handed out per week. Whilst the government have made excellent steps to make large businesses charge for their plastic bags, it is still critical every business participates to care for our environment. People expect to pay for a plastic bag, we now need that final push to reduce our usage. ",
        "background": "UK law doesn't require businesses with less than 250 employees to charge for plastic bags, but can do so voluntarily. Having worked at such a shop, they don't feel obliged to help save the environment if they're not forced to act. A voluntary basis isn't working thus a mandatory basis is required.",
