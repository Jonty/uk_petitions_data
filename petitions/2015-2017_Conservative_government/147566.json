        "action": "Keep the UK in the single market post-Brexit.",
        "additional_details": "The UK should seek to minimise the economic impact of leaving the EU by joining the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). This would still allow us to access the single market, which is the best option for businesses in the UK, most of whom favoured remaining in the EU. Also, by joining the EFTA, we would be excluded from the Common Fisheries Policy and the Common Agriculture Policy, both of which are largely opposed by our fishing and farming industries respectively.\r\n",
        "background": "The 2016 referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union resulted in 51.9% for Leave and 48.1% for Remain. This result should be fully respected. But in order to minimise the economic impact of so-called Brexit, the UK should negotiate to remain in the single market while outside of the EU.",
