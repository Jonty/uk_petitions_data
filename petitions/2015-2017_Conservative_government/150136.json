        "additional_details": "The Leave campaign was very vigorous.  Leavers were highly motivated and would have voted if humanly possible.  Postal votes were available.  Therefore most of the non-voters were unlikely to be Leavers.  When people do not vote for a specific change, they are normally presumed to accept the status quo.  This change would be detrimental to Britain.  As Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain, it may also in the future lead to the break up of the United Kingdom if leaving is pushed through.",
        "background": "Only 38% of the electorate voted to leave.  We would not declare war nor bring back capital punishment at the request of 38% of the electorate.  This critical change for Britain must have the support of a majority of the electorate.  2 of the 4 countries voted to stay.  There is no mandate to leave.",
