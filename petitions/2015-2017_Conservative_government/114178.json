        "additional_details": "Through all current Firearms legislation there is use of the word \"weapon\". If a weapon is any item used for the purpose of visiting injury upon another then, surely, to employ an \"Air Weapon\" as a weapon would contravene current legislation.  Some may argue that guns were designed specifically to be weapons.  This is true but so were the javelin, the discus and the shot.Sports departments, in schools, don't store these in a \"Weapons Store\" though.  Our shooting club uses firearms not weapons.",
        "background": "The word \"Weapon\" is used to describe many things but usually means any item which is employed in the execution of visiting injury upon another.  The Scottish Government intend to introduce the licensing airguns and intends to call it an \"Air weapons certificate\".",
