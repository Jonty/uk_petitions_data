        "additional_details": "During crucial brexit talks, it is not in the majority of the publics interest to have Conservatives setting the terms for the future of the UK. If we work together in lobbying the government, a new general election can be called, and proper democracy can prevail. The Conservatives are already systematically destroying our public services, and are imposing austerity on millions of hard working people, whilst cutting taxes for the rich! Cuts to disability benefits, UK trade unions restricted, etc",
        "background": "The Conservatives used national campaigning funds to illegally boost local campaigning. This meant that they potentially won the overall election by \"boosting\" in 29 marginal seats in the South West, the Midlands and the North of England. A \u00a370K fine is not enough of a deterrent, we want democracy!",
