        "additional_details": "Our 7 year old son is having assessments at CAMHS. He is a loving little boy whose emotional and social struggles affect him in everyday life, particularly the school environment. He would now be offered a 6 week educational placement at Adcote house to further assess his needs and get him the support he deserves. Frustratingly, he along with so many other children aren't getting their needs met due to government cut backs. Please help reopen a lifeline for families in already difficult times.",

Due to government cut backs the unit is closed and many children including our 7 year old son who would be offered a placement aren't getting their needs met. ",
