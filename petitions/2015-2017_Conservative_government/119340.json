        "additional_details": "http://www.noo.org.uk/NOO_about_obesity/measurement\r\nThe chart diagnosed my healthy 4 year old son as obese. The same chart lead to my anorexia 23 years ago which saw my weight plummet to less than 4 stone. We need to find another method or risk the self esteem of thousands of our children unnecessarily. As an opt out scheme, not all children are even included in the statistics, so those that need the help the most may be excluded anyway. It is a poor, outdated use of government resources. ",
        "background": "This system doesn't help the UK's obesity problem it just serves to misdiagnose and confuse, often destroying self esteem in the process. It doesn't take into account bone density, muscle mass, water or fat we carry.\r\nWe need to be looking at the individual and the whole picture, not just weight.",
