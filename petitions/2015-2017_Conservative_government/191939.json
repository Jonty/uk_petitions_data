        "additional_details": "The cost of Healthcare, Education and Welfare equates to \u00a399 per week for every living person so a family of 4 immigrants (including a home) costs us in the region of \u00a3600 per week for a man to do a job that others will not do whilst at the same time we pay capable men large sums of money to stay at home and do nothing. Is it surprising we are facing bankruptcy? Please see my website www.mrms.uk for many more alarming facts about the way Government is running our Country.",
        "background": "We are facing bankruptcy because Gov overspent Tax Revenue \u00a3534 ml every single day during 2005-15 (\u00a3624 ml 15-16) but we are allowing thousands of immigrants into our Country each week all of whom want at our expense somewhere to live, healthcare, education for their children and money to live on.",
