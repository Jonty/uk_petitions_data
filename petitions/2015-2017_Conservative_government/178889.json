        "action": "Include School Transport to salary sacrifice schemes to enable tax/NI savings",
        "additional_details": "The government currently funds school transport for children attending their nearest school, for many families the nearest school is not the best option so they choose to self-fund transport and send their child to another school. For parents making this decision they are generating \u00a31000s in cost savings to local councils as the council no longer has the financial obligation to provide transport. We ask the government to support working families with this simple change.",
        "background": "Many working parents are facing high costs for self funding school transport. For some families this can be \u00a31000s each year. We would like school transport vouchers to be included in the government salary sacrifice schemes in the same way that childcare vouchers and cycle to work schemes are.  ",
