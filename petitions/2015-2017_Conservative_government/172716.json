        "action": "Include all domestic pets to the Road Traffic Act 1988",
        "additional_details": "A working animal, usually domesticated, is kept by humans and trained to perform tasks which tends to give them a special status within the law. Today there are a wide range of domestic animals kept in the UK who deserve to be included in the act. For example, today Cats are successfully used as companions for the sick and disabled in care programs. They have served in the agricultural sector and in the military over many years. The Act must be updated to reflect these modern relationships.",
        "background": "The Road Traffic Act 1988 states drivers must report incidents involving horse, cattle, ass, mule, sheep, pigs, goats and dogs. This was sufficient for these working animals at the time the legislation was set. In contemporary times, the government should add domestic companions to this list. ",
