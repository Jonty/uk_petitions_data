        "additional_details": "I believe all PPI should be refunded  to everyone who has acquired it under false pretences, whether missed time scales,miss selling,or just anyone whom is not sure whether they have a claim or not sure about doing a claim. There must be thousands of people still owed money from these banks and this is there hard earned money,which belongs to them and not the banks. There are some crazy rules about PPI but this is the publics money what ever the rules. I do have records regarding my issues and the FOS has my details.",
        "background": "I personally made the mistake of using a third party to re-claim PPI, I then mis-understood the time scale deadline because the claims company I used were not very helpful. The FOS later informed myself I would of had a case for full refund if I had claimed within the time scale. ",
