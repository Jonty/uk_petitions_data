The final terms should only be considered passed if voted for by a super-majority (66%) in parliament. Each constituent nation's administration shall have a veto over the terms.",
        "background": "The UK has just voted to leave the EU and after Article 50 is triggered we will have to negotiate the terms of our disengagement within two years. Our current government gained a parliamentary majority with just 37% of the vote. It does not have a mandate to carry out these negotiations on its own.",
