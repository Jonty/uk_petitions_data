        "action": "In light of the EU referendum, I call for a general election to be held.",
        "additional_details": "I am writing this within 48hrs of the news of the result of the EU referendum and within that time the political advocates for leaving the EU have already backed out of several promises. This leads me to a vote of no confidence in these people who will now be in line to replace David Cameron. Voters did not elect Boris Johnson to run the country just like they didn't vote for Gordon Brown during the last Labour government. ",
        "background": "With UK public choosing to leave the EU and the resignation of David Cameron, I would call that a general election be held in order for the public to elect a new prime minister to lead the country through this time of transition and not for the Conservatives to elect an individual on our behalf.",
