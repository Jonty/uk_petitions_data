        "additional_details": "Over the years there have been a number of newspaper articles chronicling the poor wages on offer to care workers. Such as in the Independent, guardian & on the bbc websites.\r\nBy paying a more realistic and professional hourly rate:\r\n- The industry can and will attract better quality carers who will feel valued and see the job as a profession.\r\n- Those being cared for will be getting the best carers. \r\n- It would help reduce the number of families claiming Tax credits, to supplement their income.",
        "background": "I'm shocked and appalled at the hourly rate of pay offered by care homes. Most start at the current minimum wage of \u00a37.20phr, it's known some pay as little as \u00a35.00phr. The work is incredibly demanding mentally, physically and emotionally, & one which vulnerable adults rely entirely on their carers.",
