        "action": "Remove Arlene Foster from the position of First Minister of Northern Ireland.",
        "additional_details": "The current position of NI as a state that is part of both the EU and the UK is one that is crucial to its economic and cultural development. The majority of NI voted to remain a part of the EU, but because of its position in the UK, it is unable to have its will carried out. Post-referendum, Foster has continued to demonstrate her support for Brexit. She has put party politics ahead of her responsibility as First Minister to represent and to serve all of the people of NI.",
        "background": "Arlene Foster has refused to acknowledge the will of the people of Northern Ireland by ignoring the 55.8% who voted to remain a part of the European Union. This shows her contempt for the diverse society within which she lives and deliberate negligence that is not compatible with her role.",
