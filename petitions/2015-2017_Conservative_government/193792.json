If the age for free childcare was lowered I would be able to work more hours and provide a better life for my family. I don't feel like working parents get enough support. Parents who choose not to work just for the simple fact that they don't want to shouldn't be given free child care from the age of 2 when they are able to take care of their children themselves. It should be same rules for everyone ",

I feel it is unfair that 2 year olds only get free childcare if their parents are on income support and other benefits! People who work should get the extra childcare support ",
