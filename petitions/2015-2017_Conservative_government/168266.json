        "action": "Make it compulsory for schools with social media accounts to be set to private.",
        "additional_details": "A public twitter account allows anyone to access details of what school a child goes to, their name and also what they look like. The pictures can be saved by any person who wishes. The terrifying thing is that an individual doesn't even have to have a Twitter account themselves to access a public account. The school my children attend are refusing to make the account private as there is nothing to say they have to. I want it to be made compulsory for all schools with social media accounts to have them set to private.",
        "background": "The primary school my children attend has a public Twitter profile that they post photos of the children on. 3 explicit Twitter profiles have retweeted and liked a photo of my child. It was brought to my attention that the school profile is public and it is not compulsory to have it set to private.",
