        "additional_details": "I am a singer and left my van secure in a carpark with cameras last December in Coventry. I only had phone and email support from West Midlands Police. Nobody came to take fingerprints. The manager told me about the jiggler keys being used by local thieves. I am shocked that they keys can be purchased by literally anybody. No wonder theft is on the rise! I have suffered emotionally and financially thanks to Amazon and Aviva Insurance who do not support victims of these type of crimes.",
        "background": "I was a victim of van theft where the thief had used jiggler keys to enter smoothly without a trace. I was shocked to find that these key sets are easy to buy on Amazon without any checks/regulations. As no obvious 'force' was used and police did not come out to assist and Aviva refused my claim.",
