        "additional_details": "While road accidents involving young people have decreased at a steady rate since 2000, Insurance premiums keep rising at a much faster rate than inflation and earnings. 4/5 of serious accidents DO NOT even involve young drivers yet we are blamed by insurers. I admit, there are some really bad young drivers, but we shouldn't be punished as a collective for the foolishness of few. We recommend to the Government to CAP PREMIUM INCREASES TO STAY IN LINE WITH INFLATION AND REMOVE  INSUR. PREM. TAX.",
        "background": "Young drivers are forced to pay premiums of \u00a32,013(average) with many paying around \u00a35,000 compared to 61 year olds drivers which only pay \u00a3418 a year on average. The situation is ridiculous and HM Government has to act now to stop this, greed driven, injustice young drivers face. ",
