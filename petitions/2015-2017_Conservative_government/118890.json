        "additional_details": "In Nottingham there is high crime rate. Lots of  immigrants are coming and it's putting too much pressure on the Local government, the police and health sector (NHS). \r\nIf immigrants are given amnesty there will be able to provide for their families, go to work and increase economic growth. \r\nImmigrants having the right to live in England reduces domestic violence,mental health,crime,bullying,loneliness and improves the wellbeing of citizens. \r\nImmigrants lives matter and it's important to change  ",
        "background": "I would like the United Kingdom Government to give amnesty to all immigrants regardless of where there are coming from as long there have been in United Kingdom for 5yrs. \r\nThis will lower pressure in Local governments and decrease crime rate. ",
