        "action": "Provide accessible mental health services for 18-30 year olds",
        "additional_details": "As a result of not having a specialist young adults' service, young adults have been left to fend for themselves in a system that doesn't understand them; fighting to be recognised in hospitals which want to care for the middle-aged and elderly; less able to care for themselves due to a lack of proper support; and less likely to seek help with their mental health in the first place.\r\n\r\nWe ask you to consider putting some of the limited mental health funding towards a service for 18-30 year olds. ",
        "background": "Adult mental health services tend to cater for the middle-aged and the elderly in our society, not for the young adults who have just come out of CAMHS. Young adults who enter the services are faced with the battle to be properly supported, as the services are not suited to their specific needs.",
