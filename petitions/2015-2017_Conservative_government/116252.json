        "additional_details": "Many times in supermarkets people have parked in a parent and child space with no blue badge displayed and nothing is ever done. Never have i seen anybody get reprimanded for doing this and its public knowledge that nothing gets done about it. What is the point of having a specific space for a parent and child if anyone can park there with no repercussion? A disability space is gaurded and most people wouldn't think to park there for fear of a fine, why is a parent and child space not the same?",
        "background": "As a parent of small children it is very frustraiting seeing some members of the public parking in a parent and child space without a care in the world. It can ve very difficult parking in a tight space and being able to correctly strap a child into a carseat to prevent injury in an accident. ",
