        "additional_details": "Vegetarian & Vegan lifestyles are becoming more common and therefore the need for greater labelling of foods is of huge importance. When choosing a product people need to spend time looking at manufacturer's websites to find out whether the product is Vegetarian or Vegan, this can be tricky to find and is not always available. \r\nMany foods such as cheese, sweets & alcohol often have animal products in and labelling is not always clear. Vegetarian & Vegan logo's also vary adding to the confusion. ",
        "background": "The terms \u2018vegetarian\u2019 and \u2018vegan\u2019 in food labelling are used voluntarily by the industry. There is no standard labelling procedure with different supermarkets and companies using various labels or none at all. This is confusing and causes worrying as people don't always know what is in their food.",
