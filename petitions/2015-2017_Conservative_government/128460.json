Anonymous profiteers acquiring tickets and reselling them at huge mark-ups are distorting what should be a free and transparent marketplace.",

We demand the Government enforces last year\u2019s ticket resale amendment to the Consumer Rights Act, and also requires ticket resellers to reveal their identities. ",
