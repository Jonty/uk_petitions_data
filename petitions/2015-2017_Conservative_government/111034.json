        "action": "Reconsider the system for charities reclaiming VAT on volunteer expenses",
        "additional_details": "With the experience of charities and HMRC over these claims a flat rate percentage reclaim of VAT could easily be determined. Allowing even a conservative percentage would allow the charities to save considerable admin time and resources, and both charities and volunteers could save a considerable amount on having to post in these VAT receipts. This case was put to David Gauke MP, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, but his reply revealed an unwillingness to even consider alternatives.\r\n",
        "background": "Charities who pay volunteers travel expenses can claim back the VAT on those expenses, but to do so they have to go through a wasteful and time consuming exercise of collecting VAT receipts to support that claim. It would save the charities a lot of donated money if the system could be simplified. ",
