        "additional_details": "There is an abundance of bookies now, each with machines bringing problem gambling to a younger age.\r\n\r\nThey are limited to \u00a350 a roulette spin, which takes around 10 seconds to complete.\r\n\r\nProblem gamblers can spin many times a minute and even lose their wages or benefits.\r\n\r\nAt the moment self exclusion is optional, and a problem gambler would have to ring every betting site and attend every branch to be voluntarily banned, this is a lot of hassle. There should be 1 central point for self exclusion",
        "background": "Problem gambling in the UK is reaching a level which is out of control.\r\nThe blame for this lies at the door of the bookmakers and gambling sites, and their continued and expanding presence and advertising.\r\nThey are mostly no longer UK based which means they pay very little tax but devastate lives",
