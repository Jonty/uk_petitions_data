        "additional_details": "Being an Autoimmune Disease, IBD affects almost every part of your body. Many require a bag after surgery, so quick & easy access to a bathroom is a must have, which is difficult when finding a place to park. I have Crohns Disease, and often I require a bathroom at short notice, or struggle to walk far because I am using crutches. Being entitled to receive a blue badge when you have IBD is so important to help us maintain our dignity from an illness which so often causes pain and embarrassment.",
        "background": "People with Inflammatory Bowel Disease often refer to it as an 'Invisible Illness', as you cannot always see how much we are affected and it strikes everyone so differently in unpredictable ways. Often, we need quick and discreet access to a bathroom in order to avoid an embarrassing accident. ",
