        "action": "Make it mandatory for domestic cats in the UK to be microchipped.",
        "additional_details": "Too many people are not reunited with their cats due to microchipping not being mandatory.  Even if the worst happens, if chipped and the details kept up to date, the owner can get closure.  There have been cases of chipped cats being reunited months, even 7 years later in one case in Sheffield.  You may think that responsible owners would chip anyway - many don't understand how chipping works.  Making this mandatory will reduce the number of strays being euthanised due to lack of rescue spaces.",
        "background": "Thousands of pet cats go missing every year, some are killed on roads, some by people who don't like cats, some get trapped in vehicles and transported hundreds of miles away from home.  Whilst it is becoming law for all dogs to be chipped, it should be the same for cats, to identify ownership.",
