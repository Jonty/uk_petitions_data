        "additional_details": "Evidence of this is all around us. Videos online, news of suicides, parents taking children out of school for there own safety. Bullying will never end but we can start by givingharsher punishment for the bullies at school. They bully because they can get away with it. What's shocking is they have power to discipline bullies inside and outside of school, so why is bullying getting worse. A paragraph on what they think they've done wrong is not enough, detention with cleaning up at lunch time.",
        "background": "Schools have a bullying policy but don't seem to act upon them very well. Or when it comes to trying to sort out a situation they only get the bullies to say sorry or write a few lines.Leading to nothing getting resolved and the bulling getting worse.They need harsher punishment like litter picking.",
