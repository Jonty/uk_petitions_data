        "additional_details": "There is currently a live petition for a second referendum and the requirement for a majority of at least 60% before a leave vote can be accepted. The option to vote for leave or remain was open to the whole electorate and the referendum was executed fairly and in accordance with law.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned feel that democracy was served on 23rd June 2016 and that the results of the vote to leave the EU were clear and indisputable. The concept of a need for a 60% majority to vote leave before   an exit can be considered is undemocratic and unfair.",
