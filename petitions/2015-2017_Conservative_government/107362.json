        "action": "Allow for a disvote on Parliamentary petitions.",
        "additional_details": "Allowing for this is a far fairer option than creating another petition disagreeing to a particular petition. If a petition has 150, 000 signatures, this is a significant amount of people agreeing to the petition, but this petition may of been viewed by 400, 000 people. So that leaves 250, 000 people who have not signed the petition. A great number of these may of disagreed with the petition. So the option to disagree should be implemented as soon as possible.",
        "background": "When petitions are started there is only the option to sign & agree to it. Allowing for a disvote button or the ability to disagree to a petition should be apart of these petitions. Allowing this would show the contrast between who agrees to a petition and how many disagree.",
