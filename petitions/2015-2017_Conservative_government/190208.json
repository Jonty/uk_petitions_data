It is paramount that the moral of our troop is kept up whilst they are protecting us and if that means we spend \u00a31million a year on them being able to hear from their loved ones and are able to tell their partners, parents, friends and children that they are safe then the Bluey cannot be lost.",

It has been decided that blueys will be stopped to save \u00a31million a year however they're not thinking about the moral of our troops fighting on the front line.
