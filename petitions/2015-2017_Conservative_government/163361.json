        "additional_details": "The DDA 1991 as a whole is hugely flawed piece of legislation. Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) punishes responsible owners, gives the public a false sense of security and does nothing to hold irresponsible 'owners' or breeders to account. \r\nThousands of innocent,healthy and friendly dogs are destroyed under this legislation. In a country that is known as a nation of animal lovers, this is wrong. \r\n\r\nBattersea report: http://www.bdch.org.uk/files/Dog-bites-whats-breed-got-to-do-with-it.pdf\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "A dog classed as pitbull/pitbull type (based on looks and measurements alone) cannot be rehomed if found straying - it must be euthanised under the DDA 1991 S1. This is cruel and has not reduced dog bites in the past 25 years; the DDA kills innocent dogs, and does nothing for public safety. \r\n",
