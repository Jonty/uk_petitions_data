        "action": "Remove Mark Carney as Governor of the Bank of England.",
        "additional_details": "Mr. Carney recently made comments to the press including hinting at a \"recession\" and a \"run on the pound\" in the event of a vote to leave the EU.  He, more than anyone, should be aware of the inevitable reaction of the currency markets to words uttered by a central banker.\r\n\r\nHe is therefore \"unfit to discharge his functions\" and government should pursue his removal from office.\r\n",
        "background": "According to www.parliament.co.uk:\r\n\r\n\"The Court may, with the consent of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, remove a person from office as Governor, Deputy Governor or director of the Bank if it is satisfied that he......or that he is unable or UNFIT TO DISCHARGE HIS FUNCTIONS as a member.\"\r\n",
