        "additional_details": "I personally run a large dance school with a huge monthly rent for leased studios and hired local halls. The studios are dormant during the day so I rely on an earlier start as possible - which currently means 4pm (and all day Saturday). But it's not just my business it would affect - but associated business - the local halls would get less business; the cafeteria at the leisure centre where my studios are based, would get less custom; dance wear shops would get less custom......",
        "background": "If school hours are extended, it would impact privately run after school clubs greatly.  Schools/Clubs for dance/music/sport/brownies/cubs etc have been established to fit around school hours - it would not only effect business owners financially, but also associated areas such as local hall hire",
