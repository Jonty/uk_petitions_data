        "additional_details": "It is well understood already that Scottish MPs are able to vote on matters that affect only England and Wales, yet can exercise their rights as a separate devolved parliament to overturn or amend legislation which affects Scotland on many issues. This is unacceptable to many non-Scottish UK residents and is allowing the SNP and Scottish parliament to exert influence which is out of proportion to its size and relevance within the UK. This power needs to be diminished.   ",
        "background": "The outcome of the 2016 EU referendum has once again brought into focus how Scotland are potentially able to interfere in matters which affect England and Wales. Of particular note is the thinly veiled threat made by Nicola Sturgeon to exercise a veto to prevent the UK from leaving the EU. ",
