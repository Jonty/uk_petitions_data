        "additional_details": "We were told that the break up of the Union was project fear. Nothing is more sacred and should it come to pass we should do everything we can to try and stop it.\r\nIf the wider country decides to put its love of the Union ahead of its fear of Europe then we can pull together to make the changes we want to see.\r\nThe real danger here is that Europe is now on a path to evolve into exactly the kind of organisation we think it should be, and sadly we may break our union for nothing.",
        "background": "Should Scotland vote to leave the UK based on what they see as the Brexit deal on offer, then the wider UK should have the opportunity to review those same facts alongside the result of Scotland's intention, and ask ourselves if this is a price worth paying. \r\nScotland should be asked to think again",
