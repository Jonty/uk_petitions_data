Being quoted \u00a33000 on a car that's worth \u00a3500 is ridiculous. I think limits should be put in place on the most insurance companies can charge young drivers for car insurance. Young drivers just can't afford the prices that some insurance companies are asking!",
        "background": "insurance companies charge extortionate prices for young drivers up until around their mid 20s! I think parliament should think about setting a limit on the highest price companies can charge a young driver, E.g. \u00a32000 ",
