        "action": "Ban HGV's from overtaking on motorways and main 'A' roads during peak traffic.",
        "additional_details": "I propose that during peak times HGV's should be banned from overtaking. Also vehicles that can't reach a minimum speed of 52 mph should be banned from using motorways and main 'A' roads during this time, to reduce the need for HGV's to overtake. If the flow of traffic can increase then this will reduce commuting time, and increase commuting distance there fore benefiting the whole country. Living and working further apart will be more achievable.",
        "background": "To often during peak traffic HGV's are over taking, there by constricting two or all lanes to 50 mph whilst the limit is 70 mph.  This then causes small vehicle drivers to hog the outside lane in anticipation.  All of this amounts to poor traffic flow over all.",
