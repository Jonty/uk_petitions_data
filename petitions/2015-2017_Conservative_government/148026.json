        "additional_details": "David Cameron will not trigger Article 50, leaving this decision to his successor. Given the possibility that there will not be a general election before the decision is taken, and the controversial nature of the outcome of the EU referendum, an article 50 referendum would allow the electorate to express their final opinion based on a fuller understanding of the implications, and on any new information (See John Henley in the Guardian - background: http://gu.com/p/4myk5?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other )",
        "background": "For the UK to leave the EU, article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty must be invoked in order to give 2 years formal notice of the UK's exit. An article 50 referendum gives the electorate the choice whether to formally split from the EU or not on the basis of any new information emerging since the referendum",
