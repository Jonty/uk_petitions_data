        "action": "We demand a referendum for Welsh Independence from the U.K. and E.U.",
        "additional_details": "We are mindful of the fact that Independence is actively being sought in Scotland, who did sign an Act of Union with England, and is also being debated in the case of England, we therefore feel strongly that Wales has also the just right to demand back our Independence and Sovereignty as a nation. We are aware that Plaid Cymru is pursuing a campaign for 'Independence within Europe' but, our aim is for this petition to clarify the need for Wales to have Independence from both U.K. and the E.U.",
        "background": "Wales has been under English rule since 1536 and its no less a need and a priority for our nation to regain its Independence as England very recently has from the European Union, bearing in mind that the Welsh people were never given the vote for the 1536 Act of Union/Annexation imposed on them.",
