        "additional_details": "In fact the economy will suffer sharply as lack of access to a 600 million people market locks in and financial institutions re-locate from London - these actions alone were hardly discussed in the referendum but are crucial for future UK growth.  There are also defence issues that need to be raised especially as the unreliable Trump rarely keeps his promises even if he can remember them.  If Scotland and Northern Ireland leave the UK as seems likely and London is ruined, what is left?  The UK is a responsible country with caring and aware citizens and they deserve to be represented by well-founded arguments from the UK Parliament.",
        "background": "Leaving the EU will be an economic, social, financial and political disaster for the UK.  People who voted leave on June 26th were lied to by the key 'leave' proponents especially the red bus stating UK would have its NHS funded by saving EU dues.  ",
