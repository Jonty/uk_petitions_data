        "additional_details": "It seems ridiculous to construct a new rail line only halfway up the UK, which will mainly benefit London. Also doing this whilst charging a ridiculous amount to all UK taxpayers most of whom will not benefit or even use it. What is the point in building an already outdated line which most European countries have already built and where there is research into new, cheaper and better lines such as the hyper loop.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The government is planning to spend \u00a356 billion on the construction of a new rail line. 100% of tax payers are funding this, however only 1% will be able to afford to use the new trainline when you take into account the cost of the construction and the limited amounts of stops.",
