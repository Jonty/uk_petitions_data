        "additional_details": "The conflict in Syria is escalating, and there have been a number of disturbing events that are stressing tensions between the UK and other global superpowers, including Russia.\r\n\r\nThe latest of these is the combination of the increasing deployment of air to air combat fighters from both Russian and US air forces to the region, along with an increased preparation for a \"defensive\" nuclear first strike against Russia, prompting a similar response from that nation.",
        "background": "With continued military escalation in Syria, the UK is becoming increasingly exposed to becoming involved in a drawn out global war that could see the UK mainland targeted by nuclear weapons. We need to de-escalate the conflict by withdrawing our own forces and urging other nations to do the same.",
