        "additional_details": "Section 2 of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011 gives two ways for a snap election to be held. One is for the House of Commons to declare no confidence in the government, and the other is for a 2/3 majority of MPs to vote for an early election. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, a motion of no confidence can be triggered based on a vote over a major issue on which the government fought the last general election. There are many areas where the government has failed to deliver on official election campaign promises.",
        "background": "Falling living standards. Welfare cuts and sanctions harming the vulnerable. Rising national debt. Growing NHS closures, waiting times and fund wasting. Immigration and tax avoidance inadequately addressed.\r\nThe people have no confidence in the government. We ask the House of Commons to follow suit.",
