        "additional_details": "There are many reports about it in the newspapers but if you do not know anyone stuck in a cult church personally you will dismiss it. PLEASE read up about it if you havnt heard of them to open your mind on the evil doings of these churches..it may save your children or family members lives! A lot of these churches end up killing children in the belief that they are 'evil' and they take their sweet childhood away from them by brainwasing them and the parents to believe everything is evil. ",
        "background": "Cult churches are not heard of but they are very dangerous and ruining innocent children's lives all over the world. In the UK there are said to be around 1,000 of them operating! The people that run cult churches impose to be men/women of God but in return brainwash members for power and money. ",
