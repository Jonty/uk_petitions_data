        "action": "Make patent infringement a criminal offence in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Innovators who develop products look to protect such technology.  Enjoying rewards from inspiration made real are huge motivators. However, it is true to say, \"patents are not worth the paper they are written on if not policed\".  Unauthorised patent use is crushing for those who lack means. Business know this and take comfort at little or no penalty for their actions.  Our world is built on ideas, so why do we not protect the innovators? Steal the idea, steals the motivation and steals growth.",
        "background": "Patent infringement is commonplace. Personally and according to the Intellectual Property's Office's opinion I have experienced this directly.  However, as individual or small business trying to stop such trespass the cost is prohibitive as the penalties for unauthorised IPR's use is insufficient. ",
