        "additional_details": "As trump has told the truth about radicalised areas in Britain which has been confirmed by senior police officers I think it's only fair that both petitions should be put forward for debate on weather trump should be banned and Cameron should resign as it would be bias to reject one and not the other and if the government continue to be bias then it should be disbanded for the future of British nationalist as they are biased and a threat to the British people ",
        "background": "As a petition was sign by over 600,000 people for Cameron to resign but was rejected it would be classed as a bias move from the government to ban trump but not sack Cameron as trump has been more honest than Cameron has and allowed hate preachers to stay in the UK ",
