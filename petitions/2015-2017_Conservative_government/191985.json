        "action": "Grant the spouses of British citizens the Right to Abode in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The plight of Irene Clennell highlights the issues with a bureaucratic, target driven immigration system that does not respect the right to a family life. This impinges the rights of British citizens to marry freely and live without interference from the state with their partner. British citizens who marry foreign nationals are subject to excessive requirements simply to be granted the right to live freely with their partner in the UK. See also the cases of Sam Schwarzkopf and Monique Hawkins.",
        "background": "The current system of immigration for the spouses of British citizens is inappropriate, creates extra burden on immigration services and infringes the rights of British citizens who wish to marry foreign nationals. Spouses should be granted the Right to Abode rather than Indefinite Leave to Remain.",
