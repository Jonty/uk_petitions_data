        "action": "Allow orphans to inherit from parents without being subject to inheritance tax.",
        "additional_details": "It seems fundamentally wrong that helpless, resourceless orphans are treated less well than bereaved spouses/partners.  It is not the mark of a civilized society that the inheritance of a vulnerable, hapless orphan should be raided for tax.  Such a situation also leads dying single parents to enter into contrived marriages or other schemes just to shelter the assets of the estate; and sometimes that situation can go drastically wrong.  Surely the UKs orphans ought to be treated better!",
        "background": "Currently if you are a single parent and die leaving minor kids, they can only inherit up to \u00a3325,000 and anything more than that is taxed at 40%.  In contrast, anything that you leave to a spouse/civil partner is inherited tax free, even if s/he is earning well and/or has sufficient own resources.",
