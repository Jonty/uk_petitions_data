        "action": "Vote of NO confidence in David Cameron over the handling of the EU referendum.",
        "additional_details": "Cameron said in his manifesto that he will reduce migration to tens of thousands by controlling EU migration but the only thing he came back with was a delay on in work benefits which will not reduce the pull factor at all from the Eastern bloc countries with our wages being 10 times higher than theirs, housing, NHS education. He is a traitor to Britain.",
        "background": "Cameron has not lived up to his manifesto and should be advocating LEAVE, which he is not. He is withholding EU information from ministers that are not on his side, so it will not be a fair vote. He is a puppet to the European Union and not loyal to his own country.",
