The MoD spend over \u00a3200,000 a year asking why morale is so bad, start listening to the important things or spend 10 times more on recruiting.  ",

This is a significant saving and although savings should be made where possible, this is a short sighted cut at the heart of deployed troops morale. There are few things that can lift the morale more than a letter from home.",
