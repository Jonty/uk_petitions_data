        "additional_details": "People over the age of 60 should be means tested before giving free medication. England is in massive debt and they could easily crawl back some money by making them pay, people on a state pension should be made to pay a minimum of a pound and the highest earners on private pensions should be paying a higher rate. I believe this is a equal right as a young adult trying to get by.",
        "background": "Im a hard working 23 year old living in the east midlands and trying to get by and paying bills and i was outraged to find myself paying \u00a38.60 for a prescription at the local chemist, when the elderly get their prescriptions free. Which should be means tested. Or even make them pay a pound.",
