        "action": "Article 50 should be postponed until we have a general election",
        "additional_details": "If we simply call another referendum, we risk yet another indecisive result. This is even more likely if we increase the required threshold for Leave as some have suggested. If we require 60% for Leave and they \"lose\" a followup referendum by 59%, it's hard to imagine Leave voters would accept the result.\r\n\r\nThere's an existing process for deciding the direction our country takes: a general election. We call on all parties to clearly state whether they will trigger article 50 if voted into power.",
        "background": "The Leave side won the EU referendum, but the result has not proved decisive. The outgoing PM has not triggered article 50, the Leave campaign leaders have not called for article 50, and many have signed a petition calling for another referendum. Uncertainty over our future is damaging our economy.",
