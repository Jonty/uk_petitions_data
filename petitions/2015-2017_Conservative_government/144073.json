        "additional_details": "We live in a democracy in this country. Everyone had their right to vote. Most of the electorate weren't able to vote to join the EU, but we were given a choice to remain, but we voted to leave. We must ignore these people who claim it's unfair that the vote to leave should be by an even bigger majority. The wishes of the general public must be allowed to stand. The petition for a 2nd referendum to now \"implement a rule\" based on percentages and turnout is now irrelevant. We've already voted.",
        "background": "Great Britain has had a democratic vote to leave the EU. The leave campaign won by majority of over 1 million people. Only 3 out of 12 regions voted to leave. Only 16.1 million people of the 46.5 million of the electorate voted to remain in the EU. We must ignore the petition for a 2nd referendum. ",
