        "additional_details": "This petition strongly believes that in order to develop the next generation of cricket stars, youngsters need to be able to easily and readily see cricketing heroes, performing at the highest cricket level. It is one of our national sports and the entire nation should be able to watch the main summer test match series.\r\n\r\nThis is one test series a year on free to air television. So this petition feels that this is a fair demand. \r\n",
        "background": "This petition is for a ruling, that the main test cricket series of the summer in England or Wales be shown on free to air television. As are The FA Cup, The Six Nations and The Grand National; with a protected, permanent free to air broadcasting status.",
