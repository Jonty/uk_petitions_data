        "additional_details": "At a BMA conference in 2014 the BMA supported a policy recommending 'a minimum expected period of six weeks\u2019 notice of any new rota, particularly when rotating to a new post' http://web2.bma.org.uk/policyjuniors\r\nWe want to be treated fairly. Being given a new rota at short notice is not only disruptive it is demoralising. It prevents any forward planning in our personal lives due to the possibility of being rostered on call. This is incredibly frustrating and can be avoided with better planning.",
        "background": "Most hospital trusts advise doctors give a minimum of six weeks notice when applying for leave of any type. Doctors should be given a rota outlining their duties for their next post with similar notice. Frequently rotas are not available until a day before a post commences. This is not acceptable",
