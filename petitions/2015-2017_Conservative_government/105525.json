        "additional_details": "All of these hunts claim to work within the exemptions of the act, by their own admission, so its simply not possible for them to follow a drag as its not what their hounds are trained to do. Our Forests should be places where the wild life flourishes, gets conserved and protected. Please can you sign this petition to ask the Forestry commission to put conservation above minority blood sports.",
        "background": "please look at the forestry commission web site and notice that the people that run our public forests are giving \"drag hunting licences\" to hunts in England.http://www.forestry.gov.uk/foi",
