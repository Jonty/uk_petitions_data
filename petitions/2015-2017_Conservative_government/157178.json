        "additional_details": "Further, the Government will need to adopt policies never envisaged and not put before the electorate before. Having voted to leave the EU the electorate now requires the opportunity to decide the future relationship with the EU and on what basis this negotiation takes place given the various, differing models proposed.\r\nThe importance to the short and long term future of the UK is such that a democratic opportunity should be provided to make a full and informed decision based on that debate.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Following the Referendum to leave the EU, the full negotiating period allowed to determine the future of the UK will expire before the end of the current Parliament thereby failing to provide voters an opportunity to express a preference as to what future relationship will be adopted with the EU.",
