        "action": "Increase payment for Early Years Education Funding",
        "additional_details": "We have to have a certain amount of staff per group of children who all need to be paid at least the minimum wage. We are self funded. Incoming money funds staff costs, rent, phone, equipment & resources, HMRC, Ofsted, insurances, food etc. Cash flow forecasts shows we will not be able to sustain provision in the near future if funding is not increased, leaving children without a place and parents without childcare & staff without an income.",
        "background": "As a self funded Pre School and with the rising wage costs along with upcoming work pensions we along with many other pre schools are finding sustainably impossible. Funding that we rely on has not increased to cover these costs. We fear closure leading to no places for children in the future.",
