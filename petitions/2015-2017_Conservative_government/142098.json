He was asked for a yes/no answer but did not give one. If he was so confident in this matter that he felt he could state they would not joing until the year 3000 this should have been a simple, sharp yes. Instead he avioded an answer. I believe politics would be far more open to the people if direct answers were provided. ",
        "background": "When politicians are asked direct questions, capable of being answered with a yes/no or when specifically asked by their questioner for a yes/no answer, one is not given. They merely avoid it by padding the question with basic information formulated to look like a response. This must stop. Now! ",
