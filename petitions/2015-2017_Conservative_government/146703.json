Nigel Farage has now admitted this was a lie. \r\n\r\nThe claim made by the Leave camp was an act of disinformation: a deliberate and calculated falsehood with the sole purpose of manipulating the electorate to win the referendum. \r\n\r\nWe are the Brexiters who are furious with Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage and will not stop until democracy is served: the decision to leave the EU must be overturned.",
