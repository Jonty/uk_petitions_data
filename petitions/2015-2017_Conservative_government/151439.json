        "additional_details": "-EU citizens contribute largely to the economy, those that have been living, working, and paying tax for more than 5+ years should be involved in a referendum, because of how they will be directly affected, the loss of EU citizens means a loss of both skilled and non-skilled workers.\r\n-The increase of racism and xenophobia since the 1st Referendum, highlights that we need more voices to be heard in order for this to truly represent all those who live, and work in the UK and pay tax.",
        "background": "There must be a 2nd Referendum, as EU citizens that have migrated to the UK, and who work and pay tax to the Government must be able to vote on leaving or remaining within the EU, due to the fact that they contribute to the UK economy, and are directly affected by the UK leaving the EU.",
