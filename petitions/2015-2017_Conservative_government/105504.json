        "additional_details": "We also call upon the British Government to vigorously press the European Commission to extend a ban on the import of hunting trophies throughout the EU..\r\n\r\nIf the British government are unable to support this ban then we call upon the government to explain to the House in debate why they are in favour of  continuing to allow the import of hunting trophies into the UK.",
        "background": "We believe that the hunting and killing of wild animals simply to remove their heads to provide wall decorations is both amoral and senseless. We call upon the government to follow the example set by the Australia government and immediately ban the import of all hunting trophies into the UK. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
