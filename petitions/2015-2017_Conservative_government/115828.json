        "additional_details": "Nursery nurses work on average (in setting) a 40 hour week, this does not include training, meetings and planning. It is a demanding job and it should be rewarded with an appropriate wage. The wage we currently earn is too low, it does not take 11 hour days, training and skills in to account. We care and educate children similarly to teachers, sharing many similar skills but we are not rewarded the same as teachers.  Please support nursery nurses and our passion for working with your children. ",
        "background": "Nursery workers earn on average \u00a37 an hour and this does not increase much even with experience. This is unfair, nursery practitioners have to undertake rigorous training and complete voluntary placement hours before being qualified and allowed to practice. We deserve a fair wage for our hard work.",
