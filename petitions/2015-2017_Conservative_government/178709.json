XH 558 will move into hanger 1 and put into storage, only be allowed to stay there till April, if no new home has been found by then, she'll be moved and stored outside. With no engineers, how are they going to keep her in taxiable condition, something the Heritage Fund said they had to do when they got the grant! No engine runs, taxi runs, no engineers or  volunteers and no visits for the foreseeable future for members of the public. ",

Vulcan XH558 was always a big crowd puller at any airshow she visited and is a great 'ambassador' for British engineering and aviation.",
