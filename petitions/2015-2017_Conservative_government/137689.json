        "additional_details": "A General Election allows:\r\n- British voters to state their preference and give it a legal basis\r\n- vote for MPs who represent their preferences\r\n- for those MPs to choose the next government\r\n- for that government to have the over-riding aim of negotiating the stated wishes of the British electorate on their behalf.",
        "background": "The U.K. has held a referendum and voted to leave the EU. But the electorate has not been given the opportunity to vote for what it wants to happen now. A general election must be called before Article 50 is invoked so that the British public can positively decide what happens next.",
