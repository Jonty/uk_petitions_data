        "action": "Change car insurance law to insure driver rather than vehicle for road risks",
        "additional_details": "It is only physically possible to drive one vehicle at once so why are we paying a double premium? The largest portion of a vehicle insurance policy is Road risks so my proposition is a driver specific insurance for road risks and an optional, much smaller vehicle premium for fire and theft.\r\n\r\nMulti car insurance policies do exist but their premiums don't represent the true risk to the insurance company, usually offering a maximum of a 25% discount in a very small number of cases.",
        "background": "Car insurance has been incomprehensibly expensive for years, only getting more expensive when you use your policy and make a claim. The biggest rip off from a consumer's point of view is for people who, for whatever reason, run more than one vehicle.",
