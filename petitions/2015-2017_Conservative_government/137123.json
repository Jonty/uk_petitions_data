        "additional_details": "Myself with the other registered EU workers that live in the country must take part in all elections as long as they are registered to vote, work and pay taxes for more than 12 months. It wasn't very bright to ask people if they want to stay in the EU. You don't ask people if they want to pay taxes and you dont ask kids if they want to go to bed. But now that we did it lets do it right. ",
        "background": "It's not good you have first and second quality citizens in this country. I live, work and pay taxes in this lovely country for 3 and half years. My 5 year old son goes to an English school and only speaks English. I must be heard about this, once it has direct implications in my family's life. ",
