        "action": "Create proper regulation and penalties to tackle dishonest political campaigning",
        "additional_details": "In the wake of a referendum where the public were told \u00a3350 million more per week would be available for the NHS, it's time to overhaul the regulation of elections and referenda before people just give up on politics.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Electoral Commission's role in regulating campaign finances is clear, they have limited powers, resources or remit to actively regulate the honesty of campaign messages.\r\n\r\nPlease add your name if you want proper regulation and penalties for political campaigning.",
        "background": "In theory, it's illegal to use dishonest or misleading material in a political campaign. But when is anyone actually punished for hoodwinking the public with their crafty \"facts\"? That's because proper, consistent regulation doesn't exist and prosecutions are almost never pursued.",
