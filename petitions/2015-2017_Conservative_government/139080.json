        "additional_details": "The decision of P.M David Cameron to resign in October 2016, due to the EU referendum results, will leave the UK under the premiership of an unelected Prime Minister for just under 4 years of a 5 year term. This should not be permitted to stand and we should be given the opportunity to elect the Prime Minister of their choosing as opposed to one that would be appointed internally within the Conservative Party to guide the country through the period of change as we negotiate our exit from the E.U",
        "background": "Under the terms of the Fixed Term Parliament Act, the next general election will take place in 2020, leaving us with an unelected prime minister to guide the UK through the aftermath of the most important decision of a generation, a time where public confidence in the government is needed the most.",
