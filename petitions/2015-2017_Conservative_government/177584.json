        "additional_details": "Here is a list of the \"Special Meal\" options from British Airways:-\r\n\r\nType of meal\r\n\r\nLacto-ovo-vegetarian,\r\nVegan/vegetarian\t\r\nAsian/Hindu vegetarian\r\nMuslim \r\nKosher\r\nChild meal\t\r\nDiabetic\r\nGluten intolerant\t\r\nLow calorie\t\r\nLow fat\t\r\nLow salt\t\r\nLow lactose\r\n\r\nThe above are meal choices. Yet someone who cannot eat nuts is not catered for. It is unreasonable for people on long haul flights particularly children to be denied safe food to eat.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "People with nut allergies can die of anaphylactic shock if they ingest nuts. Whilst it is possible to order Kosher, Muslim, Vegetarian, reduced salt etc etc meals. Not one airline will offer nut free meals as an option. \r\n\r\nIt should be a legal requirement to make a nut free option available.",
