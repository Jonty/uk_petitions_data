        "action": "Temporarily suspend the powers of devolution to Scotland.",
        "additional_details": "Nearly every aspect of everyday life in Scotland is on the brink of disaster, from infrastructure maintenance through to the functioning of social services, health and education. Many farmers are near bankruptcy. Teachers have faced too much change without sufficient guidance, and standards in some areas have plummeted. The health service is in crisis with wards closing, waiting lists lengthening, insufficient doctors, nurses and cleaners and GP practices faltering under increased pressure.\r\n",
        "background": "The Scottish Government under the SNP have consistently failed to govern Scotland efficiently and effectively. Suspending devolution will allow a return to sensible and appropriate governance until such a time as a more accountable system, with suitable checks, can be established.\r\n\r\n ",
