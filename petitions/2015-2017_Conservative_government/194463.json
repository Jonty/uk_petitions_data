        "additional_details": "It wasn't until recently that I began to get help for my crippling mental health. \r\n\r\nI have hit every obstacle trying to get help and I believe this is down to the lack of understanding that employers and educators have. The NHS is stretched, so I believe that we need to meet the problem sooner.\r\n\r\nI want to set up this campaign and see it through, as every day without such channels in place, is another day where lives are lost because of a stretched health service and lack of outsider knowledge. ",
        "background": "Hi, my name is Daniel Coole, and I am a U.K mental health blogger. \r\nI have long suffered depression and anxiety.\r\nI believe that all educators and employers need to be given compulsory training on dealing with mental health, from recognising the signs to putting help and appropriate plans in place.",
