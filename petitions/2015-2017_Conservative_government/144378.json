        "additional_details": "Many people in the UK voted for Brexit based on misleading information about immigration and the money to be available for NHS after Brexit, which was disseminated by Brexit supporters like Nigel Farage before the vote. Farage admitted that the information which made one of the leading arguments of his campaign was a mistake after the Referendum. If people were correctly informed about the consequences of Brexit before the vote, the results of Referendum would have been completely different. ",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, call for the HM Government to announce the results of the EU Referendum of the 23rd of June 2016 invalid because many people voted based on misleading and incorrect information disseminated by Brexit supporters, which was revealed after the results had been announced.",
