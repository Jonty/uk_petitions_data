        "additional_details": "The HCPC requirement for home grown individuals who have graduated from a UK university needs to complete a portfolio in an approved laboratory. The portfolio needs to be supported by a training officer in the laboratory. \r\nInternational workers from the EU or the rest of the world do not need to put together a portfolio to obtain registration with the HCPC. Applying for HCPC through the \u2018international route\u2019 is much more straight forward where the applicant needs to complete an application form and needs verification for their identity and qualifications by two independent referees. This is an unfair system as it puts highly experienced and skilled workers from the UK at a disadvantage.\r\n",
        "background": "As the healthcare science profession is regulated by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) it is essential for individuals to get registered with the HCPC for patient safety and it will aid them with career progression. \r\n \r\n",
