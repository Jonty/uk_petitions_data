        "action": "Introducing a theory test with Motorcycle Compulsory basic training",
        "additional_details": "Current legislation states that a rider, whether young, old and of all level of experiences can learn to ride a motorcycle on the roads by simply completing a Compulsory basic training course. \r\nThis consists of a manoeuvring and bike control session, then a road competence ride which is supervised.\r\nDuring the CBT an instructor will assess your knowledge of the Highway code. This is not enough, too many riders put themselves at risk by not fully understanding the rules of the road. ",
        "background": "Motorcycles are an increasing form of transport, from delivery, commuting to pleasure. New motorcycle riders with no experience can legally ride without adequate training. Learner Motorcycle riders do not need to pass a theory test, producing inconsiderate, dangerous riders with poor road safety.",
