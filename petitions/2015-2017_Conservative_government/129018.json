The law gives the state only limited powers to confiscate the assets of individuals -  under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, the Serious Crime Act 2007 and the Serious Crime Act 2015.\r\n\r\nYour petition does not outline how a waste of taxpayers money would be defined, and whether (and if so, how) you would like the powers of the state to confiscate people's assets to be extended. \r\n\r\nIf you believe a particular policy is a waste of public money and should be stopped, you could start a petition calling for that particular policy to be scrapped."
