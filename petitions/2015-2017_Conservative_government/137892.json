        "action": "The EU referendum result is invalid as 16 & 17 year old citizens were excluded.",
        "additional_details": "There are many capable and highly aware young people in our nation who are completely frustrated that they have been unable to voice their opinion about the future of their own country.  The referendum result was skewed by their exclusion and it is therefore invalid as a poll of the nations opinion.  We should not use the referendum result alone as a basis of a decision without first understanding the views of this group and other groups that could not vote but are impacted by the decision.",
        "background": "There is precedence in the UK (at the Scottish independence referendum) of 16 and 17 year old citizens being asked to make a major decision about the future of their own nation.  The referendum on EU membership by excluding this group of citizens is an invalid poll of the opinion of its citizens.",
