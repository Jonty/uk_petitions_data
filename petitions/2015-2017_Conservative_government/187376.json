        "additional_details": "It was the funeral parlor staff who found out about Dr Shipman, if they had been listened to sooner more lives would have been saved. \r\nThis petition is supported by them and many others.\r\nThis can now be improved by the suggestion by making this detection process automatic. A computer program could scan photos for crimes then ask police for further actions.\r\nThis data could be stored and the cost is small compared to the other economics of criminal detection. Crimes would be more difficult to do.",
        "background": "With an increasing number of crimes against the elderly, vulnerable & children which are unknown to police. A proposal is that all deceased to be forensically UV photographed which would show bruises etc & flag serious issues. All images could be taken at the funeral parlor & uploaded to a computer.",
