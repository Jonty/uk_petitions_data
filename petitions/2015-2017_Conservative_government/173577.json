This ultimately takes away an individuals freedom of choice, potentially impacting on their health and well being.\r\nI believe in tournaments such as those run by Powerplay, which are recreational and not professional females should be allowed to compete alongside men.\r\nWomen should not be discriminated against based on their gender. ",

However I feel it is discriminatory to prevent females playing at a structured recreational level.\r\n",
