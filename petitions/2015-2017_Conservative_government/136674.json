        "additional_details": "16-17 year olds are eligible to join the army, work full/part time, drive, start a family, pay income tax and National insurance. But apparently we don't have the intellectual capability to control our own futures. This is nonsense. We want to protect our futures, we want to be included in the democracy that the UK prides it's self in. The UK has not spoken until everyone directly effected is granted the right to be part of this democracy. Restart honest informative campaigns and educate the UK.",
        "background": "There is no denying that the difference in opinion varies generations, 75% of 18-24 years olds have expressed the desire to remain within the EU, unfortunately 16-17 year olds have been denied a say in a vote which will affect them for much longer than it would affect 65 year olds. Give us our say. ",
