        "additional_details": "The residents were used to living next to a rail track with moving trains so were prepared for this level of noise but they are now having to live with between 49 and 85 dB L of low-frequency noise from NR starting anytime from 10pm through to 7am, at its worse at around 3am.  The acoustic barrier is very ineffective against low frequency noise.  The council are not listening to these residents, there are children and old people who simply can not sleep and many have had to sell their homes.",
        "background": "In 2010 Reading Borough council gave Network Rail permission to move their maintenance depot to the rear of Cardiff Road, Reading. NR assured residents that this would cause them no inconvenience  and that an acoustic fence would be built to ensure that the ambient noise level would be no greater.",
