Further, to gain entry to the Lords but have strict rules that reflect the wishes of the public. PM's should only be able to appoint limited number of people and a fixed term sitting in the Lords should be applied not least to reduce cost",
        "background": "It is clear with Article 50 now going through the Lords that they intend to block or change it. However, No one person in the Lords is elected by the public. This organisation is to big and expensive and should have NO rights to stop/change anything other than to advise.",
