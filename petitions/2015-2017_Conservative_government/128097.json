        "additional_details": "Richmond House surgery is closing in October 2016. The blame for this lies not with the superb team of doctors, nurses, management and administration staff but with the CCG, regional and national NHS who have failed to support the surgery in its quest for new premises. The Doctors & their support team provide the best of care to over 4,000 patients from the town and surrounding areas. The other surgeries in the town are already stretched way beyond capacity. ",
