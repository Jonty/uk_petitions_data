        "additional_details": "Today my daughter unsuccessfully tried to buy an Ed Sheeran concert ticket.  We knew demand would outstrip supply and were not hugely surprised not to get any.  Ed himself had urged his fans to use twickets, a non profit resale site to resell tickets.  When I checked this site there were no tickets available.  I then checked other resale sites where literally 1000's of Ed Sheeran tickets were available but at hugely inflated prices, most 3 or 4 times face value.  This cannot be of benefit either to genuine fans or the artists themselves.",
        "background": "Nowadays it is common for music artists to sell out their concerts incredibly quickly.  Many of these tickets appear on resale sites within minutes of being sold at hugely inflated prices. This reduces the number of tickets available to genuine buyers initially and also legitimises ticket touting.",
