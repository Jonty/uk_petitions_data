        "additional_details": "Trident is Britain's nuclear weapons system located in Scotland. It's made up of four submarines \u2013 one of which is on patrol at all times - carrying up to 40 nuclear warheads on board. Each of these warheads is eight times more powerful than the atomic bomb which was dropped on Hiroshima.\r\n\r\nFor more information please visit - http://www.cnduk.org/",
        "background": "The government is in favour of replacing Trident at a cost of around \u00a3100 billion. This money would be enough to fully fund A&E services for 40 years, employ 150,000 new nurses, build 1.5 million affordable homes, build 30,000 new primary schools, or cover tuition fees for 4 million students.\r\n",
