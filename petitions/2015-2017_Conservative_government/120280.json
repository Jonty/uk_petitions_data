        "action": "Legally require adjacent schools to align their school holiday schedule.",
        "additional_details": "Further impacts include: less revenue to the British tourism industry, inconveniencing employers and preventing/further discouraging mothers from working thus claiming benefits. Schools are allowed to fine parents if children do not attend, yet schools are under no obligation to consider the constraints of working parents. Aligning the school holidays causes schools literally no inconvenience what so ever.",
        "background": "Adjacent schools, serving different age groups, are attended by siblings from one family. Misaligned school holidays mean: the family cannot take a holiday & financial hardship as the parents have to cover childcare for four weeks instead of two (i.e. time away from work or child care costs).
