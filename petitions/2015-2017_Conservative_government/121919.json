        "additional_details": "Since the curfews and military operations started hundreds of innocent civilians have lost their lives as a result. 56 curfews have been declared in at least 19 districts of 7 cities since July 2015. Resultantly, 600 civilians were killed. Curfews and military operations are still going on in the districts of Cizre, Sur and Silopi. \r\n\r\nSo far, to the dismay and anger of pro-peace and pro-democracy forces in Turkey, Western governments have refused to condemn or highlight the breaches of human rights and brutality by the current government of Turkey.",
        "background": "Turkey\u2019s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is undertaking deeply divisive military action in the predominantly Kurdish Eastern and Southeastern Anatolian provinces, which involves imposing curfews and blockades, attacking innocent Kurdish civilians with tanks & snipers, shooting civilians.",
