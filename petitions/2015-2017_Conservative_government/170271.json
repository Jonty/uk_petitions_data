By signing this petition you are agreeing with me that should a politician \"knowingly lie\" the repercussions would be a criminal offence which could result in them never being able to stand for public office ever again. ",
        "background": "With everything that has happened over the past 12 months and in particular the referendum, all politicians without exception bent the truth or deliberately lied to the electorate. I think that this should be made a criminal offence carrying a minimum 5 year sentence and banned from public office.\r\n",
