        "additional_details": "I believe that it should be the people who the decision effects the most making the choice. Regardless of the outcome, it is the young peoples lives which will change the most. 3 million jobs are directly linked with the EU, with many many more being indirectly linked to EU trade. That makes at least 3 million people who's lives could change depending on the result. Further more, the outcome has no effect on pensions. This means that the household income of the elderly is likely to remain the same whatever the outcome.\r\n",
        "background": "The older generations are sacrificing the future of the younger population by voting out of the EU due to reminicing on the past.\r\nThe final decision has little or no effect on the ageing portion of the population, however it is the young people who will be effected the most as job prospects change.",
