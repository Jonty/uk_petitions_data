As a result, such carers are suffering poor health especially in cases of moderate or vascular dementia where the dementia sufferer can still remain in their home looked after by a family member. Carers may not leave the home due to a dementia sufferer\u2019s hostility and paranoia in which the carer is the focus of verbal aggression. The authorities unwittingly collude with the carers\u2019 sense of guilt into caring for the dementia sufferer.",
