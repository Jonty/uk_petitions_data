        "additional_details": "\r\nConsidering the high expense of life in general, including rates for food and living costs, car insurance, telephone bills and the other monthly expenditures, this means that tenants are paying a high rate for other important items.\r\nConsidering this, the base line is that we in the UK are LIVING TO WORK. This has to change.\r\n\r\nMy intention is that parliament puts a cap for landlords at 30% of a monthly wage based on minimum wage for tenants in each county. ",
        "background": "In the county of Dorset the average rent payment for an individual is \u00a3400 per month. If an individual is earning the minimum UK wage at \u00a37.00, and working a 40 hour week, this means that almost 50% of their earnings are going towards paying their landlord.",
