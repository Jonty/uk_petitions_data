        "additional_details": "Prices to go to university in the UK are higher than Europe. This is causing students to leave the UK to be educated. As a country that is recovering from a recession, we need to make sure that we have as many professionals in the UK that can bring in money to help us recover. If we are driving them away by making them go away for university, this will take longer to do. We need to lower the maximum fee for universities to keep our students in the UK.",
        "background": "For students in England and Wales, university in the UK costs \u00a39000 a year. For a three year course, this adds up to \u00a327000 a year. For a five year course like medicine, this would be \u00a345000. It is becoming cheaper to go to universities across the world, and we need our professionals in the UK.",
