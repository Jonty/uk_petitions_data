Some voters placed a vote to make leaders listen & not realising that it could actually make a decisive impact.  Both voters feel let down by the manor in which both campaigns were run & as a result of all of this, we would like a new EU referendum NOW!",

Both sides of the argument provided by politicians & media has now been realised to be exaggerated & over zealous.  Voters placed on both sides are reconsidering their votes & want the opportunity to vote again fairly. ",
