The DWP deals with those who are in a  vulnerable financial position. No one who calls for help should feel like they have had a door slammed in their face. This is not acceptable in this day and age. I know many this year that have contacted this call centre and feel exactly like this. It cannot go on and it must be changed.",
        "background": "An article in The Guardian on 20th August 2016 headline 'I'm a DWP call handler and have no time to care about your disability claim' received many comments when posted on Facebook. A link to the article is listed below. Staff are pressurised and those who need financial help are not getting it.",
