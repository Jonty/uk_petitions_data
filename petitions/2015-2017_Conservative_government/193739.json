        "additional_details": "In 2008, Volvo made a huge call and decided to install this simple and inexpensive piece of technology to all over their new vehicles - a system known as \u201cCity Safety.\u201d This simple technology is helping by reducing accidents by 28% and also helping reduce the cost of car insurance by 25% - an issue in its own right. These systems are reducing accidents and insurance claims, but most importantly - they are saving lives.\r\n",
        "background": "AEB (Autonomous Emergency Braking) is the name for systems which monitor the road ahead and detect potential collisions. This technology usually utilises LIDAR sensors, these are small and inexpensive. The seatbelt is a standard safety feature in all cars now, so why can't AEB be as well?",
