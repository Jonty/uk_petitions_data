        "additional_details": "This is terrifying for self-employed workers who cannot guarantee that their income will above \u00a35,965. The majority of low earners are happy to \u201cpay their way\u201d through Class 2 NI voluntary contributions. Class 3 NI voluntary contributions on the other hand are simply too much for those with small profits.\r\n\r\nSuch a significant increase in cost is inevitably going to result in no voluntary contributions being paid, which means that more people may rely on means-tested state benefits in the future.",
        "background": "At present, self-employed workers earning under \u00a35,965 can protect their state retirement pension by paying Class 2 NI voluntary contributions at \u00a32.80 a week. After the abolition of Class 2 NI however, they will have to pay Class 3 NI voluntary contributions priced at an unaffordable \u00a314.10 A WEEK.",
