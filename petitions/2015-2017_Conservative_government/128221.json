        "additional_details": "1000s of people die every year waiting for a transplant. The welsh government estimated that with this new law organ donations would increase by 25%. Under their new system, those over 18 will become potential donors either by registering their decision to opt in - as they do currently - or by doing nothing at all. It will apply to adults who have lived in the country for more than 12 months. If people wish not to become donator for whatever reason, then they can easily opt-out. ",
        "background": "From the 1st of December last year Wales changed their organ donation laws so that every adult that dies will automatically be treated as an organ donator. This increases the amount of organs available for the desperate people who need them, rather than letting them go to waste. ",
