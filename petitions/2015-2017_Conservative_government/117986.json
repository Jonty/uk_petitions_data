        "action": "Transfer costs for electronic cigarette product notification to MEPs",
        "additional_details": "Due to the pace of innovation in e-cigarettes a six-month-old product is already obsolete. This will cause great pain to UK small businesses, as many customers will buy direct from overseas manufacturers instead. There is also a financial cost for notification, of \u00a3220 per product. As MEPs voted for this notification regime without giving any justification for it the cost of product notification should be levied on past and present MEPs who voted in favour of the TPD, and not on businesses.",
        "background": "The EU's revised Tobacco Products Directive takes effect in May 2016. Under these rules every new e-cigarette product will need to go through a costly and pointless notification process, then wait in legislative limbo for six months before it can be put on the market. MEPs should pay for this.",
