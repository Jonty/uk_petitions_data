        "additional_details": "On 31 March 2014, there were 68,840 'Looked After Children' (LAC). Of these, 51,340 were in a foster placement, 5,050 were adopted and 3,330 children left care with an SGO. We believe there would be less LAC, with improved outcomes for children, if there was a fair financial support package that met the child's basic needs and that this package was maintained until the child left school. One regular monthly payment for all carers (regardless of their legal status).",
        "background": "Kinship and Foster Carers go through the same checks, training and have the same role as a non-related carer. Yet, there is a clear disparity in the financial support offered by local authorities. This support then ceases, in part, once the carer wishes to apply for SGO or adopts the child! ",
