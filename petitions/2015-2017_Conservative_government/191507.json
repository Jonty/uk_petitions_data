        "additional_details": "It is vital if possible that any referendum produces a clear, unequivocal result. A marginal result based on restricted voting or limited turnout along with a modest majority result can rarely be described as representative of the will of the nation. Our nation is founded on an enduring sense of fairness and this needs to be preserved in all British interests including any future referendum. ",
        "background": "The entire country should decide if any one part can secure independence from the whole. If any referendum is held, the rules for a decisive outcome need to be clearer. Both the minimum turn out and percentage majority should be specified. ",
