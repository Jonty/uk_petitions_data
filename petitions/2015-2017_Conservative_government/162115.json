        "additional_details": "Any goods vehicle up to 7.5T is restricted to the lower speed limits. This means even a small van weighing less than a large 4x4 has to drive slower than said 4x4. \r\n\r\nThe speed limit of a van can also be defined by whether it is a 'car derived van' or not. Which means two identical vans from a factory will then have different speed limits if one van has seats installed in the rear. Drivers who use small vans as private vehicles have to suffer these outdated traffic laws. ",
        "background": "Currently vans have to drive at 50mph on single carriageway and 60mph on dual carriageway. This causes frustration and delays for a lot of road users.\r\nThese speed limits are outdated and due to the increases in safety and technology in modern vans, they should be updated to the usual 60 and 70.
