        "additional_details": "Our reasons include: \r\na) It is not democratic for a new leader of the Tory party to invoke Article 50 without a fresh mandate from the country when this is the most important political and economic event for generations. \r\nb) Whilst it was a democratic decision to leave, we have no clear understanding of what future (& terms) we want.\r\nWe need our elected representatives to represent all of us across the UK (& future generations) to get this right for our shared future. ",
        "background": "We respect the democratic decision taken in the Referendum by the UK to leave the EU. Article 50 should not be invoked until there has been a General Election so: \r\n- All parties can be clear on their position in their manifestos \r\n- Our next government has a clear democratic mandate to proceed.",
