        "action": "Abolish the CCG system established in 2013",
        "additional_details": "I propose that an urgent review is undertaken by the Health Secretary. The CCG's must be regulated by the CQC if they are to continue. I have multiple case studies of Patients care being put in severe danger due to the poor conduct our CCG's insist on operating. They REFUSE to communicate directly with services they commission, refuse to pay their bills and refuse to provide life dependant equipment because of cost. URGENT action is required before someone dies!! Our NHS is at risk!!  ",
        "background": "In 2013 the Government abolished PCT's in order to create \"local\" Clinical Commisioning Groups (CCG's).  This system is floored in so many ways. Patients are at risk under this system, Expertise have been scattered leaving huge gaps in our services, CCG's hide behind badly managed CSU's. ",
