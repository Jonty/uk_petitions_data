It is a national mandate; voted for by over 17 million people and the Government is determined to deliver it in the national interest. \r\n\r\nThe Conservative Party manifesto, upon which the Government was elected in 2015, stated that it would respect and implement the decision of the people of the United Kingdom. Parliament also expressed its overwhelming support for the Referendum Bill by a margin of 6-1. \r\n\r\nThe rules for exit are set out in Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This is the only lawful route for withdrawal from the EU under the Treaties and we will trigger Article 50 no later than the end of March 2017. \r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to getting the best deal for the UK \u2013 one that is unique and not an \u2018off the shelf\u2019 solution. Withdrawal from the EU will mean we will decide on our borders, our laws, and taxpayers\u2019 money. We will work hard to help establish a future relationship between the EU and the UK that is dynamic, constructive and healthy.\r\n\r\nUnder The Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011, the next General Election is planned for May 2020 and an early election can only be triggered by Members of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Exiting the EU",
