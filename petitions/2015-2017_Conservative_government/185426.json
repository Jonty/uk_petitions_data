        "additional_details": "the first sale of the loan book for pre 1998 loans was sold at 18% of face value, a huge loss. this first sale of loans to Erudio has been a complete disaster. the government promised no changes to the terms and conditions with this transfer, this has not been the case. the same assurances are being given for the future sales and this is not acceptable. the loans were given by the government and should be held by the government or written off, not sold off for the profit of the private sector. ",
        "background": "the government is proceeding with the sale of the student loan book at a massive loss. the previous sale was for 18% of the face value and caused massive problems for those concerned. if they can make that much of a loss why not write off the loans?",
