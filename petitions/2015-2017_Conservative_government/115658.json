        "additional_details": "In schools, 15-16 year olds are given one hour of mental health education per fortnight and this only lasts for two months of their academic year.\r\nSurely this education should start earlier on and have a lot more time given to it. Many teachers want them to do well, but they have to understand that it's not their grades that come first, it is their happiness and health.",
        "background": "In parliament, mental health is barely given a sideways glance. Many teens going through exams are experiencing stress and depression due to the large amount of pressure put on their shoulders.\r\nSchools and gp's need to be educated in how to help young adults through these difficult times.",
