        "additional_details": "The UK has made in over \u00a3500 billion since we joined, the EU has had enough of UK money. This petition demands the UK government must refuse to pay even 1 penny to the EU for Brexit. It is a total betrayal of the UK for the government to give into such EU extortion & give over billions the UK could spend on e.g. schools, roads, NHS, jobs, infrastructure etc. Do not pay",
        "background": "The EU is demanding the UK pay a Brexit bill of up to \u00a360 billion.This is blackmail for the UK to prop up the failing EU.The House of Lords have already confirmed legally the UK doesn't have to pay anything.Also EU law & treaties do NOT have any provisions that mean we have to pay a penny for Brexit",
