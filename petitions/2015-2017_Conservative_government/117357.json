        "action": "Start an immediate program of flood resilient bridge and infrastructure building",
        "additional_details": "Bridge collapses and closures across the UK demonstrate the need for bridges built to modern standards and with modern materials that will be resilient against modern weather conditions. Local communities cannot afford this and need central government to take urgent and immediate action for the sake of communities and business. ",
        "background": "Many bridges in flooded areas are now unsafe and unfit for purpose. Given the changes in climate and traffic density we call upon the government to institute an immediate program of public works, to restore and replace outdated bridges with modern single span bridges and infrastucture.",
