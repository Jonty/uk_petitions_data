        "additional_details": "By changing how the law views dogs, it would force the law to hold people who harm dogs accountable for their actions. Dogs would gain rights as living beings and no longer be subject to the same laws as an ananimate object. Dogs are our friends, our family. They have no voice and it is our responsibility to act on their behalf, and act now. By signing, you will make your voice heard for these loving, loyal animals. Harsher penalties for people who breed without bias, neglect, and abuse dogs. ",
        "background": "Many of us have witnessed abuse of dogs. Be it neglect, or physical abuse from the keeper, or dogs wrongfully removed from their homes and treated as no more than a piece of furniture. Too often these offences are taken too lightly, people aren't being held accountable and they need to be. ",
