Losing these valuable staff we lose baby/toddler groups, cr\u00e8ches for children of parents trying to better themselves in courses, help for parents I.e disabilities, post natal depression, family problems, learning and educational, with them or there children. Parents in this area struggle enough and carnt afford pay to take their children groups not that  facilities in Stoke. Children's centres staff  provide help to parents but teach children social, educational skills which is valuable to growing up. Leave our centre staff alone, leave our centres alone.     ",
        "background": "It has been publicised that the children's centres in stoke on Trent will not close but what hasn't been publicised is that staff are to cut from 36 to 9 across the city's centres. This will mean that all groups that are run for children age 0-5 will be stopped because of the shortage of staff. ",
