        "background": "The great Brian Mathew a National Treasure if ever there was one has been 'removed' .as presenter of Sounds of the 60s a superb Radio 2 programme broadcast every Saturday Morning. Brian has presented the show since 1990. It's a stupid as well as clearly ageist decision and it must be reversed.",
