        "additional_details": "Mental health costs the economy 105 billion per year.\r\nThrough complete care and socio-economic empowerment, this loss could be reduced in time.\r\nFuture generations could also be protected through positive & proactive public mental health education.\r\n1 in 4 people diagnosed each year;\r\n1 in 10 children have a clinical diagnosis.\r\nDo these figures include those suffering in silence?\r\nIn 2001 the W.H.O. highlighted the need for policies with effective treatment in mind.\r\nPlease show your support.",
        "background": "Published figures suggest that 10% of tax revenue generated by alcohol, gambling and tobacco amounts to approx. 3 billion/year. We believe ring-fencing this proportion, (subsidised by these industries) wholly to increase investment in mental health services could enable complete care for sufferers.",
