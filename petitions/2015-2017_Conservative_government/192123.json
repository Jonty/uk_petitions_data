        "additional_details": "Only a very small minority of police officers in the UK are armed. it is not armed police officers who, on the whole, are injured. It is always unarmed officers who are either seriously injured or killed. Enough, is enough, it is time to arm all police officers now. A bobby on a bicycle in rural Belgium has more protection than a British police officer on duty in central London trying to protect people, and themselves, from terrorists. ",
        "background": "Today an unarmed police officer was stabbed by a terrorist inside the grounds of the palace of Westminster. This attacker was eventually disabled by armed police. If the officer who was stabbed had been armed it is possible that he may have been able to shoot the attacker and not have been stabbed.",
