        "action": "Introduce a wildlife conservation points system for all new builds.",
        "additional_details": "This would massively help to reduce the decline in many species highlighted by the 'State of Nature report published 3 years ago which reported that 60% of uk species were in decline. This would make a big difference in helping species that now rely on the urban environment such as the hedgehog, swift and house martin to name a few. The cost of the build would be far outweighed by the benefits to wildlife and humans.",
        "background": "Every new build, whether new homes or new commercial builds would have to gain a certain level of points before the building is signed off. I.e 2 points for a hedgehog hole, 2 points for a bird box, points for native planting etc. Points could be doubled if used in the correct scenario.",
