        "additional_details": "More than 95% of the \u2018frozen\u2019 pensioners live in Commonwealth countries.The National Insurance Fund is built up from member contributions, including contributions from those who are now frozen! It would cost less than 1% of the annual pension bill to unfreeze pensions. Pensions frozen Australia, Canada, New Zealand, most Commonwealth Countries, and many others. A reciprocal agreement is not needed before they can unfreeze frozen pensions, a simple stroke of the pen could do it.\r\n\r\n \r\n ",
        "background": "British pensioners who retire to over 120 countries, mainly Commonwealth, have their rightful state pension frozen impacting lives of 550,000 yet those retiring to other countries have their pension uprated annually, just as though they never left UK. This is discriminatory and causes huge anguish.",
