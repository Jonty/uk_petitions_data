        "additional_details": "If we are truly proud of Britain, the Queens official birthday should absolutely be a Bank Holiday.  France has Bastille day, the USA has Independence Day.  The UK needs a day celebrating our heritage - & what better day could there be?   We currently have (with Spain) the lowest number of Bank Holidays in Europe (8), France has 12 & Germany 14 and Cyprus 17!  So perhaps it is time we stopped being the lowest in Europe & celebrated a few more 'proud to be British' days, starting with this one.",
        "background": "Whether you are a royalist or not,  Elizabeth II has been in position for longer than any other British Monarch, & despite her age, she fulfilled over 430 public appointments last year - almost 2 a day. We already have the least public holidays in Europe (8), the most is 17. It's time to change",
