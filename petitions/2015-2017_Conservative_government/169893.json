        "additional_details": "Either our government lacks knowledge, or they refuse to believe endless scientific studies proving the benefits of cannabis. In the meantime people are suffering without their medicine. Extra strain is being put on the NHS when people could self medicate at home. We are embarrassingly behind compared to decriminalisation and legalisation in various other countries and states. We are not asking your permission, you do not own us, we employ you! Listen to what we need.",
        "background": "End government lies regarding cannabis!  We do not ask for government permission to use a plant, or to put into our bodies whatever we see fit. My body belongs to me, not the government. Plants belong to mother nature, not the government. Stop arresting us for enjoying nature. Where is our freedom?",
