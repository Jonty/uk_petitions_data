        "additional_details": "There has been far more sober discussion of the consequences of a 'Leave' vote than there was before the referendum. If a 2nd referendum were held the electorate would be making a more informed decision - whatever the eventual outcome. Gove, Johnson and Farage - the leaders of the \"Leave\" campaign have left front line politics - the electorate have been abandoned by the very people they voted in support of. I have email evidence of The Electoral Commission's failure to provide independent info.",
        "background": "Voters were misled by lies and scaremongering from each side. The question of EEC membership, which guarantees free movement of people, was not asked - but immigration became a key issue. The Electoral Commission, by its own admission, failed to provide independent information to all UK households. ",
