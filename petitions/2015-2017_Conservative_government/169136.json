        "additional_details": "Pregnant women don't go into pregnancy thinking about all the things that could go wrong, but I believe they should at least be educated on things like Group B Strep, and for such a simple test for it to be detected I don't believe it is a waste of time, how many parents and families have to go through what I and many others have been through for this to be a necessary test, I for one would have paid any amount for the test so I could have my baby girls in my arms.",
        "background": "Recently I lost my twin baby girls after going into early labour at 22+6 weeks due to being a carrier of Group B Strep unknowingly, with a simple test this could have been detected, and maybe something could have been done to prevent my early labour, and save their lives.",
