        "additional_details": "A majority of food packaging lists nutrition information per 100g only. This can be extremely misleading for products that are dense in calories. The reference on the front of some packages is a move in the right direction, but this is missing from lots of products and fails to communicate information that is required for a healthy lifestyle (protein, fibre and carbohydrates). All packaging of food items sold in the UK should be required to have clear, easy to digest nutrition information labels",
        "background": "Nutrition information on food packaging can be difficult to read and requires math to be able to identify what consumers are actually putting into their bodies. Listing the nutrition information per 100g, regardless of recommended serving size (which is rare) or total package size can be misleading.",
