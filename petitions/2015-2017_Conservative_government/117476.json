        "action": "Have hunting with hounds monitored by a wildlife crime officer",
        "additional_details": "many foxes are killed during hunts up and down the country. A wildlife crime officer should be available to attend the hunt to make sure they are hunting within the law. we would like more prosecutions of hunts that kill wildlife using hounds and for hunts to take responsibility for any fox killed by their pack. We would like evidence of illegle hunts to be taken seriously by police and a thorough investigation made into any report of illegal hunting. ",
        "background": "Hunting with hounds is currently legal but hounds chasing and killing a fox is against the law. This law is not upheld as the police are never in attendance at a hunt and evidence given by saboteurs is rarely considered to bring a conviction. We would like a wildlife crime officer to attend the hunt",
