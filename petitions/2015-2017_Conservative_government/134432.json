        "action": "Introduce a referendum deciding independence of London from the UK.",
        "additional_details": "On the 23rd June 59.9% of London voted to remain in the EU. England does not represent London but is governing its fate despite the cultural differences. This is a democratic failing, a tyranny of the majority. Londoners are currently powerless to decide their own future.\r\n\r\nThe concept of London as a city-state was noted by Ken Livingstone in 2012. Such a state would enhance London democracy, allow it to decide its relationship with other states and in turn reflect the views of London accurately.",
        "background": "The EU referendum demonstrated cultural divides between Scotland, England, Wales, N. Ireland, and critically, London too. As such, each should be treated differently.\r\n\r\nReferenda empower individuals to take control. Taking control must be consistent, from the international level to the local level.",
