        "action": "Not subject the UK voters to a 2nd EU referendum.",
        "additional_details": "The referendum held on the 23 June 2016 was a lawful referendum held democratically and produced a democratic result. That this result may not appeal to some is a fact of democracy and democracy should not be distracted from its aim to represent the majority however small that may be. The introduction of a requirement as laid down in the petition intended to force a 2nd Referendum would not be democratic. If such requirements where to be in place then they should also be applied to all local and central elections.",
        "background": "A petition has been submitted after the referendum held on 23 June 2016 requesting the regulations of that referendum be changed in favour of making that referendum void and thus forcing a 2nd Referendum.",
