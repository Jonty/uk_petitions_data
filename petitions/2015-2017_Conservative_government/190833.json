        "additional_details": "The National Audit Office found:\r\n(1)   the grant, worth \u00a387 per pupil in 2015/16, will be withdrawn saving \u00a3615 million per year. The government assumes that local authorities and academies will cope with the reduction in funding by becoming more efficient. However, schools plan to cut staff costs by replacing experienced teachers with younger recruits and unqualified staff; and\r\n(2) Schools have not experienced this level of reduction in spending power since the mid-1990s.",
        "background": "The Government is proposing the phased introduction of a new national funding formula from 2018-19. The formula will result in a 8% reduction in per-pupil funding for mainstream schools between 2014-15 and 2019-20.",
