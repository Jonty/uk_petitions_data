        "additional_details": "I personally have paid up to five times more for ticket prices in the past as I refuse to be forced to miss experiences. Hundreds of thousand of fans have been outraged as recent as today due to secondary ticket Markets such as stubhub, viagogo and ticket oligarch selling tickets originally retailing for \u00a370 at ridiculous prices such as  \u00a3300-\u00a3600 PER TICKET!!! Not only is it upsetting to fans but it also discriminatory to those who find it impossible to afford. ",
        "background": "Tickets for entertainment sold by the secondary ticket market are extortionate, unnecessary, unfair and it needs to stop! It prevents people with a low income from enjoying the same experiences as everyone else whilst also being highly annoying to those who can afford. ",
