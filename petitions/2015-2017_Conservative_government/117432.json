        "action": "Set up an independent enquiry to look at allowances paid to members of the Lords",
        "additional_details": "There are 822 members of the House of Lords. All these expenses are TAX FREE. The SNP does not take any seats as a matter of principle. This \u00a3300 PER DAY tax-free allowance should only be claimed by peers who take part in the work of the Lords and can prove it, not just sign a 'register'! It is alleged that some sign and just use the free parking and subsidised bars and dining rooms. This information is part of analysis by the i newspaper. There needs to be proper debate around these issues.",
        "background": " Hundreds of thousands of pounds were paid to peers during 2015 who went through the whole year without contributing to debates. 117 never spoke in the main chamber. This includes at least 49 who signed the register and claimed the \u00a3300 daily attendance allowance. Some pocketed more than \u00a34,000 pm.",
