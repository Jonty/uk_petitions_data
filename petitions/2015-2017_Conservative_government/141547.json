        "additional_details": "A campaign of lies and scaremongering by both sides of the 'Brexit' campaign lead to confusion and uncertainty in the electorate. The decision for the UK to leave will have huge global socio-economic impact.\r\n\r\nThis is a decision that can not be reversed and it is imperative that before we finally commit we are presented with the facts of the agreement so that we may have the chance to truly understand the pros and cons. How can we go ahead without knowing the details of the final agreement?",
        "background": "I believe that it would be foolish to commit to leaving the EU until the exact details of the exit have been finalised. We therefore request a second referendum once we have finalised exit agreement with EU so that we may make a final, fully informed decision knowing the exact facts and risks.",
