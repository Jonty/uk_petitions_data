        "additional_details": "About 62.6% of the total electorate either voted to remain or were insufficiently motivated to vote leave. It stands to reason that people wanting change (for whatever reason) will always be more likely to vote than a 'silent majority' who are content with the way things are.  I was especially alarmed to hear that some people had voted leave because they never thought it would actually happen and were regretting what they had done! (Radio 5 live interviews the day after the referendum). ",
        "background": "The EU referendum was ostensibly about UK leaving the EU.  The onus should have only been on supporters of the leave campaign to cast a vote, not those who were content with the status quo.  The UK should therefore only consider leaving the EU if more than 50% of the total electorate voted to leave.",
