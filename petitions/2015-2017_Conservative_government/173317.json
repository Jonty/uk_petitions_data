        "additional_details": "It comes as Germany gets ready to legalise cannabis for medical purposes and Canada prepares for all-out decriminalisation.\r\nIt is thought a legal cannabis market could be worth \u00a36.8 billion to the economy annually, potentially netting between \u00a3750 million and \u00a31.05 billion in tax revenues and reduced criminal justice costs.\r\n\r\nThe number of offenders in prison for cannabis-related offences in England and Wales would also likely drop from the current 1,363, who cost taxpayers \u00a350 million a year.",
        "background": "Cannabis should be legalised to bring the UK up to speed with a growing number of Western countries and end the \"embarrassment\" of domestic drugs policy.",
