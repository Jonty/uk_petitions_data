        "additional_details": "Not only do these treatments not work but they may actually be dangerous. \r\n\r\nA simple Google search reveals that hundreds of dogs and cats have fallen victim to the ingredients used in cheaper treatments and hundreds have actually died. \r\n\r\nWhilst it's understandably difficult to afford proper flea treatment, this is the price of having a pet and as their owners, we are fully responsible.\r\n\r\nPlease sign to make any non prescription flea treatment illegal.",
        "background": "With 13 million UK households owning a pet, it's common for people to rely on cheap flea treatment. Some non prescription flea treatments do NOT work effectively and will not kill fleas. Studies find that they may, however, kill your pets.",
