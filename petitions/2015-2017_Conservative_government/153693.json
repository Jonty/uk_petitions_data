        "additional_details": "Re-assess the democracy of Brexit more profoundly! Parliament has done wonderful things for minorities and the vulnerable, but is ignoring 48% of the voting public's wishes on purely numerical grounds. 52% is a weaker majority than that of a general election win if you consider that there are more parties to split the vote between. Wars are not entered into on the basis of popularity but strategy. Where is the strategy for Britain here? What is the point of politicians if they do not think 4 us?",
        "background": "We should not let the country drift out of Europe without a second thought on the basis of a slim majority. Ministers should re-assess whether this is truly democracy and whether it is irresponsible to allow Brexit. They should debate adnd re-assess before pulling the trigger. ",
