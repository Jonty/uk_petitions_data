        "action": "Make football available across all viewing platforms at reasonable cost",
        "additional_details": "Football fans are now having to pay for two subscriptions in order to watch all the available matches. This hardly provides better value and is leading to the increase in illegal online streaming of matches. We would ask the government to look at this ruling, especially with the impending UK exit from the European Union, and ask that all rights holders make their HD channels available to each other on a wholesale basis to end the current system of needing two expensive subscriptions.",
        "background": "In 2007 the European Union demanded that Premier League football TV rights be split to end the monopoly that BSkyB had over televised football in the UK. They said the new system would provide football fans with \"greater choice and better value\". In reality the opposite has happened.",
