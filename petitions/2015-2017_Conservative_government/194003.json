        "action": "Do not wait for an unnecessary consultation and ban letting fees immediately",
        "additional_details": "I do not believe the Government has any intention of following through with this ban. Two months prior to the Autumn statement, Housing Minister Gavin Barwell stated that a fee ban was a \"Bad idea\". This CONSULTATION was parroted as POLICY IMPLEMENTATION. Five months on and still no timetable has been announced on this 'consultation'. \r\n\r\nAgencies have continued to profit from fees that range from \u00a3100 to as high as \u00a3700 in some areas (Shelter, 2016). This is disgusting and immoral.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "In the Autumn 2016 statement, the government said they would 'ban letting agents\u2019 fees to tenants' and they would 'consult ahead of bringing forward legislation'. This does not amount to a ban, merely a 'consultation'. This is deceiving, Scotland has banned these fees, so no consultation necessary.",
