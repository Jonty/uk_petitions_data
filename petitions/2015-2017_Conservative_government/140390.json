        "additional_details": "The EU referendum resulted in 51.9% of voters (37.4% of the eligible population as a whole) choosing to leave. This margin does not give a clear mandate for departure. The referendum is not legally binding and, given the misinformation prevalent throughout campaigning, its outcome should not be the conclusive factor in a decision of this importance. A parliamentary debate and vote, taking into account both the referendum and its wider political context, is a necessity.",
        "background": "In the wake of a near-equal split in the EU referendum result, it is the responsibility of our elected representatives to employ the procedures of parliamentary democracy and hold a vote on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union before a final decision is made.",
