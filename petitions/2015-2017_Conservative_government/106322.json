        "action": "Create a standard VED for all vehicles (with a fixed motor/engine) in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "When VED was first introduced 1920 it was original create to help maintain the road structure of the UK up to 1937, due to weight of the vehicle using it. After 1937 it was change to a general tax, then was changed to emissions from 2001. The problem with this is some hybrid/electric vehicle weigh more than fuel vehicles, due to their components (batteries). Creating a greater stress on the road surface then a fuel vehicle. My proposal is to charge \u00a31 for every 10kg the vehicle weighs.",
        "background": "With vehicle excise duty (VED) rising year after year due to emissions, this is unfair and discriminating to large vehicle owners and being detrimental to the haulage industry, especially when hybrid and electric vehicle are exempt from VED. While the road quality in the UK is in decline.",
