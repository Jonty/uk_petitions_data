        "additional_details": "It is seen as normal to shoot & incinerate hounds when no longer productive & disposed of if they fail in any way. They are killed at half their life expectancy, Hounds are punished for chasing the wrong scent. As soon as they are born they are taught to be savage which is not their natural instinct & removed if not savage enough. Old dogs are replaced in a constant cycle & shot without remorse & burned. More hounds are bred than needed. Some hounds are killed when hunting. They deserve better.",
        "background": "Petition is asking for the govt or another source to monitor the welfare of the hounds. It is estimated that around 4,000 hounds are clubbed to death or shot each year if found unsuitable or show weakness. Week old pups are killed if not strong enough. Unsuitable or old dogs should be re-homed.",
