        "additional_details": "In light of the fact we are rapidly moving toward a more secular society, why should we still be subsidising religion via tax exemption?\r\nThe church often takes a political stance during times of crisis. Most recently the humanitarian disaster that is the refugee exodus, has the church not got a moral responsibility to contribute some of its vast wealth? Now lets make it a legal one too.",
        "background": "Churches, mosques and synagogues don't pay any tax on earnings or land owned, yet they often preach about social responsibility.\r\nTo really help the local communities in which they thrive they should give something back in the form of taxes.",
