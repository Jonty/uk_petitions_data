        "additional_details": "Many people will not touch the plumbing in thier house due to the possibility of a leak thus causing damage, but will happily tamper with the electrical installation of their own homes and sometimes others as they believe they know what they are doing but in reality, do not have the slightest clue and are totally incompetent to touch such systems. These people are putting peoples lives at risk everyday and are able to do so as anybody can purchase the equipment without proof of competence to fit",
        "background": "Many house fires and potentially dangeous situations regarding the electeical installations in dwellings are caused by poor workmanship on electrical installations. The main reason for this is due to the availability of hard wired accessories to the general public, who then fit them themselves ",
