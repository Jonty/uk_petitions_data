        "action": "Ban gambling and live odds advertising during sports broadcasts.",
        "additional_details": "The government has banned smoking adverts yet betting companies are still allowed to advertise, with a 600% increase from 2006-2012 and children as young as 4 being exposed to 200 adverts a year. This creates a sense that gambling is part of life and everybody is doing it whereas in reality it can become dangerous. We are not asking for a ban on gambling, all we want is to separate the enjoyment of sport from the dangers of gambling, by banning gambling adverts during the broadcast of sport.",
        "background": "With the explosion of the Premier League, a similar and more sinister growth has taken place, that of online gambling. A gambling addiction can ruin families and lives and with smartphones accessible 24/7, it has never been easier to gamble. ",
