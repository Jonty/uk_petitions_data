        "additional_details": "The Evening Echo has reported on the new timetable and how this is affecting everyone's lives. People are having to leave extra early or getting in at night up to 30 minutes late. Children who travel to school on trains cannot board due to over crowding and are being crushed or pushed off trains. You cannot fly or drive a car without a seatbelt so where is the health and safety having to travel like cattle. We are not going forward but backwards. A survey was put out but only a small number of passengers responded regarding the new timetable. 88% opposed the new timetable but C2C went ahead with it anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Supposedly put on more trains but have halved them instead. Seats removed. All having to leave extra early and getting home a lot later.",
