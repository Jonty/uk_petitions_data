This gravy train can be halted immediately by our government, why wait months whilst our government elect a new leader delaying the triggering of Article 50 of the European Treaty",
        "background": "EU law only becomes binding over UK law by virtue of the ECA 1972. Parliament is sovereign and has the power to make or repeal any law. It has been given a mandate by the majority to leave the EU. As soon as Parliament repeals the ECA 1972 the EU becomes powerless. ",
