        "additional_details": "We challenge people to visit hospitals where the ban is already in effect and see for themselves and also to talk to the nurses and OTs working directly with the patients.\r\n\r\nWhilst it is accepted that smoking is bad for your health, it is not illegal, it  does help manage stress. Mental health patients are people not criminals and deserve the right to reduce their addictions at their rate.  \r\n\r\nThe ban is at best idiotic and at worse inhumane.",
        "background": "Many people struggling with mental health are smokers.  The smoking ban in mental health hospitals is detrimental to their recovery, causes unnecessary conflict and makes the staff job much harder.  At ground level it is despised by staff and patients alike.",
