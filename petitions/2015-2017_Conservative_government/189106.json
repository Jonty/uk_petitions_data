        "action": "Choice of Cannabis oil on NHS instead of chem/radio etc for all cancer patients",
        "additional_details": "Cannabis oil is derived from plants and herbs that were handed down for generations, whereas radio and chemotherapy can potentially destroy healthy cells as well as cancerous ones. \r\n\r\nPublic opinion is growingly supportive of cannabis oil. The CBD in the oil prevents more growth and the THC in it destroys it. Cannabis oil costs less than chemo/radio and it does not destroy healthy cells. The NHS would save money, and people would not be held to ransom by pharmaceutical companies. A Ministry of Medicine could be created to research and regulate cannabis growth along with other remedies from plants.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to allow cancer patients to choose cannabis oil as an alternative to radio or chemotherapy on the NHS. ",
