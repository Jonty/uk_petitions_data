        "action": "Make 'motorway driving' lessons a mandatory part of the driving license test",
        "additional_details": "The number of large scale roads are increasing dramatically in the UK and with no real lessons or real time motorway education, new drivers enter motorways, sometimes without driving on them ever before. The rules of motorway driving need to be taught to all new drivers. Motorways are a very dangerous place and it is unfair to send a new driver out onto one without them having any previous motorway lessons. ",
        "background": "The current driving license has no complete section on motorway driving and only includes them within 'Pass Plus'. Motorway driving and motorway etiquette are an invaluable part of driving as a whole and it should be mandatory for motorway lessons for drivers. ",
