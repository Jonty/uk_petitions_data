        "action": "Force high street coffee chains to use widely recyclable disposable cups.",
        "additional_details": "Today, coffee cups are made from paper lined with a polyethylene (plastic) resin which, makes the cup waterproof. These 2 fused materials cannot be separated at a standard recycling centre (there are only 2 places in the UK which can do this) and therefore the cups are classed as non-recyclable and are sent straight to landfill.  A standard paper cup weighs ~11 grams this equates to 27.5 million kilograms of non-recyclable waste every year just from a standard disposable coffee cup. ",
        "background": "In the UK alone, we send ~2.5 billion disposable coffee cups to landfill every year.  Companies such as, Starbucks, Costa & Nero are not doing enough to make these everyday items widely recyclable/compostable. Instead they continue to use disposable cups which they know will go straight to landfill.",
