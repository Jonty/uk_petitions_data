        "additional_details": "I have many friends who cycle and I am well aware of the risks, some maybe down to the individual, but many can be down to other road users. As well as my own accident recently I have 2 friends who have  had bad crashes, both were wearing helmets and both survived, even though their bikes didn't! \r\nThere is no question regarding the importance of wearing a cycling helmet, we need to make the wearing of helmets law without delay.",
        "background": "31 years ago I was involved in an accident, I was run over whilst riding my bike, at that time I considered myself lucky to have only a fractured skull. \r\nThis weekend I suffered another fall whilst road cycling with friends. It is clear from the condition of my helmet that it likely saved my life!",
