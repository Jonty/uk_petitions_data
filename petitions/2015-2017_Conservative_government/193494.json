Since these proposed restrictions are now in the public domain, individuals concerned with terror activity are likely to choose alternate flights. ",
        "background": "We the undersigned call upon HM Government to revise restrictions on electrical devices on flights from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi. These restrictions ban passengers from carrying laptops, tablets and other electrical devices as hand luggage for safety concerns. ",
