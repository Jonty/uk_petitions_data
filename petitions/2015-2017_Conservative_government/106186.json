        "additional_details": "I personally have been divorced four years. Last year I had to give up a job (keyworker) that I loved, because I could no longer afford to live in that area. I have been living temp with a family member for the past year. I have a new job, 25 miles away in a similar role,  still as a key worker, and work shifts. At my age, 51, I'm unable to get a mortgage, but if I could access funds from pension share, I would be able to buy a shared ownership property, and move closer.",
        "background": "For a lot of women, the main asset from a divorce is a pension share, which in most cases, can't be touched until age of 55. It would benefit a lot of women, struggling after divorce if there was an arrangement that this could be accessed to help with housing needs.",
