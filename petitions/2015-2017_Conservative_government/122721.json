        "additional_details": "Recent satirists claimed freedom of speech was a basic human right, living in peace and security is also a human right, but one which is being denied to many Muslims living in Britain. There is a direct impact on increased racial hatred when the acceptance of hateful stereotypes is used in national media. Nazi extremists of 1930's Germany used the same tactics, Extremist Christians of the Balkans used similar methods in the 1990's and now we are seeing the same narrative being written in Britain",
        "background": "There has been increasing defamatory reporting on Muslims in the UK press and media, and the incessant criminal profiling of this minority community has caused a direct increase in violent and often fatal Islamophobic attacks. Legal justice is needed now for the 3 million British Muslims affected.",
