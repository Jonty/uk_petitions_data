        "additional_details": "Before we express our vote, is important to know the outcome of negotiations with the EEU regarding BREXIT. Is very important to know if UK will remain a member of the single market as this will have a big impact on our property market, economic growth, jobs and public services. We have the right to change our minds in regards to BREXIT if this will affect our furture in a negative way. \u00a3350M every week to NHS was one of the misleading information provided in the LEAVE campaign. \r\n",
        "background": "As we have been misled by the previous BREXIT campaigns, We the undersigned call upon HM Government to arrange a second referendum on Britain leaving the EEU. We definitely know more about BREXIT now, than 8 months ago when everything was looking to good to be true. We want our country back",
