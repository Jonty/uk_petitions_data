        "action": "Delay submission of intent to leave the EU (Article 50) until there is a new PM",
        "additional_details": "There are reports of EU leaders and other member states wanting the UK to submit the intention to leave immediately and begin the two year notice / negotiation period.  Given the likely duration of a leadership contest and the current target of October 2016 this could result in a rushed process and damage the chances of getting the best possible exit for the UK.  This petition is to delay the submission until a new PM and cabinet are in place so they are able to negotiate without distraction.",
        "background": "Following the result of the referendum to leave the EU & the subsequent resignation of the PM it would not be in the UK's best interests to rush the submission of our intention to leave until a new leadership is in place.  This must be delayed until at least October to maximise the two year period.",
