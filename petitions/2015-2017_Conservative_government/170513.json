        "additional_details": "Things the council have done exceptionally badly recently...\r\n\r\nDithering on the Assembly Rooms, not sorting out Duckworth square sooner, axing the Christmas lights, turning off the water for the waterfall, axing the Markeaton park fireworks display, axing the Christmas lights switch on, axing the Darley Park Concert, axing Moorways, failing to fix Queens leisure center sooner, spending an exceptional amount of money on some ring 'art'. They are ruining our city.",
        "background": "Derby City Council has proved time and time again that they are inept at running a council. Other councils up and down the country have suffered the same slashing in budgets and still managed to keep the cultural and leisure activities alive. We, the people of Derby, cannot put up with this anymore.",
