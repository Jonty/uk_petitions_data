        "additional_details": "Saudi government executed popular leader Sheikh Nimr along with 47 other political prisoners. This is a heinous crime based on false pretexts and empty allegations.\r\n\r\nThere could be no justification of such an inhuman and barbaric act. \r\n\r\nThe only reason behind the execution of Sheikh Nimr was that the respected cleric always spoke for the oppressed against the regime in Saudi Arabia.\r\n\r\nContrary to the Saudi allegations of terrorist activities late Sheikh Nimr was a spiritual scholar who always sought dialogue and resisted injustice. \r\n\r\nWe call on the UK government and the House of Commons to publicly condemn the execution of Sheikh Nimr as a crime and demand democratic rights of religious freedom as well as justice for all minorities in the KSA.",
