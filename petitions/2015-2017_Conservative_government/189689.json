        "action": "Abolish unfair 'blanket pet bans' for leaseholders",
        "additional_details": "An estimated 1 in 2 homes has pets & freeholders are forcing leaseholders to part with these beloved family members. In 2015 the RSPCA rescued 118994 animals & Dogs Trust revealed 5142 stray dogs were put down that year. Pet bans will only add to this. With leasehold becoming more common, it\u2019s reasonable to request blanket pet bans be abolished. It\u2019s unfair to deny homeowners their pet without proper review. \r\n\r\nIt was also deemed unfair by the \u2018Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999\u2019",
        "background": "Homeowners should have the right to keep pets in their property. Leasehold homes are increasing, yet blanket pet bans are hidden in T&Cs. \r\n\r\nBlanket pet bans should be made invalid on all leasehold houses/flats & replaced with a fairer system that requires freeholders to review cases individually.",
