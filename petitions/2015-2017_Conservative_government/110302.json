By making this product illegal, the end result could be a devastating to many businesses, leading to a crash in the global.\r\nThe danger of a having a bike that travels at a speed of up to 15.5 km/h (on average) is far more dangerous than a small scooter traveling at speeds bellow 9 km/h. This act is outdated. ",

To the average person living in the UK, owning a huge private space of land is not an option therefore the use of this \u00a3300 product is not available. ",
