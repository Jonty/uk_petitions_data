        "additional_details": "One of Leave's main campaigning points was against the EU anti-democracy set up, however the Conservative government will elect a new leader for which only conservative members can vote. As they will be in position for at least another 3 years the UK will effectively have an unelected leader through a period of such uncertainty and significant importance.\r\n\r\nA general election should therefore be held in order that the country can vote for who they wish to lead the UK through the coming years.",
        "background": "The UK has just voted to leave the EU, but by a fine margin and as such are going into a period of great uncertainty. The UK should therefore be able to vote for who they wish to lead them through this time.",
