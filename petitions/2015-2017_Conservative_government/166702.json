        "additional_details": "Dermal filler is currently classed as a medical device and can therefore be bought and administered by anyone in the UK. In comparison, Botulinum toxin is a prescription only medication (POM), which by UK law, requires a face-to-face consultation with a medical prescriber prior to treatment. Botulinun toxin can only be administered by a trained healthcare professional.",
        "background": "There have been approximately 100 known cases worldwide of dermal filler being injected into the arteries of the face resulting in irreversible blindness. Shockingly, no formal qualifications or knowledge of complex facial anatomy are required to carry out these treatments legally in the UK. ",
