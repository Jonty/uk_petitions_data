        "action": "Help enforce, and encourage healthier lifestyles through reducing VAT for gyms",
        "additional_details": "Research has shown that regular exercise can prevent or delay diabetes, reduce risk of heart attacks and obesity. Obesity levels are rising in the UK and the government has recently announced a sugar levy in relation to this issue.\r\n\r\nRegular exercise is also proven to be effective for reducing stress-related health problems and improve cognitive function. A more active nation with improved physical and mental health will save money for the NHS and boost the economy due to a healthier workforce.",
        "background": "There is an increasing amount of awareness about living healthier lifestyles through regular exercise, however little action is being taken by people. There are many reasons why people may not join and one factor is price. Reducing VAT will encourage more memberships and reduce cost of good health.",
