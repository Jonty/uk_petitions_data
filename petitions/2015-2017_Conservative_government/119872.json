        "additional_details": "Despite a majority vote in favour of the Church in Wales being able to celebrate same sex marriages, the margins were too narrow for it to be passed. Marriage Law has excluded the Church in Wales from being able to celebrate same sex marriages in its churches and cathedrals and there are no plans currently for the Governing Body of the Church in Wales to petition Parliament for change in the near future.  Lets get this petition going and make a change that every one has the right to.",
