If the result is allowed to stand then all UK elections can be swayed by absolute lies & after winning they can just be refuted as a mistake. Such a situation would be so bad that it can't be contemplated & cannot be allowed to happen. There is a difference between 'stretching the truth' or 'stating a point of view' and outright lies.",
        "background": "\r\nWe are used to politicians stretching the truth but outright lies dismissed as mistakes the morning after victory are beyond acceptance.\r\nIf a TV or car was being sold with as much dishonesty the sellers would be prosecuted. The future of the UK & Europe are far more important than such items.\r\n",
