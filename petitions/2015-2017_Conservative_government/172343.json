This EU Directive sets the conditions for the acquisition of permanent residence and it applies in all EU Member States.  The Directive is currently implemented in the UK through the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.  Applications for documentation that confirms permanent residence status are refused where the requirements set out in the Directive and Regulations are not met.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister has been clear the Government wants to guarantee the status of EU nationals in the UK as early as we can. We have told other EU leaders that we can offer EU nationals here this certainty, as long as this is reciprocated for British citizens in other EU countries. \r\n\r\nHome Office",
