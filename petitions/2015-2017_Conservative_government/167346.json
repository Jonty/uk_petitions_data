        "additional_details": "Every time I use or try to use these spaces that are provided for parents with children I see others use them with no children in the car. I think that this lack of consideration is very infuriating and every parent I have spoken to agrees. At one time or another I'm sure like me you have struggled to get your children out of a small space because maybe that last space had been taken by someone who didn't actually need it. If you agree with me please sign this petition ",
        "background": "When parking with young children in car parks extra door space is needed. Most car parks provide this facility but unfortunately some people don't think they need to have children in the car to use these spaces. I think the introduction of a badge system to use these spaces is needed to stop this. ",
