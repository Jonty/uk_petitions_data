        "additional_details": "Many people in society have grown up in families that are not able to afford university fees, as they are at an all time high.\r\n\r\nThis results in further problems. For example, as people have no degree they are not able to secure a good income. This can result in even worse problems such as depression e.c.t. \r\n\r\nTherefore I am campaigning and calling for the government to reduce university costs. Please take a few minutes to sign this petition if you agree and help to spread it. ",
        "background": "The increase in university fees has seen the decrease in attendees. Many people can not afford to obtain further education which limits their opportunities to build a better future.  ",
