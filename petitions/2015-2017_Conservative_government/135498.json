        "additional_details": "The EU is a non democratic organisation. It has 40,000 staff, 4,000 earn more than our PM. People who leave are paid \u00a38,000 per month for a 3 year period; money that would be better spent in the UK. It operates out of a much more favourable tax regime. Today the French PM has admitted that the EU is broken and needs fundamental reform: the ink on our ballot papers hasn't even dried and there is already admittance of the need to change.  Why wasn't this admitted when our PM tried to get reform?",
        "background": "We are a democracy and having a second referendum because the majority voted out would make a mockery out of us.  We have to look forward and make our future better, we all have to deal with that.  Life won't end and we have a fantastic opportunity to change our futures.",
