        "additional_details": "Firstly the campaign on the side of leaving the EU presented propaganda as fact, a lot of the reasons why people voted to leave are false. \r\n\r\nSecondly, this referendum disproportionately affects the younger generations who are either working or studying as the EU provides alot of support and rights and funding in these areas, so we believe that the voting age for the referendum should have been lowered to 16, as this decision will affect them potentially for the rest of their lives.",
        "background": "There was a Referendum on whether the UK should stay in the European Union earlier this month and there was a vote to leave. It is our belief that this referendum was undemocratic for a variety of reasons. \r\n",
