        "action": "Ban the giving of goldfish as prizes at fairgrounds in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Goldfish have a long life span, require a large volume of water to swim around in and also consume a large amount of oxygen. These fish grow to a large size when fully grown (around 36cm) and also produce a lot of waste compared to many other species available in the aquarium trade. It is universally accepted that one common goldfish needs at least 70 litres on its own with a bigger tank always being better and goldfish as prizes only adds to the problem of people thinking they are expendable.",
        "background": "All over the UK fairgrounds and similar events are still giving away goldfish as prizes, this is an outdated practice that needs to be banned as these fish are kept in poor condition and it goes against all the work that goes into educating the public on how to properly look after their fish.",
