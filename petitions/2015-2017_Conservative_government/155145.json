        "additional_details": "The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 sets the interval between general elections at five years. However, in light of recent events, a large number of voters are calling for the public to elect the new prime minister and recognise that the decisions made over the coming two years will effect an entire generation. \r\nThe significance of our current circumstances as a nation must be recognised despite the inflexibility of this act. A publicly unelected prime minister has no place in a democracy. ",
        "background": "In light of recent events, there is wide-scale interest from the general public regarding the prospect of a general election in 2016.\r\nThe concept of democracy was used repeatedly by the 'leave' campaign during the E.U. referendum debates and supporters on both sides deserve a democratic election.",
