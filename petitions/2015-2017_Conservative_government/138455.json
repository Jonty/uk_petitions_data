        "additional_details": "Recent referendums have demonstrated the strongly devisive nature of proposed major changes to people's lives, especially when the result is close to an even split. Having to reach a qualified majority of 60% in any UK referendum would help ensure that changes are more widely accepted amongst the electorate.",
        "background": "Referendums are called by the UK government on matters of major constitutional change. Any major change from the status quo should have the backing of at least 60% of those who vote in each referendum.",
