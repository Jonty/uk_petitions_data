        "additional_details": "The EU referendum has delivered a clear and undeniably democratic result, one that is more so than many in the recent past.\r\nThat was for the UK to leave the EU.\r\nMr Cameron has accepted it as the will of the people.\r\nBrussels has accepted it as the will of the people.\r\nBut some clearly refuse to accept the will of the people because it goes against the result they want, and they are seeking to subvert the democratic process.\r\nThis makes a absolute mockery of the democratic process and shouldn't be allowed..",
        "background": "The EU referendum was conducted and had a very high turn out of around 72%, of those the majority voted to leave thus making it the democratic decision of the people.",
