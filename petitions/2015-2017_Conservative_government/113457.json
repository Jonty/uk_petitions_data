        "background": "Boycott is being used by MPs to waste public money,  parliamentary time, and to bully others not to vote.\r\n\r\nIf an MP is unable to deliver a comprehensive speech in time it means he is an incompetent MP  unable to express the very basis of his own post: speaking on behalf of his constituency.",
