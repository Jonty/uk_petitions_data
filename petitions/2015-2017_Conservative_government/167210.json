        "additional_details": "The government expect students to memorize instead of traditional learning, which is much more influential and cheaper. For example, in many subjects, there is no more course work, only that dreadful exam day we always hated. And its only 1 day for 1 subject. What if the student has a bad day, (that does happen.)? Their future is depending on a booklet in the most stressful day of their lifes! And the only exams makes more stress to teachers  having to work more to make their students strive.",
        "background": "The new GCSE's with the 1 to 9 scale is a very bad move. If you want students to succeed more, don't make work VERY hard, just invest in better equipment for governed schools. Secondary schools now have to spend massive amount of money to get text books for \"learning\".",
