        "additional_details": "Although advertisements are expensive and therefore contribute to the economy of TFL etc., the cost of obesity and diabetes on the NHS and the government (from treatment, other obesity-related health issues, well as disability benefits, lost days of work, and many others) is simply too high to ignore the issue purely for financial reasons.\r\nA ban on advertisements is the obvious way out.  Campaigns like \"5 a day\" should ideally replace the current junk food advertisements.",
        "background": "Obesity costs the NHS 5.1 Billion, and is the leading cause of Type 2 Diabetes, which costs almost 10B. Advertisings from Mac Donald's, Subway, Burger King, KFC, Coca Cola and other junk food chains make an enormous contribution to obesity, especially childhood obesity.   ",
