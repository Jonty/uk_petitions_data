In the past 3 years publicity has grown so that more people have heard about the process, and more people have spoken out against it, and yet there has been NO opportunity for the people of this country to make their views heard. The people of the UK should be given the opportunity to decide on whether or not they wish to risk the possible long term detrimental effects to health, well-being, water and atmosphere that are now being proven by experience in the US and Australia in order to gain the unsubstantiated financial benefits Government promise.",
