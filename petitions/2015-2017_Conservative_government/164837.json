        "additional_details": "There seem to be more dogs now (not just Staffies) being taken by the police based on there looks and being thought as being aggressive.\r\nIn principle the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 is a great idea, it needs to be revised.\r\nMost people including myself see there dog as part of the family. If it does not have a history of aggressive behaviour then leave them alone, just the same as us having a criminal record.\r\nThese dogs need constant contact with owners and will lick & love till there dying breath.\r\n",
        "background": "Breed Specific Legislation, is stereotyping animals (mainly dogs) & categorising them into safe & dangerous breeds.\r\nStaffordshire Terriers are afflicted with a stigma of being a dangerous breed due to there looks.\r\nA dog is not dangerous, it's all on the owner.\r\n",
