Phillip Hammond believes that execution by beheading for political protests is an acceptable form of punishment. 3. It doesn\u2019t matter how low Saudi Arabia sinks in order to stifle protests against their barbaric regime, Phillip Hammond will seemingly refuse to condemn their actions \u2013 even if their actions are relative to those of Daesh (ISIS).\" ",

As an apologist for Saudi Arabia's execution of peaceful protestors, Hammond is working in the interest, not of the British people but of the despotic Saudi monarchy.\r\n\r\n",
