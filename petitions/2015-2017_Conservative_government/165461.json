        "additional_details": "If a person was to go into a bank wearing a balaclava which covers their face completely only showing their eyes this would be a threat to security and they would be told to leave or to remove it. A burqa also covers the face completely only showing the eyes but its totally legal even though it is also hiding the persons identity. It is also a risk to the British public as it can be used to potentially disguise a terrorist as a Muslim women therefore making it easy for them to carry out a attack",
        "background": "The burqa and burkini is a huge security risk which is not suitable for banks, shopping center's or any kind of public store or transport. Wearing a hood up in a shop is not allowed because the CCTV cannot see the person's face clear enough so this should also be applied for those wearing a burqa. ",
