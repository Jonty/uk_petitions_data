        "additional_details": "Marriage has historically been a  religious and patriarchal institution that some couples don't want to be associated with. Unmarried couples with property and children are particularly vulnerable; even if they have wills, and in the case of a partner becoming ill or dying they are not always considered as next of kin. It seems discriminatory that homosexual couples have the choice of marriage and civil partnership but heterosexuals only have marriage.",
        "background": "Many heterosexual couples do not want to get married but want to prove their commitment to each other and would like their relationship, assets and children to be legally protected.  ",
