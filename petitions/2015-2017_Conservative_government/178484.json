        "action": "Halt PM's plan to renew special relationship with US under Trump administration",
        "additional_details": "Since taking office Trump has set in place policies that run counter to values held dear by many in this country. Trump has signalled his intention to undermine the UN, profile immigrants based on religion, use torture, defund women\u2019s health care and debunk the science of climate change. Left unchallenged these policies will have a detrimental effect on justice, human rights, global peace and the ecology of our planet. \r\n\r\nWe believe our government should be opposing such policies.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "This petition calls for an urgent parliamentary debate to allow us to demonstrate, through our MPs, how strongly opposed we are to the Government\u2019s plans to renew the \u2018special relationship\u2019 with America under Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\r\n\r\n",
