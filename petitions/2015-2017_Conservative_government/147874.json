I am currently studying for A levels and have taken a great interest in the recent EU referendum and the result could have a fundamental impact on my life and future generations. I want to have a say in any future decisions which will affect our lives and want this to be extended to 16 and 17 year olds in the future to increase democratic participation.",
        "background": "Young people of the UK can't vote in referendums. In Scotland 16 & 17 year olds were able to vote & this should apply to the whole of the U.K. Referendums deal with important decisions which affect young people more than any other part of the demographic and so we should be allowed to have our say.",
