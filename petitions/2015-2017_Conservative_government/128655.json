        "additional_details": "We are only required to pay 18 y/olds \u00a35.30/hr. How are they expected to live on this when it is so far from the national living wage just introduced? It is not fair that 21-24 y/olds still only get \u00a36.70. Those of us under 25 still have bills to pay yet it seems we get no help from the government. We are exempt from their living wage, we do not qualify for working tax credits. Recognize that we are not all lucky enough to still live with our parents. We should not be penalized for our age.",
        "background": "At the age of 18 you are legally regarded as an adult; You have attained the age of majority and are regarded as independent and self-sufficient. Ban age discrimination concerning wages, and apply the new national living wage to all legal adults. ",
