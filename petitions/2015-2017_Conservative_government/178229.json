It is extremely difficult to believe that Ticketmaster can have 0 face value tickets mere seconds after the on sale time, yet their own resale site \"Get me in\" can have hundreds of listings at upwards of 2x face value. This extortion of genuine fans must be stopped. The only way to achieve this, is to change the law to make it illegal to charge more than the face value of the ticket.\r\n",

Tickets went on sale 9:00am 16/1/17 and 23/1/17, both days I was through virtual queuing within seconds, to find no face value tickets available, but hundreds of listings from 2x face value upwards",
