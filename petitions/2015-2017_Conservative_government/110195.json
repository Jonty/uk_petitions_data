        "additional_details": "smoking and passive smoking is the biggest preventable cause of premature death in England. Many of our well used outdoor public  areas are being made. 'no go areas' for the vast majority of residents of England. These include City/town/village centers, parks, sports facilities  shopping centers retail parks etc. It has been officially documented that fewer young people have taken up smoking since the legal age limit for those purchasing cigarettes and smoking related items went from 16 to 18 years old",
        "background": "Government should legislate to make it illegal for anyone of 21 years or younger  to smoke in England. This could be implemented by issuing a smoking license to those eligible to smoke. The proposed licence would have to be produced before the purchasing of any smoking related items.",
