        "additional_details": "We feel this should be reviewed by an independent group, because quite frankly we are the ones working weekends, nights, staying extra hours and missing our breaks to care for all who use this service and at the end of the day receive demoralising comments from the health secretary and a real term reduction in salary from the chancellor, both of whom are underqualified for the jobs that they are overpaid to do. Now is the time to do the right thing and have an independent review of NHS salaries!",
        "background": "Members of parliament have had an independent review of their salaries which has resulted in an 11% then 10% payrise. The treatment of NHS workers with below inflation payrises and pay freezes the last few years is disgusting and unacceptable. We deserve fair pay!",
