        "additional_details": "I propose that more rigorous legislation is introduced to prevent these websites from being allowed to sell tickets for more than 10% of the face value. \r\n\r\nWe cannot allow these websites to dictate the prices to see our favourite shows/bands/sports teams.\r\n\r\nWhy should these touts be the only people that benefit?\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "I tried to buy 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child'. It became clear that many of these tickets were going up onto other sites for hundreds and in some cases thousands of pounds more. Many of these tickets are failing to sell resulting in empty seats in the theatre on performance night. \r\n\r\n",
