Taiwan is a part of China.\r\nThis is totally justifiable,because Taiwan has been merged into the domain of China since the 17th century.\r\nIt is only the divergence of ideology between the CCP(Chinese Communist Party) and the KMT at the first place which created a gap between the mainland and Taiwan.\r\nAs the UK government agrees the One China policy, it should be both officially and unofficially recognised that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, without any doubt.",
