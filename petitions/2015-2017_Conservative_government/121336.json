A fathers role, as long as there is not a valid reason to prevent them from gaining access to visitation with their children, is just as vital as a mothers, yet day after day fathers are being denied access to their children without good reason. Fathers have very little rights once a relationship breaks down and this is wrong! Nobody should have he right to stop a child from having a relationship with a parent. More needs to be done to ensure this stops. ",

They can try and fight this busy going to court and paying ridiculous fees for a contact order but once in the place, if the mothers still refuses access there is little that can be done. ",
