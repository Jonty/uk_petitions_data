        "additional_details": "If more people sign up to veto a piece of proposed legislation than voted the government in at the last general election, then that legislation should automatically be vetoed. That would be true democracy, give an alternative to strike action, and would protect against the most destructive of government actions against the people they're supposed to represent.",
        "background": "The government shouldn't be able to enact widely derided and unpopular legislation that the people don't want. We need a system that allows the public to have a voice away from the voting booth at general elections.  ",
