        "action": "Make recycling for all businesses compulsory and easily accessible",
        "additional_details": "The Government continually increasing the rate to encourage businesses to recycle more of their waste isn't enough.The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) highlighted this issue, calling for free waste recycling for micro-businesses. The organisation is also calling for better access for all SMEs.\r\n\r\n60% of waste that goes to landfill could have been recycled. If the Government want to increase consumption in our economy then they need to do something about it from an environmental point. ",
        "background": "Cost-effective recycling is a particular problem for small businesses, which often cannot access residential recycling schemes run by councils and may not be big enough to gain attractive contracts for waste disposal from large providers. Landfill tax has risen to \u00a384.40 but this isn't working. ",
