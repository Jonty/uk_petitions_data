        "additional_details": "The Decision Support Tool, in its current form, we feel does not take into account the complexities, uniqueness and unpredictability of many serious illnesses. There are many examples of people who are seriously ill & require full time nursing care, yet are being denied funding. We believe that the entire process requires thorough investigation, with straightforward guidelines, eligibility criteria & grading structure put into place.",
        "background": "In the UK thousands of people are being denied what they feel is their rightful or their relatives rightful entitlement to CHC funding.  We feel that this urgently needs reviewing, especially for those suffering multiple medical needs from symptoms of dementia & other serious illnesses. ",
