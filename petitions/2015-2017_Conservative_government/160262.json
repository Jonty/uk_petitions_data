        "additional_details": "With two Tory MPs who backed Brexit dropping out of the leadership race, we have been left with Theresa May and Andrea Leadsom to fill the void. It would be a step backwards for democracy should they be allowed to step into power based on a vote by the Conservative party. \r\n\r\nThis isn't a vote for who leads the political party, it's a vote for who leads our country through the upcoming turmoil and uncertainty. The Brexit vote may cause the public to want a different party in power altogether.",
        "background": "Due to the Brexit vote, there is now going to be a new Prime Minister from the Tory party. This person is not going to be elected by our country and should not be allowed to take the role without a solid approval from the public. Given the circumstances, we deserve a public choice in the matter.",
