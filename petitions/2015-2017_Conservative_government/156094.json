        "action": "The UK should remain within the EEA (European Economic Area).",
        "additional_details": "This approach would grant us the perks of not being within a political union (thus attractive for Leave supporters). It would provide an option for economic stability in a potentially uncertain time (e.g. helping ensure passporting rights for the City). It could protect the United Kingdom (giving Scotland & Northern Ireland access to the continent). It could also protect the rights of expats on the continent. \r\n\r\nThe UK Government should negotiate with the applicable bodies to make this happen.",
        "background": "The UK has voted to leave the European Union. Whether or not you agree with this decision, we need to make the situation work. One crucial action to take is protecting our economy and trade. Remaining within the EEA & single market would help protect our trade with Europe and keep jobs in the UK. ",
