        "action": "Hold a referendum on England leaving the United Kingdom.",
        "additional_details": "In 2014 Scotland was told that on leaving the UK it would no longer be a member of the EU. It can be presumed that had Scotland voted for independence it could have negotiated its future EU role in its own timescale before leaving the UK.\r\n\r\nIf England leaves the UK it need no longer  follow the terms of article 50, it can negotiate what will happen when it leaves the UK  on its own terms and timescales.\r\n\r\nIn addition Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will remain the UK in the EU.\r\n",
        "background": "The United Kingdom voted to leave the EU, however there was a clear split between the Kingdoms of the UK. It is now time to vote on whether English Citizens who wish to leave the EU no longer feel the benefit of the other Kingdoms. If the answer is yes, then the means of leaving the EU is simpler.",
