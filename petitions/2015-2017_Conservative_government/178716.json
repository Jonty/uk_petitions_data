        "additional_details": "International students contribute up to \u00a314.2 billion to UK economy in 2015 (NUS, 2016) with majority coming from resource poor countries (www.hefce.com). \r\nIn the face of ongoing global challenges,  developing future generations of leaders is crucial. \r\nThis can be achieved by allowing international students in UK a stay up to 1 year post-study to seek internship placement and gained practical knowledge. Evidence has shown that on-the-job training provides better learning outcomes (Ellstrom,2014)",
        "background": "Capacity of international students to develop their countries is limited due to lack of internship opportunities. Increasing post-study stay to 1 year which was reduced from 2 years to 4months in 2012, will benefit developing countries as international graduates can return with better experience.",
