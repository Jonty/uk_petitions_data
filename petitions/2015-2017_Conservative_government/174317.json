        "additional_details": "It is a simple fact that when HMS Queen Elizabeth comes into service 13 Frigates and 6 Destroyers simply won't be adequate to form a Carrier Group whilst maintaining other global operations. We require AT LEAST 8 Type 26's, 12 T-31's and another 2 Destroyers. The RAF can only muster a pathetic 36 Jets whilst Saudi was deploying 100+ daily in Yemen. We call for immediate action to boost spending to 2.5% of GDP as to regain basic, minimum capability as quickly & efficiently as possible.  ",
        "background": "NATO guidelines put 2% of GDP as the minimum defence spending for NATO countries. I point out the key word: MINIMUM. 2% is the bare minimum. It is not a \"target\". We must endeavour to bring our capabilities back up to adequate standards after careless, thoughtless cuts in the SDSR 2010 & 2015.",
