        "additional_details": "Applying to a senior position in any role requires a senior level of expertise relating to that role.\r\n\r\nIf the public are subject to such strict requirements then certainly our ministers should be too. This would ensure that the policy makers have a credible knowledge and experience to make the right policies for the country, not policies that align solely with their ideology.",
        "background": "Cabinet positions in the government should be based on meeting strict job criteria as in industry. \r\n\r\nFor example, Michael Gove was both the Secretary of State for Education and Justice, yet the different roles require specific knowledge and expertise that is not immediately transferable.
