        "additional_details": "The eligibility for the 30hours is an income of at least \u00a3120 per week(HM Government 2017). Most nursing students do not have the time to work enough hours to gain that, especially whilst on placement. The 30 funded hours would benefit many full-time nursing students as childcare it's so expensive and our income is so little. The bursary only covers up to \u00a3128 per week for one child (NHSBSA 2017) most childcare costs more than that to cover the hours spent at uni and work placements.",
        "background": "I'm Jade and I'm the mother of four year old Alfie. I am coming to the end of my second year of nursing at university. As you may know the childcare funded hours are increasing from 15 to 30 hours per week. The eligibility however, does not include myself nor fellow full-time nursing students.",
