This was because the BMA held firm to their negotiation points which can be found in the link below. \r\n\r\nOn 15 September 2015 the UK Government announced it will impose a new contract on junior doctors working in England from August 2016. \r\n\r\nhttp://bma.org.uk/news-views-analysis/news/2015/september/the-bma-will-fight-any-attempts-to-impose-a-contract",

This new contract holds majors risks to both patient safety and to doctor\u2019s psychological well-being.  ",
