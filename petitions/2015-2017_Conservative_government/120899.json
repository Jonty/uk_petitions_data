As soon as this question is asked the real questions to the employee are: \"Do I give them some food and lose my job?\" or \"Do I kindly tell them no, then carry on working with the knowledge they're starving and I could've helped?\". What if east wasted item could become one less hungry person?",
        "background": "As of the recent wastage ban in France it's came to my attention the amount we're wasting in the UK. Every night Tesco employees have to bag up hundreds of pounds worth of food in each store to be sent to a depot and burnt. This food could be used to help the homeless and less fortunate.",
