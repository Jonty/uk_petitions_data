        "action": "Disallow a second EU referendum",
        "additional_details": "A petition for a second EU referendum has been created and has over 1.5 million signatures. This petition states that if there is a turnout of less than 75%, then either side must gain 60% of the vote to win. A second referendum should not be allowed on this basis, as it is clear that neither side is realistically capable of gaining a 60% majority vote. There would be a never ending string of referendums if these were the conditions for victory.",
        "background": "A second EU referendum should not be allowed as the referendum was carried out fairly, and the result was very clear.",
