A small increase of 49 deaths compared to 2012 did not change the overall rate.    - ons.gov.uk\r\n\r\nApprox 100,000 deaths a year in the UK caused by smoking tobacco.    - ash.org.uk\r\n\r\nThese are still legal despite the research and despite the statistics. It seems the government only seems to have a certain view when it suits them.",
        "background": "Substantial scientific evidence shows that tobacco and alcohol are harmful substances that can damage human health.\r\n\r\nUsing the same logic that the government has towards cannabis, it seems absurd that these 2 substances are legally sold nationwide. This is Hypocrisy and Bigotry at it's finest.",
