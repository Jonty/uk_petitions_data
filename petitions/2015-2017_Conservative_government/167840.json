        "additional_details": "The only way Corbyn got in was because lots of Tories became Labour members and voted him in. He has no support from within his own party and has no confidence from Labour voters, who will now vote for other party's or just not vote. He only remained in his position, as his challenger was weak and worse than he is, so the party voted accordingly. Please please for the sake of the political system in Britain bring back David Miliband& allow a fair challenge for Labour Leadership and let's move on",
        "background": "Jeremy Corbyn is making a laughing stock of Labour. He has spent his whole career being a rebel and campaigning against the EU only now wanting to stay in Europe on Brexit. He wants to take away trident and sit down and hold hands with terrorists. He wants to take us out of NATO and isolate us......",
