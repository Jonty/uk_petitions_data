        "additional_details": "We all know of someone who has been a victim of a telephone scam, usually an elderly relative or neighbour who has been deceived into paying for something they do not want or need. In the worst cases, victims have lost their life savings or even their homes. Fraudsters often start by masquerading as the representative of a familiar company to gain trust. Legitimate companies do not need to use this method of sales. A total ban would stop fraud, save police time and disadvantage no one.",
        "background": "Unsolicited sales calls are an intrusion and frequently result in vulnerable people being duped into paying for goods and services they do not want or need. Recognised companies, organisations and charities using this method merely legitimise the fraudsters to the elderly and vulnerable.  ",
