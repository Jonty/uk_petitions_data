        "action": "Make the 22nd of March a National day of thanks to UK Emergency Services.",
        "additional_details": "With an ever increasing population, the need to reign in on budgets and the constant threat of terrorism, our Emergency Services are under strain. Yet on a daily basis they work around the clock to look after and protect us, running towards danger when many of us would run away. It is often a thankless task, often vilified in the media. The day should be a time where we give thanks to the men and women ofrom our Emergency Services, the best in the world.",
        "background": "Following the tragic events that took place in London on the 22nd March 2017, it's proposed that rather than recall the cowardly acts, we mark the day to give thanks to all Emergency Services who dedicate their lives to helping others, running into danger on a daily basis.",
