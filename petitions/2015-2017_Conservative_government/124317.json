        "additional_details": "It seems wrong that someone can have maternity leave paid but when your partner is dying you are entitled to next to nothing. Given the number of people who have to work full time in order to keep the family home running during these very difficult times, employment law does not reflect this.  If we are a truly 'caring' nation then it is time this is addressed.",
        "background": "My husband is diagnosed with terminal cancer. I work full time (need to) and the only options available to me to care for him during treatment and for longer term care are 3 days compassionate leave, unpaid leave or annual leave. ",
