        "action": "Legislate that road traffic signs which close a lane MUST state \"merge in turn\".",
        "additional_details": "Too much road surface is left unused by road users who believe they must change lanes as directed at the earliest opportunity rather than continue to use all available lanes until the closure of one or more lanes (typically by cones) begins. Additionally, those drivers who DO use all lanes until closures begin are often the object of \"road rage\" of those drivers already in the lane(s) to continue to flow. EG drivers in flowing lanes will not permit drivers in closing lanes to merge.",
        "background": "Rule 134 of the Highway Code relates to multi-lane carriageways. It recommends that drivers should merge in turn when following signs and changing lanes as directed. To support this Rule, all signs, whether permanent or temporary, when closing one or more lanes MUST explicitly state \"merge in turn\".",
