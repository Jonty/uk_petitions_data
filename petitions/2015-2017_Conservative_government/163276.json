        "additional_details": "So called Islamic State are clearly making life hell for the people in the territories they have occupied but by dropping bombs we are only adding to their misery. We are falling into the narrative that Isis has written for us. How can we possibly condemn terrorism whilst murdering innocent people ourselves? It is nonsensical.",
        "background": "The UK's involvement in military action endangers the lives of innocent civilians in the Middle East and here in Britain where we lay ourselves open to terrorist action. The millions spent on war could be better used to come to the aid of the desperate refugees displaced by conflict.",
