        "action": "Make 100% of plastic in the UK recyclable.",
        "additional_details": "The majority of plastic packaging is not currently recyclable and therefore ends up in landfill or in the sea where it is eroded and broken down into tiny pieces. It is then consumed by fish and thereafter enters the human foods chain. Scientists are currently researching the long terms effects on humans of consuming this plastic. This petition is for the enforcement of 100% plastic recycling in the UK by manufacturers and producers, and to enforce 100% recycling on all packaging materials.",
        "background": "The majority of products purchase in the UK are wrapped in non recyclable plastics and end up in landfill. The government should enforce 100% plastic recycling in the UK and enforce manufacturers and producers to wrap their products in recyclable materials only, plastic of otherwise.",
