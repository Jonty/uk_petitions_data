        "additional_details": "I sit a watch the news everyday and see acts of terrorism and violence reported with innocent life's taken. I look on social media and find that people make videos abusing the police And smashing there cars and today I saw a video of a police officer get whacked with a road cone. Youngsters casually taking drugs on street corners and riding motorcycles in an anti social manner without a proper licence or insurance. Theft is rife and roads are like race tracks. Gun presence will make people safer",
        "background": "The Westminster attack would have ended more severe had no armed officers been present. We have around 400 Jihadi fighters back in Britain from Mosul, Iraq & Syria. The lack of respect from youngsters that blatantly deal drugs and rob in front of the public and carry weapons like its normal.  ",
