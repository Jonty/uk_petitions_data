        "additional_details": "We know asking to ban Halal meat is unrealistic. Halal is here to stay and there is nothing we can do about that, but all we ask for is a simple label. There are many people who do not wish to eat Halal meat for many reasons. Whether it be because of the mistreatment of animals or their own religious beliefs. These people have a right to decide for themselves. So please give us back the freedom of choice.\r\n\r\nlabel all Halal and any other ritually slaughtered meat.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Hundreds of thousands of supermarkets and restaurants in the UK are selling Halal and other ritually slaughtered meat without labeling. This removes an individual's right and freedom of choice. We should be allowed to make an informed decision on what we wish to eat and where our meat is coming from",
