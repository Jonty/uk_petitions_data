        "additional_details": "People have voted to leave for a variety of reasons. The reasons need to be layed out and people need to stand behind what they want. Only then should we be negotiating on these terms. Having a non elected PM choose what they think people want is not a mandate from the people on what they want. A general election gives all parties a chance to make their case and allow the people to stand behind what they voted out for. ",
        "background": "The country has voted to leave the EU but has not voted on what is up for negotiation. There is a huge divide between having less control from Brussels through to controlling  borders. We need to decide as a county what we are negotiating and who does it on our behalf. ",
