        "additional_details": "Despite what the property lobby claim, increasing the supply of houses will not reduce property prices in the SE. Extra supply simply increases the crisis by adding a population crisis on top of a housing crisis. The single biggest factor in the rise of house prices to their current incredible levels is the growth of a vast foreign buyer segment which has fatally distorted the market in the SE. \r\n\r\nSee this recent report on the issue by Civitas.\r\nhttp://www.civitas.org.uk/press/PRshelter.html\r\n",
