        "additional_details": "The present loop-hole allows sellers to sell inferior imported traps that have not been type-approved by DEFRA. This causes unnecessary suffering as these inferior traps often maim rather than give an instant kill. \r\n\r\nThese imports are undemining the businesses in the UK that manufacture the genuine approved products.",
        "background": "At present it is only illegal to USE non-approved traps. \r\nThe law should be extended to ban the SALE of any trap not approved under the Spring Traps Approval Order 2012. \r\n\r\n",
