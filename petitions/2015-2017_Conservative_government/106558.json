        "additional_details": "Every qualifying child is entitled to 570 hours a year of free childcare in a nursery of their choice. This adds up to an average spend per child of \u00a32565. Where is this money coming from? The tax payer. The tax payers which are also paying for their own childcare to enable them to work. And what are the parents of these qualifying children doing? There is no rules which stipulate they must be in education or job hunting, nothing. If like me you think this is unfair, please sign this petition.",
        "background": "Did you know that if you are a working parent you have to pay for childcare up until the term after your child's third birthday? However if you are on benefits this is brought forward to the term after your child's second birthday! That is an entire year worth of free childcare.",
