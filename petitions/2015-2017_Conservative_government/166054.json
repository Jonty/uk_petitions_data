The CQC said the leadership did not proactively address risks \u201cbefore concerns are raised by external bodies\u201d.\r\n\r\nA Southern spokeswoman said Percy\u2019s new role would be \u201cproviding strategic advice to local GP leaders\u201d and her salary would not change. \r\n\r\n\r\n ",

On her watch, the unexplained deaths of more than a thousand vulnerable people were not properly investigated. She will continue to draw a salary & perks of \u00a3240k/pa. This is an obscene reward for utter failure.  ",
