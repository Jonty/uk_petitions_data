        "action": "Agree key Brexit plans and put them to referendum before Art 50 notice is given.",
        "additional_details": "If we give Art 50 notice to leave the EU then we can be removed from the EU in 2 years, regardless of whether there is a trade deal with the EU (or others). On 23 June we voted with no information on ANY of these. HM Government should promptly open negotiations with the EU and trading partners and put these deals, once agreed, to a referendum. Only if the electorate accepts these terms should we leave. An Act of Parliament should prohibit giving Art 50 notice before authorisation by referendum.",
        "background": "The referendum was held with no new deal with the EU, no new trade deals lined up and no future immigration policy. There is no democracy without informed consent. These should be agreed then put to a referendum to allow the people to give informed consent. There must be no Art 50 notice until then.",
