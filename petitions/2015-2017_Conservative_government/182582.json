Our NHS is in crisis and this is one of the major factors. \r\n\r\nEmergency treatment is the only time when this should not apply, because we have to stay a passionate country. But minor injuries and surgery should always be charged when the patient is not a UK Tax and National Insurance payer.\r\n",
