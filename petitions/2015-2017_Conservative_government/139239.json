        "action": "Delay implementing the result of the referendum on EU membership.",
        "additional_details": "The current Government was elected on the promise of an EU referendum, which they have honoured. However the Prime Minister has now announced his resignation and the conflict within the current ruling party means an unstable Government too busy squabbling to serve this Country properly. The decision to leave the EU was made by a tiny majority. Such a huge change from the status quo should be backed up by an General Election where each MP stands making clear their views on EU membership. Only after such an election and the agreement of Parliament, should official notice be given to the EU on the decision to leave.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "This petition requests that MPs delay leaving the EU until after the next General Election, which they could choose to hold early if two thirds so wished. With an issue as big as leaving the EU facing the Country, a Government should be strong and have the full backing of its people. ",
