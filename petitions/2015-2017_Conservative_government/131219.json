Most religious practice is not private and cannot be done in private.  Baptism is not private, confession is not private, answering questions about faith is not private and it should not be a public offence to quote a sacred text when MP's can publicly swear upon when taking office!",

Why in our 'free' country are we increasingly protecting the public freedom from religion instead of protecting the freedom of it?",
