That's not asking the right question. If those same three million people could sign this, the right question is being asked of the government. The referendum is a measure of public feeling, and is not legally binding. ",
        "background": "Only 37.4% of the British public voted Leave. Out of a potential 46,501,241 voters, 17,410,742 voted Leave. The rest voted Remain or did not vote. We should ask the government to respond to public feeling and not trigger Article 50, but instead embark on massive reform at home and in the EU. ",
