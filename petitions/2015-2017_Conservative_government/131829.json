        "additional_details": "Electoral fraud is much easier to perpetrate through postal voting than voting in person as the opportunities for personation offences are multiplied significantly compared to where a person needs to present themselves at a polling station.\r\n\r\nIf there is significant variance between the two counts, any irregularities can be more easily highlighted and if necessary, investigated.",
        "background": "Given widespread concerns about the potential for electoral fraud being easier to perpetrate through postal voting than 'in-person' voting, we propose that postal votes be counted separately from the 'in-person' vote and the numbers for each count be published when the results are declared.",
