        "additional_details": "When we have a general election we vote for that leader of that party and their manifesto. If this candidate then gets elected and resigns a year or two into their term, then currently we have no say in the next leader of the current party in government and consequently their political agenda.\r\n\r\nIt's not democratic and it's unfair on the vast majority of people. This needs to change. ",
        "background": "When an elected Prime Minister resigns it's undemocratic to then be stuck with a new Prime Minister that hasn't been elected into office. An example would be the resignation of David Cameron and consequently now having Theressa May has PM despite not being fairly elected into public office. ",
