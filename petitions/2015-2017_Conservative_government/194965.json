Childcare providers would never not be paid again as the money would come direct to them. No investigations into fraudulent claims anymore saving the government millions of lost pounds. As childcare providers we help parents/carers waiting to be paid and sometimes it never comes leaving us out of pocket but the government has paid for our service. ",

As childcare providers too many of us have expirenced not being paid what's owed to us as parents/carers spend it on things they deem important. If we are paid direct it would save the government millions of pounds.",
