This means that it will assess the planning application against certain criteria and decide if a full inquiry is needed. For more information, including the criteria and how to request the call in of a planning application, see:\r\n\r\nhttp://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN00930/SN00930.pdf\r\n\r\nIf you want the UK Government or Parliament to take action, for example to amend the legislation and policy framework which governs planning and development decisions taken by local authorities, you could start a new petition specifically asking for that action to be taken across England.\r\n\r\nIf you have already made a complaint to the council, and you are not happy with how it has been handled, the Local Government Ombudsman may be able to give you some advice:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lgo.org.uk/"
