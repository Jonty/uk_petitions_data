        "additional_details": "When David Cameron delivered his resignation speech outside No 10 on Friday, he said he would leave the task of triggering article 50 of the Lisbon treaty \u2013 the untested procedure governing how an EU member state leaves the bloc \u2013 to his successor.\r\n\r\nThis has prompted much speculation \u2013 and a glimmer of hope for those who want Britain to remain in the European Union. Cameron, they argue, had repeatedly said during the campaign that article 50 would be triggered immediately if Vote Leave were to win the Brexit referendum.",
        "background": "When the European Union member states drafted and then approved the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007, they did not think anyone would ever want to leave.",
