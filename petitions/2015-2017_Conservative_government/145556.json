        "action": "Establish a constitutional convention to decide the future direction of the UK",
        "additional_details": "A constitutional convention would allow a wide public debate on important issues about the type of UK we want to become including:\r\n\r\n- improving our democracy through an elected House of Lords\r\n- should the head of state be elected\r\n- a fairer voting system that maximises people's voices\r\n- the type of relationship we want with the EU and the single market\r\n\r\nA constitutional convention would allow voices of people across the UK to be heard and would lead to the drafting of a UK constitution.",
        "background": "The result of the EU referendum has fundamentally changed the future of the country. However the vote was on a narrow question about a single issue. Everyone in the UK should now get a say in what type of country they want us to become once we are outside the EU.",
