        "additional_details": "Schedule 2 currently fails to adequately and explicitly allow for the cumulative fatigue suffered by those with CFS, resulting in many sufferers needing to appeal. An amended test that explicitly takes the cumulative consequences of repeated physical and mental activity into account is needed to treat those with this condition more fairly.",
        "background": "This government should amend Schedule 2 of the Employment and Support Allowance Regulations 2008 and 2013 so that the limited capability for work assessment is better able to assess the disabilities of people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.",
