        "additional_details": "Only 37% of the electorate voted to leave, winning the decision to leave Europe by just 3.8 percentage points. Put another way, if just 634,751 leavers had voted to remain the result would have been reversed.\r\n\r\nThe government \"decided\" on the third runway at Heathrow but then allowed discussion and a debate in parliament in 2017 or 2018! Following that example, it seems only right to allow time for reflection and debate, followed by a second referendum to confirm the people's will on the matter.",
        "background": "The momentous decision to leave Europe was won by a small margin. Following the government's lead on making \"decisions\", we seek to confirm the people's will to leave (or remain in) Europe.",
