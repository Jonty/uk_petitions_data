        "additional_details": "It is of extreme importance that Children remain safe in there home, it is also important that the removal of a Child should be investigated and full evidence of the facts are laid before the family court before a removal of a child. Where a Child welfare must be investigated, the child should be put into the care of a alternative family member such as grandparents until the investigation is complete. It does not benefit a child by being placed with a foster carer who the child does not know",
        "background": "In 2004 Minister for Children Margret Hodge enforced a Act of Law relating to the child act. This act gave more power to Social Services and the courts to remove Children from there home with no real foundation or evidence. It has caused excellent parents to loose there children.",
