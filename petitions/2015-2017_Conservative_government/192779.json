        "additional_details": "I am starting this petition to request that our government try a new anti-terrorist tactic. Prevent the British media from naming the criminal. Stop the hysteria. Let's not give them their 'glory'. If the media name them and day after day, and we go over and over the details of their disgusting acts then I feel we are giving into them and giving them the sickening fame they crave. As journalist Simon Jenkins puts it, we are 'aiding and abetting terrorism'. Lets try a new tactic. Don't name them.",
        "background": "After the incident in Westminster this week, I have been increasingly frustrated about the amount of hype and frenzy surrounding the coverage of the attack. I have felt for some time now that the amount of publicity that our media gives terrorism is encouraging their sickening acts. ",
