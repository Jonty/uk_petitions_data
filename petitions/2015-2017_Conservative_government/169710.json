        "additional_details": "There is no legal obligation not to park in a parent and child space in car parks and I see almost daily people without children parking in these spaces. These spaces are not there to be closer to the shop, they are there so that doors can be opened to allow people to get car seats out of the car without injuring anyone or damaging vehicles and they are generally next to a footpath so that children are safe off of the road. I want people who park without children under 12 to be issued a fine.",
