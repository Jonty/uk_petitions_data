Public transport fares are not set directly by the Government.\r\n\r\nIn the case of buses, local bus operators (bus companies) are free to set their own fares. However, local transport authorities (usually local councils) have the power to set maximum fares in some circumstances. For trains, the price of train tickets is the responsibility of train operating companies, although the Government can set the rate by which train operating companies can raise ticket prices. \r\n\r\nIf you would like the Government to provide a subsidy for school children using public transport, you could start a new petition calling for that.
