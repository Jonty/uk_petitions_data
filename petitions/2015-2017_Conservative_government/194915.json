        "additional_details": "Despite detailed reports from Amnesty International, independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta and Human Rights Watch, the British Government have made no statement. Turning a blind eye whilst gay men die in concentration camps is not an option. The silence is deafening. We urge May, Johnson, and the British Government to come out in condemnation of the despicable, state-sanctioned atrocities reportedly being committed against LGBT Chechens. ",
        "background": "The government of the Chechen Republic have reportedly imprisoned more than 100 gay men in a \"concentration camp\" where they are subject to beatings and torture. Rather than condemn the wrongful, arbitrary imprisonment and torture of LGBT people, Theresa May's government has remained silent. ",
