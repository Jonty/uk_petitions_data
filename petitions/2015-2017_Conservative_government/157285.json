        "additional_details": "The consultation began Wednesday 29 June 2016 and closes on Wednesday 5 October 2016.\r\n\r\nThe proposals are to close more than 100 beds across Nth Derbyshire, who currently care for the elderly and dementia sufferers.\r\n\r\nThis petition is with particular references to the Cavendish Hospital.\r\n\r\nIt is unacceptable to expect patients / relatives to travel to CRH  / Walton Hospital for services which are currently provided within the Cavendish. We oppose any changes to the Cavendish.  ",
        "background": "Spencer Ward at the Cavendish Hospital is earmarked for closure under new proposals. \r\n\r\nThis will mean that the Cavendish Hospital, will have just 8 Beds to serve the needs of the High Peak area.\r\n\r\nThis is unacceptable and in short we oppose these changes.\r\n",
