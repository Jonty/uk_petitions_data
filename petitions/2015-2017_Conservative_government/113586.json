        "action": "Immediately accept BMA offer of ACAS mediation, to avoid a strike by doctors.",
        "additional_details": "Doctors question how they will, in future, quickly and effectively challenge excessive hours, seek clarity on new rosters, given that the same number of doctors will be spread over a longer working week and need better modelling of old versus new contract pay scales to ensure they don't lose out.\r\n\r\nWhat matters is that a strike is avoided. For the sake of patients, the government should now go to ACAS.",
        "background": "Trust between Secretary of State Jeremy Hunt and junior doctors seems irreparable. Doctors feel insulted by the SoS and his negotiation by media and fear the outcome of the 'to be imposed' new contract will result in even more unpaid hours (staying late, where necessary, due to staff shortages).
