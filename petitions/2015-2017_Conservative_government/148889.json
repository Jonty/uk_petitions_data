        "action": "Ensure that planning for the implementation of the EU exit is fully cross- party",
        "additional_details": "The EU referendum campaigning for Leave and Remain was a fragmented mess of claims and counter claims playing on the fears and hopes of our nation, (with each party running their own campaign), many of which are now being withdrawn (eg NHS funding and immigration controls). The Leave vote won but neither Leave nor Remain campaigners had a strategy for what happens next. We need our EU position to be negotiated in the national interest, not waylaid by party politics to ensure a stable future.",
        "background": "David Cameron has resigned. The new Prime Minister should concentrate on governing the UK. The planning and implementation of our EU position should be a fully cross-party group, not headed by the PM, (with both Leave and Remain MPs and appropriate other people) acting in our national interests.",
