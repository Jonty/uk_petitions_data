        "additional_details": "The call for a re-run of the recent EU referendum on the basis that the result did not meet the criteria of a 60% majority on a turnout of at least 75% flies in the face of every democratic election or referendum since 1865 when Gladstone was elected with 61.5% of the popular vote. To accept this call would be to invalidate the 1975 referendum as it did not meet those criteria. It would also set a very dangerous precedent for future elections.",
        "background": "In the annals of British democracy a simple majority has always been the criteria for deciding elections. The government should uphold this principle and accept the declared will of the people in the recent EU referendum.",
