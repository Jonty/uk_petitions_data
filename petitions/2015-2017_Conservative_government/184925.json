        "additional_details": "The rate will then change every April starting April 2017. The rates from 1 April 2017 will be:\r\n\r\n\u00a37.50 per hour - 25 yrs old and over\r\n\u00a37.05 per hour - 21-24 yrs old\r\n\u00a35.60 per hour - 18-20 yrs old\r\n\r\nHowever 66% of voters believe the new higher rate should also be given to workers under-25, compared to 24% who do not.\r\n\r\nAt 18 you become a legal adult in UK, therefore you should be able earn the same as an 25 and over does. This lets companies rid youngsters off for doing the same work as an over25!\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "he National Living Wage only applies to workers aged 25+, meaning those aged 18-21 can be paid 26% less for the same work and those aged 21-24 nearly 7% less.\r\n\r\nIt also goes against the UK electorate. A Survation poll in September 2016 shows 66% of voters believe the NLW should apply to under-25s.",
