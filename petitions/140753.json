        "additional_details": "Under our democratic system, which is a first past the post system, Leave polled the most votes. To instigate a 2nd EU Referendum vote and ignore the will of the majority in this matter can lead to a constitutional crisis, and will, without doubt, put Parliament at odds with the will of the people. Parliament should therefore reject the petition that demanded a 2nd EU referendum.",
        "background": "There was no clause in the EU Referendum that stated one side or the other (Leave or Remain) needed to win by a specific percentage. The only requirement was for each eligible voter to declare whether he/she wished to leave the EU or remain.",
