        "additional_details": "The UK no longer has the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland in its heart. The willingness of the English people to leave the European Union goes against the wishes of the Northern Irish population therefore it is time to reevaluate our relationship and union with the United Kingdom. It is time to turn to our own island and its population, north and south of the border, to plan for a future out of the United Kingdom and in the EU, to forge a new future for the people of Ireland.",
        "background": "The majority of people in northern ireland voted to remain in Europe during the \"brexit\" referendum.  Northern Ireland's decision has been discounted.  It is our democratic right to decide the future of our Island through a poll on whether to unite the Ireland and remain in the EU. ",
