        "additional_details": "Amongst the promises made, was the referendum on the EU, which was lost by government, when it campaigned for and expected to win. \r\nThe United Kingdom now faces its greatest challenges in more than a generation, with a leader who wasn't elected as such, without a mandate to lead, and without popular backing for her plans or ideals.\r\n\r\nGiven the challenges and changes the country now faces, the new leadership MUST face a General Election to ensure popular backing.",
        "background": "Barely a year since the General Election, the Conservative party, lead by David Cameron was given a mandate on their promises.\r\nThe outlook, like the Prime Minister, has changed significantly in that time, and a General Election MUST be called to validate the mandate of the new PM.\r\n",
