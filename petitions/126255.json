        "additional_details": "A quick look around any web review sites will see that ALL the energy companies use the veil of broken IT systems as the reason for putting the already dysfunctional energy sector under greater pressure.\r\nOver charging; reverse billing; applying exit fees when not due - the list is fairly exhaustive.\r\nWith an average telephone hold time of in excess of 40 minutes and without any resolution I fear many old people would simply pay just out of ignorance or peace of mind.\r\nOffgen need more muscle.",
        "background": "The UK energy companies are deliberately over charging tens of thousands of customers every year, citing technology problems for the billing shambles.  This is opportunist and the appalling customer service means that often the most vulnerable and least able are forced to overpay for their energy",
