        "action": "Stop the UK Government leaving the EU without consent from Scottish Parliament.",
        "additional_details": "Scotland has to agree to the UK leaving the EU in order for Brexit to go ahead. A second referendum is extremely unlikely. The best chance we have of stopping the UK proceeding with leaving the EU is for the Scottish Parliament to refuse to give formal legislative consent.",
        "background": "Brexit politicians misled millions of voters on immigration, funding, the NHS, and the economic impact of leaving the EU.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call on David Cameron and Nicola Sturgeon to ensure the views of the Scottish people are represented and cease the process of leading the UK out of the EU.
