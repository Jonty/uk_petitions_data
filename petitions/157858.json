        "action": "Create a system in which breached child contact orders can be enforced quickly",
        "additional_details": "The parent breaching the court order is breaking the law yet it is the other parent, and the children, who suffer. It can take 4 months to get a date for the original order to be enforced which is unacceptable. The parent breaching the court order should be forced to pay all costs and this process should take a maximum of, for example, 30 days. This will minimise the emotional impact on the children and parents whilst reducing the occurance of breached orders.",
        "background": "Parents are being ripped away from their children for months after a separation while they await a court hearing. They spend thousands to get a court order which, if breached, has to be brought to court to be enforced. The wronged parent incurs all costs and is again seperated from his/her children.",
