        "additional_details": "According to the British Election Study, the proportion of registered 18 to 24-year-olds turning out to vote has consistently been below every other age group since the 1970s.\r\n\r\nEurobarometer suggested that young British adults are among the least engaged with the political process when comparing their peers across Europe.\r\n\r\nYoung people do not only vote less, but research by the Electoral Commission suggests they are less likely to be on the electoral register than other age groups.",
        "background": "Turnout has fallen from over 60% in the early 1990s to an average of 40% and is estimated around 36% for Brexit. More funding is needed for neutral education on the system and process.\r\n",
