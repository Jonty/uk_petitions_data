        "background": "We want teachers and students to be more aware about homophobia within schools. By teaching teenagers in their PCSHE lessons about the LGBT community and why it's wrong to discriminate and bully we can help to stop the ever so popular \"that's so gay\" phrase being used in schools all over the UK.",
