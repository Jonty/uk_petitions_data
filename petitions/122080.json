        "additional_details": "This is a zero cost proposal; no public money needs to be spent. If this proposal is adopted these committees will be more democratic and more worthy of trust from the people that they represent. Cynicism is rife regarding local government Councillors. This proposal will go some way to reducing this. Councillors should be accountable to the people who vote for them. How can they be held to account if we can't know how they vote? ",
        "background": "These committees take decisions affecting our lives. Their decisions can be worth \u00a3millions to developers. The current system where votes are counted on a show of hands is unsatisfactory. These committees are open to corruption. Parliament must pass a law requiring Councillor's votes be published.",
