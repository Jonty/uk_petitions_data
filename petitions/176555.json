        "additional_details": "1 in 10 children and young people aged 5 - 16 suffer from a diagnosable mental health disorder - that is around three children in every class. \r\n\r\nThere has been a big increase in the number of young people being admitted to hospital because of self harm. Over the last ten years this figure has increased by 68%. \r\n\r\nMore than half of all adults with mental health problems were diagnosed in childhood. Less than half were treated appropriately at the time. \r\n\r\nSource: YoungMinds \r\n",
        "background": "Mental health education is still not part of the UK curriculum despite consistently high rates of child and adolescent mental health issues. By educating young people about mental health in schools, we can increase awareness and hope to encourage open and honest discussion among young people. ",
