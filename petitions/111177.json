        "additional_details": "The mechanics of voting on issues does not seem to me very different in principle from elections/ballots, which are widely available on-line.\r\nWith the pervasive nature of the Internet it does not seem unlikely that it will be widely used for at least informational consultation on issues in the next 10 years and quite likely for legislative decision making soon after that is an accepted way of operating.\r\nThe UK parliament should use it talent and experience to get ahead of the game.",
        "background": "It seems illogical for the benefits of modern communication in ascertaining the wishes of the governed to be ignored by the governors.  The process for internet voting is well established, all that is required is voter verification and qualification.",
