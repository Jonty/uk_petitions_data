THAT IS JUST IN THE US THINK OF CHINA AND JAPAN AND GERMANY. \r\n\r\nNo experiment is illegal, no matter how cruel, irrelevant to human health, redundant, or painful.\r\n\r\nNinety-five percent of animals used for experiments are excluded from the only federal law offering any sort of protection.\r\n\r\nEven when valid alternatives to animals are available, the law doesn\u2019t require that they be used.\r\n\r\nNinety-two percent of experimental drugs that are safe and effective on animals fail in human clinical trials because they don\u2019t work or are dangerous.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The population of the UK do not understand the amount of pain and torture that animals have to go through for the sake of our vanity. \r\nSo humans have rights but  animals don't? \r\nWe are animals, but having a higher IQ and apposable thumbs suddenly means we can abuse innocent creatures? !",
