        "additional_details": "People from outside the EU can bring so much more to Great Britain, these people are willing to work & not be on benefits or sponge off British People. As a young man wanting to start a family just like many others but these per annum incomes is nothing but a barrier between loved ones. We need a U-Turn on this. Many are in my shoes & we plead to the Government & the people of Britain to not put an overrated per annum.\r\n\r\nNorth East of England is no where close in getting.\r\n\r\nI want to enjoy life.",
        "background": "Britain's wages in North East England cannot get jobs that is equivalent to \u00a318,600 per annum. It is absurd & not fit for purpose, take into consideration full time applicants who are on minimum wage & can afford for both people. Also people from outside EU are qualified individuals.",
