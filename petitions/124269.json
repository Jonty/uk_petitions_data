        "additional_details": "In the UK, a man commits rape if he \"intentionally penetrates a male or female with his penis, without the person\u2019s consent.\" This sexual offence can only be committed by a man. A woman can NOT be charged with the offence as rape is defined as penile penetration, but she may be charged with another offence. I feel if the law was equal, (that both men and women can commit statutory rape) teenage boys would be more comfortable reporting the crime, rather than feeling injustice. I want equality.",
        "background": "I'm calling for the MoJ to fix the inequality regarding the law of statutory rape for under 18's. Only 20% of REPORTED statutory rape cases last year were on boys and 80% on girls. I believe this shocking percentage has a correlation to the law regarding under-age sex and prosecution.",
