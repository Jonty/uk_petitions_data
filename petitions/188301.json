        "additional_details": "We urge our government to think again and appreciate the value of their own health. We ask them to understand disability is not a straight forward topic and that is why we have professional input from doctors and experts who know how illness effects us in daily life financially due to appointments, mobility, safety and living a some what decent life. We ask our government not to descend our disabled people in to poor health or our standards as a nation.",
        "background": "Theresa May has taken it upon herself to cut 160,000 peoples disability benefits without consulting social security experts. This will include with dementia, mental health, epilepsy & those who have suffered strokes etc. This is a shameful decision that will make life harder for those vulnerable.",
