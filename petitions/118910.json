        "additional_details": "On 9th of January, CND campaigners who were following a nuclear convoy between the Burghfield bomb factory in Berkshire and the Royal Naval Armaments Depot at Coulport on Loch Long tracked the route taken by the convoy past Hamilton, and through Stirling, and Balloch \u2014\u00a0residential areas.\r\n\r\nThe ability for anti-nuclear campaigners to follow the convoy also shows the potential for terrorists to do the same.\r\n\r\nNuclear convoys have also been spotted driving through icy and snowy conditions.",
        "background": "The UK\u2019s nuclear warheads regularly travel in convoys between bomb factories around the UK, and the Royal Naval Armaments Depot at Coulport on Loch Long \u2014\u00a0passing near and through many residential areas.\r\n\r\nThe potential fallout of an accident along these routes would be devastating.",
