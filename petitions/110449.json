        "additional_details": "As stated when Towing anything it is required that Both the towing vehicle and the trailer or caravan are to be Level, again most are not and cause light steering or the rear wheels being light, in both cases this causes poor control and accidents and why they are restricted in the first place, this should be common sense to the owners and the Police who turn a blind eye.",
        "background": "Many Lorries and Towing vehicles do the same speed as normal traffic which is dangerous as Lorries with a Heavy load require much longer distance to stop, plus the fact in an accident cause more damage.\r\n\r\nAlso the ones who tow a Caravan are restricted to '60' but most exceed this by a large amount.",
