        "additional_details": "Mental health services are under huge pressure. 40 per cent of mental health trusts experienced reductions in income in 2013/14 and 2014/15. There is widespread evidence of poor-quality care. Bed occupancy in inpatient facilities is frequently well above recommended levels, community services are often unable to provide sufficient levels of support to compensate for reductions in beds. This is having a negative impact on safety and quality of care. No more cuts to budgets. Kings Fund (2015)",
        "background": "Cuts in mental health budgets have lead to a reduction in mental health inpatient beds available, and reorganisation of community services have been driven by cost savings rather than best practice or evidence based practice. More people are being sent 'out of city' when they need to be in hospital.",
