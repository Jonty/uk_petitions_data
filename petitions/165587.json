        "additional_details": "Although the current rules are supposed to offer protection, as Sellers are meant to inform Buyers of serious defects if a previous sale has fallen through etc this is often not enforced. Instead late in the process, after the Buyer has already paid for a host of surveys, the true cost of the property becomes apparent. Having the survey completed first would make everyone aware of all issues at the start of the process, making life easier for all involved.",
        "background": "When selling a property the building survey should be completed by the seller before it can go on the market, so that all parties involved are aware of any serious defects.This would expediate the process for buyers, who often only discover the property's faults late in the process, but also sellers",
