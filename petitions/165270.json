        "additional_details": "Late payment can severely impact a freelancer especially during a period of no work therefore it is important that they are able to claim fair compensation, not only to deter companies from exploiting them but to live. If a freelancer were to work one day for \u00a3100 and were not paid within 30 days of the client receiving the invoice, the freelancer could claim 8.25% interest (Bank of England base rate of 0.25%) meaning the annual interest would be \u00a38.25 (approximately 0.0226 pence per day).  ",
        "background": "Under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts Act 1998, Businesses can claim 8% interest plus the current Bank of England base rate. However this is not enough to deter larger companies from taking advantage of freelancers carrying out non-contracted work, i.e a one-off job. ",
