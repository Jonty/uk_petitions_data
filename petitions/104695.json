        "additional_details": "Evidence of the proportion of tax per litre is published by the Government.\r\nIt is a fact not here-say.\r\nIt is an outrageous amount to pay considering the actual cost of the product.\r\nThe motorist is paying more than his fair share to the economy given that fuel duty is spent on everything not just roads, then it is indeed an unfair tax.\r\nBringing it in line with the rest of Europe would be a fair option considering we are at the moment an EU Country.\r\n",
        "background": "Fuel is a massive part of many working people's budget and any reduction in price would have a positive effect on all families.\r\nThe knock on effect from this would be a boost for the economy as many people would have increased disposable income. \r\n",
