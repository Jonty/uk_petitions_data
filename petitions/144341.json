        "additional_details": "The Fixed Term Parliaments Act (2011), Section 2 provides a number of ways that an early general election can be held, one of these being if the House of Commons has \"no confidence in Her Majesty's Government\". \r\n\r\nIt is hard for anyone to have confidence in a government who decided to hold a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union, blunder through leave and remain campaigns and then for there to be no exit plan in place for the country when it was decided we should leave.",
        "background": "On Friday 24th June 2016 David Cameron made the public decision to step down as Prime Minister. \r\n\r\nThis will result in an unelected Prime Minister taking control of the country. \r\n\r\nWhy should an unelected person be able make decisions about our country going foward after our split from the EU?",
