        "action": "Keep gay marriage legalised",
        "additional_details": "I'd like to address the fact that if gay marriage is made illegal again, it's teaching members of the gay community, young and old, that their sexuality is wrong, which could end in suicide rates increasing. There is nothing wrong about two people of the same sex joining hands in marriage. Their sexuality doesn't define them.  \r\n\r\nThe point of this petition is to be able to prove that yes, some people may be against gay marriage,\r\nbut they can't forget the vote of the people who want it kept legal.",
        "background": "Recently, there's been a petition set up reevaluating wheither or not gay marriage should continue to be Legalised. This petition is set up for those who agree it should be legal, and just because gay marriage may not be accepted in some eyes, doesn't mean the marital rights should be taken away. ",
