        "action": "Make a Halal, Sharia-compliant car insurance model available for Muslims.",
        "additional_details": " The typical contract of insurance is categorically Haram in Islam, as it includes the element of uncertainty: gharar. Therefore, it is proposed that, similar to the Sharia compliant student loans, a Halal form of car insurance is created for the thousands of Muslim drivers (as well as many more potential drivers, for whom the only deterrent is their faith's prohibition), where they can uphold the harmony and security created by such an institution whilst adhering to their own religious ideals.",
        "background": "Muslims number close to 3 million in the UK, and are steadily growing. Living in the UK, they have embraced British society and become fully integrated. Yet they are forced to compromise a fundamental principle of their religion when it comes to car insurance; a legal requirement for all drivers. ",
