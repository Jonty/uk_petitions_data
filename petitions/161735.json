        "action": "Exclude the Armed Forces core meal provision from the 20% VAT rate",
        "additional_details": "The increase is due to PAYD facilities having to charge VAT on the DFC, which in turn reduces the amount of money left to actually provide the meal.\r\n\r\nWith little cooking facilities available to service personnel living in military accommodation, it is unfair to ask such personnel to pay the 20% VAT rate when they have little or no other options for cooking their own meal(s).\r\n\r\nCore meal provisions are not a luxury and should not be charged as such.",
        "background": "While the last review left the Daily Food Charge set at \u00a34.79, from October the 1st the cost of a core meal at a Pay As You Dine facility will increase to \u00a35.75 to account for VAT at the 20% rate.\r\n\r\nNo VAT should be paid on core meal provisions or proper cooking facilities should be provided.",
