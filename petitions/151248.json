        "action": "Britain should apply to become the 51st state of the United States of America",
        "additional_details": "Under Article IV, Section 3, of the US Constitution, any territory may apply to Congress to join the United States. As the 51st US state, Great Britain would gain all the economic and military backing of the US federal government whilst also being free to draft its own state constitution and effectively retain its sovereignty. This would have the added advantage of allowing the UK Government to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty sooner than October in order to re-stabilise the EU economy.",
        "background": "In light of the result of the EU Referendum held on Thursday 23 June and the immediate concomitant decline in the UK economy, it would be germain to enter into a stronger economic union with the United States of America at the earliest possible opportunity.",
