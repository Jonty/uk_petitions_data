        "additional_details": "Brexit has enormous implications for the UK, and the rest of Europe. It was made clear before the EU referendum that this would be a one-time-only vote. People need to accept the verdict, but with campaign misinformation (both sides), news of people already changing their minds now that real facts starting to hit home, means the government, and the people, can no longer be certain it's what the majority wants.   We believe that these are extra-ordinary conditions that justify a final referendum.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call for a final EU referendum due to the very real possibility that with such a small (3.8%) margin, enough voters may have already changed their minds now that reality is starting to hit home.  It's highly irresponsible to make such a huge change without checking this first.\r\n ",
