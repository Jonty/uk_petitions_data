        "additional_details": "People wishing to leave safe countries, for whatever reason, are not refugees.We have thousands of homeless British people, and many more unable to get the medical attention they need, because of insufficient funds. Until these issues are entirely resolved, no further non EU citizens should be admitted to Britain for the purpose of seeking asylum. Any found here illegally must be deported, with no right of appeal, immediately.\r\n",
        "background": "Pressure is being applied by the media and foreign governments to admit thousands of non EU citizens who claim to be fleeing war zones, or suffering persecution. Most of these are false claims as can be seen from the condition, demography,  and geographical locations of the claimants.\r\n",
