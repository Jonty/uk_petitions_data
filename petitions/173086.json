        "additional_details": "Teaching kids, teenagers and adults with disabilities isn't rocket science. It just takes a bit of training and a lot of patience. Not only would it be great for the teachers to be able to teach both neurotypical and disabled children, but it would also help the children, they would feel more socially accepted and not put down by a disability they can't help thenselves having (or, as I see it, a gift too special for people to handle). Please help raise awareness and maybe get training in place.",
        "background": "My brother has autism spectrum disorder and went to many mainstream schools. He was bullied and taken advantage of by the kids and teachers never understood his meltdowns, having to come and get me. I think that ALL teachers, need to be trained and qualified on how to teach ALL types of children.",
