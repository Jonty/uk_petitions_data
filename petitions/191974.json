        "action": "Make all CCG's ensure access to Minor injury unit or A& E within 15 mile radius",
        "additional_details": "Rural communities particularly those on the coasts receive poorer services overall and rural poverty and isolation is ignored because it is spread and hidden.\r\nIn paces where there are seasonal employment car ownership is lower.\r\nIn the case of Withernsea, residents will have no choice but to go to the full A and E at Hull Royal which like most is already under pressure.",
        "background": "East Riding CCG is downgrading and closing minor injury unit and ceasing services such as community X Ray, therapies, rehab beds in two isolated coastal towns, one of which, Withernsea has low car ownership. The replacement service is 29 miles and not accessible by public transport. ",
