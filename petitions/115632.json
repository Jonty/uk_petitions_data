        "action": "Put an end to state funded faith schools discriminatory admission policy.",
        "additional_details": "I understand legally this policy that allows schools to discriminate based on religion exist and I don't think it has a place in our modern society. Just because this is legally allowed doesn't mean it is right (like Apartheid in South Africa which was subsequently abolished with South African independence). What is more shocking, is that 30% of state funded schools are religious schools, meaning the public is funding a lot of schools that discriminate. Please put an end to this. ",
        "background": "My four year old daughter has recently experienced both racial and religious discrimination, due to the draconian and antiquated school admission policy of our local state funded faith school. She has been denied a place at her local school (the closest school to us) because of her faith.",
