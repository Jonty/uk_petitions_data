        "additional_details": "Amongst all of the city wonders  London is known for its extremely high living costs - not to mention the extortionate prices private landlords are charging tenants. \r\n\r\nDue to inflation and low wages some Londoners are forced to work more than one job solely to pay the rent. \r\n A lot of these landlords are illegally renting rooms and do not declare the income they are receiving from tenants and are charging tenants anything from \u00a3500-\u00a3850 for box rooms that can only fit a bed- this need to change!",
        "background": "It's time for the government to take responsibility and stop ignoring their broken system. They should regulate and cap rent prices for rooms at the maximum of \u00a3550pcm. We want Responsibility, Regulation and Results (RRR).",
