        "additional_details": "The system I am proposing would be fairer to everyone in the whole country no mater what vehicle they own or drive. This would safe money as the DVLA wold not need to chase up or remind people to renew their Road Tax. The Government is always telling us we are all in this together and moving on. Well if we are all in this together and if we are moving on, this would simplify collecting Road Tax. The additional revenue could be ring fenced and put back into our road system and repair upgrade it.",
        "background": "Currently there is a lot of debate about Vehicle excise duty. Whether there should be a 25 30 or 40 year rolling excemption. If the government added 2/2.5% on to the amount they take in tax form the cost of fuel, this would make the Treasury more money even short term. Fairer for all.",
