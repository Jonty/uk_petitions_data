        "additional_details": "Out of every 600 houses getting  built there are just two 4 bedroomed houses and this isn't enough. Most of the houses that where for social housing are now changing to afford houses that are for sale but 98% of British people can't afford to buy there own house so we need more affordable housing associations houses. They are getting these housing associations to build theses so called afford houses for sale instead of for people who are on the social housing list.",
        "background": "People like me can't afford to buy there own house and I have been on property pool for over 3 year's because there's a shortage of affordable social housing by housing associations. Not houses that no one can afford to buy. ",
