There are many examples of people who are seriously ill & require full time nursing care, yet are being denied funding. We believe that the entire process requires thorough investigation, with straightforward guidelines, eligibility criteria & grading structure put into place.",

We feel that this urgently needs reviewing, especially for those suffering multiple medical needs from symptoms of dementia & other serious illnesses. ",
