        "action": "End hospital parking charges for NHS staff.",
        "additional_details": "Staff frequently work through their unpaid breaks and voluntarily work over their hours, only to see parking fees deducted from their already low salary each month. In a workforce that is already stretched to the absolute limit and who have received minimal pay increases in recent years, surely free parking isn't too much to ask.",
        "background": "NHS staff are overworked and underpaid. It is unfair that despite all of this they have to pay to park their car at work each day.\r\n\r\nThe department for health should abolish parking charges for their loyal NHS staff who are already stretched to the limit.",
