        "action": "Force County Councils to allow residents to use their closest recycling center",
        "additional_details": "Residents of Sandhurst could travel a 6.6 mile round journey and use the Camberley recycling center. Surrey County Council are now not allowing cross county border use and as a result these residents are having to travel a 13.6 mile round journey to the Bracknell recycling center. This causes extra environmental damage and increased road use. This type of policy is in force in many areas of the country and should not be acceptable as a simple agreement between councils could stop this lunacy.",
        "background": "Many County Councils require proof of residency before allowing them to use their recycling centers. This forces people to travel extra distances to avoid crossing county borders to recycle. It is bad for the environment and councils should be forced to co-operate to limit this environmental damage.",
