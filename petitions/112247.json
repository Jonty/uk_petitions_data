        "additional_details": "According to the law, only a man can commit rape (as the penetration has to be with a penis). e.g \u2018A\u2019 is guilty of rape if:\r\nhe intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of \u2018B\u2019 with his penis;\r\n\u2018B\u2019 does not consent to the penetration, and\r\n\u2018A\u2019 does not reasonably believe that \u2018B\u2019 consents.\r\nthis is completely out dated and  barbaric. so this is why i am calling for the government to change the law on rape.",
        "background": "I would like the law on rape to be changed as i belive that it is gender specific. because as it stand by law only men can be convicted of rape as women can only be convicted of sexual assault unless its on a minor. I know for a fact that the are many men that are raped on a daily basis.  ",
