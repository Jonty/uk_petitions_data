These laws I feel should be amended, with regards to animal rights in particular.......... Do the manufactures think about the poor defensless animals that are terrified, each time their man made noises are set off?\r\nPlease sign this petition to see if we can shame the makers into lowering the sound of these fireworks to within a decent tone, which will hopefully be less upsetting to All.",
