        "additional_details": "The average British person\u2019s total daily energy expenditure is 2000 calories. Eating just 100 calories over this per day will lead to an average weight gain of nearly 10.5 pounds (4.7kg) a year. 100 calories is one large apple, half a plain bagel, or a packet of crisps.\r\n\r\nBeing overweight or obese is connected to many health problems, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, sleep apnoea and some cancers, as well as significantly reducing life expectancy and quality of life. ",
        "background": "64% of the UK population is overweight/obese. Many simply don\u2019t understand why they are obese, and thus do not have the first idea of how to combat it. Basic information such as calculating Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) should be taught in secondary schools.",
