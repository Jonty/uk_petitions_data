        "additional_details": "When referenda are held they are in effect an extension of the Parliamentary process. However the rules that prevent the obstruction of Parliament do not apply to referenda, so it is possible to obstruct the democratic process by misleading the public without repercussions. \r\n\r\nFor the public to make informed decisions information must be factual. Therefore elected officials who knowingly mislead the public during referenda should be subject to parliamentary discipline. ",
        "background": "Giving false evidence in Parliament is known as contempt of Parliament and can result in exclusion from office. This rule safeguards the democratic process by ensuring as much as possible that parliamentary action is based on fact. Referenda should commit to those same standards. ",
