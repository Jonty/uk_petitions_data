        "additional_details": "One of the pillars of English law is that all are equal in the eyes of the law & that nobody should receive unfavourable or favourable treatment on the grounds of ethnicity, religion or other beliefs.\r\n\r\nIn light of these inappropriate & discriminatory rulings by Judge Sally Cahill & Mr Justice Walker, parties to this petition call on the government to remove the afore-mentioned from taking part in any further oversight of judicial hearings.\r\n\r\nWe further call on the Home Office to issue guidance to all judges making clear that rulings should be equal, no matter what the ethnicity of the perpertrator(s) or victim(s). \r\n\r\nhttp://www.examiner.co.uk/news/west-yorkshire-news/asian-longer-sentence-child-abuse-10081883#ICID=sharebar_twitter",
        "background": "Recent rulings by two courts have determined that the sexual abuse of girls of Asian ethnicity is more serious and, warrants longer sentences, than had they been of European ethnicity.\r\n\r\n",
