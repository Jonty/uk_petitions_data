        "action": "Propose a referendum calling for an early General Election in the wake of BRExit",
        "additional_details": "David Cameron's resignation has in effect left the UK leaderless, and the selection process of an new leader by the Conservative Party would exclude the British public from this choice at a time when the traits of political leaders are key to their election as PM. Jeremy Corbyn's position as leader of the opposition is also under significant threat, with most of the shadow cabinet having resigned. A snap General Election would give a fresh mandate to a new government following the BRExit choice.",
        "background": "The EU referendum outcome has caught both the UK government and the opposition on the back foot, destabilising the democratic process to a level that has rendered it dysfunctional. The UK electrorate should be given the opportunity to call an early election giving a new mandate to a new government.",
