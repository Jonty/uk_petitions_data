        "additional_details": "Ancient woodlands are a vital part of our cultural heritage, often containing archaeological remains waiting to be discovered, yet 85% of it has no legal protection. If we are to commit to our climate, flood alleviation and biodiversity action plan obligations these habitats must be protected from vandalism and development. At one time woodland covered the majority of the UK, as relics of this wild wood we must ensure that our ancient woodlands survive for the benefit of future generations.",
        "background": "Ancient woodland is recognised as irreplaceable due to the specialised plant and animal species they support, not found elsewhere. As a result of habitat loss and fragmentation over the last 50 years 60% of those specialised species have declined significantly according to the State of Nature Report",
