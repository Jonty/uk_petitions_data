I am making a statement that they criminals are not welcome in my shop. All of the people in my rogues gallery has been caught and either fined or is in Prison. The British Independent Retailers association and I believe that the public should regard criminals who steal from shops as what they are 'THIEVES'. Ban the use of the word SHOPLIFTING call it what it is 'THEFT'",
        "background": "The government have issued instructions to the Police to treat stealing items from shops below \u00a3200 as a misdemeanour.
