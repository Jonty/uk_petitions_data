Assad, ISIS and other factors are not helping the people of Syria. \r\nThe U.K government at one point wanted to bomb the Assad government however now wants to join hands with Assad to bomb ISIS held areas. One of these is Raqqa, 95% of the population are civilians. Does that seem right to bomb there? No. But if David is adamant let's send him first. ",
