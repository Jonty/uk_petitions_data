        "action": "Mandatory training in education \r\nre impact of abuse/trauma on children",
        "additional_details": "NICE guidelines advise that schools ought to complete training regarding attachment, brain development & the impact of trauma/abuse on these, but currently most schools (primary & secondary) appear to struggle with understanding the needs of children who are no longer with birth families. This ultimately impacts negatively on these children's attainment & enjoyment of school.  We wish to make it mandatory for teachers to undergo training regarding the impact of trauma on brain development & attachment. Training should also be reviewed in order to ensure all teaching staff understand these children's needs.  Work by John Bowlby, Margaret Ainsworth, Dan Hughes, Bruce Perry, & Graham Music all provide detail about brain development, trauma & attachment.",
        "background": "Children who no longer remain with birth families often have attachment difficulties & a history of witnessing/experiencing abusive trauma regardless of the age they were removed, this is rarely understood by teachers or school staff. This needs to alter to increase attainment levels for children",
