        "action": "Introduce a bill to set a higher minimum wage for zero hours contracts",
        "additional_details": "The aim of this bill is to target employers who systemically provide employees with contracts for considerably fewer hours than they would normally be expected to work. The most extreme case of this is employers who widely use zero hours contracts.\r\n\r\nIn the example of a zero hours contract the minimum pay rate would be \u00a39 per hour based on the current National Living Wage of \u00a37.20. The same minimum rate would apply to other overtime.",
        "background": "We call on the government to introduce a bill to set a higher minimum wage for hours worked above contract hours. This would set a higher minimum pay rate for zero hour/minimal hours contracts.\r\n\r\nHours worked above contracted hours the minimum pay rate must be at least 1.25 times the minimum wage.",
