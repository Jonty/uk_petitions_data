        "action": "Amend the Trade Union Act 2016 to remove trade union immunity from damages.",
        "additional_details": "This advantage that gives unions legal immunity from any claims for damages arising from their behaviour, however destructive, is wrong. Even the government has been taken to court by an individual before being allowed to invoke article 50, yet someone that loses their job because of persistent union action has no recourse to the courts, it is unjust and unfair. \r\n\r\nUnjustifiable strikes must stop, unfair advantages must stop.\r\n \r\nPlease help to get the Trade Union Act 2016 amended and remove the unfair trade union immunity from damages.\r\n",
        "background": "RMT & ASLEF have been striking for no discernible aim other than to cause harm to the commuters that use Southern Rail. They have wreaked untold costs upon individuals, families & businesses, yet they have legal immunity from the laws that govern every other person & organisation in the country.",
