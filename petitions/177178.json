        "additional_details": "A while back, I was (falsely) arrested in a case where the police seized my business laptop, after nearly a year and hundreds of phone calls to the police, my laptop was finally returned to me, and the case was dropped, however, my company had to shut down due to all my work being on that laptop, and I lost a very good company and people lost their jobs. This is all because the police could not \"fit my job in\" due to more important work in front of me, and never once kept me in the loop.",
        "background": "Give the police a 2 month deadline from the date of arrest, once they have seized any item for any form of forensic analysis. After 2 months, they MUST give the property back to the suspect (unless the item has evidence on convicting them of a crime).",
