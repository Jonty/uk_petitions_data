        "additional_details": "Reading is a Vibrant City that contributes significantly to our economy and culture.  It is one of the largest towns worthy of City status.\r\n\r\nThe town applied in 2012 and was disappointed after a long application process.  It was not selected as one of the three cities chosen but we strongly believe that it should be chosen.",
