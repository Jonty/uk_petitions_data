        "additional_details": "The UK has been ignoring Amnesty International\u2019s call for such a halt since October 2015. The UK is putting exports before ethics and turning a blind eye to Yemen\u2019s suffering population while it is thrown ever-closer to the brink of humanitarian catastrophe and famine. The UK government must instead do all in its power to promote a peaceful negotiated settlement to Yemen\u2019s civil war, as called for by the UN Secretary-General.\r\n\r\nFor further information, please see:\r\nhttp://www.stoparmstosaudi.com\r\n",
        "background": "The Saudi Arabia-led coalition has committed war crimes in Yemen by bombing schools, hospitals, heritage sites, and other civilian targets, including the dropping of cluster bombs on civilian neighbourhoods in Yemen\u2019s capital. The UK is fuelling Yemen\u2019s civil war and is complicit in such war crimes.",
