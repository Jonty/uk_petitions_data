        "additional_details": "I have been riding my 50cc motorbike for a few months now and I have to use 60mph/40mph roads on a regular basis on my way to school. I have found that other road users in larger vehicles grow impatient of trailing behind me at 30mph and many find that it's a good idea to pass on corners and/or dangerously close to me. There have also been some that risk a head on crash in an attempt to pass. A faster speed in my eyes would eliminate the threat that other road users oppose to slower mopeds.",

I have found that other road users grow impatient of trailing behind me at 30mph and many find that it's a good idea to pass at dangerous points of which could easily result in a threat on my life as some cars overtake and narrowly avoid a head on crash",
