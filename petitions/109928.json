It scares the living day lights out of me! We need our taxes used appropriately! You've saved money turning street lights off which on a Friday and Saturday night is ridiculous! We have too many traffic police! This country is failing it's people! ",

How long does it take for them to assist 30 minutes to 1week! Crime levels on the rise! People don't go out and use our local pubs anymore for fear of being stabbed or bottled. ",
