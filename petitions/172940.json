",
        "background": "Their is no need for the Severn bridge to have tolls! It is proven that they don't need it anymore. It makes 90 million and the mantence costs are 15 million...so where's the rest of the money going?! \r\n\r\nYou don't pay to go to Scotland....so why do we have to pay to go to Wales.",
