The amounts given to certain countries should be reduced by how much their citizens have used through our NHS & not re-payed back into our system. The NHS is in dire need of cash, we need this money to be paid back. To expect the hard working people of the UK to foot the bill of someone having 4 children through IVF & then just fly home to their mother country is just not fair. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4176406/Meet-Nigerian-cost-500-000-IVF-triplets.html",
