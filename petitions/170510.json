After being asked recently to remove ALL items from my little boy's grave, I'm petitioning to get the rules at certain cemeteries eased or changed, to allow bereaved parents to decorate their child's resting place as they see fit, providing it remains maintained by the grave 'owner'. \r\n\r\nBuried babies may only be a plot number to some, but they are our children and deserve their own little gardens. \r\n\r\nThank you.
