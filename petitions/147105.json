        "action": "Hold an English and Welsh referendum concerning Scottish independence.",
        "additional_details": "Nicola Sturgeon's actions and statements since the referendum result have clearly demonstrated that Scotland's place in the EU is more important to them than their place in the UK. If Scotland is allowed to decide whether to be independent, regardless of their referendum result, England and Wales should also be asked to decide whether they want Scotland to remain part of the UK, considering their lack of loyalty to their nation and refusal to accept a democratic process. ",
        "background": "Since the referendum's result, Scotland has made it very clear that as a nation they want to remain part of the European Union, even considering another referendum on their independence from the rest of Britain or blocking the UK's exit. ",
