        "action": "Abandon European Water Framework Directive to prevent future flooding in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Following the introduction of the European Water Framework Directive in 2000, river dredging has been stopped to comply with obligations imposed by the EU. The build up of sediment and trees in river beds since 2000 has led to higher water levels and increasing water pressure on local structures, leading to the damage and collapse of many buildings and bridges throughout the UK. Many communities and businesses have been left devastated by such events, isolated from road networks and other areas.",
        "background": "Recent extreme weather and flooding have led to widespread devastation, caused largely by inadequate flood defences. A key factor has so far remained absent from discussions on the future of flood prevention in the UK \u2013 the cessation of river dredging that has led to river beds becoming blocked.",
