        "additional_details": "The legislation was endorsed by Mrs May while she was Home Secretary, but unfortunately still has not been enacted into law and has been waiting for two years. Meanwhile thousands of predators are thought to have gone unpunished as police can only arrest them if they are known to meet the children they groom online. The new law would make it illegal for an adult to send sexual communication to a child. This law will make the act of child grooming illegal in England and Wales.",
        "background": "Breck Bednar, 14 was murdered by someone he met online at their first meeting. At the moment the police can only arrest offenders if they meet the children they groom online. This would have been too late for Breck, so it is imperative police are able press charges before children are put in danger.",
