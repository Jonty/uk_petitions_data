        "additional_details": "The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs wrote to the Home Secretary, Theresa May, in 2011, stating that alkyl nitrates cannot be accurately classified as a 'legal high' nor as a psychoactive substance [1]. \r\n\r\n[1]: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/119139/acmdnps2011.pdf",
        "background": "A Government committee in 2011 published a report stating that poppers are not a psychoactive substance, and that their adverse health effects are negligible. Failing to exempt poppers from the Bill will, due to their ubiquity amongst gay communties, criminalise many people and be unenforceable.",
