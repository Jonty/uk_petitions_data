        "additional_details": "It is perfectly understandable to say that time pressure is a likely occurrence in life people in the country. However, the time pressure showed by examinations prevents them from carrying out their role in testing knowledge of students. A student needs the appropriate time to prove his/her knowledge in order for it to be a legitimate examination.",
        "background": "Young people in the UK are continuously battling the clock rather than the exam. The typical mark-a-minute ideology is obsolete and does not give students with extensive knowledge the time to apply it to a paper. As a result, students receive grades that less than represent their true capability.",
