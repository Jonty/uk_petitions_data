Savay Farm is a grade 1 listed house of great historical significance; nearly 900 years old; former home of Sir Oswald Mosley. Savay Lake is legendary carp-fishing lake and amongst the top 3 fishing lakes in England. Immensely beautiful it is full of wildlife and amazing fish. We want the Secretary of State for Transport to put a tunnel under the Colne Valley to preserve these sites.",
