        "additional_details": "Theresa May is now the leader of the conservative party and consequently will be a carbon copy of the 'Iron Lady' that destroyed this Nation in the 80's. She has proved that she is not against deportation of current EU nationals, and only wants whats best for her own party and not the Nation as a whole.",
        "background": "The decision to leave the EU has come about, & the UK needs a strong and decisive leader to carry us through the negotiations over the next 2 years. The conservatives' leader proved that his party are incapable of doing this and have appointed in an undemocratic manner a person of similar tact.",
