Ian Duncan Smith MP and Nigel Farage MEP say \u00a3350m per week need not go to the NHS.\r\nIn the case of an advisory referendum it is proper both that the representations made be examined and that the now evident effects on the economy and administration of the U.K. should be assessed by Parliament as the Sovereign body representing the will of the people.",
        "background": "The referendum on future membership of the EU was advisory. The referendum decision to leave was won very narrowly. Major participants of the leave campaign have since accepted that representations made were inaccurate or not binding upon them. Parliament must guard the public interest.",
