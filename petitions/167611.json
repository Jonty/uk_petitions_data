The Government need to cut through the red tape and allow all 1000 children into the UK without any delay, i.e. TODAY before any more perish. The young boy who was trying to reach the safety of his family by joining his brother in the UK died unnecessarily and this must stop. Allowing 1000 young people to live in fear and anxiety when they are on our doorstep is a scandal",
