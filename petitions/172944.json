And it dismisses the rights of my son, who has the right to be within his birth family.\r\nI have committed no crime to anyone, adult or child. I have no addictions.\r\nThe law should be changed , so that no child can be taken without parental consent, if no crime has been committed and if there are no addictions. Instead family's should be worked with and supported to be a family by child services before any further action is considered",
        "background": "I was abused as a child and domestically, as a result I have PTSD. Although I left my partner, moved far away from my family, made great improvements with my ptsd, and had support, my newborn was taken at birth, and has been placed for adoption without my consent, based on a risk of emotional harm",
