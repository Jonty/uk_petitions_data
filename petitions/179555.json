Financial security is just one of the securities any Country needs to be sustainable and between the UK and the USA, our trade together is worth \u00a3150 billion a year. Plus, the USA is the UKs single biggest inward source of income with \u00a31 Trillion Dollars invested in each others economies (President Donald J.
