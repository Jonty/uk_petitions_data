I would suggest this figure as the bench mark requiring a vote in the House of Commons. \r\nWhilst not agreeing with all these petitions, issues of such public concern should require a formal and collective response from our MPs. A vote would give a clear indication of where the House stood on such issues, allowing the public to asses their representation in the Commons. ",
        "background": "Currently petitions require a governmental response on reaching 10,000 signatures and will be considered for debate at 100,000 signatures. There ought to be a third figure after which MPs are required to vote on an issue so as to guarantee a response to petitions with large public backing. ",
