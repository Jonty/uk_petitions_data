        "action": "Allow some freedom of movement in any UK-EU trade deal",
        "additional_details": "We should allow free movement of citizens only on the basis that they have paid taxes and NI for 5 years before claiming welfare. They will only be allowed non urgent healthcare if they reside for at least 6 momths. We will allow EEA students to study under Erasmus but introduce a EEA school permit so they will need to pay an annual fee for state education. This reduces pull factor yet it doesn't violate free movement laws. We can compromise on EU structural funds.",
        "background": "The UK voted to leave to control immigration but that makes a UK-EU trade deal unlikely. The UK government should allow some degree of freedom of movement so we have full single market access. This is means we are able to trade freely yet have some control on EEA immigration.",
