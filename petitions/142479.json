        "additional_details": "Comments and campaign material regarding immigration produced by the Brexit campaign and their supporters in the media can now be seen to be directly inspiring the increased incidence of this abuse, which risks ultimately turning to violence. This petition does not wish to comment on the merits of the electorate's decision, but rather wishes to guarantee the commitment of the Brexit leadership to the proud British values of tolerance, acceptance and civility in these turbulent times.",
        "background": "Reports are flooding social media of non-British citizens and ethnic minorities suffering heightened racist and xenophobic abuse in the wake of the recent vote for the UK to leave the EU. The under-signed call on the leaders of the Brexit campaign to immediately denounce this behaviour.",
