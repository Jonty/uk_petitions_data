        "additional_details": "I'm at Nottingham Trent university. On a daily basis I meet other students that can't afford to live on maintenance loans. It's not enough for even the poorest of students to live. We want to concentrate on our studies and not have to worry about making ends meet every day. ",

Maintenance Loans aren't covering living costs at university anymore and it's a day to day struggle for all of us, we are the future of this country. How can we carry this country forward if we always have to worry about money?",
