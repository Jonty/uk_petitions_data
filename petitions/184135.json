Graffitti alone in London last year cost over \u00a3100m, criminal damage, theft and crimes relating to injury should all hold the parents financially accountable. Criminal damage by children is not paid for by the parents, so insurance goes up. Unless the laws of this country encourage the outcome we want then some parents will continue to perform badly as parents and future generations will suffer.   ",

But laws do not encourage this, a child can be brought up an cause, criminal damage, theft and even hospitalise people without any come back on the parents. Adults need to be accountable for parenting performance.      ",
