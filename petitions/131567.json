        "action": "Remove restrictions on bus lane use on bank holidays there is no peak congestion",
        "additional_details": "Bus lanes are there to ease congestion at peak times. On any normal operational day traffic would be bumper to bumper. On a bank holiday however the traffic is down by at least 50% for the same time period. Surely this means it is not necessary enforce the restrictions at these times. Most people don't have to go to work and there is no school run on bank holidays therefore less traffic. Give us back a small piece of our roads.",
        "background": "We were driving in a bus lane on a bank holiday during its operating times. There were 2 other cars on the road so not congested. The bus lanes are not enforced on a Sunday, and as the bus company operates a Sunday service on bank holidays the same rules should apply to their use on those days.   ",
