        "action": "Government to reform the honours system to include posthumous awards",
        "additional_details": "A prime example is Bobby Moore. Its now the 50th anniversary of the year of England winning the world cup. He was a leader, a gentleman and credit to this country. Geoff Hurst has been knighted so surely Bobby Moore should be too (posthumously) as he was the Captain of the team, especially in this anniversary year. It would be a very fitting way to celebrate the achievement of the the man and the team.",
        "background": "I'm creating this petition to call upon the Government to reform the honours system, so that knighthoods can be awarded posthumously. Its a shame that people that have contributed something for the country but are sadly no longer with us cannot be recognised for their achievements.",
