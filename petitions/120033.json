        "additional_details": "Helium is a very light element, and one of the few elements that \"leak\" out of the Earth's atmosphere. This means that when Helium is used, such as in party balloons, it cannot be retrieved from the atmosphere and will eventually disappear into space.\r\n\r\nHelium is used in MRI scanners, supercritical fluids, telescopic lenses, and much more.\r\n\r\nThe shortages experienced in the 2000s are inevitable in the future, and such a precious resource MUST be protected and regulated for future discovery.",
        "background": "Helium is a rare element on Earth, shown when the price doubled between 2002-2007, and despite new plants in Qatar, Russia and the US shortages will occur.\r\n\r\nThis element is widely used in medicine, science and industry but is wasted in party balloons. Regulation is needed.",
