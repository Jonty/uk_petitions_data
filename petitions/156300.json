        "additional_details": "The Yulin Dog Meat Festival & Asian Dog Meat Trade focuses on farming dogs for human consumption. Thousands of dogs are rammed into tiny cages, contorted & left to weaken. Dogs are happy animals & it is believed that their happiness & good health is passed onto those who eat them. The perpetrators think that torturing the dogs by blow torching & skinning them alive & battering their heads willl keep the meat tender. Videos & live Facebook appearances, notably by Ricky Gervais are ref points.  ",
        "background": "I was physically sick when I saw a video on Facebook depicting the torturing to death of dogs for human consumption. The dogs are kept in horrific conditions & as sentient animals, feel the same emotions that we do. They are absolutely terrified. It is inhumane, barbaric & abhorrent & needs to stop",
