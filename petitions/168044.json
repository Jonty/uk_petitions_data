        "additional_details": "The public and news vendors love a good referendum, so the undersigned hereby request that the government take hold of the FA's managerial selection process in an effort to restore English footballs pride and identity.\r\n\r\nReading through many forums on the matter; it seems clear that the general public knows best\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I remember Derren Brown once said something about 'consensus opinion' generally being the right one, so it's probably a good idea to hold a referendum on stuff like this",
        "background": "\r\nAllegations of managerial corruption, and being knocked out of the Euros by part-timers from a popular frozen food store, has left English international football at an all time low.\r\n\r\nWe invented the game you know, and whilst the game is in such disrepute, so too is our great nation.",
