        "additional_details": "I suggest a public vote of some kind on the matter, so the people of the UK can decide if \u00a31.2b of our tax money is simply given away. Why not split it between police forces facing cuts or the fire service. This petition isn't to stop foreign aid. It's to allow the people of Britain to vote and have a say on the matter",
        "background": "Whilst listening to BBC Stoke they were discussing the \u00a31.2b that will be given as foreign aid over the next 4 years. They repeatedly described it as a drop in the ocean compared to the budget of the nhs of over \u00a3400b. It's not a drop in the ocean. It's our money and our tax and we should have a say",
