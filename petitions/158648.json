        "action": "Nullify the E.U referendum and sanction a second referendum",
        "additional_details": "Throughout the 'Leave\" campaign the commitment to redirect \u00a3350 million pounds per week into NHS funding was repeatedly made by poster, verbally and on the Leave campaign bus.\r\n\r\nLess than 24 hours after the Referendum result the Leave campaign announced that they would not be doing that.   It is uncertain how many people were DUPED by this false claim but as there could be hundreds of thousands the result was corrupt and a subversion of the democratic process.  This is the basis for this petition",
        "background": "We the undersigned call for the nullification of the E.U referendum result  and call for a second referendum on the legal basis that the \u00a3350 million per week redirection of funds into the NHS was a false and misleading 'commitment' by the Leave campaign and therefore a corruption of democracy",
