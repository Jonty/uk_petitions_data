        "action": "Hold a second referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU",
        "additional_details": "Instead, a second referendum should be held based on the misrepresentations and fabrications of facts which were put forward by politicians to convince UK voters to vote to leave the EU. Such an important and historic decision should be based solely on honest projections and facts (and where facts are unavailable, clear disclaimers should be given so that the average voter can understand fully that what they're being told is merely conjecture and that the reality could be vastly different).",
        "background": "A petition like this already exists, but it relies on voting thresholds that did not apply to the referendum held on 23 June 2016. On that basis, it is doubtful such a petition will succeed. It asks for rules to be applied retrospectively and this is unlikely to be legally enforceable. ",
