        "additional_details": "However, as house prices have gone up, \u00a316,000 is not enough for a deposit in many areas and many families face not being able to save above \u00a316k due to their benefits being stopped at this threshold. If savings put aside to buy a property were exempt from the \u00a316k limit then more people may be able to save up for their own deposits.",
