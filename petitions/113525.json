        "additional_details": "This would be very beneficial with teenagers, as after all they are the future. With this they will begin to form their own opinions on various issues and so when they turn 18 they will be ready to vote.\r\nThe information needs to be easily accessible and understandable. The ideal place for this is in school, as it can be taught unbiased and in an interesting way.\r\n\r\nFor me, I knew very little about politics before I chose to study it at A level, only now am I realising how important this is.\r\n ",
        "background": "It is a known issue that many people today do not participate in politics and with living in a democracy it means that participation is crucial for a strong, successful and thriving government.\r\nAnd so it is a pressing issue to educate people on politics and get more people interested.",
