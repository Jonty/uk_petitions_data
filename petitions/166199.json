        "action": "Make it illegal for parents not to vaccinate a child",
        "additional_details": "Herd immunity is the primary reason for mass immunisation - in layman's terms, it means that the more people are immunised against a given disease, the less that disease will be able to spread, and more people (especially children too young to receive that specific vaccination) will be safe from it. We call on the government to criminalise non-vaccinating parents who refuse an initial order to vaccinate.",
        "background": "Not vaccinating your children makes two things more likely\r\n- Your child will get sick\r\n- Your child will spread that illness to other unprotected children, some of whom may be too young to have received the necessary vaccination.\r\nTherefore, not getting your child vaccinated is grossly negligent.",
