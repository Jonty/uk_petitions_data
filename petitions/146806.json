        "additional_details": "Promises on NHS spending have been unravelled. People were not told there were conditions linking the free movement of people to being in the single market. There was an imbalance of representation across the Media in favour of Brexit. Many people voted not knowing what the EU is as shown by UK's most popular Google search being \"What is the EU?\" following voting results. Many people in the leave camp expressed regret at voting leave, but not vice-versa.  A more informed vote can now be achieved",
        "background": "The British people were misled in the run up to the EU Referendum regarding the consequences of leaving which confused the voters.  There is a moral obligation to give the British people a second referendum now that the full consequences of leaving and the benefits of staying are clear to voters.",
