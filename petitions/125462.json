        "action": "Cancel the court closures announced on 11th February, 2016 and improve justice.",
        "additional_details": "The Govt. claims that the 86 courts are under used by 60%. This could be addressed by ensuring that matters are listed more quickly and the courts used more effectively. The Govt. claims that 97% of citizens will still be able to reach a court, by car, within an hour, ignoring those without cars. There are examples of round trips that will be costly and exceed four hours. This will stop justice being local and accessible.",
        "background": "There are currently 460 courts and tribunals in E & W.  The govt. announced the closure of 86 of these, claiming they are substantially under used. Why not ensure that they are used more often - speeding up justice. It claims that they will be within a 1 hour car journey, ignores public transport.\r\n",
