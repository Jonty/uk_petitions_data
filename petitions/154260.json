        "additional_details": "We accept the result, but it is clear that voters did not know what they were voting for. The EU Referendum showed that no one on either side had any clear view of what the consequences might be, or what the terms might be should the decision go one way or another - the evidence of the campaign is clear to see - the motives for millions of voters were far wider than the subject of the Referendum. The Terms must be suitable, acceptable and feasibility to a 60% majority in a 75% turnout.",
        "background": "The evidence of the campaign for the recent EU Referendum shows that voting occurred where no plan or terms existed for voters to assess.Thousands of voters now say they 'regret' their vote, suggesting the tip of an iceberg where voting occurred on the basis not knowing what they were voting for.",
