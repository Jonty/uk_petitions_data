        "additional_details": "Year groups at college are split, as some people are too young to vote. Some people who are slightly too young to vote have to deal with other people's decisions until they are, in some cases, 22 years old. \r\nSome people can go through life with just there secondary education, and still have the ability to vote. So it cannot be argued that, in this case, with only a secondary education, teenagers do not have the mental capability to vote. \r\nWe should allow young people to shape there future. ",
        "background": "By the end of secondary education, people have to decide where next to go in there life, whether it be further education, an apprenticeship or full time employment. At this age, people make life changing decisions about there own life. Why shouldn't they have a say in there country's life?",
