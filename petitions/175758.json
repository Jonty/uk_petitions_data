        "additional_details": "We know DfE did not intend to threaten the country\u2019s largest and most innovative nursery school.\r\nWhilst we support the principle of funds being redirected to the front line we urgently request the government ring-fence funds for Pen Green and other integrated nursery schools before February 2017. \r\n\r\nFurthermore we urge the government to enact a caveat to the future funding arrangements whereby integrated nursery schools are protected financially to continue their outstanding work from hereon in.",
        "background": "Government changes to Early Years centrally held funding are threatening the existence of the outstanding Pen Green Centre, a pioneer in early years integration. \r\nNCC funds the majority of the centre's work via the centrally held fund and changes will inadvertently see a savage reduction in budget.",
