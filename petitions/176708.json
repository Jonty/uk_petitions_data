        "action": "Compulsory for UK schools to teach about sexual consent.",
        "additional_details": "On average, the age of first intercourse experience is 15.6 years (14.9 for men and 15.9 for women). It seems, the majority of teenagers are sexually active before the legal age. It is for this reason, sexual consent must be taught before the age of 16. Not just our daughters should leave school able to navigate the sexual challenges and choices they\u2019ll face in adulthood but more importantly boys. Schools must become educators and advocates of sex-positivity/healthy consent for both genders. ",
        "background": "In the UK, it's not compulsory for schools to teach anything about sexual consent or healthy relationships, only about the biology of sex. Before teenagers are sexually active, consent education will give them the power to recognise when receiving or inflicting abuse/exploitation/rape. ",
