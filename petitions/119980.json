        "additional_details": "The UK is Google's largets market outside the US yet countries like France and Italy have managed to secure much larger tax deals from Google. France have secured more than \u00a3500 million and Italy \u00a3150 million-equivalent to a 15% tax rate. This deal is extremely unfair to all small businesses and other companies that are expected to pay their tax recipts in full. This deal needs to be fully and publicly investigated to see why so much money has been lost.",
        "background": "Google has been allowed to pay just \u00a3130 million for over ten years worth of business. This is a tiny proportion of the company\u2019s \u00a33.93 billion annual UK revenues and amounts to a tax rate of just 3%. A public enquiry is now necessary to see how this grossly unfair deal has been allowed to stand.",
