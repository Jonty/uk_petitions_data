With the 1:1  support that he had, he managed to cope with college life and did very well there, but he aspired to go to uni to follow his dream. His EHC plan stopped because it didn't  cover higher education. My son is the same person he was before. We are trying to get support for him now from the council but keep hitting barriers ",

He did extremely well at collage and got an overall exam result of merit merit, he got a place in his local Uni only to find that the support he had had in college would cease, just like the EHC plan.",
