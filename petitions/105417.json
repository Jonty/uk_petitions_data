        "action": "Phased introduction dividend tax over 3 years rather than in April 2016.",
        "additional_details": "Business owners structure the rewards for their efforts with salary and dividend payments. A totally legal method of profit extraction that has been previously encouraged by different governments.  These small company owners are the entrepreneurs that start small business, take risk and create employment opportunities for other people.\r\nThe tax on dividends is an attack on these business owners which results in additional tax, often reducing income by 5%, from April 2016, without notice.",
        "background": "The recent Budget proposed a new tax of 7.5% on dividends  to be introduced in April 2016. A new tax that has been introduced without consultation, warning or discussion. We suggest that this tax should be introduced on a phased  basis, over  a 3 year period.",
