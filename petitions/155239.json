        "action": "Prevent Brexit: MP's Veto the Repeal of the European Communities Act 1972",
        "additional_details": "The future of the UK is at stake, the future of our young people is at stake and Britain's place in the world is at stake. The financial markets have already crashed, companies are making plans to leave the UK, taking jobs and growth with them, and the pound has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years. \r\n\r\nThe turnout was only 72.2% and the results were 52% to 48%. The future of our country cannot be jeopardized on such a poor mandate, achieved through misleading the electorate. Please save the UK.",
        "background": "We call on MPs to reject the result of the EU referendum by Voting No on the Bill to repeal the European Communities Act 1972.\r\n\r\nThe Leave campaign misled their voters. Their pledges on NHS spending and immigration have already unravelled and they have no plan in place for a UK outside of the EU.",
