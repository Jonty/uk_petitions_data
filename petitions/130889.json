        "additional_details": "People who buy a vehicle automatically have to renew the road tax on the vehicle. If somebody chooses to buy a car on (for example) the 15th of a month, they're losing two weeks worth of money for no reason, because the tax is back dated to the 1st of the month, when they didn't even own the vehicle. There is no longer a reason for this, given all details are electronic. It wouldn't even cost the treasury a penny as people still have to renew it annually.",
        "background": "Since 2014, vehicle excise duty has been solely electronic, with no requirement to show a tax disc in the windscreen of the vehicle.\r\n\r\nTherefore with MOT and insurance being 12 months from start, there is no reason for tax not to be the same. ",
