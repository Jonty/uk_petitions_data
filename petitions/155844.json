        "additional_details": "EU citizens who live in Britain are currently exercising their Treaty rights guaranteed by the Treaty of Lisbon (TFEU). Once the Treaty is repelled, EU citizens will have no protection and many may see their lives ruined. The rules under the Treaty are different from the British domestic law.\r\n\r\nWe submit that a clause is inserted into any exit agreement between Britain and the EU that all rights acquired by EU citizens under the Treaty and rights in the process of acquisition are protected.",
        "background": "Following the decision made by the British public in thereferendum on 23rd June 2016, millions of EU citizens who live in Britain are facing having their Treaty rights removed. We need to protect these rights in any exit agreement with the European Union.",
