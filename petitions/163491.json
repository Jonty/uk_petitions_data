        "action": "Make a UK-wide ban on the use of artifical colourings in medication.",
        "additional_details": "Artifical colourings can make it greatly difficult for those sensetive to find even basic medication without adverse effects.  Examples of which are calcium supplements containing brilliant blue E133 and antibiotics such as amoxicillin containing sunset yellow E110\r\n\r\nReactions in those allergic can range from migraines and photosensitivity,  hypersensitivity,  vomiting & in my personal experience with E133 rash,  nausea, swelling of throat and disorientation. These are unacceptable & unnecessary",
        "background": "Artifical colouring agents are often unnecessarily used in medication to effect a particular appearance rather than for any significant gain or change in the effectiveness of medications. \r\nAs one of many people prone to allergic reactions to colourings E102-E133 I request a ban from medication use.",
