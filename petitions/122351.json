        "additional_details": "Although this issue has already been discussed by parliament, I believe it needs to be readdressed. The Scottish referendum of 2014 proved that young people are interested in politics - 109,593 young people registered to vote and approximately 75% of all 16 and 17 year olds voted. Why shouldn't the same age group be allowed the vote this time? \r\nhttp://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/179812/Scottish-independence-referendum-report.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The result of the referendum will influence the lives of 16 and 17 year old's and it is wholly unfair they they will not have a say in their future.  This issue needs to be rediscussed by the government. Young people are interested in this issue and want their voice to be heard. \r\n\r\n",
