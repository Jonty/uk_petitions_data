        "additional_details": "This system can be implimented according to each last general election vote % stats equalised to total spending using real pokerchips;\r\n\r\nConservative then has 50.8% of chips to total spending %\r\nLabour has 37.5%\r\nSNP has 8.6%\r\netc (fill)\r\n\r\nThe parties that agree on a policy (ie; to pay schools) each chip in to an equal distrubution. To such (ie) 1 man has \u00a32, another has \u00a31, a bag of sweets costs \u00a31.50. therefore the 1st man pay's \u00a31, the other 50p.\r\n\r\nAfter that each party chips to their own policies.",
        "background": "No one wants to pay taxes to parties they don't support, no one also wants for there to be no taxes paid also, this meets in the middle. The party trusted recieves their income to help the community according to their policies they can afford and amend to. Everyone's \"happier\" & there's competition.",
