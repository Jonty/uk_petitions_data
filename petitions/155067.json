        "action": "Parliament should block any proposal to remove the UK from the EU.",
        "additional_details": "We ask for this action in view of these facts:\r\n- only 37.4% of the electorate voted to leave the EU\r\n- the requirement for a simple majority in this referendum, without reference to turnout, sets a bar that is much lower than is usual for such matters\r\n- many of the claims made in support of the campaign to leave are now known to be false\r\n- it is evident that many of those who voted to leave did so without understanding the consequences, which are now becoming more clear.\r\n",
        "background": "The UK\u2019s recent EU referendum was a consultative process, and any decision to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty (and so begin the process of removing the UK from the EU) must be taken by Parliament. We call on Parliament to exert its authority in this matter and keep the UK in the EU.",
