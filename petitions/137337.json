        "additional_details": "The older generations which it does not affect for long, in future, should not get to vote, or their votes should count for less as they have had pretty much all of their life and they choose to decide to screw up the young generation's futures, whilst enjoying the benefits which we will be repaying shortly once we are old enough to earn money.\r\nOver 60% of over 65's who voted made a result which was not voted for by a majority of young people who the referendum actually affects.",
        "background": "In the recent EU referendum, no matter what the result was, the ending decision was powerfully swung by the older generations of over 65's. This is in essence generations who will not experience the full effects making the decisions for the future of the younger generation.",
