        "additional_details": "Our country was built on Christian values, and whilst we are not all practising Christians, we all acknowledge that it is these values that made our country great. We are tired of being told we cannot live according to our values and traditions for fear of insulting other cultures that have come to live in this country. Our leaders seem to bend over backwards to accommodate other cultures whilst restricting the freedoms of our indigenous peoples. ",
        "background": "The UK multiculturism policy has failed. Whilst the idea of different cultures living in harmony is admirable, it should always be on the provision that it is not detrimental to the indigenous peoples culture and traditions. British nationals, feel we are giving up too much of our society.",
