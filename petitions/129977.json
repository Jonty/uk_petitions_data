Under a zero hour contract an employer has no obligation to provide any minimum hours of work leaving employees with worry that they may not be able to feed their family or pay bills on time. \r\nI would like Parliament to discuss bringing a minimum guaranteed hours scheme or a base pay so people don't have to rely on benefits to see them through.",
