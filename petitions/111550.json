        "additional_details": "An NHS 'free at the point of use' is essential to its very being, irrespective of nationality.\r\n\r\nThe Government's plans (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34685022) should be withdrawn because:\r\n\r\n- they provide a cruel barrier to healthcare for many\r\n- doctors should not have to act as border guards\r\n- they will exacerbate health emergencies and increase costs for injuries as people seek to delay accessing care\r\n- they present a dangerous precedent which could see charges introduced for all patients",
        "background": "The Government is considering charging non-European Economic Area citizens for access to emergency care, including ambulance services and A&E. \r\n\r\nThis goes against the principles of the NHS and the logic of universal healthcare; it is unimplementable, cruel, and dangerous to the nation's health.",
