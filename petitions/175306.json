        "action": "Prevent private hire drivers and vehicles operating out of their licencing area",
        "additional_details": "With the introduction of cross border private hire operations, this has brought to light a serious problem that local councils are facing in terms of drivers operating in areas that they are not licenced. Local enforcement officers can not monitor licence holders on a national basis and as a result, some drivers working out of their licencing area, are free to do as they please, breaking the law, without being brought to justice. This is a serious public safety issue that must be addressed.",
        "background": "Make it an offence for a licenced private hire driver to operate outside of their licencing area (cross border). This will make it easier for licencing authorities to keep track of their licence holders, which is next to impossible to do, if a licenced driver is operating on a national basis.",
