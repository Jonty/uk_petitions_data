Lets get this to 100,000 signatures, so MPs can debate a such important issue. The government seriously needs to stop it, we CANNOT afford it. ",

At this rate, if the NHS does continue to pay for their treatment, the NHS will start to collapse. We must only give free treatment to our British citizens. ",
