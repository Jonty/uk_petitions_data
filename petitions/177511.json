He had a heartbeat that beat in me, He is a brother, and a son. We grieved, and we grieved hard! 3 days would not of made one single difference to what we went through. Every parent has the right to have there baby registered whether its 18 or 38 weeks. There baby was loved, there baby had a heart that beat, there baby was real. It's time the law changed! I want every baby born after 18 weeks to be registered and to have a birth certificate.",
