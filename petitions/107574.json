        "action": "Ban smoking outside entrances of public buildings (especially hospitals)",
        "additional_details": "Hospitals in particular have tried various methods, including smoking shelters or having a painted No Smoking area around the entrance, but these measures are routinely ignored, making them ineffective. Public institutions are powerless to impose any restrictions on smoking outside entrances.\r\n\r\nLegislation banning smoking at entrances to around 15 metres, along with other smoking cessation measures, will help smokers to quit and non-smokers to have a more pleasant and less harmful experience. ",
        "background": "Smoking is universally recognised to be harmful. Both the smoke and the unpleasant smell spreads, which can mean unwanted exposure to non-smokers.\r\n\r\nOne of the untoward effects of the smoking ban has been a concentration of smoking outside entrances, particularly hospitals. Can we stop this please?",
