        "additional_details": "This is NOT to have the full name changed.\r\nIt's just so men can relate to it. As Breast Cancer is only directed at females, men actually probably think they could never get Breast Cancer.\r\nIf it was renamed to Pectoral Cancer for Men only.\r\nThen more cases would be found.\r\nFemale = Breast Cancer\r\nMale= Pectoral Cancer.\r\nIt would make it more Gender direct. And men would check themselves more often and do it as standard.",
        "background": "The term Breast Cancer is misleading and not associated with men.\r\nIf it's name was changed then more men would examine themselves as the word Breast Cancer is directed to a woman.\r\nBreast Cancer for Females.\r\nPectoral Cancer for Men.\r\n",
