        "additional_details": "Faith groups which run after school need to be registered on a Regional/National database and some ground rules need to be put in place by the relevant statutory body to help monitor the progress and  implementation of basic rights of the young people who attend these places of worship for religious education/activities. Certain Faith groups are not concerned with the bureaucracy of Child protection and sometimes cultural and religious pride plays a big part in this innocence.",
        "background": "Having worked in a Faith setting myself and being aware of local Madrasah\u2019s which do not have Child protection policies in place I am concerned about young people who attend such places. When I have personally approached the leaders of such places I have been turned away in good faith. ",
