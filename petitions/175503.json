        "additional_details": "Car drivers and passengers MUST wear a safety belt, therefore it stands to reason that cyclists MUST wear a cycling helmet and a fluorescent/reflective item when cycling. This would help to reduce the number of incidents which occur on the roads.\r\nThere were 21,287 reported cycling casualties in 2014. Source: http://www.rospa.com/road-safety/advice/pedal-cyclists/facts-figures/\r\nMany of these could have been avoided if cyclists were easier to see.\r\n",
        "background": "The current wording of Rule 59 allows cyclists to ignore the suggestions. The rule should be revised so that cyclists MUST wear a safety helmet and at least one article of fluorescent or reflective clothing and/or accessory (visible from front and rear) at all times when cycling on the highway.\r\n",
