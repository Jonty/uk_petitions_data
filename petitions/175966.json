The government has no conscience if it can ignore our elderly population and worry more about spending mine and many other people's tax on such projects as helping the Ethiopian 'Spice Girls' get set up and funded until 2018! They have now received in the region of \u00a39 million and that is only one example of money wasted on an overseas project. An utter waste of money!",

Many elderly people are in this terrible position. How can this be fair when taxpayers' money is being wasted abroad.",
