        "action": "Install CCTV covering all of the North Circular Road.",
        "additional_details": "If there were CCTV cameras covering this road then serious accidents like my own personal experience would have been caught on camera and therefore there would be actual video footage evidence of what happened. There has been at least 4 or 5 crashes in-between the junction's of North Finchley and Friern Barnet in the last 2 years. Some of these accidents have involved lorries, with the most recent accident causing a fatality. ",
        "background": "The North Circular road is a very dangerous road. Several people including myself have been involved in accidents on this road and due to no CCTV coverage there is no footage of the accidents and therefore serious accidents are not being treated as seriously as they should be.",
