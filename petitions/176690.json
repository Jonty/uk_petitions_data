        "additional_details": "Described by the UN as \"the world's most persecuted minority\", the Rohingya are an ethnic minority who have lived in Myanmar's Arakan state for generations. They were stripped of citizenship in 1982 and are victims of gross human rights violations.\r\n\r\nWe urge the UK government to pressure the Myanmar government to:\r\n\u2022Allow humanitarian and medical aid into the affected areas\r\n\u2022Allow the UN unrestricted access to conduct their investigations\r\n\u2022Recognise Rohingya as an official ethnic minority",
        "background": "Decades of discrimination and dehumanisation of the Rohingya, an ethnic minority in Myanmar, has ultimately led to genocidal violence from political and religious leaders since 2012, which \"may amount to crimes against humanity\". The country's leader, a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, sits idly by.",
