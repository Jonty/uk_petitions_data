        "additional_details": "Those in a full time role over two years should be offered a full time contract and an improved deal. This does not happen purely for big businesses to invoke the terms in your contract to benefit themselves at the workers cost.\r\nMany workers; the security industry for example, have been on sites for over five years with the same zero hour contract and have had no option for an improved contract or deal. This must end, it is not fair",
        "background": "These contracts benefit big businesses and some people who want a relaxed working pattern to either study or help with childcare. Many others are left on these unfair terms that prevent them from being paid for sickness, or apply for a mortgage or have any stability at work.\r\nThere should be options",
