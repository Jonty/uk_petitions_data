        "action": "Remove the requirement and fine DVLA imposes for renewing photo every 10years.",
        "additional_details": "Aging ten years has only slight changes to the appearance of a person. The ability to drive is improved with experience, not reduced, until later life, and that is only if certain ailments are effected. DVLA is purely generating income here, when they purported to decease the cost of motoring to the tax payer & give ease of access. Would ANYONE have changed from a paper licence had they been informed? ",
        "background": "DVLA promoted photo licence - with paper counterpart to allow people to access services for themselves, to make it easier & join up insurance with licensing for car ease of car taxation. Now they have removed counterparts & made you an illegal driver by imposing a 10 year renewal period. ",
