        "additional_details": "I share Mr Corbyn's concerns over bombing Syria and am insulted that my Prime Minister had chosen to equate this view with sympathy for terrorists. I would like Mr Cameron to apologise for his incendiary and offensive remarks in general, and specifically for implying that my lack of support for bombing Syria puts me in league with terrorist sympathisers.",
        "background": "On December 1, 2015, the Prime Minister was speaking to a meeting of the 1922 Committee when he referred to Jeremy Corbyn and his fellow detractors of Syrian air strikes as 'terrorist sympathisers'. When asked 12 times to apologise for this statement in Parliament, Mr Cameron failed to do so.",
