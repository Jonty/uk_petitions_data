        "additional_details": "Ovr recent months there have been a number of well-reported tragic cases involving elderly drivers who have been involved in collisions that have led to loss of life or serious injury - themselves and innocent younger people. There has to be a proper balance between supporting older people so that they can lead the most independent life possible and their own safety and that of others. A regular re-assessment of road awareness, mental skills and reactions will provide vital guidance for all.",
        "background": "With a continually aging population, the UK has a growing number of elderly drivers. There is at present no clear and consistent method of advising older people as to whether their mental or physical faculties are still sufficient to enable them to cope with the range of challenges they face.",
