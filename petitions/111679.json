        "action": "Make the proposed changes to maintenance loans apply to all current students.",
        "additional_details": "Students joining university between 2012 and 2015 are the only students who will not only have to pay \u00a39000 per year in tuition fees, but also will receive a lower amount in maintenance than the government's new proposals deem necessary. From a 2014 article on the telegraph website, one in ten students expect that money worries may affect their ability to finish their degree. The government clearly acknowledges this by raising loans for 2016 entrants, but why should current students suffer?",
        "background": "If the government realises that students need more in maintenance loans to survive, why is it that the proposed changes should not apply to every university student? Many students are struggling financially, but only those starting uni from 2016 onwards will receive the increased maintenance loans.",
