        "additional_details": "Children with excellent attendance records should be able to take up to two weeks holiday per year (subject to the school agreeing the timings) to spend quality time away with their family.  I have a family of 5 and for us to camp in France in August will cost around \u00a33,500 just for travel (by ferry) and accommodation (mobile home).  Nothing lavish, but very expensive when you throw in spending money too.  If we did this in May or June, it works out at \u00a31200!  This seems so unfair for Parents.  ",
        "background": "Taking a summer or winter holiday during half term or end of term, is incredibly expensive when you have children.  Holiday companies monopolise on parents like me every year, to the point where we sometimes just cannot afford to go away. I want the Government to consider a fair way to address this.",
