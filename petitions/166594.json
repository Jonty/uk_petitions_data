        "action": "Permanently move Parliament to a more UK population central location.",
        "additional_details": "With a new parliament location a more commutable distance, we can also do away with the cost of many second homes for MPs. The \u00a340+Billion cost of HS2 can be reallocated to pay for a new Parliament building (The final cost of Holyrood was put at \u00a3414M) and the renewal of the rail infrastructure to support it. After hundreds of years of revenue flowing from the rest of the UK to the South East, it\u2019s about time it started seeding sustainable growth elsewhere.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The seat of power in the UK has for too long resided in a place inaccessible to most of the country. This has resulted in generations of regional underinvestment and the revenue creation capacity of our country massively skewed to financial services in the City, Greater London and the South East\r\n",
