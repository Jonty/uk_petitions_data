        "additional_details": "Many that voted leave did so with a heavy heart.  The country was divided with less than 2% winning the leave vote. Many of those that did vote leave, did so because the open borders were too much of an issue. If the EU had allowed the UK to control its own borders, many of them would have voted to remain in the EU and not leave. If the EU offers this now to the UK and triggers a 2nd referendum, we the people will support remaining in the EU.",
        "background": "For the majority of Leave voters the issue was the UK's open borders.  It massively affected jobs, housing, schools, hospitals.. The list goes on..  We the people request the EU offers the UK to remain in the EU but have control over its own borders, and trigger a 2nd referendum.",
