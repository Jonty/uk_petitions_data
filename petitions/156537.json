If one of these issues can be resolved to the satisfaction of a large number of voters, another referendum would be likely to produce a decisive Remain vote, resulting in increased unity.\r\n\r\nSome suggestions:\r\nhttps://ukreferendumoneu.wordpress.com/2016/06/29/another-eu-remain-or-leave-referendum-if-the-eu-is-reformed/",
