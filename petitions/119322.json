        "additional_details": "Its not rocket science. If we continue to allow money to go out of the country and continue to import and buy from overseas then eventually the pot will run dry.  If the uk government kept pounds in the uk it would help the economy grow, create more jobs and bring the country back.  There is something to be said for always buying products made in the uk if you can find them.",
        "background": "The government complains about its debt and keeps cutting services and the NHS.  Yet the same government allows foreign businesses to take profit out of the country.  The french sell us power and run our garbage collection's, germany makes money on our trains and buses. Keep the pound in thr uk.",
