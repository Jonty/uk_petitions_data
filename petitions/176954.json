        "action": "We want the UK to stop selling arms to Israel.",
        "additional_details": "Israel must recognise international law as to its borders, it must dismantle its settlements on illegally occupied Palestinian territory including East Jerusalem. It must stop human rights violations and war crimes against the Palestinian people. It must dismantle the Wall in accordance with the 2004 judgement of the International Court of Justice. It must end the apartheid-like system of infrastructure, laws and regulations. It must be held to account for its egregious crimes against humanity.",
        "background": "Israel must end the siege of Gaza, withdraw to its 1967 borders, give up its occupation of Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem. Israel uses UK-supplied weapons to kill innocent people, destroy their homes. Israel interferes in our government and parliament. This is wrong and has to end. ",
