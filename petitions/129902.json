        "additional_details": "He has without necessity called for a referendum which could result in the UKs exit from the EU believing it will be ruinous to the nation.  In numerous speeches made by himself and his ministers have made it abundantly clear that he considers a possible exit from the EU would be disastrous for the economic welfare and security of the nation. He's therefore been derelict in his duty to defend the nation against threat by setting in motion a chain of events he believes will harm the UK.",
        "background": "He's not fit to hold the office of Prime Minister because he has knowingly put the UK in a position which he believed will undermine the security of the UK, destabilise Europe and the world economy, diminish the capabilities of our intelligence services and will cause mass unemployment.",
