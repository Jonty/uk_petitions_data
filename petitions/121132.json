        "action": "Make it illegal for any MP to have any financial interest in the arms trade.",
        "additional_details": "Last February more than 40 MPs were wined and dined by representatives of the arms industry at a cost of \u00a3250 a head. This is an example of how the arms trade lobbies Parliament to influence decisions on future conflicts, like the one taken recently to bomb Syria. If MPs were not permitted to have financial interests in arms companies, this would at least go some way to stopping such a dangerous conflict of interest.",
        "background": "Parliament makes the decision as to if and when the UK enters into a conflict or war. MPs who have a financial interest in the arms trade are likely to be more inclined to vote for such an intervention, as they will probably gain personal monetary advantage from it. ",
