        "action": "Give EU nationals living in the UK for 4 years or more automatic citizenship now",
        "additional_details": "This petition is not meant to be exclusive. Non-EU migrants have a clear set of defined rules however hence our friends are covered already and know where the road gores - WE DO NOT and need answers now from a country that has left us hanging. We represent almost 5% of the UK pubic - yet have no voice. \r\n4 years are based on the decisions made in the re-negotiations between the UK and the EU commission in Feb 2016. This petition follows the same rational (4 years entitle to benefits for example)",
        "background": "We are asking parliament give citizenship to EU migrants living in the UK for more than 4 years to:\r\n\r\n- prevent the loss of skilled workers\r\n- honour year long contributions into the system \r\n- give re-assurance to over 3m EU migrants \r\n- make sure in future all views are represented and respected ",
