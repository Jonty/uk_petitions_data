        "additional_details": "This means:\r\n(a) honouring all existing funding decisions made to UK institutions by EU bodies.\r\n(b) duplicating the existing funding framework when science funding is repatriated to the UK, and \r\n(c) pledging to maintain and index link the current level of funding (currently around \u00a31 Billion per year) until at least the next general election in 2020. Since this investment is part of our \u00a319 Billion per year gross contribution to the EU budget, making this commitment requires no new money",
        "background": "The British Academic and Scientific communities are in turmoil because scientific funding from the EU is at risk. To prevent a 'brain drain' in the next 12 months, we call for the government to restore certainty by making an immediate pledge to protect existing funding levels post 'Brexit'.",
