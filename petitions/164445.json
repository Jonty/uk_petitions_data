        "additional_details": "Current regulations say that the new \"superfast\" technology must be installed outside exchanges in cabinets. Therefore new cabinets should be installed outside existing exchanges (to comply with current regulations) or the regulations should be changed.\r\n\r\nCurrently the public money being spent on these projects is done so without public consultation. Homeowners and businesses cannot interact with the organisers implementing the projects to ensure fair distribution.",
        "background": "During the current \"superfast\" broadband rollout, many properties are being excluded because they are not connected to roadside cabinets. When these properties were originally connected to their local telephone exchange, cabinets were not in standard use.",
