The abuser in this case threatened the victim and scared her to not tell anyone so he was fully aware what he was doing was wrong.\r\nIf he thought it was a normal act would have openly done it than threatening her.\r\nThe trial lasted two days because of this law. Which is wrong where is the justice for victims. Rape is rape and doli inpacax should not be used.\r\n",
