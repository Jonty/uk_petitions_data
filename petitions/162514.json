Even if they had a second opinion on a complicated matter.\r\nA PM's catchphrase of a \"once in a generation vote\" is not legally binding and should not be held as the final word on the biggest decision this country has made. A decision that currently, should not be held as law and is proven to be influenced by lies.\r\n\r\n",
