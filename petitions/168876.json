        "additional_details": "The European Single Market enables free trade within the EU, helping 26 million UK businesses and access to a market worth over \u00a39 trillion. Membership of the single market would allow us to enjoy the same trade benefits and support British companies even after we have left the EU. Continued tariff-free trade will preserve confidence in the British economy, but with Theresa May's current plan, it would require leaving the block, our economy will go down and the working/middle class will suffer.",
        "background": "People voted for brexit thinking it would be done in an orderly fashion with an input from everyone in parliament, not by a committee created by an unelected prime minister. Brexit should be done with everyone in mind, no one asked for a crippled pound and a damage to the economy.",
