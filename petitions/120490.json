        "additional_details": "Cars today are also fitted with advanced technologies such as ABS and automatic braking. They have become safer but the roads have not grown to accommodate them. \r\nIt should not be assumed that all vehicles have the same stopping distance and often cars that can achieve higher speeds have better stopping distances. For example a McLaren P1 (sporty car but still a good example) can stop in 30.2 metres while the Highway Code states it should take 102 metres to stop from the same speed. ",
        "background": "The 70 mile per hour speed limit was introduced back in 1965 and since that time cars have become much safer due to shorter stopping distances and more rigorous safety standards for car manufacturers. Roads have not advanced at the same pace however and are stuck using an outdated speed limit. ",
