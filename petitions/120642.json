        "additional_details": "Most Bailiff enforced court orders are printed, invalid or not correctly signed. This petition is to ensure that the ACTUAL rights of the Bailiffs are understood by the Police.\r\n\r\nIn 99% of cases the bailiffs claim to \"force entry\" or issue \"distress warrants\" is incorrect and not founded in law. Yet the majority of police officers are unaware of the legalities (its a civil matter NOT criminal) and assist the Bailiffs.......This practice HAS to stop. \r\n\r\nThe Police NEED to be trained in this matter.",
        "background": "The Police are used by bailiffs to enforce court orders, many of which are civil matters (council tax, energy companies etc. ). this is against actual legislation where warrants are concerned. Also the police are unaware of the actual powers of bailiffs are.",
