        "additional_details": "[From http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/elections-and-voting/general/]\r\nThere are two provisions that trigger an election other than at five year intervals:\r\n1. a motion of no confidence is passed in Her Majesty's Government by a simple majority and 14 days elapses without the House passing a confidence motion in any new Government formed\r\n2. a motion for a general election is agreed by two thirds of the total number of seats in the Commons including vacant seats (currently 434 out of 650)\r\n",
        "background": "A motion of no confidence could see a general election forced before article 50 of the EU Treaty is invoked. What action to take against the \"advisory\" EU Referendum's close result against a backdrop of misinformation and fraudulent claims by the \"Leave\" campaign would then become an election issue.",
