        "action": "Properly clarify status of encryption in The Investigatory Powers Bill",
        "additional_details": "The bill MUST make clear that CPs can offer secure communications which cannot be read or intercepted even with a warrant or with an intercept order or order to maintain an intercept capability.\r\n\r\nWithout this people (in UK and overseas) cannot trust CPs offering secure communications, and trust is essential in this industry.\r\n\r\nEven as worded now, the bill allows criminals to communicate using own encryption, so that battle is lost. We need to allow non-criminals the same benefit using CP services",
        "background": "The draft bill suggests that communications providers may have to remove \"protection\". The joint committee says the bill should make clear that this be only where technically practicable. This does not quite go far enough. We need a clear statement allowing CPs to offer secure communications.",
