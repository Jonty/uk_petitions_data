Almost 20% of its cost new. Correspondence with Honda UK proved unsuccessful. Some manufacturers do not include DPF's in their warranties. \r\n\r\nI would like to see Manufacturers being forced to give \r\n1) A retrospective guarantee on DPF's for a period of 10 years or 150,000 miles\r\n2) To recall all vehicles sold since 2009 and test the DPFs, compensating owners\r\n ",

These filters are failing or becoming clogged up and consumers are being presented with costly repair bills.  ",
