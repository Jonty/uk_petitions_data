        "action": "To urge MP's to vote to hold a general election in September 2016.",
        "additional_details": "In order for Great Britain to succeed in its negociations with the EU to ensure a smooth exit from the EU, the government needs a renewed mandate from the electorate. Since 75% of MP's have declared their support for the EU and the British people voted by a majority the opposite, Parliament no longer represents the people. Therefore it is imperative that a General Election is held as soon as possible. The circumstances of this petition are extraordinary and of great importance to the nation.",
        "background": "With the political turmoil resulting from the referendum on EU membership the country needs a General Election to fully reflect the will of the majority. Both major parties have descended in to viscious in-fighting which is against the national interest. ",
