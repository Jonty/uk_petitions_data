        "additional_details": "Social workers generally don't have the experience of real life and when dealing with both parents, whom ever gets in first wins...and it's not a race, it's about being a good parent to your child. \r\nFairness still doesn't seem to exist between parents and the authorities. The past can be exaggerated to make one person have the hardest time of their life and generally have to fight against the whole world just to see the child/children. \r\nThe system is too easily manipulated.",
