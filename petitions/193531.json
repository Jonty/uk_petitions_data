        "additional_details": "Everyone circumstances are different.. I know this.. but why arent all 2 year olds benefiting from this great service? Just cause we work doesnt mean we can afford childcare, Infact in some cases the total opposite.\r\n\r\nIve spoken 1st hand to various nursery teachers and parents. Some have told me they drop off their kids for \"me\" time (Which would be lovely dont get me wrong) but us working parents need our kids watched too if not more.\r\nHELP\r\nPlease sign this petition and help try fix this problem",
        "background": "The government's extended nursery places for 2 year olds.. Woohoo... BUT this doesnt include working mums and dads who dont get benefits.. Dont we all need help... right now most kids who have places at age 2.. their parents dont work at all. Where is the sense in this?? ",
