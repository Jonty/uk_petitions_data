        "action": "Make Business Studies, Life Skills and Politics mandatory at Secondary School.",
        "additional_details": "There is so much opportunity that is potentially being wasted by not equipping children with the skills and knowledge to get on in life. Children should have a knowledge of politics, business, how to get a mortgage. Children should know who the Prime Minister of this country is and how laws are made. If we want our country to be set up for success we should invest in our children as they will invest in the country themselves.",
        "background": "In school there is no direct focus on skills that children need to truly succeed in life. Business Studies is taken an optional subject when really we should be teaching our children how to be entrepreneurial, this would help children gain essential critical thinking skills to help them grow.",
