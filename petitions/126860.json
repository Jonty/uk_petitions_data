The 14-page document, to be sent to 27 million homes, is designed to respond to public demand for more details about the EU referendum ... Royal Mail will start delivering the leaflets in England next week and in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland after the 5 May elections.\"",
        "background": "The government says it will send an EU referendum 'information' leaflet to every home. Yet the leaflet isn't factual but political & biased, backing an In vote. The \u00a39m cost is more than the official Leave group can spend on their whole campaign. It's unfair, abuses public money & must be stopped.",
