Most of this money is spent on educating children, immunisation, refugees and encouraging global action on climate change. However the water crisis is a significantly problematic issue, as 1 in 9 people do not have access to clean water and adequate sanitation, which kills 5,000 children daily.This leads to a lack of education and rapid spread of diseases, forcing families to fall further into extreme poverty.

Funds as such could have been used towards Water And Sanitation Hygiene Projects; which would work towards the Global Goal 6, ensuring the availability of water to everyone",
