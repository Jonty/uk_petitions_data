        "additional_details": "I remember dog licences as a child and we were a poor family, but we had two dogs, plus many other animals; we had all the necessary paper work. It would not cost much, just a database of responsible pet owners, registering their pets. All is needed are rules to be made about selling live animals online or anywhere. People are breeding and selling 'pets' to sell for great sums of money per litter, pretty much unchecked and as undeclared earnings. Regulation would discourage breeding for money.",
        "background": "Pet ownership comes with responsibility, the environment in which the animal lives and with who. The sale of pets on websites for large sums of money encourages irresponsible breeding and is open to abuse, genuine breeders are already regulated. Pets are not possessions to be used to make money.",
