        "additional_details": "Neglect can range from leaving a child hungry or dirty, without adequate shelter, supervision or clothing or denying the child medical or health care. The NSPCC identify 57,000 cases of children that need protecting. That number is staggering. Where child deaths from homicide or death may have declined in 2016 a sharp rise in sexual offences towards children overshadows the fact that serious and longer sentences need to be imposed to ensure these people don't have access to children ever again.",
        "background": "The neglect and abuse of children is on the rise in Britain. From Baby P to Liam Fee the U.K. seems to be at the forefront of child abuse and neglect cases. But our courts do not seem to reflect the appropriate sentence for the crime when proceedings have concluded. ",
