There are also those who did not vote in the recent referendum who may now wish to add their voice to whether to remain or leave the EU. Considering the closeness of the result. A compulsory vote of all citizens aged 16+ is required to settle this issue once and for all with full agreement of the population as its implications affects all citizens.",
