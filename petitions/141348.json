At the age of 14 we are legally permitted to work, therefore why can't we be given the right to vote as we are working in the real world, dealing with people of all ages and are subsequently expected to be able to tell the difference between right and wrong. Thus we should be able to choose a local counselor or an mp to represent us or those issues that affect us in our daily lives. ",
