        "action": "Instead of allowing an unelected MP to be PM, hold a general election",
        "additional_details": "Although the two provisions that trigger an election other than at five year intervals aren't currently met I feel as though it is in the interest of the public to hold another general election. It's unjust to allow someone like Boris Johnson to take lead and rule the country, it's almost like a dictatorship, the people voted for David Cameron of the Conservative Party to be Prime Minister, nobody else.",
        "background": "After just having the most important democratic vote in our lifetimes, how could it be morally and justifiably right to allow an MP who has been unelected take to charge of our country. Democracy must be upheld and the country should be allowed to have their say.",
