We could accept a petition calling for the Government to expel US military personnel from the UK, but we are not clear what you would like to happen with regard to the Magna Carta. The legal basis for the US Visiting Force in the United Kingdom is primarily the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Status of Forces Agreement of 1951 (SOFA) and the Visiting Forces Act of 1952. You could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. "
