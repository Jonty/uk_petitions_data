        "additional_details": "There is a huge imbalance in infrastructure spending between North and South, sucking economic activity away from the north. London gets 24 times as much spent on infrastructure per resident than north-east England. \r\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/aug/07/london-gets-24-times-as-much-infrastructure-north-east-england\r\n\r\nLiverpool has offered to pay \u00a32bn towards the \u00a33bn cost of high speed rail. The government can't find \u00a31bn left for that but has \u00a327-32bn to spend on more for London.",
        "background": "Until there is equal per capita funding for transport schemes in the north there should be no more funding for huge schemes in London like Crossrail2.\r\n\r\n\"HS3\" is very small scale, and these plans still concentrate spending in the capital while there are only very minor upgrades for the north.",
