        "action": "Legalise the recreational and medical use of Marijuana in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Every argument you have that challenges marijuana is immediately nullified by the fact that we are allowed to abuse many substances that do even worse, especially when the one that has been made illegal isn't fatal, has mental and physical benefits and is being constantly proved acceptable and convenient by the places it has been legalised in. Legalising cannabis could bring in \u00a3900m in taxes every year, save \u00a3400m on policing cannabis and create over 10,000 new jobs.",
        "background": "It's LEGAL in places. It's been proven to aid physical and mental pain - (chronic muscular pain, CANCER CELLS, insomnia, and anxiety to name a few). Yeah it can make people lazy if they smoke it without moderation but drinking too much can make you aggressive, reckless or even dead.",
