        "additional_details": "From 1st April 2017, the benefits of Flat Rate savings will virtually disappear for the majority of Contractors. HMRC has proposed a new flat rate percentage of 16.5% for any business of any industry if they are classified as Limited Cost Trader. 16.5% equates to 19.2% of sale and therefore the saving is the very small amount of just 0.8%. So naturally anyone spending more than 0.8% on Vatable expenses will be worse off continuing on the Flat Rate Scheme from 1st April 2017.",
        "background": "This government has systematically introduced changes in Tax and VAT rules that specifically hit small business throughout the UK. Higher NI contributions, Employer Pension Contributions, Lower Director dividends, and now the virtual disappearance of Flat Rate VAT Savings. This needs to end.",
