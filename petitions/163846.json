For the public at large this can take 12 to 18 months. The recent announcement of the departing Prime Minister's rapid Honours List justifies the tag of \"cronyism\" especially as many awards are to persons who are simply doing their chosen job. This is especially so with regard to his wife's \"stylist\" who is receiving an award for what?",
