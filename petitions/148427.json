        "additional_details": "More than 2/3 of 18 to 30 year old wanted to remain in the EU. Three of the five countries Northern Ireland, Scotland and Gibraltar wanting to remain. A majority of just over 50%, there should not be a mandate to leave. MP's do not have to make the referendum legally binding.  Canary Wharf to lose billions of investment and millions of jobs to be lost.  The independence of Scotland and the increase interest rates on the government debt of up to 50 billion more a year in interest. Do not bankrupt",
        "background": "EU referendum not legally binding. Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation block, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European communities Act. With 75% of MP's wanting to stay in the EU and wafer thin majority, less than the 2/3 to go in the EU. No repeal.",
