        "additional_details": "Bleacher Report and talkSPORT polls in 2014 and 2015 respectively both finished in favour, so we know the majority of fans are in favour - but only with government support can the FA wrestle the fourth spot from Scudamore and his fatcat friends. The FA Cup winners deserve better than Thursday evening trips to Liechtenstein and Georgia. Oh, and a couple of games against Fiorentina if you're lucky - which is great, if you're playing Championship Manager 3.",
        "background": "No other sport rewards fourth place - so why are teams which have finished on average 14.4 points behind the champions in the last five years awarded a spot at Europe's big boys table, while the winners of the world's oldest club competition are rewarded with Thursday nights on Channel 5?",
