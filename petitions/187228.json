        "action": "Exempt homes that people are living in from the definition of \"brownfield\" land.",
        "additional_details": "As profits to be made out of regeneration increase, this risk extends to more and more occupied homes. Homes are compulsorily purchased and existing tenants evicted so the land can be sold for development. At the moment this is mainly the terrified residents of council estates - because councils own some of the land already, can force out their own tenants & CPO leaseholders & freeholders relatively cheaply. But the brownfield definition means it will be any homes where a profit can be made.",
        "background": "The current definition of brownfield land puts your home at risk. Brownfield land used to be thought of as ex-industrial but your home is now considered to be 'brownfield' (land which has been previously developed). The National Planning Policy Framework prioritises brownfield land for development.",
