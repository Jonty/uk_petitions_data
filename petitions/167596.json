        "additional_details": "The UK currently recycles 64% of all packaging waste, but only about 32% of plastic packaging waste.\r\n\r\nThis is unacceptable. We cannot let big business create more packaging that our society cannot deal with - it may be good for profits but it is irresponsible and unsustainable.\r\n\r\nWe call upon our leaders to take action: to ban all non-sustainable packaging on all products, with a grace period of 5 years to allow manufacturers to integrate viable, sustainable alternatives into their supply chains.",
        "background": "The UK fails to recycle over 1.5 million tonnes of plastic packaging waste each year, which ends up in landfill & waterways instead. \r\n\r\nCreating packaging that our society cannot deal with is blatantly unsustainable. We urgently need 100% recyclable/compostable packaging on every product in the UK.",
