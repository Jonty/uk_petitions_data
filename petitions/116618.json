        "additional_details": "This shocking charge will be added to the already existing fee of \u00a321.60 that pensioners pay to be part of Careline.\r\nIf the person does not pay this additional fee, help will not be given and an ambulance will have to be called, leaving the elderly person lying on the floor. This is unnecessary and incredibly undignified, and whether someone goes through this or not entirely depends on whether they can afford for it not to happen. In short, they are being fined for falling. ",
        "background": "Tendring district council are introducing an additional fee to the Careline package that means elderly people will have to pay an additional \u00a326 per annum to be helped up after a fall. The elderly have paid taxes throughout their lives to have the insurance of healthcare yet are having to pay more. ",
