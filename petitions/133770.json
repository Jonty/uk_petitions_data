        "action": "Explore further concessions to remain within the EU",
        "additional_details": "It is evident that the UK's current relationship with the EU was rejected by a very slim margin and it is important that this rejection is respected. However due to the size of the margin and a previous offer of further concessions from it would be undemocratic not to explore all available options as long as there is sufficient support for this petition. \r\n\r\nWe owe it to future generations to explore all options before we inflict such a profound socioeconomic change on the UK and the EU. \r\n",
        "background": "We propose that the government explore all possibilities of gaining further concessions from the EU in order that the UK might remain a member nation. The ramifications of leaving the EU will be devastating for the continent as a whole. All options need to be explored prior to closing the door.",
