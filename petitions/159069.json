        "additional_details": "Zero Carbon homes are not more expensive - designers at Cardiff University built a zero carbon house at no extra cost here: (http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-33544831). Also, they will be cheaper to run as energy costs could be zero or even negative, therefore earning the owners money.\r\nAs well as the economic benefits of zero carbon homes, reducing carbon emissions is also important for climate change; and reducing energy dependency on other countries (i.e. by importing gas and oil)",
        "background": "The plan would have ensured that all new dwellings from 2016 would generate as much energy on-site \u2013 via renewable sources, e.g. wind or solar energy \u2013 as they would use in heating, hot water, lighting and ventilation. This would be alongside tighter energy efficiency standards.",
