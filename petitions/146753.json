The action of demonising another group is what they are doing in a stereotypical fashion.  They are also acting in a farcical & wholly undemocratic way akin to the unelected bodies that they are asking to be governed by.  LEAVE MEANS LEAVE-GET BEHIND BREXIT",

Wales won against ROI & the ROI are not asking for a rematch because of an own goal made them lose.  The country now needs to get behind BREXIT & be the best we can be",
