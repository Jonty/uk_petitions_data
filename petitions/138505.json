        "additional_details": "This referendum should never have happened. An ill informed public should not be made to make a decision with such vast impact of life in the UK based on half truths, lies and impossible promises. Many voters regret their vote & it has divided everyone. Now the UK faces not only leaving the EU but splitting up into independent countries/states. Parliament must take these events into account, vote on if the PM will activate Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and act to ensure the stability of the UK ",
        "background": "38% (51.9% of 73%) of the public have voted to leave the EU after misleading & lacklustre campaigns, whilst Parliament has stood back. As our leaders we the undersigned ask Parliament with their vast resources & experience to debate & vote on if the PM will activate Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty",
