        "additional_details": "The six former soldiers were onboard the vessel as sub contractor's and had no responsibility for the vessel. The master and crew were in charge of the vessel when it went seeking fuel. A storm was approaching and Indian authorities gave permission to enter territorial waters to obtain fuel. The Indian authorities then arrested all onboard and detained them for two years whilst different agencies argued who had jurisdiction and who should prosecute causing unnecessary delays. ",

The case is a debacle as many law enforcement agencies have claimed jurisdiction and interfered with the justice system.These guy's should be released",
