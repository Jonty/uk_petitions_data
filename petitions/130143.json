        "additional_details": "This is a petition is to end compulsory inclusion of BBC services in media packages and to therefore remove or vastly reduce the licence fee for those who do not choose to use the BBC services. We should not have to pay for services not required just because we have media viewing devices in our homes.",
        "background": "BBC channels are always included in media packages for television viewing whether paid versions or freeview versions. This then results in the compulsory purchase of a TV licence as the 'choice' to not use these services is removed.",
