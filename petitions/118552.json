        "action": "Remove time limits from GCSE and A Level exams.",
        "additional_details": "For instance, I sat my GCSE English Language exam in June 2014. Because I was unable to finish my paper in time, I only just ended up with a C grade, which has narrowed down my options for university.\r\n\r\nTime limits also cause a lot of stress within the exam, as well as putting unnecessary pressure on those who may be unable to cope with it. This could then have a further negative effect on their grades as a result. Exams are supposed to demonstrate your knowledge, not your time keeping ability.",
        "background": "Exams are there for candidates to demonstrate their ability in a certain subject. However, heavily punitive time limits are preventing many students from finishing their papers. This means they don't have the time to answer every question, leading them to achieve lower than expected grades.",
