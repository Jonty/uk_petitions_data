        "additional_details": "Cosmetic surgery is performed to enhance the patients appearance and this type of surgery obviously has its place. \r\nHowever, many women are being refused breast reduction on the basis that it is, primarily, acknowledged as a cosmetic procedure. \r\nWomen are suffering chronic backache, which at times can prove crippling, neck pain, shoulder pain, headaches and breast abscesses, to name but a few ailments. \r\nReferrals to a surgeon are difficult, if not impossible in some areas, due to lack of funding",
        "background": "Many women are being refused breast reduction on NHS because it is primarily seen as cosmetic. Funding has been withdrawn in many areas of the UK. \r\nMany of these women are suffering long term health problems and being denied treatment that would lead to a better quality of life",
