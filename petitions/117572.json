        "additional_details": "If you think immediate family members have a right to know about the death of a mother, father, sister, brother, son or daughter, please sign this petition. I would like the Government to set a law whereby it is a civil offence to not inform immediate family of a bereavement, thereby giving them the opportunity to ensure everyone's needs are met. I would hope that the person who was first informed or was present at the time of death bears the responsibility to ensure all members are informed.",
        "background": "My husband was not informed of his father's or mother's death. In this instance the brother of my husband had his parents sent away and cremated with no service or acknowledgement. The pain and suffering this causes should be a civil offence and a right to know should be established.",
