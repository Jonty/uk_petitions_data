        "additional_details": "H&S is such an important area in Design & Technology for staff and pupils alike. The number of pupils in the workshop has increased in an environment of reduced time but the same, often higher, expected grades. There needs to be a limit due to the amount and types of tools and equipment in order to make it manageable and safe. The guidelines are law in some countries and this needs to be made law here too.",
        "background": "More and more D&T teachers are reporting increased class sizes and do not have clarity on official expectations. Bulletin 103 suggests space requirements for each pupil related to the size of the room but the term 'guidelines' often restricts any raised concerns. ",
