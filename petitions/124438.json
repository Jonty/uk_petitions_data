I don't see why we should have to buy a product several times to listen to/read/view it on our favourite formats. Also when you download something what do you actually own? I also do not think it's unreasonable to see downloads transferable across formats if you decide to move from say Apple to Android.",

This is why I believe with every physical purchase we make we should be entitled to a digital copy in the format of our choice. ",
