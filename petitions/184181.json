        "additional_details": "Despite an insurance model that has worked for years, the government body the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) have said it\u2019s no longer suitable.\r\n\r\nThe insurance is for labour and birth care.\r\n\r\nBut the NMC refuse to say what the insurance needs to be.\r\n\r\nThis is a damaging and upsetting situation for women who can no longer have their known independent midwife with them in labour.\r\n\r\nThe government should instruct the NMC to quickly identify what kind of insurance would be suitable, allowing independent midwives to pay for new insurance, get back to work, and women to choose them if they want to.",
        "background": "Independent midwives are fully regulated, registered and experienced midwives.\r\n\r\nThey are self-employed and take pressure off the NHS.\r\n\r\nAs of Jan 2017, they can no longer work for themselves due to new government guidelines.",
