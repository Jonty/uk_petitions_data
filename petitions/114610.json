        "additional_details": "There is a huge difference between allowing 16 year olds to LEARN to drive where not being on public roads, and allowing them to drive on the public roads, I just want myself and others to be allowed to start learning now, so when we take out practical test when turning 17, we have a higher chance of passing.",
        "background": "I strongly believe that the government should allow 16 year olds to LEARN (NOT being on a public road) to drive. It will allow us to gain experience before taking the practical test when we turn 17. A qualified instructor will of course be required.",
