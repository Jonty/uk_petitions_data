        "additional_details": "It takes about 2 days practice to become confident in using Swegways/Hoverboards making them far easier to control and use than a bicycle or a skateboard yet just because they have motors they are illegal to use in public. However bicycles with electric motor assistance are Legal. ",
        "background": "Section 72 of the Highway Act of 1835 which indirectly bans the use of Swegways/Hoverboards/Monorovers is out of date. Swegways/Hoverboards are slower, easier to control and smaller than much larger Segways. Top speed of 6-8 mph also means they are smaller, slower and safer than mobility scooters",
