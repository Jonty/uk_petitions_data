        "additional_details": "- The EU referendum legislation did not make the result of the referendum binding on the government (unlike for instance the previous referendum on electoral reform).\r\n\r\n- The eligible electorate in the referendum was 46,500,001. The number who voted 'Leave' was 17,410,742 (37% of the total electorate).\r\n\r\n- The central principle of our parliamentary democracy is that MPs are elected to make decisions in the best interests of the whole country.",
        "background": "Only 37% of the electorate have voted for Britain to leave the EU. This does not constitute a mandate for the government to take such a momentous step. We call on the government not to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty unless a majority of MPs first vote in favour in a free vote of parliament.",
