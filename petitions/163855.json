        "additional_details": "Harambe was gunned down in cold blood, on May 28th 2016. He was just seventeen years old. Harambe was agitated by the crowd baying for his blood, even as Primatologist Jane Goodall opined that he was trying to protect the poor child involved (http://www.janegoodall.org/wp-content/uploads/2796_001.pdf). ",
        "background": "Harambe was a proud, benevolent, and majestic creature. Closely related to we humans, we should mourn the passing of this loving being appropriately. His death will not be in vain. He died as he lived, protecting the innocent, and showing us all how to live our own lives. An inspiration. ",
