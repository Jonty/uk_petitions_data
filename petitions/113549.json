        "additional_details": "My husband (Mr. Nicholas Guya) came to know that he was a sickle-cell carrier in  2012 when his baby was diagnosed with it and he was advised by the NHS that it is not an illness and cannot change into an illness. Because he had the trait which the army never tested for in order to advise him accordingly, the army has refused to claim responsibility for his death despite the fact that he was on a military training exercise  when it occurred.",
        "background": "Guya collapsed during a military training exercise in Cumbria in January 2013 and died within 18 hours. The post-mortem revealed the cause of death as exercise related complications of sickle cell trait. When joining the army in 2007, he was neither tested for the condition nor advised about it. ",
