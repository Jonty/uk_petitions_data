        "additional_details": "Despite all efforts by wildlife experts to stop the badger cull the Government continues with a badly devised scheme to reduce TB.  The most important data was never obtained. Recording the number of affected culled badgers and the areas where TB was most prevalent is surely crucial for developing a strategy to reduce Bovine TB.  A statistical report will show where number of TB hosts are more severe.  Joined up interventions such as vaccinations and bio-security on farms are needed.       ",
        "background": "The Government failed to test culled badgers to measure the percentage hosting tuberculosis & the most affected areas.  This data is key. UK Government ignored advice of Wildlife Experts by continuing the Badger cull. Other wildlife such as Deer host TB, so the badger cull policy is flawed.  ",
