        "additional_details": "Wouldn't it be nice if we could have a referendum on issues such as allowing refugees into Britain, or give our ideas and opinions rather than putting it to a vote in parliament that also involves the MP's of other political parties.\r\nLet's make politics work and have our voices heard, which in turn would reduce the amount of protests and violence. Let's vote for a TRUE democracy that works for our country!",
        "background": "I'm calling out to the British public for us to demand to have our say in politics. Our current goverenment should allow us to have referendums on some issues, rather than parliament voting and making decisions for us all the time.\r\nWe should demand fairer politics and have our voices heard!",
