        "additional_details": "If this plan goes ahead, it will mean that the bars and clubs on King street may receive noise complaints and may have to reduce their noise levels and operating hours. Wigan cannot afford any more unemployment in the town and many of the staff are now worried that they could lose their jobs over this. King street is dependant on its nightlife and see's 1000's of customers every week. Having a residential area in the middle of the street is only the start of what negative's it will bring",
        "background": "Wigan Council is planning on converting Evolution Nightclub / 36-44 King Street Wigan into restaurants, cafes and residential units. This will seriously damage the nightlife in Wigan and cause many job losses. King street is made up of bars and clubs and employs hundreds of people.",
