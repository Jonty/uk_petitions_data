        "action": "Second EU referendum after a suggested \"cool down\" period of 2 months.",
        "additional_details": "There have now been a number of revelations made by prominent Leave campaigners after the referendum has completed that what they said during the build up to the referendum was untrue. Democracy only functions when the populous has factually correct information in which to base their decisions - in the first referendum, this unfortunately was not the case. If a 2nd referendum is held and results are within 5% of each other, the decision should be given to the UK government to vote upon.",
        "background": "23rd of June saw the United Kingdom EU referendum. Campaigning on both sides was not comprehensive enough for informed decisions to be made creating a failed democratic result with consequences only being realised after the1st referendum. A second, more informed, truthful referendum is required",
