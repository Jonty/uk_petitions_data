        "additional_details": "It is seen as normal to shoot & incinerate hounds when no longer productive & disposed of if they fail in any way. They are killed at half their life expectancy. Hounds are punished for chasing the wrong scent. As soon as they are born they are taught to be savage which is not their natural instinct & removed if not savage enough, Old dogs are replaced in a constant cycle & shot without remorse & burned, More hounds are bred than needed. Some hounds are killed when hunting, They deserve better.",
        "background": "It is estimated that between 3,000 & 10,000 hounds are clubbed or shot each year if they are unsuitable or show weakness. Week old pups are executed if not strong enough. This petition is asking for unsuitable pups & old dogs to be removed & not killed & re-homed somewhere more suitable.",
