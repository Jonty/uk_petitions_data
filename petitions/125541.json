        "additional_details": "Scrap the dated restriction preventing the application of newer style number plates to old cars \r\nInformation on a cars actual year of release is widely available in the modern times apps HPI checks etc and this would become buyer responsibility similar to checking if a car is stolen or written off when buying. \r\nMaking it harder to get caught out e.g 2006 plate on a 2004 car would HPI check as 2004 car.\r\nThis would mean less paperwork for DVLA and more revenue from personalised registrations \r\n",
        "background": "This means that people can apply a personalised registration plate on any age car regardless of the age of plate \r\nMaking it easier for DVLA to sell number plates and making them more valuable as they are more applicable.\r\n \r\n",
