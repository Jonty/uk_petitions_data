        "additional_details": "The use of subliminal images by the BBC in targeting minorities or immigrants or even Scotland is disgusting. It has political agendas far beyond its remit and even targets politicians. Even if you do not like Jeremy Cobyn, one day it could be any other politician which does not serve the ultimate controller of the BBC.\r\n\r\nThe NHS which is depleted and suffering could make better use of these resources for the welfare of the nation. And people would be less taxed too by its excesses of the BBC.",
        "background": "The BBC has become an expensive white elephant with anything but a public service as its main goal. It is becoming extremely political and targeting minorities and politicians alike. It is time to make good use of its assets by selling it all and earmaking all proceeds to go to the NHS",
