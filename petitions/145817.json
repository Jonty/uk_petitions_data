        "additional_details": "The UK is currently an integral part of the European single marketplace, but, it would seem, wishes to look further afield to find more markets. Staying within the Single Market would retain the current distinct advantages for social progress, and for consumers, workers, small and large enterprises. \r\n\r\nRemaining within the Single Market should also permit us to retain many jobs which must otherwise fly abroad to other European cities or countries whilst permitting the search for further business.",
