UK governments over decades have been working to replace our NHS with a US style system. That costs twice as much per capita as the NHS, and ~30% of costs go on admin. Pre-marketisation NHS admin cost ~5%. The market has increased it to ~15% (\u00a310 bn pa wasted and rising). 1 in 5 US citizens cannot afford any healthcare.",
