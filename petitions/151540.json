        "additional_details": "The recent EU referendum showed how the youth of the UK were disenfranchised by not having the vote. The older generations decided their future for them and it is they who will face the consequences most. The younger generation should have the chance to shape their own future \r\n\r\nAlso, there is an age inequality of voting age in the UK as 16 year olds have the right to vote in Scotland, Jersey and the Isle of Man. ",
        "background": "The government has branded 16 and 17 year olds as too irresponsible to vote. However 16 year olds are legally allowed to marry, join the army, leave compulsory education for work, drive a vehicle and be held responsible for a crime. Then why are 16 and 17 year olds not legally allowed to vote?",
