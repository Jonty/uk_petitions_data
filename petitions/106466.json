        "action": "Move parliament to a new campus with halls, etc. No 2nd homes or expenses.",
        "additional_details": "The houses of parliament are not fit for modern use. A new building can be created with circular debating chambers (more democratic and less confrontational/adversarial) and support facilities. Accommodation should also be built with a bedroom, study, bathroom and kitchen/diner for each member (some flats can be nicer, with a committee to allocate for senior members, etc.). On-site facilities such as gym, restaurant, etc. This would allow all members the same free facilities during the week.",
        "background": "During houses of Parliament repair build a campus with circular debating chambers, etc. for both houses. On the campus build enough self-contained flats to allow all members a place to live and work when in London. Restaurants also on site. All free so no expenses can be claimed. Stratford?",
