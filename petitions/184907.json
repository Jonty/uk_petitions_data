About a third of us has GBS in our gut without even knowing it. \r\n\r\nAbout a quarter of women also have GBS\r\n\r\nThough it's unusual, GBS is the most common cause of severe infection in newborns, particularly in the first week after birth (early onset infection). In the UK, about 340 babies develop a GBS infection every year\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Group B Strep has no obvious symptoms\r\nIt affects 1/3 of all people and a 1/4 of women have GBS inside their vagina. \r\nAs it has no symptoms it can cause problems with newborns, in worst cases, death. \r\n\r\nA test is available but you have to pay. ",
