        "additional_details": "There is no evidence that dropping bombs on Syria will make the UK any safer. It may, in fact, prompt revenge terror attacks from existing Daesh members on UK soil. \r\n\r\nImportantly, many more innocent Syrians, who have already lost their children, their parents and their homes will inevitably suffer and die due to our Prime Minister's ill-advised and inept warmongering. \r\n\r\nIt may be our country dropping the bombs and causing more suffering, but to that we simply say this: \r\n\r\nNOT IN MY NAME. ",
        "background": "On Wednesday 2nd December, David Cameron won approval on his motion to perform air strikes on Syria by 397 to 223 votes. \r\n\r\nDespite widespread public condemnation and no demonstrable long-term military plan or exit strategy we are now engaged in another open-ended war in the Middle East.
