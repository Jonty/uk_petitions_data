        "action": "Consider amending the Revenge Porn law to make it apply retrospectively.",
        "additional_details": "Just because the act of \"disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress\" was recognised as a crime in 2015, it does not mean that it has not occurred for many years. Victims of this crime cannot gain justice for incidents in the past. This petition is asking Parliament to consider amending the law and allowing it to become Ex Post Facto - meaning that past actions can retrospectively be declared as a 'crime' in the eyes of the law.",
        "background": "Criminal Justice and Courts Bill (HL Bill 49), Section 33 now makes Revenge Porn - the act of \"disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress\" - a criminal offence. However, actions committed before the passing of this law are not considered a crime.",
