They have no contact number, and refuse to speak to customers directly.\r\n\r\nInstead, they pass excuses after excuses to your service provider, whose hands are tied. OpenReach have a complete monopoly over telecommunications in the UK, and with no competition, they can take months to take any action.\r\n\r\nBy reclassifying Internet connectivity as a 'utility', it is regarded as a 'must' for households, just like water and electricity.",

This is a vital form of connectivity, for the majority of households and businesses in the UK. Yet if your telephone line fails, it's at the hands of your service provider, and OpenReach. This can take months!",
