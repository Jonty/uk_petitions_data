        "additional_details": "The EU Referendum produced a narrow result to leave the EU with a marked difference in voting preferences between the young and elderly. Given the historic and long-term nature of the decision, it is wrong that 16-17 year olds were not allowed to vote unlike in the Scottish Referendum. The proposal here is that there should be a 2nd referendum held including 16-17 year olds in the franchise before the Government invokes Article 50.",
        "background": "The EU Referendum did not allow 16-17 year olds to vote unlike the 2014 Scottish Referendum. Given the historic and long-term nature of the EU Referendum's decision those who are going to live longest with that decision should be allowed to vote in a 2nd referendum before Article 50 is invoked.",
