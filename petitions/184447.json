        "additional_details": "Social Services fabricated evidence in my social chronology, misinterpreted information and made duplicate entries without changing dates so it's obvious the errors. Biased opinions are relied on and facts and evidence presented ignored so we are unable to address these. Complaints are passed to nhs and back to Ss. Theses incorrect opinions and documents are relied on. Making complaints is used against us. Cafcas & Social Services also record opinions and misconstrue interview content. ",
        "background": "Social Services & Cafcas get it wrong too much. Innocent families have children removed and families needing intervention go ignored. Errors are made in the reports and systems. Interviews not accurately relayed and misinterpreted. They need to be held to account and interviews audio recorded. ",
