The style and culture of PMQs has indeed changed dramatically, see above. Its fame should not be used as an excuse for excusing behaviour that i) is abhorrent ii) prevents further questions iii) detracts from questions.\r\n  The current format should be debated, past and present functions of it reviewed and a new progressive format to ensure a civil (yet lively) PMQs should emerge.",
        "background": "The style and culture of PMQs has changed gradually over time...the now famous disorderly behaviour of MPs during PMQs first arose as a result of the personal animosity between Harold Wilson and Edward Heath; before this PMQs had been lively but comparatively civilised.\r\nWiki: https://goo.gl/fI43la",
