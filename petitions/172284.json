        "additional_details": "In every town in Britain there are people living on the streets, for no other reason than their local authority is refusing to home them. They are given the impossible choice of giving up their pet or being homeless. They are vulnerable people, and are being discriminated against for sharing love and companionship with a pet. It would be detrimental for them to lose their pets, and would put additional strain on the mental health service. They are at risk of serious harm or death on the street. ",
        "background": "People are being forced to make the decision between giving up their pets or being homeless.  For some people their pet is the only family they have, and the animal is often vital for helping with mental health issues. People end up living on the streets rather than giving up their beloved friend. ",
