        "additional_details": "The Professional HGV/PCV Drivers who only drive within the country and do not have to cross the borders should be exempt from the EU regulations and should be counted as Domestic Drivers.\r\nAs since 2009 there is a great fall in the number of HGV & PCV drivers, drivers are leaving the profession as they are forced to comply with many unnecessary rules and regulations.\r\nThis will help the transport industry to recover from the shortage of professional drivers and also it will motivate the young new drivers to join the industry.",
        "background": "As article 50 is going to be triggered in the middle of Mach 2017 and officially the UK will not be a part of the EU soon.\r\nWe urge the Government and the Ministry of Transport to scrap EU regulations on HGV and PCV drivers who only drive within the country and count them as domestic drivers.",
