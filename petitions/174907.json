        "additional_details": "Alcohol related incidents cost the public sector millions which can be significantly reduced by having easily identifiable water stations in all establishments. \r\n\r\nThis can be done by having large containers or a simple bar tap facing the customer and also through encouragement of re-hydration electrolytes in between and after alcoholic drinks. \r\n\r\nNSW in Australia has a similar project already in place and the UK government should follow suit benefiting individuals and the greater community.",
        "background": "Significantly reduce incidents and Public Sectors costs, following other countries' lead by highlighting re-hydration in establishments with alcohol consumption. \r\nEliminate queuing up and faux pas amongst peers by having water and electrolyte fluids available in prominent areas relative to capacity",
