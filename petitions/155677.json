        "action": "Ban the use of in game purchases for non-permanent downloads",
        "additional_details": "For example: You buy a game. You spend \u00a340. Then you start playing and you pretty much get forced or pressured to buy 'virtual cash' to get certain things in the game that is free dlc but so overpriced in the games' currency that achievement of this is only possible through either excessive play to near extremes or take the easy route and pay your hard earned cash to 'quick buy' this. Not only is this discrimination to those who have less money but its ruining games and must therefore be banned.",
        "background": "The gaming industry is slowly being ruined by games that are paid, yet have objectives or objectives that are almost inachievable without paying more. We therefore call for legislation to ban these purchases for this virtual cash. By this we do not mean paid permanent addons or expansions.",
