        "action": "The PM must apply under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty immediately to leave EU",
        "additional_details": "With a petition set up to nullify the result of the referendum by demanding a second referendum and with Parliament's support for membership of the EU, there is a distinct possibility that the decision of the British people will be ignored or over ruled in some way. This must not be allowed to happen. As the PM is to resign, a pro EU replacement could put the result in further jeopardy. Delay provides uncertainty for the financial markets, Britain and EU members. So there must be no more delay.",
        "background": "Following the referendum on 23.06.2016 the British people voted to leave the EU. The Prime Minister must apply under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty immediately to avoid undemocratic stalling and the possibility of a 2nd referendum or Parliamentary reneg on this result.",
