        "additional_details": "Whether it is the murder of a child, police officer, civilian or members of our Armed Forces, the crime committed is a heinous one.\r\nWe do not believe that locking someone up for the rest of their natural life is appropriate.\r\nWe believe that for such a heinous crime, the offence of Capital punishment should be mandatory.\r\nIt is more than 30 years since Parliament debated reintroducing Capital punishment.\r\nWe believe that another vote on this issue is long overdue.\r\nIt is time to bring back hanging.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, believe that the crime of Capital punishment for first degree murder should be reintroduced.\r\nThose who commit murder should face the ultimate penalty.\r\nOur country faces danger on many fronts.\r\nIt is time our Government acted to reintroduce Capital punishment as a deterrent.",
