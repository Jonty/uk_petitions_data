        "additional_details": "Dogs are increasingly being stolen to supply the cruel and horrific \u2018sport\u2019 of Dog Baiting. Thieves with vans regularly drive around looking for unattended dogs to supply the trade for 'bait dogs'.\r\nDogs are being stolen for resale or extortion of money from distressed owners. \r\nCompulsory Microchipping will not stop either of these crimes. Microchips only identify the dog and it's owner. They do not prevent theft.\r\nI call on the UK  Government to make it a criminal offence to leave a dog secured or otherwise unattended in any public place.\r\n",
        "background": "Dogs are often left unattended outside shops, libraries and other public places. These dogs are at risk from theft and straying. \r\n",
