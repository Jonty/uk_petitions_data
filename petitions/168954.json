        "additional_details": "My dog suffers massive anxiety issues due to a garden firework from a neighbour almost hitting her and exploding above her in our garden. \r\nShe is now terrified of any firework, bang, thunder, even heavy rain. \r\nShe shakes uncontrollably, pants heavily with dangerously elevated heartbeat levels. \r\nShe bolts around the house terrified, and this all continues for hours after the problems have finished. \r\nThe garden displays go on at random times and days and make this far worse.",
        "background": "The sale of retail fireworks for personal home use and unofficial displays causes massive health and safety issues to both the public and undue stress and anxiety to pets and animals. \r\nThis also means they are used for extended periods rather than the associated dates increasing the problem.",
