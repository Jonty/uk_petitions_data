        "additional_details": "We ask the British Government to create a special medal to be awarded to servicemen and servicewomen who, while serving under competent authority in any capacity with one of the UK Armed Forces has been wounded or killed. We also ask that the Government consider that this medal be posthumously awarded to qualifying servicemen and servicewomen who have been wounded or killed since the 28th July 1914. ",
        "background": "Unlike the United States who issue the Purple Heart Medal, the British Armed Services do not recognize the sacrifices made by those who serve and are wounded or killed during their service by way of a special medal. We believe it is shameful that such a medal does not exist and needs to be rectified",
