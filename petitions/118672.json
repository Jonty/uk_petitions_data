        "action": "Reverse the government decision to refuse EU funds for foodbanks & flooding _",
        "additional_details": "UK government officials from DWP stated that government was not saying no to EU funds but, \u201cno to Europe about how it should be spent\u201d. David Cameron\u2019s spokesman said the issue is whether the UK should be in charge of the funds that are spent in the UK.\r\n\r\nTherefore we the undersigned believe that refusing this aid was NOT done as representative of ALL people in the UK and did not recognise the needs of communities or the nation as a whole.  We call on Westminster to debate & reverse this decision",
        "background": "The EU parliament agreed to provide millions of euros in aid for those in extreme poverty in UK and we are entitled to apply for EU emergency help for recent flooding as well. \r\nBUT our government has refused these funds to help those affected by flooding and lack of food, for 'ideological' reasons.",
