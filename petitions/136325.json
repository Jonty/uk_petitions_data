        "action": "Hold another EU referendum so that those aged 16 and over are eligible to vote.",
        "additional_details": "The economy has suffered and will continue to, with the value of the pound falling, and an almost inevitable recession to follow. Extreme right wing radicalists are beginning to dominate and hold power all across Europe, radicalising both the UK and Europe as a whole. We don't want this, we need countries across the continent and across the world to coexist in order to maintain a credible, honourable country and world in which everyone is safe and respected.",
        "background": "The result of this EU referendum has and will affect the younger generation the most, so it is therefore unjust that those between 16 and 18 could not vote like they were able to in the Scottish Referendum. We don't have a voice! Europe is becoming corrupt, and this vote should be reconsidered.",
