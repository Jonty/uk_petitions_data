        "action": "Whilst respecting Freedom of Speech Laws, Holocaust denial should be a crime.",
        "additional_details": "A number of countries have laws against denying the Holocaust and many historians and politicians have stated that it has enabled anti-semitism to be tackled more proactively. In some European countries there are increasingly greater numbers of anti-semitic attacks and hate crimes, as well as the election of anti-semitic parties. In Britain anti-semitism is sadly rising as official reported crime figures show. Anti-Semitic hate crimes are already criminalised, but denial of the Holocaust is not.",
        "background": "The Holocaust saw 6 million Jews and countless millions of others executed in concentration camps. The Holocaust is a historical fact taught in our schools. Whilst we have freedom of speech, we should specifically criminalise it's denial as it can be used to further anti-semitism within our society.",
