        "additional_details": "The turnout in Scotland for Brexit was poor. The number that voted to stay in the EU was 1.66M. Compare this to the 2014 IndyRef(1.62M voted to leave the UK but 2.0M people voted to remain). By leaving the EU, Scotland loses access to the EU common market, (Estimated 17% of our exports).However if Scotland were to leave the UK and join the EU, this would impact an estimated 63% of Scottish exports to the rest of the UK.If you are a Scottish voter and don't want another Indyref, please sign this.",
        "background": "In 2014 Scotland had an independence referendum in which 85% of eligible voters participated and 55% of them decided to remain as part of the UK. With the UK voting to leave the European Union, there have been calls for another referendum because Scotland voted by 62% to 38% to stay within the EU.",
