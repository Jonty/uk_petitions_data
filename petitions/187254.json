How is she going to address the \u00a330Bn shortfall in funding which has been predicted by 2020?",
        "background": "We call on Theresa May to show the courage of her convictions and attend the rally to reassure us that the concerns of all those assembled are misplaced and that the government really can be trusted to protect the NHS and Social Care. \r\n\r\n",
