        "additional_details": "This will help to pay for more care homes and after care for the elderly and release more beds in hospitals so that we can all benefit. With an ageing population, If this situation is not tackled this way, then bigger problems will arise. It is on best affordable way forward to this and still retains 50% of the foreign aid budget, which should be more scrutinised than currently is or scrapped altogether.",
