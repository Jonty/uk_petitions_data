        "additional_details": "B-eat, the leading eating disorder charity estimated that in 2015, 725,000 people in the UK were affected by eating disorders; with Anorexia nervosa having the highest mortality rate of all mental disorders. \r\n\r\nAccording to the NHS, 1 day, for 1 patient in hospital costs around \u00a3400. Therefore, money would be saved by giving people the access to treatment they need, before they reach the point of needing a hospital admission; which can last months. \r\n",
        "background": "Currently, when people approach GP's due to eating disorders, many are turned away due to not having a low enough BMI.\r\nWith increased NHS funding, people can be given access to the treatment they need before it's too late; radically reducing the number of lives lost due to these deadly illnesses.",
