HMRC have denied numerous freedom of information requests. In one of these requests made by jonathan portes the goverment responded saying the figures would be \"unhelpful\" to Mr Camerons renegotiations. I think its a national disgrace that the Tory Goverment are withholding such vital information before the EU referendum. Release the figures!",

But in this same time 2.2million national insurance numbers have been issued to EU migrants. This doesnt add up and furthermore HMRC are refusing to publish the figures! We have a right to know!",
