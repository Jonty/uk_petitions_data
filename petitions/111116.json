Dippy is instantly recognisable and adored across the world. \r\nReplacing Dippy with a blue whale skeleton would threaten this legacy. Future generations deserve to be amazed by the past and how Earth has evolved, just like their parents and grandparents.\r\nDippy must be saved and remain in the main Hintze Hall forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We demand Dippy remains in the main, Hintze Hall.",
