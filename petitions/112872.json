        "additional_details": "Since the release of the new regulations from the government for gambling more and more staff are being put at risk by their employers including a staff member who was raped in a store and more recently members of staff and the public being held at knife point is becoming more and more frequent. No measures have been put in place to protect the staff. One member of staff was held at gunpoint while a robbery took place. It needs to be addressed NOW before people die!!",
        "background": "In recent months there has been a torrent of staff being raped, held at knife point and zero security for the staff working in betting shops and nothing has been done about this. It's time companies that run betting shops are held accountable for the safety of the staff they employ!",
