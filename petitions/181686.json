        "action": "Introduce a 'political awareness test' to allow minors to qualify for the vote.",
        "additional_details": "Introduce a political awareness test which would allow citizens under the age of 18 to vote (after qualifying) in all forms of election across the UK. A test like this would eliminate the argument that minors do not know politics and therefore can't be trusted with the vote. If the minor was to pass the test, proving there awareness of politics, then they would qualify to have the ability to vote in any domestic election before age 18. The default voting age will still remain at 18. ",
        "background": "This idea arrived after the recent Brexit-Bremain debate when many minors felt their vote would have impacted the descision to stay or leave the European Union. The idea is also inspired by the positive impact 16 and 17 year olds had on the Scottish Refferendum. The test would allow minors to vote.",
