        "additional_details": "Manual workers are more at risk for potential damage to limb and arthritis damage so therefore would cost more in the long run for medical deficiency!! Most of us will end up taking sick leave because we can't manage our jobs. Personally I have worked since I was 14 and am now 57. Is this not long enough!!!",
        "background": "We work until we drop!! Is that the idea? Myself and my partner are both manual workers and are 57 years old!! We really can't see ourselves being fit to work until we're 66!! Can you? We're ready to drop now.\r\n\r\nPlease vote.",
