        "additional_details": "http://www.thewestonmercury.co.uk/news/an_accident_waiting_to_happen_1_4549561 - this is the article mentioned above. \r\nWith traffic lights in place at the top and bottom of the hill people wouldn't feel the need to try and push through the small gap, especially in rush hour. There is a give way from one end but it's sometimes impossible to get through. Please support this petition to get the work done that should have been done many years ago.",
        "background": "There was an article recently about property and vehicle damage in the area. This could have been avoided. When there were roadworks they had temporary traffic lights and Banwell had never run smoother. I worry about the locals and children leaving school when it's busy. ",
