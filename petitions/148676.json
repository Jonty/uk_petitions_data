        "additional_details": "PM has resigned. His replacement's selection will take time. Shadow cabinet is fragmenting reducing the effective opposition. Scotland, N.Ireland and the young are bitter about the result. The break-up of the UK is a possibility. Markets are jittery. Now is the time for National Unity. Form our EU negotiation team quickly start the herculian task ahead. It should be led by Leave reflecting the people's will, but must be inclusive to reflect those in our society that feel alienated by the vote.",
        "background": "Post EU vote there is a vacuum and high uncertainty. We want to rapidly see the roadmap to clarity and then stability. The terms of our exit from the EU will last well beyond the term of this government. Therefore, a negotiating team reflecting many perspectives is required - a National Unity team.",
