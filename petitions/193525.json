        "action": "Allow retention of EU Citizenship for those who wish to keep it post Brexit.",
        "additional_details": "Removing a citizenship held since birth is normally only the act of war or invasion. Yet post Brexit millions of UK Citizens face being stripped of a dual European Citizenship they have held since birth.\r\n\r\nI was born in the UK but also in Europe & identify as both British & European. That doesn't make me less patriotic or a traitor.\r\n\r\nFor those who want to sever ties I respect your decision but implore the Goverment to also honour the decision of those of us who wish to retain our European status.",
        "background": "EU Chief Negotiator Guy Verhofstadt has stated he has received thousands of contacts from UK Citizens asking him to look at ways of retaining their citizenship post Brexit. We ask that the Goverment work proactively to find a way for those of us to keep rights we've held since birth.",
