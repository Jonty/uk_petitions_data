        "additional_details": "If 17,410,743 registered eligible voters sign this petition, Parliament would be able, quite democratically, to refuse to give effect to the EU referendum of 23rd June 2016. There would no longer be a mandate from the electorate for them to invoke Article 50. It would be both constitutionally and democratically wrong to do so.\r\nThose in power in the UK have had their 'wake-up' call. So has the EU. They all now realise that they work for the people and not the other way around. Now that the message has been sent, it is time for the British people to do what is right for the UK.",
        "background": "The EU referendum narrowly resulted in a 'leave' vote because (a) significant numbers were voting leave not because they wanted to leave the EU but because they were upset with the government and (b) they did not fully understand the consequences.",
