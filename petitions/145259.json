        "action": "Call for Snap General Election in Light of Referendum Result",
        "additional_details": "The referendum has divided the UK. Now David Cameron has resigned, there will be a transfer of leadership to a caretaker. An estimated 7% of leave voters admit their vote was a protest which they now regret. This alone amounts to around 1.1 million voters. In addition to this many expats did not receive their postal vote in time. We need a snap General Election to vote in a government who represents the will of the UK and one that is democratically elected.",
        "background": "At this time the UK needs an elected government to take us forward, not an inherited Prime Minister. The UK is now divided as a result of the EU referendum with many voters claiming they were ill or misinformed, their vote being a protest one. This referendum does not reflect the wish of the UK.",
