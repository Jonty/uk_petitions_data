        "action": "Bring in strict regulations regarding ticket touting to stop exploitative prices",
        "additional_details": "Most recently the cost of tickets to next years American Football match have show how exploitative the touts are. Many fans are left with no opportunity but to pay over \u00a3100 for a ticket with a face value of \u00a330. This is seen time and again at events especial music concerts or popular comedians and these prices are of no benefit to the acts only to lining the businesses pockets who resell the tickets.",
        "background": "Ticket touting is an unfair exploitative business which does not allow members of the public a fair chance to buy event tickets. The industry alone should not be responsible for self regulation and I move that the government need to bring in strict controls in this area if not illegalisation.",
