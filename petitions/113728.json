        "action": "To grant Immunity from prosecution to all British Forces involved in Op Banner",
        "additional_details": "As ordered by the UK Gov, Op Banner commenced Aug 69 to 31 Jul 07; during this time  Republican terrorist groups carried out numerous murderous attacks on civilians and members of Her Majesty\u2019s Forces, the latter sent there to combat these atrocities. \r\nJudicial Records show that as part of the Good Friday agreement, known members of the IRA and other Republican terrorist groups were pardoned, released early or faced no investigation. These walk free, some to take up public office.  \r\n\r\n",
        "background": " The Government compounds an injustice, in failing to provide legal parity, by continuing to support immunity and pardons, given to individuals of known Republican terrorist groups, whilst denying their legal representatives, Her Majesty's Forces, in the conflict, the same rights.",
