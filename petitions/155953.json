        "additional_details": "There is another petition trying to stop Article 50 being invoked which would be totally against the UK's democratic process. The Remain campaign is still active. The SNP are trying to stop Brexit. We the majority must stand again and be counted, to ensure our Government (the majority of whom are on the Remain side) carry out our wishes in accordance with the significant majority of voters in the EU referendum. We have spoken and our Government must act. Sign now to ensure Article 50 is invoked.",
        "background": "Can the UK government still legally disregard the Brexit vote?\r\nThe answer is YES. Others CAN and ARE trying to stop Brexit from being implemented. Leaving the EU can only happen by invoking Article 50. Sign this petition to ensure Article 50 is invoked and that we leave the EU\r\n\r\n",
