        "additional_details": "At the 2015 General Election, the Scottish National Party won 1.4 million votes and 56 seats; UKIP, Green and the Liberal Democrats won 7.3 million votes and share 10 seats. The Conservatives won control of the Commons when more than 50% of the population voted against a Conservative government. The Single Transferable Vote system will fairly represent the voice of the British people and will make Britain truly democratic. John Cleese expains: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSUKMa1cYHk",
        "background": "The first-past-the-post voting system is unfair and the statistics from the last General Election prove this. Labour and the Conservatives hold onto seats that are deemed safe with no real challenge and peoples' votes for other parties often count for nothing. PR will ensure every vote counts.",
