        "action": "Reduce the drink drive limit in England and Wales to the same level as Scotland",
        "additional_details": "In December 2014 the Scottish Executive introduced The Road Traffic Act 1988 (Prescribed Limit) (Scotland) Regulations 2014 which reduced the legal alcohol limit for drivers to 50 milligrams of alcohol in every 100 millilitres of blood. The limit in England and Wales is 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. Bringing the limit in England and Wales in line with the limit in Scotland would be very beneficial as it would reduce accidents, preventing serious injury and death.  ",
        "background": "In 2014 an estimated 240 people were killed in Great Britain in accidents where at least one driver was over the legal limit. Drinking and driving increases the risk of a crash and the likelihood that death or serious injury will occur. Reducing the limit will save lives and make our roads safer. ",
