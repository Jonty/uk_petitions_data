        "action": "Please reduce fee charged for dogs and cats entering and leaving the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Many of us either show our dogs or cats in the UK and in Europe. There are health and passport requirements in place by organisations where we show our pets, we are not farming or smuggling animals but simply taking our pets in and out of the country for show purposes and for some for holiday. It feels as though we are penalised by the government for representing Britain in pet shows abroad. We belive the fees applied are extravagent and would like Parliament to look into reducing them.",
        "background": "It costs \u00a320/ animal leaving the UK via Eurotunnel where no scanning is conducted and \u00a320/ animal returning where scanning is conducted in France or \u00a315/ animal at ferry ports. We understand that there is a cost associated with animals entering the UK, current fees are too high and unsustainable. ",
