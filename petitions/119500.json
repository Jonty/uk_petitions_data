        "additional_details": "To stop scammers trying to abuse the system by immediately selling the house after the discount and making a profit, if the house (bought for the discount) was sold within the first 10 years then the discounted amount would be paid back to the government. Furthermore after any discounted house is sold a fraud investigator is sent to the house to ensure that no scamming is happening. \r\n",
        "background": "First time buyers coming out of education find it extremely hard to get on the property ladder. This means that they will have to rent or live with their family. They won't be able to start a life. This small discount will make a huge difference in them starting a life.",
