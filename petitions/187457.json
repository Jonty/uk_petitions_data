        "action": "Abolish the income rule for British citizens to bring a non-EU spouse to Britain",
        "additional_details": "It is estimated that 41% of British citizens working as employees earn less than the minimum income threshold and would not be eligible to sponsor a non-EU spouse / partner.\r\n\r\nThousands of families are living in hardship as a result of the rule. It is estimated there are an estimated 15,000 children in the UK growing up without one parent present (Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants).  It disproportionately affect women, younger people and those outside London (Migration Observatory).",
        "background": "Whilst the recent Supreme Court judgement found the Government\u2019s rule requiring British citizens to earn a minimum of \u00a318,600 in order to bring a non-EU spouse to the UK \u2018lawful\u2019, it doesn\u2019t make it right.  The law is unjustified, discriminatory and inhumane and needs to be abolished.",
