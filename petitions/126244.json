        "action": "Stop the London Stock Exchange falling into foreign hands",
        "additional_details": "The ramifications of allowing this institution to fall into foreign hands are too terrifying to contemplate, and will further erode our already depleted British identity and sovereignty. Any so called 'merger' will quite simply be a TAKE OVER. We must prevent this outcome at all costs. The London Stock Exchange MUST remain independent and MUST remain British. This is an appeal for the British government to intervene and to prevent any merger or take over. ",
        "background": "As per news reports, the London Stock Exchange is in discussions to merge with the Frankfurt based exchange, Deutsche Boerse. The LSE is one of the great pillars of British History, and of modern day British finance. A merger or take over of any description will be a devastating loss to the UK.",
