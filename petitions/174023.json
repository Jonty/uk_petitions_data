        "additional_details": "In 2004 the Hunting Act was passed which bans the hunting of wild animals with dogs in England and Wales, the act does not affect drag hunting (when hounds are trained to follow an artifical scent). \r\nPassing a law which requires hounds being used for drag hunting to be muzzled or persons involved to be prosecuted will lead to clearer intentification of illegal hunts making prosecution easier. www.facebook.com/KeepTheFoxHuntBan/\r\nThis site shows various video and photo documenations.\r\n",
        "background": "Mistakes occur in drag hunts to often,\u00a0wild mammals, mainly hares and foxes are still being mutilated, injured or killed by hunting hounds, this generaly occurs when the pack go off the trail and catch the real scent of a wild animal instead of the artifical scent which is used when drag hunting\r\n\r\n",
