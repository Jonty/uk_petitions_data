        "action": "Stop the cuts to the funding of Sharnbrook Upper School Sixth Form",
        "additional_details": "We believe that the governments cuts to the schools funding is going to severely impact the education that students can receive at Sharnbrook. They are unfair cuts and make the work being done at the school to help and nurture students to fill their full potentials even more challanging than it already is in this education system that we are part of. \r\nTherefore we are calling for the cuts to Sharnbrook to be stopped so the school can continue to provide their award winning A-level provisions.",
        "background": "Cuts to Sharnbrook Sixth form are meaning that the school is having to cut around 18 subjects including Spanish, German, a number of arts subjects Electronics, Computing and Geology. We believe that this is fundamentally wrong as it will negatively impact students and thus needs to be stopped.",
