        "additional_details": "Throughout the EU Referendum campaign it was asserted by the cross-party Vote Leave campaign that EU migrants would not be \"kicked out\" in light of Brexit. \r\n\r\nWe believe that said referendum result (particularly in light of the disgusting increase in xenophobic slurs against EU migrants, telling them to \"go back to where you came from\" etc) demands that this pledge be given some measure of parliamentary assent. \r\n\r\nThis is a guarantee Parliament has the power to make before any UK-EU negotiations.",
        "background": "Please give assurances that all EU citizens living in the UK will be given indefinite right to remain in the UK once we have left the European Union.\r\n\r\nIt is the ONLY moral position to take on the issue, and EU migrants need reassurance for the lives and livelihoods they have built here.",
