        "additional_details": "Ofsted is having a detrimental impact on Teacher attrition rates and workforce motivation.  It also costs over \u00a3200m a year, which equates to around 5000 teachers.  Standards are set and measures in place, which is overseen by LEAs.  Ofsted is therefore also unnecessary - the LEA can and should be accountable for driving standards in their area.  This very simple action would yield significant savings and other intangible benefits.",
        "background": "Ofsted creates more harm than good and costs over \u00a3200m per year.  Ofsted should be scrapped and the funding put into helping teachers and schools rather than labelling them as failures.  Metrics for pupils can be maintained by headteachers and LEAs.  A motivated workforce = a high performing one.",
