        "action": "Hold a referendum with the question \"Should London secede from the UK?\"",
        "additional_details": "London and a small number of other parts of England voted to continue in the EU. The remainder of the nation elected to put an amorphous vision of 'freedom' above the interests of their fellow citizens. London should not longer be made to follow the rules of people and companies with whom the majority of London's citizens have no business relationship. We must also be able to protect London from unchecked migration from England, and regain our sovereignty.",
        "background": "In light of the results of the EU referendum, it is clear that London, a forward thinking city, has more interest in continuing as part of the international community than much of the remainder of England. In order to safeguard the interests of the people of London, we must have independence. ",
