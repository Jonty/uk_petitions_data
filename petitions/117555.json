        "additional_details": "We are group of young people who want belmont bowl to be refurbished and upgraded to a bigger, safer and controllable environment. We can help contribute to the funding by holding fundraising events in the local community.\r\n\r\nThere is a drain cover in the middle of the bowl, which when wet causes slips and trips, the coping is corroded, concrete is damaged. The bowl is used for people to misbehave or act unsociable and should be redesigned to suit a wider audience, no one likes the bowl.",
        "background": "The youth and teenagers of our local area can not use the bowl as it too dangerous and causes people to injure themselves quite frequently. This is because the walls are far too steep, the drain covers have lifted, resulting in trips and minor injuries quite often.It is also very small and crowded.",
