        "additional_details": "Our dealings with the NHS medical professionals has been exemplary understanding  the emotional and mental strain caused by total hair loss particularly in a woman. However all requests for a proper prosthesis are denied for reasons that are unfathomable.  Example cost ( our proposal costs less ). Not NHS approved, (some trust supply). And of course the you need individual funding committee approval ( they always say NO that's their job, all requests made by doctors and consultants are ignored.",
        "background": "For seven years we have been asking our health provider to supply a human hair prosthesis that fits can be washed and styled.  Our GP and consultant are fully supportive but at the point of supply the bureaucrats say NO. ",
