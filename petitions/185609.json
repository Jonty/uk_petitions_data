        "action": "Government to introduce clause to declassify first class on trains at peak times",
        "additional_details": "As the government is responsible for issuing the franchises to companies to run trains on the railways, I am calling for a clause to be added at the time of renewals for first class to be de classified during peak hours or on commuter trains. Unlike the intercity trains, there are no real benefits from having first class (i.e no refreshment service) and the seats are often no different. These seats could be used by more people and offer value for money when prices are  increasing annually. ",
        "background": "During peak / commuter hours, many trains are running at capacity except for the first class areas, which are often empty. This is forcing people to stand when they could be sitting in comfort and therefore having a more enjoyable commute to work. ",
