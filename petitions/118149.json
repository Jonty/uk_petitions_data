        "action": "Require a valid un-tampered VIN and V5C to race a banger/stock car",
        "additional_details": "Of course the majority of banger drivers would never go near a stolen car, but the fact exists that cars do get stolen for this purpose. I'd like to see a law passed requiring all banger / stock car events requiring cars to have a valid and un-tampered VIN, and a V5C as proof the car has not been stolen. This won't affect the majority of banger drivers who are genuine, but will stop people's cars from being stolen after years of blood sweat and tears have gone into them. ",
        "background": "With the recent spate of stolen Ford Cortinas in the last month, and a large 'All Cortina' banger racing meet planned for June of 2016, questions have been raised about the possibility of these stolen cars ending up on the track. We'd like to see raced cars requiring valid VIN and V5C to stop this.",
