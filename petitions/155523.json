I appreciate that this was probably not high on the agenda for the majority of EU referendum voters. I propose that plenty of leave and remain voters, along with divided UK politicians and the EU, would not want to risk a decline in the development of new and potentially life-saving technologies, due to an entanglement with unrelated EU policies which have proven to be controversial.",
        "background": "I would like the government to fulfil this request and cite mutual humanitarian benefits for all involved. Current EU projects are developing renewable energy, medicines, food production and water treatment technologies etc. These are tools which humanity will require to survive population growth. ",
