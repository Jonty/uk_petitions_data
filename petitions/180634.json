        "action": "Parliament to debate a motion of no confidence in the current British Government",
        "additional_details": "Much of the decisions being made by the current government appear disjointed, taken purely for short term reasons and to please only a portion of the electorate rather than for the greater good of all of the citizens of the four nations of these islands. The hasty invite to Donald Trump to meet the Queen now points to a government with an overall agenda that is ill-conceived. As such they are not fit to govern and a general election should be called. ",
        "background": "The recent foreign policy moves to remove the UK from the EU regardless of the damage it will do and the invite of Donald Trump to come to the UK on a State Visit  indicates a government that acts without care or diligence and is losing the confidence of much of the electorate each passing day.",
