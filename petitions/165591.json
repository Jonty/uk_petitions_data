        "additional_details": "Due to the history of HMS Illustrious, and the already unfortunate scrapping of her sister ships, she is the last real icon of British naval power in the 20th century. She is also a veteran of the Falklands war.\r\n\r\nIt would be a almost disrespectful to scrap a piece of our naval history, particularly for such a low price.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't make sense to essentially waste such an incredible ship. Please sign to have this icon become a national heritage museum ship for the Royal Navy's history.",
        "background": "As of recent, word has surfaced that the MoD wants to sell HMS Illustrious, a Royal Navy Invincible class aircraft carrier to the scrap yard.",
