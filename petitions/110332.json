        "additional_details": "PEV (personal electric vehicles) such as the self balancing scooter allow us to commute to work without the aid of fossil fuel powered vehicles, are cheap to run, safe and fun. \r\n\r\nThey also supplement the use of public transport as a \"last mile\" device, as they can be carried on board a bus/train by hand (taking up significant less space than a bicycle) and then used to complete the last mile of your journey the public transport doesn't cover. \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "We want personal electric vehicles such as electric longboards, self balancing scooters (hoverboard/swegway) and other commuting devices allowed on public pavements throughout the UK. These will promote people to get public transport or commute via no fossil fueled vehicles.",
