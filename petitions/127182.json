        "additional_details": "We need to allow the people who would like to live under Sharia Law to leave the UK and surrender their passports to go and live in ISIL area.  In return for Non-Muslim minorities living in the ISIL area. This would reduce the burden on our prisons, whilst reducing the threat of local terrorism and aiding humanitarian relief to the area and at the same time encouraging and promoting people from less contentious religions to live in the UK",
        "background": "Many Muslims living in UK are unhappy with the way we live our lives and want to live under a ISIL Caliphate. A number of these people are hate preachers and their followers, some of which are in prison. There are persecuted religions in ISIL areas who would make great citizens here in the UK",
