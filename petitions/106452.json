        "additional_details": "I personally don't suffer with asthma but have relatives and close friends who do and some of them really struggle to pay the prescription charge for their inhalers.  One of them even puts their life at risk by not buying them as it's a choice for them of food or inhaler.  These people are working and can't afford the charges they have to pay.  ",
        "background": "It's not fair that people suffering from Asthma have to pay a prescription charge for their inhalers.  It's a lifelong condition and the inhalers are a necessity.   Inhalers are available over the counter in Spain and in some, if not all, other European countries so why not the UK? ",
