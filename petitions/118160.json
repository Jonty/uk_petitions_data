        "additional_details": "As an ex-serviceman I am aware of the effect that current events have on morale and recruiting at a time when both are very important. A mandatory restriction should be placed on so called 'ambulance chasing' lawyers and a more sensible and understanding stance taken on acts carried out in good faith in the heat of battle.  The British Army has a well deserved reputation for integrity and professionalism making it well able to maintain its own discipline.",
        "background": "The fear of subsequent prosecution may have life or death implications in a stressful, combat situation. Our soldiers in action should be given confidence in the knowledge that they will be supported in their decisions and protected from self serving lawyers seeking legal loopholes for self gain.",
