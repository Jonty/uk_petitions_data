        "additional_details": "We the British people do not stand for this dereliction of your duty and call upon the government to gracefully stand down by means of a Vote of No Confidence, thus allowing a general election to take place.\r\n\r\nWe realise and accept that this could result in a pro-European party being elected on a manifesto pledge that they intend to ignore the recent referendum on EU membership, but should this happen it would do so fairly having been elected democratically on a platform of EU membership.",
        "background": "We call for parliament to raise a vote of no confidence in the government and thus force a General Election, and to do so before Article 50 is signed which would end our membership of the EU\r\n\r\nThis government has caused economic instability and fractured the UK after over 300 years of togetherness",
