        "additional_details": "An example of the pressure and difficulty we face is the fact we have to learn 21 poems by heart with all annotations as nothing but a pen is allowed into are exams. We also have to memories quotes from three diffrent books which is difficult as the language used is hard to understand.",
        "background": "I am a year 10 student, doing my first year of GCSEs. What we are being taught is to much for people at this age to take and is causing stress not only for students but for teachers and parents aswell. If you are going to be teaching at this intensity then make the exams much easier.",
