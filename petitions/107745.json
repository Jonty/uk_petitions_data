        "action": "Do not arrest Benjamin Netanyahu when he arrives in London.",
        "additional_details": "Benjamin Netanyahu is not a war criminal. He is the leader of a country surrounded by people who want to destroy it, and murder its population. He was fighting Hamas, a group that happily hides behind Gazan civilians while firing rockets at Israeli civilians. In response, Israel took every reasonable measure to avoid civilian casualties. In this conflict Hamas, not Israel, are the real war criminals and condemnation of Israel merely encourages Hamas to continue pursuing the same strategy.",
        "background": "This petition opposes the recent calls for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be arrested for \"war crimes\" when he arrives in London this month, specifically regarding deaths caused during the Gaza conflict last summer.",
