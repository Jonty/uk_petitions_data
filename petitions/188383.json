        "action": "Restore the Core Grant to Local Authorities from Whitehall to 2015 Levels",
        "additional_details": "George Osborne took the decision to axe the central government grant to local authorities as part of Conservative reforms to local government finance in 2015. Conservative, Labour or Liberal Democrat, your council and your community is now being crippled by these horrible cuts. Retention of Business Rates can never make up the shortfall in rural areas or poorer parts of the UK. I call on Philip Hammond, present Chancellor of the Exchequer, to restore the government grant to local authorities. ",
        "background": "The government decision to axe the core government grant to local authorities is making life insufferable people across the UK. A civilised and prosperous society like ours should support local community and its most vulnerable citizens. Those most in need of public services are being hit hardest. ",
