        "additional_details": "In the UK, the Jewish & Muslim communities are exempt from a section of the law in ' The Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995' that requires all animals to lose consciousness, making them insensible to pain and suffering. Some would be unwilling to inadvertently support this method of slaughter through making an uninformed purchase. British values are not being upheld by animal cruelty not being made transparent to the consumer.",
        "background": "Some would consider this method of slaughter to contravene animal rights which a form a core part of British values. It is unacceptable, that in a civilised society, innocent animals can be tortured to death in this way. British citizens deserve to be given an opportunity to make an informed choice.",
