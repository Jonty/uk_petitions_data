It is purely a political solution and will not help in the long term where the estimate in freight traffic over the next 5 years is for an increase of 30%. So then what. Another increase in size to 5000-10000 spaces ?\r\n",

The better way will be to stop lorries from arriving on the M20 through social media and wait at the Haulage Depots until the routes are clear. This solves the problem !",
