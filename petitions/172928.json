        "additional_details": "Civilised cultures remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defending freedom, the wearing of the poppy isn't restricted to remembering British fallen but those of the commonwealth and respect of those who thought against us in the hope their sacrifice wasn't in vain. The poppy isn't a political image but one of hope/respect and even reconsideration. Any travel ban on FIFA officials should stand until such time as a full and unconditional apology is made to both nations teams by FIFA. ",
        "background": "It is at the government's discretion to restrict access to the UK of those deemed to be unconducive to the public interest. FIFA decision to enter into disciplinary proceedings against both the English & Scottish teams for wearing the universal emblem of remembrance the poppy is just that. ",
