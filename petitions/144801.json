Democratically elected MPs in Parliament need to be able to directly influence this decision with full consideration of the referendum result. \r\nFurther, elected politicians must be involved because referendum campaigns cannot produce a manifesto or promise to implement policy.\r\n",
        "background": "We the undersigned call upon the Government to ensure that Article 50, committing the UK to leave the EU, is not triggered unless there is a majority vote in Parliament to do so. \r\n",
