        "additional_details": "The private manufacture of recreational drugs could become one of the largest industries in the world. 15% of all global trade is on the illegal drugs market, which goes completely untaxed, hurts millions of lives and robs governments around the world of billions of pounds in trying to destroy it. \r\nThe drug industry would open up millions of jobs and huge funding for other areas.\r\nAlmost 100 years since the start of prohibition, the catastrophic failure it is can be seen apparent.",
        "background": "Decriminalise possession of recreational drugs for personal use, and consider the creation of an official drug market. \r\n\r\nA government taxed and sponsored drug market would keep money away from organised crime. Arresting petty drug users is a waste of tax-payer money and police time.",
