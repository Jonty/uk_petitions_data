        "additional_details": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business\r\n\r\nAs argued by Andrew McPhillips, Yorkshire Building Society's Chief Economist - the current SDLT model is simply not fit for purpose.\r\n\r\nAs a first time buyer myself, I have already lost two homes as we couldn't afford the SDLT, though we had more than a large enough deposit and income to afford a 90% LTV mortgage.\r\n\r\nHelp us change this for the new generations.",
        "background": "The SDLT is currently payable by the buyer of the property who as a consequence requires significantly more starting capital.  Removing this burden from the buyer will allow significantly more first time buyers to enter the market and make it easier for existing owners to move up the ladder.",
