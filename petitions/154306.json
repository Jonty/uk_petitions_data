        "additional_details": "Britain has become a divided Nation, and many people voting to leave have shown their true colours by disgracing the very multi-cultural values Britain prides itself on. We should not have been lied to in order for politicians to claim a win. Pride in Britain ensure we are progressive, not retrogressive. Our economy has been hit hard, our freedoms will be hit hard, and we will lack the protection that it was believed would still exist from Europe after we left. ",
        "background": "The last referendums votes were too close to call a majority. Events after the referendum have proven that MP's lied to us to gain votes, and the are retracting many of their promises. The decision to leave has proven the massive detrimental effects that leaving the EU would incur on Britain. ",
