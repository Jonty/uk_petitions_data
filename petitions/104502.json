        "additional_details": "Dogs Trust recently exposed some of the border weaknesses. Before that Channel 4 Dispatches also uncovered this despicable trade that fuels impulse purchases, causes heartbreak to consumers who buy these illegally imported pups and stretches the rescue network to breaking as they are dumped when their illegal status is discovered. Treat all bulk imports of pups as suspicious - there is no market for correctly aged properly vaccinated 15 week old pups. Trading standards alone cannot stop this.",
        "background": "Despite recent pet passport reforms, loopholes are still being exploited and huge quantities of underage puppies are still entering the country for resale. It causes distress to the puppies transported over vast distances and it floods the market with poorly bred pups which have fake paperwork. ",
