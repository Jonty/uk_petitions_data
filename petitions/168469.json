        "additional_details": "More & more crimes are carried out on motorcycles, robberies, smash & grabs, shootings & drug dealing. Police will not pursue in case the criminals hurt themselves & officers are too scared to use stop stick in case the criminal gets injured & they get the blame. Recent incidents in Merseyside have seen up to 60 motorbikes causing mayhem in the streets at one time, many in stolen bikes, riding on pavements, through red lights, in & out of traffic causing danger. Police need to do something.",
        "background": "The use of motorcycles in crime & anti social behaviour has grown massively.  The police are powerless to stop these thugs.  Give police more powers to tackle the problem and fully support officers to use stop sticks on these menaces protecting them from blame should these criminals hurt themselves.",
