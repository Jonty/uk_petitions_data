        "additional_details": "The vote to leave has undermined many of the certainties of British political life. The success of people's ordinary lives depends on there being stability and certainty in politics. Political instability and division has economic and social consequences. The union between Scotland and the rest of the UK is now in question, as is the N.I. peace process. Many people voted in protest as they feel disconnected from politics. The British people need the chance to debate a positive way forward. ",
        "background": "The 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU is a decision with very many serious impacts on how the politics of the UK will work in the future. A new set of rules and rights for the UK - a new constitutional settlement - is needed to address these questions and reunite a politically divided nation. ",
