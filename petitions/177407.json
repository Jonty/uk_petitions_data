Both countries have much we can share with each other and benefit from our relationship. \r\n\r\nIt is clear that in this case, these remarks can only be attributed to one person. The Israeli Ambassador has apologised and explained that the comments made do not reflect the views of the Embassy or Government of Israel. \r\n\r\nThe Embassy has informed us that the official has resigned from his position at the Israeli Embassy and left the UK.   \r\n\r\nThe UK therefore considers this matter closed.\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office",
