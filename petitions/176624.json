        "additional_details": "Our research has shown there is not a single care home manged by the Government that funds catering for the needs of Hindu Vegetarians.\r\n\r\nPrivate care homes are beyond the reach of 90% of the Hindus hence it is a moral obligation on the part of the Government to cater for the needs of the Hindu Community and other Vegetarians. \r\n\r\nThe National Congress of Gujarati Organisations UK, the largest Hindu Organisation in the UK with 860,000 plus members, has requested this petition.",
        "background": "Vegetarians, mainly Hindus have strict vegetarian dietary needs which are not available in any care home facilities provided by the Government.",
