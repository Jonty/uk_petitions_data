        "additional_details": "The life of millions of animals is already abused with current farming practices. We humans create animal lives in order to satisfy our own pleasures and in doing so we abuse life itself. Animals suffer hugely already. It is not right to create life, use it, abuse it and then destroy it. Animals are feeling creatures. We love our pets. There should be no difference between how we feel about our dogs and how we feel about pigs. It is all life, we are all creatures. Let's prevent this beginning.",
        "background": "It is in the news today that animals are to be considered for growing human parts for human transplants. This is an abuse of animals and the very nature of life itself. ",
