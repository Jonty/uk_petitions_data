Most recently fracking caused a 4.6 magnitude earthquake in Oklahoma just yesterday. Why should we risk creating new fault lines under the UK?Surely the costs outweigh the benefits and there is simply not enough research.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dangersoffracking.com\r\nhttp://www.energyfromshale.org/articles/fracking-and-earthquakes",
