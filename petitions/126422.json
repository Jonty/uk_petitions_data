        "additional_details": "Dogs which are not under the direct control of their owners can be unpredictable and cause anxiety to people of all ages, all dogs are potentially dangerous. \r\nMy own child was attacked by a dog at the age of 3 and is left permanently scarred, I have friends who have experienced their child being attacked and I feel strongly that the law needs changed.\r\n",
        "background": "I am calling for a change in the law to make it compulsory all dog owners in the UK have sufficient control over their dog by making it mandatory dogs are walked on a lead in public places at all times.\r\nI believe action is required due to the number of dog attacks particularly on young children.",
