        "additional_details": "Service charges go up every year without any improvements to the estate. Deficit charges are regularly added onto accounts because of poor budgeting. Expensive Insurance policy's and contracts are taken out and charged back to the leaseholders when they are available a lot cheaper elsewhere. Many leaseholders would like 'the right to manage' themselves but this can be a long winded process which can put many off. ",
        "background": "Many Property management companies exploit their position by charging excessive fees whilst providing a very poor service. They hide behind a 91 year old law to justify their actions when in reality they are just taking advantage of the situation to make more profit for the company.",
