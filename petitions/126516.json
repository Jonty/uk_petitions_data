        "additional_details": "make the system more fare, give young offenders a fighting chance to turn their life's around when realised from prison. They wouldn't have to disclose there convictions for a ridiculous amount of time like adults do which isn't fare because they was under 18 at the time they commited the offence giving them much more of a chance obtaining a job or even a career. Why make it that much harder for them to turn their life's around. Do we Want kids still reoffending as adults?? Help break the cycle.",
        "background": "People that are under 18 while on remand waiting for a plea date at court that turn 18 in the mean time are still convicted as an adult even though they was under 18 at the time of the offence commited help me change it so many more will have a chance of not reoffending and more likely to get a job.",
