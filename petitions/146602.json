        "additional_details": "The EU should use this poll result of Leave voters to present reforms. The UK can then vote again that with these reforms, do we still want to leave the EU? \r\n\r\nSome may argue that David Cameron already asked for reforms. However, it is clear few really actually believed the UK would vote to leave. Now that it is clear, ask why the people voted this way and the EU should present new reforms. \r\n\r\nEU reforms will need to come. The EU has the chance now to do so before a Brexit actually happens.",
        "background": "Anti-EU sentiment is not exclusive to the UK. With a Brexit, it is clear the EU will need to implement reforms to prevent other Nations from following suit. Why wait for the UK to leave the EU before reforming? Poll those who voted Leave for their reasons (it is currently not clear). Present these. ",
