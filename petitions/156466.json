        "action": "Delay triggering Article 50 until after a General Election.",
        "additional_details": "We believe that Article 50 should only be invoked once the Government has a clear plan for the United Kingdoms place in Europe. At present there are several paths open to the UK, with regard to the single market, immigration and financial contributions. \r\n \r\nThe current Government has no mandate from the electorate to make these decisions. A general election should be called to allow all political parties to state their visions for Europe and include these in their respective manifestos.",
        "background": "Following the referendum and the decision to delay exit negotiations, we petition that Article 50 is not invoked until after a General Election giving political parties time to establish their stances with regard to 'brexit' and incorporate them in their respective manifestos.",
