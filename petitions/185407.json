        "action": "Call for a referendum on the production, sale and use of cannabis becoming legal",
        "additional_details": "America, Holland & Spain all have established legal frameworks showing how this drug can be safely implemented into society. It is said that the UK cannabis market could bring in \u00a3900m through taxes, save \u00a3400m on policing the drug & create 10,000+ jobs. It's proven legalisation of the drug reduces harm to individuals & communities through introduction of a regulated market & proper treatment. Our outdated system has discredited the law & empowers criminals, forcing users into the illicit market",
        "background": "The rest of the modernised world are liberalising their drug policies towards cannabis, 6.6% of Britons use it annually highlighting the direct mainstream support for the plant and the current % of population forced into the illicit market. Leave the decision to the people through a referendum. ",
