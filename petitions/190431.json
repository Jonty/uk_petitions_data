Repatriating refugees in this way is a clear violation of human rights and they should be allowed safe passage through China to a country who will accept them (e.g. South Korea).\r\nhttp://www.libertyinnorthkorea.org/\r\nhttp://www.nkfreedom.org/index.aspx\r\nhttp://www.northkoreanrefugees.com/\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei-gGvLWOZI",
