        "additional_details": "In today's society absolutely everything is taxed. For many people in minimum wage jobs this makes day to day survival a struggle. By abolishing income tax this would give them an extra \u00a360-\u00a380 a month which would be put towards improving their quality of life.\r\nMany people could use this money to feed/clothe/shelter their families and as stated EVERYTHING is taxed therefore is there any need for income tax for everyone to prosper?",
        "background": "Income tax in the UK was introduced in 1799 as a TEMPORARY measure to fund the Napoleonic wars which ended in 1815. Income tax was abolished in 1816. \r\nIt was later reinstalled in 1842 due to there being a growing deficit.  ",
