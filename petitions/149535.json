        "additional_details": "The government has a duty to govern, which means delaying the formal discussion to leave the EU until the economic and political consequences are fully understood. The EU referendum was advisory and is not binding, which means the government is still responsible for this very important discussion. The government has the moral, economic and social responsibility to do the right thing and act in our best interest. ",
        "background": "In Scotland 62% voted to remain in the EU with 38% to leave - all 32 Scottish council areas backed Remain. The Scottish people have not given a mandate to leave. Imposing an EU exit on Scotland could lead to the disintegration of the UK resulting in significant economic and social instability. ",
