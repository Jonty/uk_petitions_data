        "action": "Hold a referendum for London to have independence from the UK",
        "additional_details": "London has always been the driving force behind the UK economy, a microcosm of multiculturalism, diversity and tolerance. The differences between London and the rest of England have been highlighted on the back of the EU referendum result, and it is time to let the 'Northern Powerhouse' find it's own way outside of Europe. I call on the Government and the Mayor of London to call a referendum and let the people of London have their say on independence. ",
        "background": "In the wake of the catastrophic referendum result, in which the North of England chose to leave the EU while London firmly voted to stay, and given the significant regional differences in tolerance, equality and economic strength it is time for London to declare independence from England.",
