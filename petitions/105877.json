Not only will this be an interesting lesson but it will be vital for keeping girls safe. \r\nAs crime is on the increase it is also becoming more important to know how to keep safe and how to defend yourself. ",

Girls need to feel confident about defending them selves and be able to do what is necessary to get out of a dangerous situation, and they need to know what they can do to be safe, and how to counter an attack.
