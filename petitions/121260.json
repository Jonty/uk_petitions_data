        "additional_details": "Doesn't a child with additional needs need intervention sooner rather then later? Us as parents need that help! In my son's situation starting school earlier rather then later can have a huge impact on his communication and social skills with out a shadow of a doubt..why should disabled children be left behind? Because of shortage of funding maybe? I don't know but I do know that families like mine need that stability and routine to start at age 3 not 5! Thanks for your time ",
        "background": " last year my son was diagnosed with autism,changing our lives forever. After research and many phone calls I discovered that if a child cannot attend a mainstream school they can't attend a specialist school till reception age of 5!",
