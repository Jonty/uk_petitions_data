        "additional_details": "The result of the referendum is marginal.\r\n\r\nThe Act enabling the referendum is flawed: it didn't specify a threshold for either turnout or proportion required to return a mandate.\r\n\r\nThere is currently no credible strategy for effecting an exit from the EU that can be considered to be in the national interest.\r\n\r\nThere is growing evidence that the result is being high-jacked as a justification for open racist intimidation.\r\n\r\nIgnore EU pressure for a swift exit, demonstrate Parliament's sovereignty.",
        "background": "I call on Parliament to act to curb the damage already inflicted on our European neighbours and the wider world by this poorly-implemented referendum; acknowledge its flawed enactment and overrule its outcome, or recognise its advisory nature and pose a second referendum on a credible exit strategy.",
