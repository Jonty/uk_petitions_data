        "action": "Remove big pharmaceutical influence from the MHRA to ensure patient choice",
        "additional_details": "The MHRA is the government body which licenses medicines in the UK, it has been criticised for years due to links with big pharmaceutical companies, whose financial interest is to promote their expensive products and limit alternatives. \r\n\r\nCurrently inexpensive and effective treatments are freely available and licensed across Europe, but not in the UK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe call on the Department of Health and Minister Jeremy Hunt MP to exclude pharmaceutical influence and control - giving us patient choice.",
        "background": "We call on the government to remove big pharma presence from the MHRA - giving the UK a truly independent regulatory body. This will allow UK patients to have access to cheaper alternative treatments and natural therapies.\r\n\r\n",
