        "action": "Ban the taking of photographs of children in school without the child's consent",
        "additional_details": "A child, over the age of 12, must be able to give or withdraw consent to the taking of his or her images in addition to the wishes and feelings of the parents/legal guardians.  At present, there are guidelines published by the Information Commissioners Office as to the taking of photographs at schools.  We argue that this is not sufficient because the use of personal mobile phones within a class room setting by a tutor is not prohibited.",
        "background": "The concept of private life is a broad one which encompasses the right to identity.  A pupil's image reveals his or her unique characteristics and constitutes one of the chief attributes of his or her personality.\r\n\r\n",
