        "background": "HGVs frequently 'elephant race' trying to pass each other. This overtaking frequently takes up to 10 miles due to the subtle differences in speed limiter calibration. \r\n\r\nThis causes long tailbacks, dangerous pulsating traffic flow and frustration to other motorists leading to dangerous manoeuvres.",
