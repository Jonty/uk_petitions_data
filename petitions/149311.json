        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom exists as a representative democracy, with each individual constituency having equal representation in parliament. The same value of equal representation should be applied to the four countries of the United Kingdom: England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. With Northern Ireland and Scotland voting Remain, the decision as to whether or not to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty should lay with Members of Parliament, as our democratic representatives.",
        "background": "Support for the UK's exit from the EU does not have majority support of all four countries of the United Kingdom. The final decision should be made through a vote in the House of Commons. As the majority of sitting MPs have already declared their position, a General Election should first be held.",
