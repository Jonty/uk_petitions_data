        "action": "Stop Michael Fallon from spending \u00a3642m on Trident before a vote in Parliament.",
        "additional_details": "Spending this money on Trident will make it more difficult for the UK to pull out of its nuclear weapon programme as a significant amount of money will already have been invested in its renewal.\r\n\r\nThis is a unilateral and undemocratic decision by the Defence Secretary that will contribute to the vote in Parliament later this year swinging in favour of renewing the weapons, compromising the impartiality of such a vote. No spending on the programme should be allowed until the vote has taken place.",
        "background": "Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon, is due to announce spending \u00a3642 million of public money on renewing Trident despite the fact that the issue of whether to replace the UK's nuclear weapons will not be voted on in Parliament until later this year. ",
