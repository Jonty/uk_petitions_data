        "additional_details": "The 48% who voted remain must have there rightds protected. It could also help with the situation in Scotland, London and Northern Ireland, where a majority voted to remain in the EU. If dual citizenship is not possible, then UK citizens should at least be given the choice between UK and EU Citizenship. UK citizens who take the EU option, should still be entitled to permanent residency in the UK. This  could help facilitate an amicable agreement regarding  UK residents in the EU.",
        "background": " It is incumbent on the Government to safeguard the interests of the minority. They must insure that, those UK citizens who wish to, can retain EU Citizenship. Dual citizenship would be preferable. There rights of residency in the UK, as UK born or naturalised, would also have to be protected. ",
