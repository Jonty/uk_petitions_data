        "additional_details": "The EU Referendum is the last straw. The lies told by the Leave campaigners are now being exposed. The funding to the EU is not as they stated; immigration control is not going to be repaired by leaving; our relationship with EU countries has been damaged - far from the respected departure we were promised.\r\nHad politicians on both sides all told the truth, the result of the Referendum might have been very different. Future generations have to live with the consequences of these lies.",
        "background": "In the UK we have long suffered from untrustworthy, self-serving politicians. The Expenses Scandal is a case in point and went some way to expose the issue, but we continue to have a broken political system run by people we cannot really trust.",
