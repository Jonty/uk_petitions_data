        "additional_details": "There has been a previous incident with one of the students from our school getting hit by the wing of a lorry and therefore we want to reduce the risks of that terrible tragedy happening again. Lowering the speeding limit will ensure that drivers are more aware of their surroundings and can pay better attention to students crossing the road. We have already raised this issue with students in our school and taught a lesson on road safety in order to help them gain more awareness of this issue.",
        "background": "We are taking part in a citizenship project where we have raised the issue of \"road safety around schools\" and we want to reduce the speeding limit on the road next to our school in order to reduce the risks of an accident. ",
