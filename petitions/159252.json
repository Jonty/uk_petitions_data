        "additional_details": "Poor quality and lack of knowledge isn't the way forward to providing good exercise prescription. This just simply isn't safe if you are charging the client or giving it for free. If you have no qualifications/experience you can mislead people into thinking you can training healthy people or people with diagnosed medical conditions or injuries or even have no insurance. We must raise the standard of what clients have as a fitness professional and impose some kind of penalty.",
        "background": "Currently there is no regulation of non qualified fitness professionals from practising without qualifications and insurance. To maintain standards a register of all trading fitness/massage persons working/earning should be controlled by local councils. REPS and CIMSPA can only regulate upon members",
