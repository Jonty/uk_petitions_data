        "action": "Reimburse UK companies of tariffs when trading with the EU, if the UK leaves EU.",
        "additional_details": "With the UK trading at a deficit with the EU, more tariffs will be paid by EU companies to our Government than UK companies to EU Governments. A new Tariff Reimbursement Transition Period could be introduced to help our companies trading with the EU. This will mean our Government reimburses UK companies on tariffs paid to EU Governments using money received in tariffs from EU companies. This would effectively make it free trade for UK companies whilst the UK negotiate free trade deals with EU.",
        "background": "If UK left the EU there would be a renegotiation period. In this period companies will need to pay tariffs. This petition is to protect all UK businesses that rely on EU free-trade agreement. This idea would mean UK Government would reimburse UK companies on tariffs, using tariffs received from EU. ",
