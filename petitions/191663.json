        "action": "Stop allowing employers to ask about criminal convictions before a job offer",
        "additional_details": "If the legislation was changed to not allow employers to ask about criminal convictions until an offer of employment has been made it would be very hard for an employer then to say it was not because of an individuals criminal past allowing a more fair and just application process for ex-offenders. The current legislation is poor and despite it being illegal for an employer to not offer employment based solely on someone having a criminal record their are no current protections in place. ",
        "background": "Currently employers are allowed to ask an individual about their criminal convictions before a job offer is made. This is unfair and gives employers a \"loophole\" not to offer a position and say it was not because of criminal declarations but something else. This needs to change. ",
