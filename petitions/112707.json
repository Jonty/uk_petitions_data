        "additional_details": "If we respond to the appalling attacks in Paris by closing our borders we will shut out refugees running from the threat of ISIS. This is effectively doing ISIS' work for them. They do not want safety for refugees. We need to stand up and show the world that terror will not stop our way of life; will not stop our humanity; and will not stop our bravery. Stand up to ISIS and save the people they have targeted for years. Let's give safety to refugees. ",
        "background": "Our grandparents bravely fought for our freedom in Britain, but now presented with terror hundreds of thousands seek to close the borders. Where is the bravery of our ancestors? Keep the borders open. Save the refugees. Prove we are not cowards and give us a reason to be proud we are British again. ",
