        "additional_details": "This has been brought up by the US government as well as by Declan Welsh in the Guardian. Also Marc Tarabella and Brad Adams (exec. Director of Asian arm of Human Rights Watch) have condemned pakistani government of human rights abuses in balochistan and Azad kashmir. These people deserve to live a free life in their own countries rather than flee seeking justice elsewhere. The UK government needs to show its support to humanitarian causes and rights in every corner of the world.",
        "background": "There has been persecution of religious minorities, targeted killings of civilians, ethnic cleansing of shia muslims, hindus, punjabis, zikris and other minorities by frontier corps and inter service intelligence agency. ",
