        "additional_details": "The narrow definition of \"Humanities Subject\" will lead to:\r\n(a) job losses, as RS teachers are no longer required; \r\n(b) generations of children ignorant of religious belief; \r\n(c) a misunderstanding of \"the humanities\";\r\n(d) the loss of vital and unique topics to History and Geography syllabuses or PSHCE;\r\n(e) the loss of a unique, valuable, and essential part of the British school curriculum;\r\n(f) a squandered opportunity to enhance the PREVENT strategy to tackle radicalism and extremism.",
        "background": "The exclusion of RS from the EBacc is leading to a reduction in the overall understanding of religion in the UK, and suggests that RS is an unimportant subject. In a world increasingly defined by a lack of understanding of religious belief, this is a clear mistake by the Government.",
