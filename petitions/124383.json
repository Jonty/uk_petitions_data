        "additional_details": "The nearest Admiral Nurse for the whole of Bedfordshire is Cambridge.  I found it abhorrent that this government were paying doctors \u00a355 for every patient they diagnosed with the condition, that money should have been given to fund more nurses not as an incentive for someone 'doing their job. The figures, from the Health and Social Care Information Centre, show the number of patients with a record of dementia went up to 415,964 at the end of March this year.  We need to fund Admiral Nurses.",
        "background": "An  Admiral Nurse is to Dementia/Alzheimer sufferers what a MacMilland Nurse is to cancer.  I lost my lovely Mum to Dementia.now my father in law has it.  Here in Bedfordshire we do not have ONE Admiral Nurse. We need to look after dementia sufferers with care and compassion especially lone patients",
