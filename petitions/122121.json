But instead of targeting the money on areas with the biggest cuts, 85% of it has been sent to areas with the lowest levels of deprivation that have experienced the least cuts. Most of these areas are run by Conservative councils. There are concerns public money was used as a political fix to buy votes for the Tories in the run-up to elections in May.",
