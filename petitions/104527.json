        "action": "Do not pass further Mass Surveillance legislation into law.",
        "additional_details": "Currently, the USA are stopping their Surveillance programs because it is a waste of money and figures show it is not effective at stopping crime. It managed to stop one person from giving $8000 to a terrorist organisation but later the charges were dropped. \r\n\r\nThe UK has not released figures for the amount of crime it has prevented. It also cost the taxpayer an estimated \u00a311.1 billion, or \u00a3500 per household, since 2005. It is an invasion of privacy and we're worried about an Orwellian future.",
        "background": "Since 9/11, the UK and US Governments have used terrorism as an excuse for all increases in Mass Surveillance. In 2013, Edward Snowden revealed that GCHQ in England and the NSA in the US have been working together to spy indiscriminately on everyone in both countries. This is invasion of privacy.",
