        "action": "Decriminalise the use and production of cannabis for personal and medical use",
        "additional_details": "Numerous studies have shown the medical benefits of cannabis, for several life threatening conditions. By criminalising the drug, users who wish to use it in small quantities and for medical purposes are forced to buy from criminals. Cannabis purchased off the street has no health and safety regulations attached to it, and so users risk injesting harmful additives that may be added by the growers. Allowing small scale production would allow users to grow a small, safe supply for their own use.",
        "background": "In cases where people grow the plant for their own personal use, and for possession in small quantities, it should be decriminalised to prevent the needless criminalisation of thousands of users throughout the UK - especially for medical use.",
