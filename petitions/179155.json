        "additional_details": "Recently,  a Conservative council announced it was holding a referendum on increasing Council Tax by 15%. Yet the Government still insists on spending 0.7% GDP on Foreign Aid spending.  We believe this target should be abolished,  the Foreign Aid budget slashed and the money used to fund the NHS, Adult Social Care and increased expenditure on border controls. The Armed Forces should also be looked after. We should look after our own people first. ",
        "background": "We believe that the 0.7% GDP target for Foreign Aid expenditure should be abolished. The money should be spent at home. It is utterly ridiculous that Foreign Aid expenditure is set to rise to \u00a316bn by 2020.  Spend the money in this country rather than abroad. ",
