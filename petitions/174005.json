        "additional_details": "Insulin for diabetes sufferers is free, so medication for ALL incurable diseases should also be free of charge.\r\n\r\nHard working tax payers who suffer from such conditions, have to pay for their prescriptions, whereas citizens on JSA can get theirs free of charge. This simply does not make sense.\r\n\r\n\u00a38.40 may not seem expensive, but when you are being prescribed 4 different medications per month for the same condition, this amounts to over \u00a3400 per year without a pre-paid exemption card.",
        "background": "It is unfair that people who have no other option but to take medication for the rest of their lives, due to suffering from lifelong / incurable diseases, conditions or syndromes (such as: arthritis, asthma, heart conditions, etc.) have to pay for their prescriptions until they reach the age of 60.",
