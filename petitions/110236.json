        "additional_details": "Popular self-balancing scooters (so-called 'Hoverboards') and other such devices as electric scooters and segways are also deemed illegal in the UK.\r\nThey are legal for use in much of the rest of the world. The UK's strict adherence to anachronistic laws is self-defeating in this case, and should be altered to accommodate advances in technology.",
        "background": "The Highways Act (1835) prohibits the use of powered vehicles on the pavement. Although this was a good idea at the time, preventing things such as steam powered traction engines from being used, it now stifles progress as harmless devices are illegal to use.",
