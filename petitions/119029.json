My daughters time at school has been highly unpleasant, why should the victims of bullying be left with no option than to further their education elsewhere? Entry to 6th form should not only be based on academic results. As role models for the younger students it is important to show that bullying will not be tolerated on any level. ",

Why allow them to stay on at the school where they have caused extreme distress to other pupils? 6th form students should act as role models for the younger children. ",
