        "additional_details": "The preoccupation with Article 50 of the European Treaty is a red herring and requires the Government to go cap in hand to Brussels for permission to leave.  We should seize the initiative and start the process of getting our country back now, not wait months for an interminable Conservative Party leadership contest, followed by several years while we await permission from Brussels to leave.  The Government has the authority of the people to act and it should do so, not sit on its hands.",
        "background": "Government to introduce a bill to repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and all its amendments. This gives it the authority to negotiate our exit from the EU. While this Act remains in force, we have to go on handing over vast sums of money to the EU and we are still subject to its laws & demands",
