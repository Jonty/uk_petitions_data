        "additional_details": "We are now leaving the EU, so we should set about restoring the institutions of the British state, which the EU has undermined with the support the political parties in the House of Commons. The House of Lords should be a House of legacy and law, a check on the power of political parties and the government. The political parties should no longer be able to stack the House to block the will of the British people. ",
        "background": "The House of Lords is no longer independent of the political parties in the House of Commons, leading to the destruction of the British Parliamentary system. We have lost Liberty and Justice because of this. To correct this we must restore the Hereditary Peers and Appellate Committee in the Lords.",
