        "additional_details": "The national debate about the EU referendum must be fair and balanced for the outcome to have any legitimacy. The Electoral Commission has stated that the government\u2019s pro-EU leaflets have created an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d for Remain. Brexit: The Movie \u2013 which will be free to watch via the Internet from 11th May \u2013 makes the case for Leave in a factual, relevant, accessible and entertaining way. The government can restore legitimacy to the referendum by sending a DVD of the film to every UK home.",
        "background": "Cameron has rigged the EU Referendum by using \u00a39.3 million of taxpayer money to mail pro-EU leaflets to every UK household. The government must now restore legitimacy and fairness by also mailing to every home a DVD of Brexit: The Movie, which makes the case for why the UK should Leave the EU.",
