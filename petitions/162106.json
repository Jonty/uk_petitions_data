        "additional_details": "The effect of this decision has been to place services under increased pressure leading to waiting times of over 12 months for the most vulnerable children in our society to receive the help they need. Visyon, a local children's mental health charity, has been forced to close its waiting list because expected funding has not been awarded. This leaves families who are desperate for help with no alternative source of support. Your signature could help to force a U-turn on this decision.",

In Cheshire East CCGs have been forced to redirect this money into deficits by NHS England, preventing them from spending the additional money on its intended purpose.",
