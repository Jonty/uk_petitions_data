        "additional_details": "Brexit means Brexit is not a good enough explanation to the British people! The British people all understand that detailed plans of a Brexit plan would do more damage than good however the least the British people deserve is a set of deadlines and a brief overview of what the Government believe Brexit will look like.",

It was decided that the majority of the UK wanted to leave the EU and that the current government would abide by the decision of the British people. We now need to make this a reality and make it a reality sooner rather than later.",
