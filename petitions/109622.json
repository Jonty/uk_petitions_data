        "additional_details": "My mum sadly passed away due to heart failure at home and if my sister was first aid trained and able to use a defibrillator it could of potentially saved her life.\r\nAnd it could save thousands more.\r\nMaybe every household is a big jump at the moment but I think this is what we should be working towards in the future.",
        "background": "When somebody suffers cardiac arrest you can perform CPR on them if trained too but with only 5-10% chance of survival.\r\nWith a defibrillator on hand it can jump that percentage up to around 70%.\r\nI think people who are 45-50 onwards should have a defibrillator in their household.",
