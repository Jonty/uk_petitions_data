        "additional_details": "The great vehicle tax rip off .. along with insurance tax means anyone using a vehicle legally gets stung enough WITHOUT the Chancellors underhand robbery. I don't want to pay for the days I don't use my vehicles, I can only use one at once and the current system rips me off if I change one mid month.",
        "background": "Vehicle duty (road tax) is currently an unfair tax ripping off the British motorist. Charging monthly means if someone buys or sells a vehicle mid month the Government benefits by getting 2 lots of tax for that month from the buyer AND seller (if the new owner uses it immediately). Charge daily.",
