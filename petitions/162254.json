        "action": "Make all foreign vehicles entering the UK pay a road tax.",
        "additional_details": "Vignettes could be purchased at the port of entry, or on line, in much the same way as the purchase system on the borders of Switzerland and Austria.  In Switzerland we have to purchase an annual vignette, and in Austria we are able to purchase a three month vignette.  Our roads are crammed with foreign trucks, and I strongly believe that some form of British road tax should be levied to ease the burden of the high road repair costs.",
        "background": "When we drive across the channel we are expected to pay road tax in many European countries, either by way of motorway tolls, or by purchasing a vignette.  However, any vehicle can enter the UK from Europe and are able to travel free of road tax.  Why is this allowed to carry on?",
