        "additional_details": "On 23rd June 2016, over 7 Million people voted to leave the EU. On the 24th June 2016, William Oliver Healey tried to start a petition insisting that there is a second EU referendum as his side lost the vote. This causes unnecessary stress and strain on the nation as a whole who are already divided. We need it set in stone that the vote to leave the EU is final and cannot be undone by complaints and abuse from the Remain Supporters. This hate crime cannot continue.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, request that the government put in place ruling to stop the abuse from Remain voters unhappy with the loss of their campaign. We would like an official statement that the decision of the 23rd June Referendum is final and cannot be changed.",
