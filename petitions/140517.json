        "additional_details": "We move that the UK Government disregard the above petition and uphold the original EU Referendum result, which was executed under the rules in force at the time. Under the proportional democratic process used, the EU Referendum is a valid result, with a majority of the electorate voting for Leaving the EU. This should be abided by and Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty subsequently triggered in due course, as clearly instructed by the UK Electrorate.",
        "background": "A petition has been raised for a repeat of the EU Referendum, on the basis that it was too a close result. This asks the government to rule the result void unless it has a 75% electorate turnout and 60% majority. This currently has over 2m signatories at the time of this one being raised to counter.",
