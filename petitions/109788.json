        "additional_details": "There are some crimes where prison is not enough and people don't want their tax to be spent sustaining these police-murderers/child rapists etc.\r\n\r\nFor those that argue, using capital punishment is more expensive than sustaining them in prison, there are many forms of capital punishment that do not cost anywhere near as much - e.g. firing squad.",
        "background": "Ever since capital punishment has been abolished in the UK, serious crime has increased and the amount of people that are wrongly imprisoned has also risen.\r\n\r\nCapital punishment provides a deterrent for those that commit serious crimes and can deter repeat offenders from committing again.",
