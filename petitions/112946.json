I go without my husband, it breaks my heart leaving holding back tears saying bye. Dreaded refusal our hearts sank as we opened it, can't believe they deny us again. How will I explain Daddy isn't coming. Unable to visit 'home', experience my culture. I'm a British Citizen I don't have rights to appeal. Cherish every min with loved ones some don't have a choice\"",
