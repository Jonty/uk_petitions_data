        "additional_details": "Although a majority of those voting voted to leave, the margin was narrow and on a matter of such fundamental importance, there needs to be a stronger mandate.  I am in favour of the petition asking for a rule to increase the required proportion of the electoral vote, but it is retrospective.  This new petition goes further and more fully recognises the situation after the vote has taken place.  It asks for further negotiation to improve the terms of our membership and for these to be put to the vote.  ",
        "background": "This petition demonstrates the lack of a clear majority of the total electorate in favour of leaving the EU and asks HMG to negotiate new terms of our EU membership prior to another referendum. ",
