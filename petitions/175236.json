        "action": "Make the reproduction and selling of HM Armed Forces Veteran's Badges illegal.",
        "additional_details": "A great many HM Armed Forces Veterans have expressed both disgust and dismay at the fact that obtaining a Veteran's Badge is as simple as buying one from eBay. We, as Her Majesty's Armed Forces Veteran's have earned the right to wear our badge with honour and pride, whereas charlatans obtain discounts and respect that they DO NOT deserve and have NOT earned. This is completely unacceptable to those of us who have served our country; often at great personal cost, both physically and emotionally.",
        "background": "We the Veteran's of Her Majesty's Armed Forces strongly believe that the buying and selling of the HM Armed Forces Veteran's Badges is both immoral and unjust. It takes away from us the sanctity of the badge itself, and us having earned it.",
