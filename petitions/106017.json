        "action": "Ensure Tax credit entitlements are protected for hard working 18-22 years olds.",
        "additional_details": "A large number of 18-22 year old British Citizens claim tax credits, approx 50,000 people. The majority who claim Tax Credits are reliant on this as they are on very low incomes, are often on zero hours contracts, and many are single parents, who can only work due the tax credits that are available. If the waiting period is introduced, then many will be fall further into poverty, will be forced to give Up work as childcare will be unaffordable (if they have very young children i.e under three) And finally the countries unemployment figures will rise.",
        "background": " The government is planning to introduce a 4 year waiting period for tax credits, primarily to stop immigrants from claiming. HOWEVER this will also affect poor, hard working, often single parent British citizens who are 18-22 years old. This if introduced would increase poverty and unemployment",
