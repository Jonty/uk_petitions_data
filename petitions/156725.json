        "action": "Respectfully ask UKIP to stand down from representation in parliament and the EU",
        "additional_details": "Nigel Farage's speech in Europe upset many of the countries that we now must negotiate with in a bid to secure our future.\r\n\r\nUKIPs behaviour skirting racism (and embracing racism) seems to be making a small number of people in the country feel validated in hateful behaviour.\r\n\r\nI believe that both remain and leave voters can come together in a small way to condemn racism in this country by respectfully letting UKIP know that their views are no longer welcome and have no further purpose.",
        "background": "UKIPs behaviour both pre and post the EU referendum has fuelled racism in this country. Their post-referendum stance does not help our cause abroad. I believe UKIP should be respectfully asked to leave politics. I believe that this petition will align with the views of both leave and remain voters.",
