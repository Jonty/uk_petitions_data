        "additional_details": "This includes websites like Seatwave, viagogo, ticketmaster, stubhub.\r\n\r\nThere should at least be rules about the price at which tickets are listed!! Only Face Value tickets should be allowed to be listed on these websites. An example is Ed Sheeran who \"sold out\" in less than 5 minutes, and yet as I go on the mentioned sites above, there were tickets listed at prices between 200 and 600 pounds(Face value was 77).\r\n\r\nThis is unacceptable and action should be taken by the government to protect real fans",
        "background": "Me and many other people are upset because they cannot get tickets for their favorite artists just because some people decide to buy as many tickets as they can and sell them x2, x3 or even more expensive the original face value. I think that this is unacceptable and should be stopped. ",
