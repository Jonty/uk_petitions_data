        "action": "Lower the minimum voting age to 16",
        "additional_details": "For years the voting age has remained at 18, mainly because the current party in power believes it may damage their majority in Parliament if it is lowered. However, this shouldn't be the reason why 16yr olds are not allowed to vote. Even in Scotland, the minimum voting age has been lowered for Scottish laws, so why can't all of the younger generation in the UK be allowed to vote? This is an issue that more and more people are feeling angered about, and now the law needs to be changed.",
        "background": "At 16, you can marry and even fight in the armed forces, but you don't have the right to vote. Many believe that 16yr olds are incapable of forming serious political views; this is completely incorrect. It is an essential part of democracy that young people should be able to vote for their futures.",
