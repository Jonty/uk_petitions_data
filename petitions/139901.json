        "action": "Set up a unity commission to negotiate the terms of Brexit.",
        "additional_details": "The terms of Brexit are too important to leave to the interests of a narrow political group. A commission should be set up with the power to negotiate our exit. This would allow the nation to draw together politicians from all parties who polled more than 5% at the last general election. Members should also be appointed from business, education, unions, the law, charities, public services, security and the economy. The negotiated terms will be legally binding on the government of the day.",
        "background": "Exceptional circumstances require an exceptional response. HM Government should set aside narrow party politics and set up a commission with the power to negotiate the terms of our exit. This must include representatives of all parties, all regions, all backgrounds, and many interest groups.",
