        "additional_details": "More importantly to us, fans should be able to buy tickets at the prices that artistes and event organisers choose, not what the profiteers can extract from people.  Ticket prices are set so the broadest spread of people can attend events, not just the wealthiest. Anonymous wheeler-dealers acquiring tickets and reselling them at huge mark-ups are distorting what should be a free and honest marketplace. We urge the government to take action to protect music, arts and sports fans.",
