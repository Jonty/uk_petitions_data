        "action": "Amend the planning rules away from favouring development",
        "additional_details": "Planning rules seem to favour rich developers against local objections. This should be sorted so that development plans can no longer be released with minimal publicity and fanfare, and then developers or Local councils who want massive development to occur claim that minimal protest counts as approval for their plans",
        "background": "Developers seemingly put forward a massive plan for development and consult only a few neighbouring roads, plus put up a couple of laminated notices. Local councils can put out local plan consultations with no publicity. They should both be required to inform a far larger section of local population",
