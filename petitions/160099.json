If each large company (\u00a31m+ turnover) was fined, per customer, for each call to customer service which was unanswered after 5 minutes, then they would pretty quickly improve things. For younger people, who can operate websites fairly easily, the situation is barely tolerable; but for the elderly, waiting on a phone for hours, it must be very upsetting, leaving customers feeling powerless and neglected with little recourse if things go wrong.",
