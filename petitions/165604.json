        "additional_details": "It would require car manufacturers to create a new range of restricted, but affordable cars, that would also lead to cheaper insurance for first time drivers. ",
        "background": "It is common to see young drivers driving badly, too fast, aggressively,  and involved in accidents that cause death and injury to themselves and others. I believe it would be a relatively easy step to restrict the power and speed of cars driven by young drivers.",
