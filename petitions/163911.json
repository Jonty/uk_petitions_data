It can ruin a person's life as their name will potentially always be blackened, despite the fact they they're completely innocent!  Imagine if your son, brother or partner/spouse were falsely accused of rape, their life would be destroyed.  Please sign this petition to help protect them in the future, as this can happen to ANYONE! ",

In other cases, people who are accused of making false accusations may be prosecuted for wasting police time.\r\n\r\nIt is not therefore clear to us how you would like the law to be changed. You could start a new petition asking for a specific change to the law. \r\n\r\nYou may find this guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service helpful:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/perverting_the_course_of_justice_-_rape_and_dv_allegations/\r\n"
