        "additional_details": "Born in Melrose, Scotland in AD 635, Cuthbert was a soldier before  becoming a monk, earning a reputation for sanctity and devotion. He was a Celtic Christian, but after the Synod of Whitby (AD 664) he worked to bring Roman and Celtic Christians together and heal divisions. He did his greatest work at Lindisfarne and spent was an ascetic hermit on the Farne Islands, which are now one of our finest nature reserves. He was Bishop of Lindisfarne for just a year before his death on 20th March 687.",
        "background": "St Cuthbert would make a much better patron saint for England, because:\r\n1. He lived in England (unlike St George).\r\n2. He worked to bring harmony and peace (unlike St George).\r\n3. He is associated with wildlife and wild places, representing the natural capital of our country.",
