        "additional_details": "Reform is essential to improve the working of Parliament and improve the public perception of it and of politicians. All debates should be fully attended (except where civil duties take precedence). MPs who fail to attend without good reason should be fined, and repeat offenders  should lose their status as MPs. \r\nClearly, other reforms are necessary, such as banning or limiting the odious tactic of filibustering. In addition, total recess should be no more than 30 days/year (like most jobs).",
        "background": "MPs should attend all debates, not merely turn up and vote or strike pairing deals. With other commitments, a five day Commons is not workable for MPs: I suggest three full days (9am to 6pm minimum), with one or two days for Committees, leaving at least one day for constituency work.
