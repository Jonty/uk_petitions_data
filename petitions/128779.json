        "action": "Save the Environment Land Based Science (ELBS) GCSE from ending in 2018.",
        "additional_details": "Our school in Kingsteignton Devon has had a farm since 2009 offering this land based science course. Many of our students at Teign School live in the rural community this has been a huge asset in education. As well as offering students GCSEs Rydon Primary school also visit for educating younger children reaching out to over 1600 students. Our farm will now have to close due to this decision, it will have devastating impact throughout education and the local communities. Together we're stronger.",
        "background": "Please do not let this generation suffer and the rural sector miss out from this damaging decision. ELBS is a fantastic course for secondary education to offer especially in rural areas, developing the next generation and inspiring teenagers to live and work in the rural community or animal care.",
