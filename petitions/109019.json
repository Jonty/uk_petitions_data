        "action": "Protest the chairing of UN Human Rights panel by a Saudi Arabian representative",
        "additional_details": "Given the country's appalling track record on women's rights, LGBT rights, free speech, and the recent flogging of blogger Raif Badawi; it is unconscionable that a representative of Saudi Arabia (Mr Faisal Trad) be serving (since June) in a key role in the oversight of the UN's human rights policy. We the undersigned petition the government to use all diplomatic channels to protest and object to this appointment and seek the removal of Mr Trad from his position as panel chair.",
        "background": "It has recently been revealed that the Saudi ambassador to the UN; Mr Trad; has been appointed as chair of a panel of independent experts to the UN Human Rights council. We ask the government to use all possible diplomatic avenues to condemn this appointment, based on Saudi's existing rights record.",
