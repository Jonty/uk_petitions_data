If people had the same responsilbility when they've run over a cat as they do a dog they'd drive more carefully and the number of cat deaths by vehicles would be reduced, also many could and would be saved by taking to a vet if they are still alive after the hit. You should have a legal responsibility to take action when you've just run over someones pet no matter what the animals is. ",

There's far too many people that run over cats because there's no responsibility on them & they have no obligation to legally do anything about the life they've taken. STOP them just driving off. ",
