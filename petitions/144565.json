        "action": "Referendums must garner over 50% in all four nations of the UK to be passed",
        "additional_details": "The United Kngdom is a valued but vulnerable Union. The U.K. Parliament must respect the views of the constituent nations when consulting the public over constitutional matters. Therefore, referendums must require the support of each constituent nation (England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland). \r\n\r\nThe undersigned wish this to be enforced retrospectively, including the recent EU referendum. ",
        "background": "Referendums risk the break-up of the United Kingdom, if the four nations vote in different ways, as devolved parliaments can cite \"material changes\" that allow a referendum of independence in their respective nations to be carried out. ",
