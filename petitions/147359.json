        "additional_details": "It is obvious from personal stories from friends and families and other stories trending on the internet that a significant number of people voted when they did not know what they were really voting for and also were using as a protest rather than considering and forming balanced opinion based on informed arguments for yes or no.",
        "background": "Before important future referendum i.e. like should UK be in the EU or not? A pre-referendum is issued first  to ensure that eligible voters understand what they are voting for. The results of pre-referendum should be used as weighting to set the criteria that main referendum is considered passed.",
