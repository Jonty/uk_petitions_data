        "action": "Change the legislation regarding the trapping and killing of foxes and wildlife",
        "additional_details": "Hunters and generally nasty people are using these laws to trap foxes for training their dogs to hunt and kill. Hunting in this country is absolutely pointless and is purely to fulfill a sick ego. If we had bears and predatory animals roaming our streets then hunting would make more sense. The cruelty one can impose on an animal is merely a snapshot into their psyche and gives evidence they are not mentally healthy people who would not think much about inflicting pain on another human.",
        "background": "Currently it is legal to trap foxes and other wildlife in snares and cages and then kill them \"humanely.\" The very act of trapping and killing a wild animal is inhumane and is cruelty at it's best. The law should only allow farmers the right to kill an animal if said animal is causing problems.",
