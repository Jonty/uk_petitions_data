        "additional_details": "As a lot of us see them as more than pets, we should have places where we can bury them and let them rest in piece. They are loved ones and should be treated as such. They don't ask for a lot in life, all they ask for is love and care and don't we all just want love? If you look after your animal, they will look after you. Please consider this as I can assure you, many, many people will really appreciate being able to use these places. Thank you.",
        "background": "I think we can all agree that our pets are more than just pets, they become best friends and family members. it is only because of my dog that I can leave my house due to my mental health. He is my bet friend and I think others will agree we need a place to rest them just like we do with people.",
