        "additional_details": "As a college student myself, I understand how many people who are 16 or 17 years old feel. I believe at this age we lack rights. We don't have the right to vote, and we don't have the right to make a choice on our own futures. I feel for many, attending college isn't the right choice, and unless we are able to secure an Apprenticeship, there is no way for us to leave. Personally I find remaining at college difficult, as I would like to seek full time employment, but that choice isn't available. ",
        "background": "In England, you must stay in some form of education until you are 18 years old. I believe this is wrong, as it limits the choice of young people. If this law was removed, everyone would have the ability to do what they want to do after they leave school. ",
