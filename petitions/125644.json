        "additional_details": "For a sport associated with global travel more than any other, most Formula 1 teams are based in Britain. Britain is centre of the universe for Motorsport. For decades Formula 1 has been a standard viewing slot for many households until corporate greed started robbing many of the chance to watch F1 for free on terrestrial TV. In 2019, Formula 1 will for the first time become unavailable on free terrestrial TV robbing many the chance to enjoy some great racing & support their teams & drivers.",
        "background": "Formula 1 should be classified as a category A event in Britain to stop corporate greed robbing millions of the chance to watch F1 on free terrestrial TV. Moving to pay TV only in 2019 to SKY gives them a monopoly over one of the most popular sports in the world & barring millions from watching it",
