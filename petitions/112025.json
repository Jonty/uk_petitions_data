        "additional_details": "In the last 13 years more and more ppl from other countries now live in the uk and are driving without any safety tests of highway codes and practices. They block pavements and roads with random parking and drive without any tax or insurance. I myself have fallen victim several times by uninsured drivers. There should be bigger penalties on them and they should not be allowed to drive or own a car without first passing a test. They block my street . Block the foot paths and dump vehicles. ",
        "background": "Many drivers from other country's do not know uk safety policies whilst driving or parking. They need to be taught the Highway Code and sit an intensive course if they want to drive in the uk. More then 60% of driving offences in the last year were from resident ppl now in the uk from other countrys",
