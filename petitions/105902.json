        "additional_details": "The BBC provides a world class broadcasting service that is envied and certainly not matched by any other country. It is a service, which the majority of British citizens are proud of yet this government is jealous of its success, its freedom of expression and its independence and wishes to destroy it. This government, with its zeal for privatization, must leave the BBC alone, and not be allowed to privatise it or get rid of it altogether.\r\n\r\nThe BBC isn't perfect. But with other parts of the media controlled by the Murdochs and corporate interests, an independent BBC is vital. We all benefit from having a public broadcaster that's free from commercial interests and run independently from government.\r\n",
        "background": "The BBC we currently know and love is under attack. The government is trying to cut popular programmes, undermine its funding, and - worst of all - challenge its independence. \r\n",
