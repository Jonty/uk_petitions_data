        "additional_details": "Some may call this an expression of \"art\" and freedom. The highly ironic facts are that many young girls and boys get into the industry at a very early age, so the abusive (88.2% of top rated porn scenes contain aggressive acts stoppornculture.org*) scenes mostly aimed at women (94%*) is all that some know in the work place. Despite laws and blocks against young people watching porn, after first exposure, 12- 17 year old boys are the biggest audience*. It is addictive, destructive and shameful.",
        "background": "Pornography is a fake sense of stimulation, aimed at a range of audiences and age groups. Many believe what happens on a pornographic set, is what does/should happen in real life, leading to more domestic violence and lack of trust in many couples globally. It is leading to a broken society for all.",
