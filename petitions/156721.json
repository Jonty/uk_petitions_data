        "additional_details": "A public enquiry is required to review the misinformation and to ensure that in future any campaign is operated truthfully and honestly. The Leave campaign has already started to distance themselves from their own promises and have brought UK Politics intro disrepute. Had this been a VCR or a TV we would be entitled (under UK/EU consumer law) to a refund and the vendors prosecuted for fraud. The same tests must be applied to the Leave and Remain campaigns and we must never see this again\r\n",
