The EU has a massive link to our migration figures due to the EU Free Movement and accounts for roughly half off all immigration.",
        "background": "Seen as migration is a flagship issue for both sides of the referendum campaign and the Q2 immigration figures aren't due till a short time after the referendum, it would be fair to publish a set of migration figures just before June 23rd 2016. The ONS should publish a set of figures before this.",
