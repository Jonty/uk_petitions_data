        "action": "Allow British citizens to offer rooms in their homes to refugees, for free",
        "additional_details": "There are 20 million refugees in the world, including 5 million from Syria. The plight of \"displaced people\" is not new. Most prolonged wars cause many people to flee their homes - or from the ruins of their homes. Many live in overcrowded conditions with relatives. Many don't have that option, fleeing across borders to a life of uncertainty, often living in camps or shanty towns. There is a long tradition of citizens giving up space in their homes to house refugees. Publicly encourage this.",
        "background": "Many people would willingly give up space in their home for free to a refugee or a refugee family. The British government should start a scheme to encourage people to do this.",
