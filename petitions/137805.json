        "action": "Allow votes at 16 in a second referendum on the EU.",
        "additional_details": "Given that the outcome affects the future of young people the most, if the current petition for a second referendum has a positive result, it would be fair to give the right to vote at 16, especially given the percentage of young people who voted remain. Many researchers argue that votes at 16 is a democratic ideal, shown in the high turnout of 16 and 17 year olds during the Scottish Referendum. If a 2nd Referendum does take place, let the young people of this nation protect their future.",
        "background": "The EU referendum produced a narrow win for the Leave campaign. While I am happy with the democratic process, the result showed that the majority of under 50's voted remain. If 16 year olds had have been given the vote as in Scotland in 2014, the outcome may have been very different.",
