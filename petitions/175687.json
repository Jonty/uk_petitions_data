        "additional_details": "In 2011 the Murdoch family attempted to gain full control of Sky (it currently owns 39 percent) but backed off following the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. The Murdoch family, under 21st Century Fox, has now reached an agreement with Sky for a full takeover. This will give the Murdoch group an unprecedented level of influence in the British media, as it already owns the Sun and the Times. We should not allow one company or individual to have extensive control of the media - it undermines our democracy. ",
