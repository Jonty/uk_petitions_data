MPs have claimed some ridiculous expenses -- one guy even claimed about \u00a3100 for two toilet seats! \u00a3700mil is being avoided in tax by companies, whilst nurses & teachers pay higher taxes than them & in the meantime, ATOS and Capita bear excessive promises but also excessive wait times, people literally could die whilst waiting, or others choose to end their lives after being failed by the system! ",
