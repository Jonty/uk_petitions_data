        "action": "Greater independent regulation and oversight throughout buying a new home",
        "additional_details": "Buyers being forced to queue in the freezing cold overnight for the right to reserve a property should not happen in the 21st Century, and neither should waiting almost a year trapped, having legally exchanged contracts, to move in.\r\n\r\nThanks to schemes like help-to-buy it is getting easier for first time buyers to purchase, and new-build properties are the key. The NHBC is there to help when you've moved in, but we need an independent regulating body to help through the process of purchasing.",
        "background": "Stressful enough, the process of buying a new house is fraught with legal traps and hidden charges for the consumer, where developers have free-reign to act as they please. Just like the majority of other industries, we need a body to provide advice to consumers and help when things go wrong.",
