        "additional_details": "SMEs are seen as the growth engine of the economy yet there is little information for the inexperienced to identify who are credible business consultants and who are not.  There is no overarching governance mechanism, and yet we see numerous initiatives and grants seeking to help this sector. To this extent making available a list of accrediting organisations who exercise not only a quality control scheme for their members but ongoing educational programmes, for example as offered by, the Association of Business Mentor (a body of professional mentors) or such organisations as ibd Business Advice Group (ibd-uk.com \u2013 a group of business consultants) would protect both end user and provider.  \r\n",
        "background": "Business Consultants offer valuable advice to government and SMEs yet remain unregulated. \u00a0It is proposed that when engaging, recommending, or working with Business Consultants government bodies and SMEs should be able to refer to an approved provider list of organisations and agencies.",
