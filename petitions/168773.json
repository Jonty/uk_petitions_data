        "additional_details": "We demand that any politician who lies for personal or political gain should: \r\n1/ Be removed from their position\r\n2/ Be banned from all public offices for a minimum of ten years\r\n3/ Pay a fine based on the severity of the crime and their ability to pay\r\nAny legislation enacted based on the lie must to be cancelled.\r\nAn independent body must be set up to monitor politicians to this effect, and also to monitor political advertising and campaign materials, similarly to the Advertising Standards Agency.",
        "background": "We cannot call ourselves a functioning democracy if our democratic decisions are taken based on lies and deceptions. We therefore demand that any politician who lies to or misleads the public be held legally accountable, and a new agency be set up to monitor political advertising and promotion.",
