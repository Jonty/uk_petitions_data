In the short term it should quash suppression of local planning policy where there is no 5yr land supply especially where serious infrastructure issues are also evident. NPPF para 47.2 should define how land is acquired; Current mechanism is not working for our communities leaving us open to speculative & unsustainable development!",

Time is running out! Sprawling and \u201cunsustainable\u201d urbanisation will result! We must have LOCAL DECISIONS made by LOCAL PEOPLE!",
