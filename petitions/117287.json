        "additional_details": "Not only does funding Virgin Media`s plan help bring Fast Broadband to even more homes, but also helps to increase the UK encomy by 8 billion, that could increase! David Cameron has announced that he is satisfied with their rollout plan to bring fast broadband to more homes, so you could help with that by funding it! BT should not get funding, whilst Virgin Media does not.",
        "background": "In February 2015, Cable Operator Virgin Media announced their 3 billion pounds investment plan to extend their network to 4 million homes by 2020. Currently BT gets funded by the government to support their rollout, but Virgin Media who provides FASTER speeds, does not, There are some pros doing so.",
