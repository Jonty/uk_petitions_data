        "action": "Review anti-discrimination laws to stop unfair appearance-based discrimination",
        "additional_details": "Employers can discriminate against employees, or prospective candidates on the basis of superficial attributes such as hair colour, make-up, piercings and tattoos. It is unfair to subject innocent, hard-working citizens to this prejudice and unjust treatment in the workplace on appearance-based grounds, especially without any legal means to challenge such discrimination. Nobody should be made to feel inferior or disadvantaged due to harmless self-expression. Appearance doesn't define ability. ",
        "background": "In the UK, there are a number of specified characteristics the law will protect against discrimination, specifically regarding behaviour in professional environments. However, many aspects of a person's appearance and individual nature are not covered by this protection. This needs to change. ",
