This is too small to be a government mandate to leave the EU with the dire economic consequences already seen. The MPs Code of Conduct obliges them to do what is best for the NATION i.e. Scotland, NI, Wales and England.If a deal which is more favourable to the whole of the UK than EU membership cannot be reached, MPs must vote not to leave.",
