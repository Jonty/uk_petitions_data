I shared this story on social media which went across the world. \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207097809738910&set=a.1926244431082.109135.1091294407&type=3\r\n Since then many have people expressed their concern about not knowing that this could be dangerous for a baby, including the doctor we saw in accident and emergency.  Lots have people have sadly lost their babies because of this lack of knowledge.",
        "background": "Before the age of 3 months a babies immune system cannot cope with the herpes simplex virus, if the baby contracts this it can lead to long term disabilities or could even be fatal. This is a very common virus that can be fatal for a baby, yet no information is provided by the NHS to pregnant women.",
