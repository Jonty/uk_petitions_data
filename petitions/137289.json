        "additional_details": "Young people, our future, have made it clear that they wish to Remain in the EU. Very nearly half the vote was for Remain. Is Leave is in fact what the nation wants? Many made their vote based on misleading statements (e.g. 350 million euros of EU funding to be directed to the NHS), with no understanding that the outcome might affect whether Scotland and Northern Ireland wished to continue being part of the United Kingdom or voted based on simply wanting to lash out at the establishment.\r\n",
        "background": "It has become clear that many voters did not understand the possible or likely repercussions of their vote.  A Confirmation Referendum on whether we wish to Remain or Leave the EU would allow people to vote with their eyes wide open now that much more of the likely outcomes have been revealed.",
