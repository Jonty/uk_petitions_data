To put it in plain English, people who place an offer on a property should be forced to see that offer through, as should the vendors of that property. No 'someone has come in at the last minute to place a higher offer'. No 'I've decided to reduce my offer as the house doesn't look as nice on a wet day'. The U.K. should follow the Scots example on property law. ",
