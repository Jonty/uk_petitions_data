        "action": "Have a second EU referendum allowing ages 16 and 17 a vote to hear their views.",
        "additional_details": "We ask these children in school to become like adults and be part of a debate then ignore their voice at a crucial point. In the Scottish referendum it was clearly apparent that people of this age were both engaged and politically aware enough to take part sensibly in debate (sometimes more so than their adult counterparts). This, I feel, means that a precident was set that should have been followed. It should be allowed before Article 50 is invoked.",
        "background": "My son and his friends at high school are devestated that their voices were not heard in Thursday's EU referendum and spoke angrily together about the outcome. How can it be allowed that a vote on their future in Europe has not included them?",
