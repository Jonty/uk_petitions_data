        "additional_details": "If people are educated about politics from a young age rather than being introduced to it at AS Level; then they will have a better understanding of the issues affecting our country and others. They will have better foundations to form their opinions, their political allegiance and turnout at elections at almost every level, be it Police and Crime Commissioner or a General Election will increase exponentially. Young people need to be more engaged with politics and education is the way forward. ",
        "background": "Politics is such a massively important facet of everyday life and it is well known that many young people are disillusioned and sometimes confused by politics. We believe that education from a young age would be the best way to tackle this issue. ",
