We create and sign petitions because we want to see change, we want our voices to be heard. ",
        "background": "In late 2006 the government set up the e-petitions website as a way for people to engage with politics. Millions of people have signed petitions, but we still don't feel like these petitions are given any real attention or importance. Petitions having the chance to become laws would change this.",
