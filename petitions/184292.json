        "additional_details": "Today The Telegraph released an article stating that the conservatives were making a move with the eventual intention of ousting John Bercow as speaker. This is because they believe he 'was not within his remit' to make the comments he did about Donald Trump's actions and to refuse him talking in Westminster Hall. This is an unfair reaction to Mr Bercows decision when it was based on the Presidents racist, sexist and bigoted actions and remarks. ",
        "background": "The conservatives have started a bid to oust John Bercow as speaker after his criticism of Donald Trump. We should respect his opinion of an individuals character and the choices they've made without assuming it's a political jibe.",
