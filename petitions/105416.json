        "action": "Abolish factory farms and relocalize meat production.",
        "additional_details": "Animals are living things - not something to mass produce, and must be treated as humanely as you would treat a household pet. Meat is never humane, but profit shouldn't come before animal welfare.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.peta.org/videos/glass-walls-2/\r\n\r\nAdditionally farmers should be independently checked to ensure they comply with acceptable standards of animal welfare. ",
        "background": "Factory farms, in aiming to produce the highest amount of meat at the lowest cost, inevitably neglect the welfare of animals, who are often frightened and distressed for whole of their short lives. Relocalize meat production so animals are raised on farms with compassion and a degree of humanity.",
