This would also enable legal redress against hate-speech often directed at lone parents.\r\n\r\nhttp://tinyurl.com/zh6kkoz\r\nhttps://gingerbread.org.uk/content/658/Employment",

In addition, caring responsibilities are not a recognised 'category' in legislation that protects individuals in vulnerable groups from discrimination and hate crimes. ",
