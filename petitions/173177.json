Yet, the prosecution will still give their evidence in the same way. Meaning a trial takes place with only the prosecution's evidence. This is injustice, the law should protect the venerable. Yet it's failing to do this for the most vulnerable of society those with Dementia and Alzheimer's who wont get a fair trail .",

Without direction the defendant is unable to give evidence in their own trail, nor can anyone else on their behalf.
