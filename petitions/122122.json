        "additional_details": " \r\n\r\nResearch shows that feeding infants exclusively on milk for the first 6 months has a positive effect on our nations health in child and adulthood.\r\n\r\nIntroducing babies to solid food at 6 months means that normal food can be used and products sold as \"baby food\" are not needed.  This could save families money.\r\n\r\nClear labelling in line with WHO and NHS guidelines will end confusion and contribute to a healthier population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "I work with a team of Health Visitors and give advice to parents about introducing their babies to solid food.\r\n \r\nBaby food is currently labelled as suitable from 4 months old. This is confusing as NHS guidelines say that infants should be fed milk only, breast or formula, for the first 6 months.\r\n",
