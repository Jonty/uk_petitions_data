        "action": "Remove VAT on bicycles and cycling equipment",
        "additional_details": "The cycle-to-work scheme is not provided by many employers, favours those in the higher tax bracket, with a limited period of eligibility and does not allow retailer discounts to be used. \r\n\r\nRemoval of VAT from cycling equipment is a real, simple and accessible incentive for all. ",
        "background": "Encourage the uptake of sustainable,  eco-friendly, healthy transport.  The cycle to work scheme is complicated and favours those on higher incomes, whilst preventing the would-be cyclist from benefiting from retailer offers and discounts. Removal of VAT would be simpler and benefit everyone equally",
