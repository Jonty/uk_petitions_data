If you mean that the sitting hours of the House of Commons should be changed, we could accept a petition asking specifically for that change.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, MPs do not have set working hours. It is for each MP to decide what hours he or she wishes to work. If you think that MPs should have a formal contract setting out their working hours, you could start a petition about that.\r\n\r\nDecisions about MPs' entitlement to expenses and business costs are not the responsibility of the Government or Parliament. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) is responsible for the rules about MPs\u2019 expenses and business costs. You can find out more about IPSA here:\r\n\r\nhttp://parliamentarystandards.org.uk"
