        "action": "We need to start a child loss benefit for bereaved parents/carers",
        "additional_details": "We lost our son Carson Hartley on 2nd June and within hours of losing him we also lost our title - his mummy and daddy - and our income. We then had to plan and pay for a funeral whilst worrying about if we could stay in the home we shared with our son all this whilst trying to grieve. If it was my partner I would get help but when you lose a child there is nothing. I want to stop this happening and I want parents to be able to grieve knowing financially they are ok even if for a short time.",
        "background": "The government recognises the loss of a partner or parents and then gives a benefit to those affected but the loss of a child goes unrecognised and there is no financial help after the child dies instead you are no longer mum/dad or carer you are simply nobody with no money and an empty heart.",
