        "action": "Hold a referendum on Greater London becoming an independent, EU member state",
        "additional_details": "The referendum on the 23rd of June clearly showed a divide in the beliefs of Londoners and the majority of the rest of England. Continued membership of the EU is vital if London is to remain the biggest financial centre in Europe. In addition, leaving would clearly go against the wishes of the majority of Londoners. We also believe that a divorce from the UK would be less traumatic than a split from the 450 million strong EU population",
        "background": "We want a referendum held in Greater London on becoming an independent, federal state, that will remain a member of the European Union. This reflects the wishes of the majority of Londoners to remain in the EU",
