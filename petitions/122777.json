        "additional_details": " The idea is to get youth involved in aid, charity, sustainable development and homelessness programmes. A mandatory year is spent in volunteering after compulsory education. This would be an excellent opportunity for youth to gain work experience, a work ethic, employment opportunities, to character build and have fun.\r\n\r\nThis was inspired through the work undertaken by being a volunteer in the Raleigh ICS programme.   ",
        "background": "In the old days we had a national service where two years were spent training and preparing for war as apart of our public service, instead of destroying the world with our hands, we can build and heal the world by volunteering at home or abroad.",
