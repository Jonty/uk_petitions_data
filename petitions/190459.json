        "additional_details": "We are in times that most of the UK are experiencing cut backs on public spending, at local Government level to NHS and it would be wrong that while the UK are suffering from these cut backs that Scotland wastes further millions on another referendum so soon after the last referendum.  They are wanting independence by leaving the UK to join the EU that is not independence.\r\n\r\nIf they insist on another referendum then it should be paid by the Scottish tax payer and in advance.",
        "background": "The UK taxpayers paid for Scotland's last referendum. The Scottish Tax Payer should foot the bill for the next referendum. They are wanting the next referendum before the UK exits the EU and should pay for the cost of their next referendum in an increase in PAYE over the next two years. ",
