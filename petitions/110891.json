        "additional_details": "There are many military bases left derelict.  They should be utilised as housing for ex-servicemen.  This would create communities of like minded people who can support each other in a familiar environment through their knowledge and understanding of what each has gone through.\r\n\r\nThese support networks would flourish and encourage self help, whilst utilising the dissused bases for the benefit of so many who would otherwise have nowhere to go and no-one to provide the help they require. ",
        "background": "The DIY SOS programme highlighted the need for specialised housing for many of our armed forces who have been injured during service for their country.\r\nThe support provided to ex-servicemen is inadequate and many are left homeless or living in sub standard conditions as a result.",
