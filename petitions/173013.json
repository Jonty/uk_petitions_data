        "action": "Stop Network Rail removing lineside trees for their own commercial gain.",
        "additional_details": "This proposed action is completely unjustified and un-proportionate. They have not considered the impact on the environment, wildlife and the effect it will have for local residents. The letter states that they will be removing trees,plants and vegetation unto 10 meters from their lineside, this will in effect create a concrete jungle and damage the beautiful aesthetics of Stirling. This must be opposed and stopped as the impact of this is far greater than the commercial gain of a company.",
        "background": "Recently a residential area within Stirling received generic letters for Network Rail advising that from 26th November 2016 they were going to be removing trees and plants from their lineside. They advised this was to minimise the risk of disrupting railway operations. ",
