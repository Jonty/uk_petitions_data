IFS take the 1st instalment within 14days of the direct debit setup in addition to huge deposit taken upfront. The balance is spread 9 monthly instalments, less than insurance term period.\u00a0It's like taking a\u00a012 month loan, paying the 1st instalment on drawdown, a second instalment within 14 days, and balance spread over 9 monthly instalments. This needs to change urgently.",

At present, most insurance companies who are deemed most affordable by search engines are exploiting customers' vulnerabilities.",
