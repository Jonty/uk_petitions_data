        "additional_details": "To abuse someone because of race or creed is quite rightly a criminal offence.  However, to abuse someone because of a particular hair colour is almost socially acceptable and does not result in the same punishment for the abuser.   This kind of prejudice and abuse is just as wrong and is very damaging to the abused person yet is looked upon as 'a bit of a laugh' and not really harmful or abusive.  It seems to be the last hiding place for bigots and needs bringing into the open.",
        "background": "Abuse of people with red hair seems to be one of the last remaining 'acceptable' forms of racism or hatred and this is unacceptable in today's culture of acceptance and tolerance of other cultures, creeds and colours.  Verbal and physical abuse of a person because of hair colour IS very damaging.",
