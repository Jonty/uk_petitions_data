        "action": "Ban the primate pet trade in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Many of these monkeys fortunately end up in sanctuaries such as Wild Futures UK, set up to ensure their protection and meet the needs that had been withheld from them. But even then, many of these monkeys can never be returned to the wild they were taken from due to their inability to fit in with wild monkeys. The psychological damage many primates face  means they could never survive in the wild.\r\n\r\nJoin me and various UK organisations in calling for a complete ban on the primate pet trade",
        "background": "More than 5000 primates including cappuchins and squirrel monkeys, are currently being kept privately as pets in the UK. Being subject to abhorrent conditions, unable to meet their basic physical, social and psychological needs, the primates are forced to live a life they'd rather not live.",
