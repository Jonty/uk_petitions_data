        "additional_details": "In  parts of Europe silent fireworks are used increasinlgy to protect pets, livestock and wildlife.  Collecchio, Italy, passed a law in 2015 that all fireworks displays must be quiet.\r\n The World Health Organization lists 120 decibels as the pain threshold for sound, including sharp sounds such as thunderclaps. Fireworks are louder than that and can lead to hearing loss..\r\nAnimals fleeing from fireworks often get lost, injured or killed. Noisy fireworks are not as colourful as silent ones.",
        "background": "Firework bangs terrify pets, farm animals, wildlife and young children. For hours on firework night, the weeks before and after and at dozens of other events all year.  The British Fireworks Association says restricting sale and use would increase illegal activity. Silent fireworks are a compromise.",
