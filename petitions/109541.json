        "additional_details": "simply in place to force payment for drop off, arguments for monitoring people leaving cars via cctv in the official drop areas are countered with the systems currently used to fine cars parking in the red zone just use similar systems to monitor the road, they dont seem to care about the passengers walking alone very late at night on the roads from the terminal to reach the car waiting to collect them who has had to park a long way from the terminal to avoid paying the inflated parking charges",
        "background": "claimed as needed due to security issues on the road leading to the airport (a dual carriageway) a red zone with no stopping with automatic penalty but the potential threat can use the quick drop area before getting onto a flight wont the same potential threat still get into the airport either way?",
