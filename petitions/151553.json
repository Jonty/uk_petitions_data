        "action": "Allow students at secondary school to participate in national votes.",
        "additional_details": "An example of this would be the EU Referendum. By this we mean that the outcome of the vote would affect the future of students under the age of 18 more than anyone else's yet they were not allowed to vote and were expected to just deal with the outcome without any say in the matter. Although there are many good reasons why under 18's shouldn't be allowed to vote, there are many more as to why they should, e.g. it affects them too, they deserve a say in their future, they should be heard... ",
        "background": "We accept that there may not be an argument to lower the age to vote but in cases such as referendums, the argument is fundamentally different. In national votes, the impact of the result is far greater on the young, which adds credence to maximising younger voters able to participate.",
