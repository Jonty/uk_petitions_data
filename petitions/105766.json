        "additional_details": "Condoms issued from government run/funded GUM clinics that would usually have plain wrappers would include facts/statistics on STI's and their spread. Over 200,000 people tested positive for chlamydia alone in 2013 in the UK. 7/10 of these people were under 25. A simple implementation like this keeps sexually active people aware and informed, and makes them think twice before engaging in risky sexual behavior, aswell as encouraging sexually active people to constantly have sexual health checks.",
        "background": "We believe this simple implementation will encourage people to be more aware and conscious of their sexual health. Things like STD Symptoms, statistics about STDs and their spread, and reminders of how often sexually active individuals should get sexual health checks. ",
