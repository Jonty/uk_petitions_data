        "additional_details": "Many people actively avoid animals products in their food, clothing and goods, either for ethical reasons, religious reasons or personal choice. As consumers we have a choice not to buy products that contain animal products and can find alternatives or simply live without.\r\n\r\nWe can't avoid handling money, especially people who work in money handling positions. Please review the production method and find an alternative that does not harm animals so that money can handled by the whole community.",
        "background": "The new \u00a35 note is made from a polymer pellet from which the base substrate is made contains a trace of a substance known as Tallow. Tallow is derived from animal fats (suet).\r\n\r\nThis makes the note unsuitable for Vegans and therefore we would like an alternative that does not discriminate.",
