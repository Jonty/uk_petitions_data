        "additional_details": "A single person living on their own should Not have to pay the same as a Family of Five Six or More, it is a Loophole and unfair, the Law needs updating as when Rooms are added the Council Must be informed and their Council Tax increased as Appropriate and makes the system fair for All, should be Equal Rights.\r\n\r\nHave got a complete list for a road which everyone pays the same from a Two Bed to a Six Bed, very wrong, let's have it fair.",
        "background": "At this time people pay the same amount from a Two Bed to a Six, this is unfair as a Two Bed does Not Create the same Waste as a Three/Four/Five or Six plus, many properties do extensions adding extra Bedrooms without the Councils knowing, Loft Bedrooms added, Brick Sheds made into a Bedroom etc.",
