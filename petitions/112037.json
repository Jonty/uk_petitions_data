        "additional_details": "Removal of 1p and 2p coins could save the Royal Mint a sizeable chunk of money, which could then be allocated to more important areas of the government's budget.\r\n\r\nA \u201crounding system\u201d could easily counteract the removal of the coins, which rounds the total value of a purchase (after taxes have been applied) up or down to the nearest five. A system similar to this has already been implemented in Canada and New Zealand, and seems to be a success.",
        "background": "I think that the abolishment of 1p and 2p coins from circulation and\r\nproduction and the use of a \u201crounding system\u201d to counteract the removal of 1p and 2p coins could save the UK a substantial amount on a yearly basis, as well as making it easier for consumers and business owners to handle money.",
