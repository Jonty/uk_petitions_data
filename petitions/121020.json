        "additional_details": "I had a PE 2 years ago & started taking anticoagulants, It was unknown if the PE had formed after an emergency C-Sec or due to a condition I have called Lupus, which is an auto immune disease. Due to Lupus my blood is not able to clot as fast as others. Weekly INR blood tests take their toll. 2 years on my veins are collapsing and serverly scarred. With a home tester this stops all the invasive tests, would cease costs of travel & hospital/GPS time. Like many others, get back to a normal life!",
        "background": "Giving patients who take anticoagulants long term be granted an option to self-monitor at home with an INR blood tester. If we can test at home it can avoid the\u00a0anxiety\u00a0and disruption involved in going to hospital/GP, time involved with waiting for your appointments & the cost of transport/fuel.",
