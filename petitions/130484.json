        "action": "Allow the ownership of handguns in the UK",
        "additional_details": "I believe we should be allowed to own handguns for sporting purposes in the UK. Criminals do not buy guns legally so banning legal gun owners form owning handguns does not reduce crime but instead restricts certain areas of the sport of shooting and this is unfair and NEEDS to end. It is time for all gun owners to unite as one to deal with this problem and get are rights back weather you want a handgun or not. Soon they will push to ban all guns, so we must make the first move to prevent this.",
        "background": "I am a young shooter and I take great pride in my sport, however I am saddened to see I have had my rights restricted due to the actions of a few and I am fed up of being blamed for the acts of terror committed which does not involve gun owners in any way.
