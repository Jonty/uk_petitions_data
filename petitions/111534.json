        "additional_details": "Frustratingly, the exotic pet trade is still legal in the UK. As it is legal, there is very little that sanctuaries and well meaning bystanders can do to help the situation. Experts agree that at least 1 in 3 reptiles harbours salmonella and shigella.

        "background": "According to Gov UK, you can legally apply for a license to keep wild animals as pets. Whilst the idea of having your own pet monkey may seem thrilling, it comes with a mountain of unnecessary risks for you, your pet and for the environment. ",
