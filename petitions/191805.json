        "additional_details": "The communication around the impending legislation change has been extremely poor and many organisations have subsequently lost huge swathes of experienced resources critical to sucessful delivery. Furthermore the legislation is seen as unecessarily punitive on limted companies who provide knowledge skills and expertise.  HMRC are seeking to differentiate these companies by terming them Personal Service Companies (a term which has no basis in law) and to punitively discriminate against them.",
        "background": "On April 5th 2017 HMRC will reform the intermediaries legislation in Chapter 8 Part 2 Income Taxes (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (\u201cITEPA 2003\u201d) often known as IR35. The impending arrival of this clumsy legislation has already introduced huge risk and budget overuns into.public sector projects.",
