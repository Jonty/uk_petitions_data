        "action": "Abolish the Vagrancy Act 1824",
        "additional_details": "The act is still in use by most police forces, with some such as Merseyside and West Midlands police forces arresting over one hundred people a year on vagrancy offenses. Many end up serving prison sentences for non-payment of fines. This means that as well as being cruel and inhumane the act is also a waste of money which could be redirected to support. (Court, police, prison costs and fines which will never be paid!)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thepavement.org.uk/stories.php?story=1028 (more info)",
        "background": "The Vagrancy Act 1824 is a pre Victorian piece of legislation which allows for the arrest of rough sleepers and beggars. This criminalizes homeless people with complex needs who need access to proper support, not a criminal charge and a fine/prison term for non-payment of these fines.",
