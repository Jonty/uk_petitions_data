        "additional_details": "With the news that Facebook allows 20 days bereavement leave (http://bbc.in/2kYZd1J), I'm reminded of when my mother died and I was forced to use my holiday entitlement to grieve and take care of practical matters.\r\n\r\nMedia coverage shows I'm not alone in experiencing this (http://bbc.in/1gGBED7) and it highlights a dire lack of protection for workers' mental well-being, which should be a main consideration of the state and employers.\r\n\r\nI suggest a min. 5 days paid leave. Small businesses exempt.",
        "background": "Losing a loved one is traumatic, stressful & demanding, but there is no legal requirement for employers to provide paid bereavement leave.\r\n\r\nThis means employers can force people to immediately return to work or go unpaid/use their holiday, which is unacceptable & counter-productive for well-being.",
