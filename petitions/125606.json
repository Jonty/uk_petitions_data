        "additional_details": "At lunchtime on 23rd March 2016, during Prime Ministers Questions, Black Rod, the official with responsibility for the parliamentary estates and security, ordered reporters not to take or tweet photos of a protest in the Central Lobby of the Palace of Westminster. \r\n\r\nThe BBC\u2019s Norman Smith, who has permission to broadcast from the central lobby, was ordered by the authorities to stop filming mid-broadcast.\r\n\r\nhttp://tinyurl.com/BlackRodVideo\r\n\r\nThe democratic process must not be subject to censorship",
        "background": "Under present rules, only authorised photography is allowed. \r\n\r\nThe UK is fortunate to have one of the world\u2019s great public service broadcasters, not a state broadcaster. As such it is the role of government to allow public scrutiny of interactions and protests, even those critical of the state.",
