        "additional_details": "A carer needs to look after someone for a minimum 35 hours a week, in order, to receive Carers Allowance of \u00a362.10, that`s just \u00a31.78 an hour or less which is far below the National Living Wage and has not been increased the way pensions have.\r\n\r\nWith the effect of Austerity policies meaning that financial support for carers in the form of Council Tax and Housing benefit having been slashed we are now struggling to survive and we're forced back into part-time work to survive.\r\n\r\nWe need action now.",
        "background": "According to a recent survey, carried out by the Carers Trust, caring for sick and/or disabled family members is taking its toll on the health of the nations unpaid carers.\r\n\r\nThis is going to lead to a care crisis in this country as well as be a massive drain on the NHS.",
