        "action": "Government must confirm no EU nationals residing here legally will be deported.",
        "additional_details": "The misunderstanding and uncertainty is already leading to incidents of bitterness and racism. Examples are schoolchildren telling their European peers that \u201cthey\u2019re not going to be here next term\u201d and anti-EU-immigrant graffiti being daubed on walls. Please can the government make a statement to nip this worrying trend in the bud, before it develops into more serious social problems. Regardless of how immigration is controlled in future we need to reassure and reaffirm our present society.",
        "background": "The referendum has created concern among EU citizens and their families living and working in the UK that they may be deported in future. The small-minded have also seized upon this uncertainty in order to worsen the lives of others. People must therefore be reassured deportations will not occur. ",
