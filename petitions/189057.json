We are therefore not sure what further action you would like the UK Government to take. \r\n\r\nThe Minister said: \r\n\r\n\"I want to take the opportunity to apologise unreservedly, on behalf of the Government, to all those men who will receive a pardon. The legislation under which they were convicted and cautioned was discriminatory and homophobic. I want to make sure that all who were criminalised in this way and had to suffer society\u2019s opprobrium, and the many more who lived in fear of being so criminalised because they were being treated in a very different way from heterosexual couples, actually understand that we offer this full apology. Their treatment was entirely unfair. What happened to these men is a matter of the greatest regret, and it should be so to all of us. I am sure it is to Members across the House. For this, we are today deeply sorry.\" \r\n\r\nYou can read the apology in Hansard: https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2017-01-10/debates/7D8B82A3-533A-4D1A-832F-B87CF36566EB/PolicingAndCrimeBill#contribution-EF3FA206-9250-4AA9-8FBA-1A382A6EE456 \r\n"
