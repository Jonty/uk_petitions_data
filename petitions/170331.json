        "additional_details": "Unfortunately, because cats are not included in this law, there are currently no legal consequences if a cat is run over: the driver can just drive away. This petition is to change the law so that it applies equally to cats and dogs. It brings clarity to drivers, helps the cat owner understand what happened in the accident, and informs the police so that they can determine whether the accident was simply that, a very sad accident, or caused by careless or dangerous driving.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "If a driver runs over a dog then by law they must:\r\nStop, give their name and address to the owner or the person in charge of the dog (if the driver is not the car owner then the driver must supply the owner\u2019s details), and provide details, etc, of the vehicle by way of identification.",
