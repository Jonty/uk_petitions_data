Teachers and parents are opposed to the eventual privatisation of our schools, and constant meddling in our education system. Academies are no more successful than local authority schools. Parents need to have a say in this matter, and not just at the ballot box, when it will be too late. ",

I propose that parents of school children should be consulted or given a vote on this issue. ",
