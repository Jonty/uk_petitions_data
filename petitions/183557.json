        "additional_details": "The NHS is the best in the world and free at point of service and should continue to remain so.\r\n\r\nThis will benefit both the patient, who will no longer be presented with a bill from the hospital when they are still recuperating, should they require medical treatment. Plus also avoid the situation where hospital staff must operate as debt collectors, chasing patients to pay outstanding bills that are unlikely to be paid.\r\nAny money raised should also be ring-fenced to remain in the NHS.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "A requirement for visitors to have sufficient health insurance covering their stay in the UK, avoiding \u2018health tourism\u2019 on the NHS. \r\nFor countries where a visa is a requirement to enter the UK sufficient  insurance must also be provided, as is the case for UK nationals travelling overseas.
