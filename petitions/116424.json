Whilst no specific research has been undertaken in relation to the above, the issues raised are, essentially, either a matter of public media record or otherwise represent a considered logical progression. \r\n\r\nOf great concern is also the likelihood of personal injury due to distraction or drone crash, the use of video footage obtained, and the incursion into an individual's life.",
        "background": "Hobby drones are not licensed,but piloted by individuals without training,whom mainly lack common sense,or else show disregard for Public safety.At times of high terror threat,a major incident is likely. Otherwise, any personal injury caused will leave the person without redress/access to justice.",
