        "additional_details": "Recent tube strikes caused extreme distress and inconvenience to lives of millions of Londoners, paralysed the transport in the city and seriously damaged London's reputation. 80,000 union workers disrupted lives of millions, causing million dollar loses to business. ",
        "background": "Right to strike has been excessively used, setting a dangerous precedent for other key workers and bringing UK back in time (to times before Margaret Thatcher). The unions should seek an independent court arbitrage instead of announcing numerous strikes.",
