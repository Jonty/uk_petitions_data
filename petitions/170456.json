        "additional_details": "The recent article from uSwitch.com, ( http://tinyurl.com/z2w83bh ), highlights that those seeking to save money by opting for third party only or third party fire and theft cover, are actually being charged more than for comprehensive cover. As motor insurance is a legal requirement, it is felt that insurance companies should be both transparent and accountable for their pricing structures, for such a economically vital, social utility as motor insurance, so that consumers are treated fairly.",
        "background": "Motor insurance is a legal requirement and a social utility, but the transparency in policy pricing and post inception activities of insurers in recent years, is disadvantaging consumers and was not addressed in the Competitions and Markets Authority's investigate of 2013/14.
