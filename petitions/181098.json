        "additional_details": "This would not be going against the result of the referendum, but would simply allow for Parliament to have the information it needs to properly consider its position and its options and whether a future vote on a proposed deal will be truly meaningful.\r\n\r\nThose advocating leaving the EU have waited years for this moment. Waiting a little longer for Parliament to have the information required to consider its options is in the interests of our democracy.",
        "background": "The question as to whether notice under art.50 can be revoked once issued remains open, however a definitive answer to this question would be useful to allow MPs to make constructive decisions on the exit process.\r\n\r\nA case currently before the High Court in Ireland is addressing this very question.",
