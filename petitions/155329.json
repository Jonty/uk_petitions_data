        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned suggest that people refer to the horrific facts shown in the RoSPA July 2015 \"Drinking and Driving\" report to see that even just 1 accident, injury or even death is too many. A reform of the law should be considered to lower the limit or introduce a zero tolerance on the matter. Thus to save the lives of countless people horrifically torn away from their families in such awful circumstances.  ",
        "background": "Every year, over 250 people are killed on UK roads and over 7,000 casualties from drink driving. In 2013, 683,651 roadside breath tests were carried out by the police, which 71,675 drivers\r\nor riders failed or refused to take the test. Many of these are due to people driving the morning after.
