        "additional_details": "Many teenagers apply to university even though they have no idea what they want to study or whether they even want to go, but they still apply because their teachers and mentors expect them to. Unexplained to 16 to 18 year olds, there are many more options than university in this country and I believe that if there was a career adviser in every sixth form college to talk to students about them, they would choose their next step after higher education with a clearer goal in mind. ",
        "background": "Between the ages of 16 and 18 you are expected to know what you want to do with your life after your time at college, but as a hormonal confused teenager, you can easily make a detrimental decision that effects your chances of being happy with your educational and career outcome in the future.",
