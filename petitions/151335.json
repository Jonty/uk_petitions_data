        "additional_details": "The results of the referendum are too close. 1/3 want to stay, 1/3 want to leave, 1/3 didn't vote. \r\nCameron said he would not resign and that he would invoke Article 50 immediately, which he hasn't done.\r\nThe leave campaign has backtracked on diverting EU funds to the NHS, which many Leavers supported.\r\nThe vote has expressed serious concern about immigration.\r\nThe impact of the vote is already affecting markets, job certainty, value of stirling.\r\nThe vote could split the UK and the EU.\r\n",
        "background": "Brexit: Plan B\r\nThe EU referendum was not binding and things have changed since the vote on 24 June.  I propose that Parliament debates invoking Article 50 with a motion to have a free vote on leaving the EU and negotiating change in the EU for the benefit of all member nations.",
