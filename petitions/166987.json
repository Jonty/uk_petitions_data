        "action": "Review the Council Tax system so that it reflects individual contributions",
        "additional_details": "Tax should be paid on individual bases and proportional to each person burden to the local authority - Should 2 pensionnaires household pay same council tax as a family of 5? Should a single working professional pay towards services it does not currently use?\r\nAlso with property valuation completely changed from 25 years ago - should household taxation still be considered an option? \r\nOn top of that local councils have constantly risen tax/year and discrepancies between boroughs are huge.",
        "background": "I believe that the current Council Tax system is outdated and unfair - taxing households rather than individuals - Why should single households pay almost as much as a 5 occupancy household, why should a property worth millions pay same as a council flat?\r\n",
