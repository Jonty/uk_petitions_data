        "additional_details": "In a letter from Edward Timpson MP dated 5-11-15, he states that section 68, Education & Skills Act 2008 requires local authorities to make available support that will encourage & assist the participation young people in education or training up to the age 19. \r\nWithout an EHCP there is no transition into post 16 education, LEAs are not made accountable for those unable to attend education or work as an apprentice. LEAs must be held accountable to provide education and/or apprenticeship for all.",
        "background": "The age of participation is 18 but for those with chronic conditions such as PoTS, CFS/ME, EDS there is no funding for home tution. If they fail their GCSEs they are unable to retake, there is not the provision to do A Levels at home. Few have an EHCP as it is considered health not education. ",
