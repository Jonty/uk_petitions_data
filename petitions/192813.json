I believe it's morally wrong to disregard those who didn't vote as they form a considerable proportion of the Great British public (27.8% of us in fact).\r\n\r\nBy including the non-voters we get a very different result in which only 37.44% voted to leave.  The rest of us, 62.56%, voted to remain or keep things as they are.\r\n\r\nMake the Government hear your will now.  Will you stay?",
        "background": "Dear Fellow British Citizens,\r\n\r\nWe have been told that a majority of the electorate voted for Brexit.  In truth, just over a third (37.44%) voted to leave and many now regret it. 12.9 million of you didn't vote at all!\r\n\r\nStand up now and be heard.  Sign this petition to demonstrate your will!",
