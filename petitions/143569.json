        "additional_details": "The BBC has become too big & disconnected with the public that is forced to pay for its services regardless of its quality, content of its programming and reporting. As a nation we are forced to pay for a service that no longer wishes to report fact from an unbiased, neutral stance but wishes to influence & impose its views. I no longer wish to pay for a service that wishes to alter my political and social views & would like the ability to voluntarily pay for the service should I wish to do so.",
        "background": "The BBC has become a biased left wing London centric organisation, no longer happy just reporting the news, but now distorting news reports and programmes with a left wing biased view.",
