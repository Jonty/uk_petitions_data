        "additional_details": "The narrow Leave victory was fouled by \"dishonesty...on an industrial scale\" which preyed upon uncertain voters and misrepresented key facts. Such conclusion was reached by a professor of European Law at Liverpool University, who has spent his entire career studying EU law as it relates to the UK. The public should watch his 24 minute lecture for informed and rigorous information about access to the single market, the existing evidence base for the benefits of EU membership and much more.",
        "background": "The invoking of Article 50 should not happen, unless and until the public fully understand its real consequences. It deserves a second referendum, upon the appointment of the new Prime Minister, to verify whether public sentiment has substantially shifted, and to ratify the decision (or not). ",
