        "action": "Redirect funds from accommodation of increasing road traffic to its reduction",
        "additional_details": "Electric bullet trains currently operational in parts of Asia are cheap, fast, eco-friendly and efficient. In the UK, infrastructure is an embarrassment which costs our pockets and the environment dearly. \r\n\r\nWith investment in mass infrastructure development, we no longer allow the urgent concerns over CO2 emissions to be in the hands of time-restricted car consumers and money-hungry suppliers and, instead, raise this issue to the level of a national emergency.",
        "background": "Road traffic in the UK, similarly to many other countries around the world, is drastically increasing and causing irreparable global damage. We need to redirect funding of roadworks which seek to accommodate the increase, to funding of mass infrastructure allowing people cheap and efficient travel.",
