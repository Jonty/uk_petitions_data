        "action": "Ask the Queen to veto the result of the referendum and order a rerun with facts",
        "additional_details": "I am referring to the public retractions and distancing of mainstream Brexit and Leave campaigners from their core assertions that they would spend \u00a3350M per week on the NHS and that they would be able to stop immigration from the EU.  These were central claims advertised widely and caused many people to vote against their interests, and were retracted almost immediately.  An independent commission should be tasked with compiling facts and a rerun ordered.",
        "background": "Given the existential threat to the UK as a consequence of a highly misleading campaign from the Brexit and Leave campaigns, combined with wide-scale remorse on behalf of Brexit voters.  I would like to suggest that a rerun with enforced fact-checking be ordered/suggested by the Queen soon.",
