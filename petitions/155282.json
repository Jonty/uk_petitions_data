Parliament's duty is to ensure the UK is not wrecked by this freak event. Parliament must lead not follow. The majority of parliamentarians, from all main parties, oppose Brexit but are unable to address it unless and until a Government of National Unity is formed. ",
        "background": "As matters stand the next PM will be appointed by the members of the Tory party, those that created this disaster. Mr Corbyn's refusal to go shackles the opposition.  The UK drifts leaderless whilst catastrophe looms. A Unity Government, the PM appointed by Parliament, is the only solution.",
