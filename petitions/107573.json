        "action": "Consider building a MP's apartment complex in London to save taxpayers money",
        "additional_details": "At the moment the Government allows MP's to claim a maximum of \u00a3150 a night for hotels in the capital if all 650 MPS used the maximum allowance just 16 times a month the bill would come to an astonishing \u00a31.57million a month for the British tax payer. If the Government was to build a complex for MP's there would be no need for rent expenses and over the years the tax payer would make a huge saving which could then be invested on the vulnerable in society.",
        "background": "Taxpayers currently pay for MP's housing in London through MP's expenses. If the Government were to invest in building a apartment building solely for MP's and other government officials this would save the tax payer money in the long run and would stop abuse of expenses through Rent.
