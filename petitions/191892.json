        "additional_details": "Currently pet insurance Co. can word polices in a way that leaves you believing your pet is covered for anything. This causes numerous failed claims; people getting into debt; animals not getting the treatment that they need; animals being abandoned and leaves many pets without cover as people have lost faith in the insurance companies. \r\n\r\nCurrently only 1 in 4 dog owners and 1 in 7 Cat owners have pet insurance\r\n\r\nThe polices need to be clear, the cover fair and these need to be the same for all\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "E.g.:Policy 1 Illness & Accident, Policy 2 3rd Party, Policy 3 Fully Comp \r\n\r\nMaking claims, the amount of cover & the policies themselves should be the same across the board. Insurance co. can still charge differing amounts depending on the animal but people will know what is covered from day 1\r\n",
