This is unfair. If the system is so poorly designed that large numbers are having to appeal only to win their case then it is fair that the claimants should continue to receive benefits while waiting for an inadequate system to catch up. Even when an appeal is won no compensation for extra cost is awarded so penalizing the applicant ",
