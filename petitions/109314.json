            "details": "The family Immigration Rules implemented in July 2012 require non-European Economic Area national adult dependants, including parents and grandparents, to demonstrate that they require a level of long-term personal care that can only be provided in the UK by their sponsor here.  The route now provides for those most in need of care, but not for those who would simply prefer to live in the UK, given the significant NHS and social care costs to which these cases can give rise.  Adult relatives can continue to visit a family member in the UK for up to six months but must return home at the end of their visit. \r\n\r\nThe new rules do not provide a route for every parent to join their adult child in the UK and settle here and it is not intended that they should do so.  The new rules represent a fairer deal for the taxpayer, given the significant NHS and social care costs which can arise when adult dependent relatives settle in the UK, notwithstanding the required sponsor\u2019s 5-year undertaking to maintain, accommodate and care for the relative without recourse to welfare benefits or social housing.  \r\n\r\nThe rights of EU nationals to live and work in other EU countries, and to be accompanied by their non-EEA national family members, are set out in the Free Movement Directive by which all EU Member States are bound.  The free movement rights of EU nationals are not unlimited.  Those who wish to live in the UK for longer than three months must be exercising a Treaty right as a worker, a self-employed person, a self-sufficient person or a student.  Where EU nationals do not meet one of these requirements, they will not have a right to reside in the UK and may be liable to removal.  We will not tolerate abuse of the Free Movement Directive: identifying and tackling abuse of free movement rights is a priority.\r\n\r\nHome Office",
