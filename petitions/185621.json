        "additional_details": "Since the Chancellor reduced VED in 2001 for cars with low CO2 emissions, and the scrappage scheme of 2009, the UK public were encouraged to buy \u2018cleaner diesels\u2019.\r\n\r\nIn 2015 Lord Drayson said that Government \"made a mistake\" in encouraging diesel ownership.\r\n\r\nWe need these vehicles off our roads, but well-intentioned current owners were badly misled by the Government, and will suffer financially, being unable to sell their vehicles, or use them freely due to proposals to limit their use.",
        "background": "From 2001-2015 the UK public were encouraged by Government to buy diesel cars as they were better for the environment.\r\nNow, those cars might be banned because of an estimated 23,500 premature deaths a year.\r\nA scrappage scheme would protect health & compensate well-meaning owners who were misled.",
