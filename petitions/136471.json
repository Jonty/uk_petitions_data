        "additional_details": "These Directives actively reduce pollution, monitor it and help reduce. At the same time it protects wildlife, it would be a backward step for the UK not to monitor and actively take part in these directives. The environment is something we should all treasure and it does not respect boundaries as we do. We must work with the EU to make this work even though we have voted out. \r\nIt is important that fishing quotas remain to protect the future of our fish and seas, or soon there will be no fish. ",
        "background": "The UK was bound under EU law to protect the marine and terrestrial environment, this could be threatened due to the referendum. The Water Framework Directive, Habitat Directive, Marine Litter Directive and Bird Directive, all protected these environments. It is important we still follow these.",
