        "additional_details": "You should all be ashamed of yourselves, act like MPs, not Julius Caesar's murderous senators.\r\n\r\nThe referendum was neither fare, democratic or representative of the wishes of the British people.\r\n\r\nWe need you to immediately try to force a no confidence vote in this government to stop them making things even worse.\r\n\r\nLeaving the EU is not in the best interests of our country or peoples, and both Houses should attempt block any legislation to exit the EU until after a general election.\r\n",
        "background": "Instead of acting in the best interests of the country, you immediately used the opportunity to attack the democratically elected leader of the Labour party, to further your own selfish political ambitions.  He is probably the only person who is actually fairly blameless in this whole BREXIT mess!",
