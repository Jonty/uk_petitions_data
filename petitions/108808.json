        "additional_details": "On the 16th September 2015 Jeremy Corbyn famously read out emails from the public for the Prime Minister to answer during PMQs. This was well received by the pubic, evident in the 40,000 entries, and also among members of the House of Commons, including David Cameron himself. This proposal takes a step further, suggesting the public have a direct voice and the opportunity to exercise their power every week during PMQs, via an official website. A truly revolutionary democratic adjustment.",
        "background": "Currently, Prime Ministers Questions does a disservice to the public. Change is needed. This is a proposal for the government to set up an official, regularly monitored website in which any British Citizen or UK resident can put forward questions for PMQs, of which a minimum of 5 must be selected.",
