        "additional_details": "It is important to state that we are already recieving fluoride within our toothpaste. So why would we need to be drinking it? \r\nFluorosis is a known condition and can even result in permanent discolouration of the teeth which is a potential contradiction to the original basis for this mass medication. \r\n\r\nIf we want fluoride we can add it ourselves.\r\n\r\nhttp://fluoridealert.org/issues/health\r\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11430233/The-extent-of-water-fluoridation-in-the-UK.html",
        "background": "Fluoride is an industrial poison, and the reason for it's introduction into our water supply was allegedly to reduce tooth decay. But this toxic substance is widely considered to be more toxic than lead, and we are ingesting this daily through our valuable drinking water. We are not given a choice. ",
