Eg: The extremely childish attack on Donald Trump \"the danger of working with children and animals\" spoken TO THE EAGLE to imply that Trump is an animal. \r\n\r\n4) Loaded questions such as \"This is a terrible thing to say, isn't it\" instead of \"Please tell us what has happened\"\r\n\r\n...... ... ...\r\n",
