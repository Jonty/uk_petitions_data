        "additional_details": "Firstly we do not know if it will work! There is no working version to base a decision on. What if in 8 years we find it doesn't? We will have a serious problem.\r\n\r\nSecond, EDF will come under huge pressure to make it work and make it work by 2025, what short cuts might they be tempted to perform as a consequence?\r\n\r\nFinally, the world political scene is unclear for the next 5 years let alone 30+ years, we simply should not put the energy production for our country in the hands of other countries.\r\n",
        "background": "Call on Theresa May to scrap Hinkley C\r\n\r\nI have no in principle objection to nuclear power. Neither do I wish to comment on cost, no-one on the planet knows whether the strike price will be good bad or indifferent in 10, 20 or 30 years.\r\n",
