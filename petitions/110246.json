I have been married to a man who was not allowed into the UK for a minor mistake made on his visitor application in 2009 as a result he was banned from being with his wife and child in the UK. My life has been in turmoil since this time and to date I still haven't been able to gain any entry into the UK for my husband. Despite representation from barristers his appeal failed.  SIGN this petition and give my husband a chance to be a father to our daughter. Thank you.\r\n",
