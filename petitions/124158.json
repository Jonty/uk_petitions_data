        "action": "Provide textbook grants for all students in key stage 4 and above.",
        "additional_details": "As a student I have realised the burden of these costs; a single textbook is rarely the only material needed and additional workbooks and revision guides add to the mounting costs. The continually changing curriculum means most second hand textbooks are no longer fit for purpose forcing students to buy new. I believe the education gap between the wealthy and less so can be attributed to costs such as these, and providing a grant would help each young adult achieve their full capabilities.",
        "background": "For many students the high cost of basic curriculum textbooks means they cannot afford to access vital information needed to achieve their full potential. A single a-level physics textbook costs \u00a340 -which acts as a massive discriminatory burden on less wealthy students and families.",
