I wanted to appeal however, the threat of an increased penalty and possible court action forced me into accepting the 'lighter' punishment.\r\n\r\nThis needs to change so innocent motorists like myself are not used as a revenue generator. I genuinely feel robbed and it is not a nice feeling.\r\n\r\nOrdinary citizens and drivers cannot afford fancy and expensive Lawyers to make something like this 'go away.'\r\n\r\nThe law needs to change so motorists (past, present and future) who were forced into accepting the alleged offence (speeding and parking) in return for a lighter punishment  have a chance for a fair and an independent hearing.
