        "additional_details": "Every year 400 people die on UK roads in young driver accidents. 100,000 signatures could help save those precious lives.\r\nResearch shows that road safety messages are better absorbed by children in their early teens. Pilot studies in Europe show a 40% reduction in accidents for those who train at school. Independent UK research on pre-17 driving lessons shows pupils have 50% less accidents.\r\nWe don't want to change the driving age - only the age we start teaching children to drive safely.",
        "background": "We should train young people to understand road safety and hazard perception at a younger age. This lifesaving training should begin at school as a part of every child's curriculum.\r\nA quarter of all 15-19 year olds who die are killed in cars and a fifth crash within 6 months of passing their test.",
