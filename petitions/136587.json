        "additional_details": "Now  that  the  UK  has  voted to leave the EU, I believe it is in the\r\ncommon  interest  of  British people to have a comprehensive agreement with  the  EU  as  a  whole  rather than with each individual  country, agreement  that  would give us free trade and free movement, something we have so much enjoyed whilst being a part of the EU. EU has been our biggest  trade  partner (collectively) and will continue to be such in the future. This should become the #1 priority of the new UK government.",
        "background": "The  EU  has been the UK's largest trade partner for years. It will be\r\ndevastating for our economy to not be able to enjoy free trade with\r\nthe  EU  as  a  whole, should the UK actually leave the EU in the near\r\nfuture. Same goes for free movement of UK citizens in Europe",
