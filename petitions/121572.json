        "action": "Ban shorting of London AIM stocks,  including shorting by Market Makers",
        "additional_details": "The purpose of AIM is to support companies looking to grow steadily through investment, In turn creating jobs.\r\n\r\nLarge orchestrated shorting attacks aren't giving companies a fair chance in an already difficult market. \r\n\r\nSocial media and forums are often used during shorting, attempting to panic investors into selling, hence sending the price of the stock down further. \r\n\r\nOnly shorters and Market Makers benefit from this\r\n\r\nA simple explanation of shorting\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14510946",
        "background": "We believe that shorting stocks on the AIM is damaging to companies, private investors and to the economy. \r\n\r\nManipulating a share price with borrowed stock is detrimental. Stocks should rise and fall naturally based on fundamentals and any external interference, legal or not should be addressed.",
