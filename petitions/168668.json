        "additional_details": "Gatwick has the world's busiest single-use runway. It does have two runways on site but the close proximity of the two and the length and lack of guidance for the second means that only one is used. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_busiest_airport#Busiest_airports\r\nThe plan to expand Heathrow was supported by businesses, the aviation industry, the British Chambers of Commerce, the Confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress and the then Labour government. \r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37566361",
        "background": "Heathrow often runs at 98% capcity, and is the busiest two runway airport in the world.  Likewise Gatwick is the busiest single runway airport in the world.  The capacity is long overdue, and planes are circling both hubs emitting more CO2 than necessary. Build both runways as soon as possible.",
