        "action": "We call upon the government to immediately halt its assault on the Green Economy",
        "additional_details": "The incremental attack on sustainability has been done in the name of efficiency and the economy. What it really means is colder homes, higher energy bills, higher fuel poverty, higher costs to the NHS from excess cold amongst others. The country has a creaking energy supply and the poorest efficiency homes in Western Europe and the government has stepped back from tackling these issues. This is ultimately a case of the Government passing our problems on to our children and grandchildren.",
        "background": "Since coming to power in May the Conservative Government has methodically and callously undertaken an incremental attack on the sustainability in the UK which will leave the country less able to cope with future energy uncertainty, poorer quality homes and fuel poverty.  ",
