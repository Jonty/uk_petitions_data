        "additional_details": "Lets get this to parliament and give fathers the chance to be with their kids from the start. There are all these fathers who don't want to spend time with their kids and the ones who do can't. Lets change this for fathers and kids in the UK lets allow fathers to bond with their newborns. Please sign this petition. THANKS",
        "background": "Currently paternity leave is around \u00a3140 or 90% of your weekly income whichever is lower. Due to this fathers cant afford to take time off to be with a newborn or have to take annual leave. I myself just had a child and cant take paternity leave as I would be over \u00a3200 out of pocket each week. ",
