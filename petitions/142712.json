        "action": "Only a Prime Minister chosen by a general election may invoke Article 20 of TFEU",
        "additional_details": "Since the main leaders of both the remain and leave side came from one party, and the losing leader has resigned as PM, his successor will be elected by that same party, rather than the electorate. If that successor PM triggers Article 20, then they do so with no more democratic authority than any EU leader. It is now clear that Article 20 is not just about the EU, but the preservation of the Union. That is a matter for the electorate to decide by means of a general election.",
        "background": "The organisation of the referendum to leave Europe failed to anticipate that the differences in regional voting would threaten the present existence of the UK. That threat requires a general election to allow the electorate to chose which government they want to handle the referendum result. ",
