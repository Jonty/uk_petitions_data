The country is witnessing an increase in racist attacks. It is becoming increasingly clear that the Leave campaign won by deceit and is now rolling back its referendum promises. They have offered no clear plan of action. It is time to recognise the non-binding nature of the referendum and use its result to fight for positive change within the EU.\r\n",
        "background": "The referendum has yielded a fractured and divided country, it has harmed our economy, taken away opportunities for future generations, and damaged our international standing. We should use the referendum results to support a meaningful discussion about EU reform within the EU as a full member.\r\n",
