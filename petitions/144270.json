        "action": "Annulment of the EU referendum and decision by HM Government",
        "additional_details": "The result of this referendum, if taken forward, will bring negative consequences to everyone around the world, including those in the UK who were not allowed to express their opinion and should have been entitled to do so as tax payers, residents and on the electoral roll. Under the UK law on equality and diversity, this discrimination against non-British residents is unacceptable and on these grounds urge HM Government, as representative elected bodies to make the right decision for the UK.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, in our condition of European citizens permanently residing, working and paying taxes in the United Kingdom, plea to HM Government the annulment of EU referendum of June 23rd as the matter in discussion affects everyone living in the UK, not only those who were entitled to vote.",
