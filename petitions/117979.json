        "additional_details": "A side room that is available to people with a disability would benefit the person, it would speed up recovery and prevent long term stays. I feel i would make a quicker recovery if all equipment i.e ceiling hoist was available as waiting for hoists is very stressful. privacy and dignity is a huge thing for someone with a disability and having somewhere private is essential, I am arguing the case for people with complex disability and the side room would only be available on a priority basis.",
        "background": "I am 24 years old i have a physical condition called muscular dystrophy i have had numerous hospital admissions and found the experience of being on a ward difficult due to having this condition, I have to take a variety of equipment which included shower/toilet chair specalist respiratory equipment",
