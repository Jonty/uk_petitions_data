        "action": "Make working with electricity a criminal offence unless suitably fully qualified",
        "additional_details": "Electrical installations are at the forefront of keeping this Great Britain running and have some of the highest regulations in the world.However, due to short term courses too many so called \"competent persons\" are carrying installation work no matter how small which is not upto standard. We want to see stronger enforcement for the sale of goods only to FULLY qualified electricians with installation becoming an offence if you are not. Electricity is extremely dangerous & is not taken seriously.",
        "background": "Qualified Electricians demand stronger enforcement as to who can purchase goods and carry out electrical work. We undertake years of training for qualifications & accreditation for somebody to then carry out a 6 week course and become \"competent\". This is dangerous and an insult to our industry.",
