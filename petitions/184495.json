        "additional_details": "By spending half of what we have in foreign aid we are still spending proportionality more than the US however this money can be invested in respite centres, palliative care, community NHS workers, the possibilities are endless.\r\nIt is about time we as a country stood up and started looking after ourselves, let us be proud of our nation again & take care of our own interests. Invest in caring for our elderly & those who can't look after themselves. Be proud, Be British, be UNITED. ",
        "background": "For years this country has stood at the forefront of helping other countries by means of finance and physical aid. This has to stop, the NHS is at breaking point due to lack of elderly care out of hospital and adult mental health issues resulting on excess pressure on emergency services.",
