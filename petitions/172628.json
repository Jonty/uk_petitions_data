        "additional_details": "For a long time now we have had to watch as our national press have stirred hate among our society. Imagine how you would feel if, on waiting to find out if a loved one was hurt, you had to read brutal and graphic descriptions of what they may have been through. We have to come together and decide that enough is enough. Nobody facing the darkest hour of their life should be plunged further into darkness by being exposed to such brutal and insensitive 'journalism'.",
        "background": "Wednesday was a terrible day for Croydon, when a tram crashed at Sandilands and tragically took the lives of 7 people. During this time the loved ones of the victims had to read graphic details of the accident which were published before the victims were officially identified. This is unacceptable. ",
