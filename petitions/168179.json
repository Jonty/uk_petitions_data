        "additional_details": "The current care system fails both care workers and service users. I propose that HCAs have a banding system. Band 1 will be apprentice carers, paid the minimum wage, band 2 will be level 2 carers and be paid 25%+ above minimum wage, band 3 (senior) +50%, and band 4 (deputy/coordinator) +75%. I also propose band 1 cannot lone work until 6 months shadowing has been done. This will encourage training, ensuring the quality of care provided is of the standard it desperately needs to be!",
        "background": "The average care worker is paid the minimum wage give or take 5%, regardless of whether or not they have experience and qualifications. It is said to be unskilled, yet there are various care qualifications sought after by employers. Why? Because care work is a skilled job which requires training!",
