        "action": "Make employers offer bereavement leave following the death of a pet",
        "additional_details": "Academic studies repeatedly show that companion animal guardians (pet owners) consider their companion animals as family members (Voith, 1985). Consequently the grief following a pet's death carries the same psychological and physical problems that occur when a significant human dies (Gerwolls & Labott, 1994). Employment rights recognise the need for a period of bereavement leave following the death of a human dependent but no formalised equivalent is afforded following the loss of a pet.",
        "background": "The loss of a pet is a traumatic experience with research showing that the death of a companion animal is \"just as devastating as the loss of a human significant other\" (Planchon et al, 2002: 94). Yet Employment rights do not currently recognise the loss of a pet in terms of bereavement leave.",
