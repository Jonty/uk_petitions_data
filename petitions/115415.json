        "additional_details": "A woman who has worked from the age of 15 and retired at 61, currently receives less that the proposed full state pension and will continue to do so. A serviceman retired after serving 27 years  will need to work an additional 35 years in order to qualify for the full state pension due to the military pension being contracted out. The scheme discriminates against those already retired who have worked more than 35 years and those who have or are currently paying into a works or private pension.",
        "background": "It is unfair to people who have already retired or who currently invest in a savings plan. Many of these people have worked longer than the 35 years stated in the plan or would need to work longer to receive the full state pension amount.",
