        "action": "Set up an inquiry into the impact of press reporting on the Brexit vote",
        "additional_details": "Just like the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war and the potential manipulation of public opinion through the media, we need a similar inquiry about whether any actors had vested interest in a Brexit and if so, whether they did take any steps to manipulate public opinion in an unacceptable, illegal manner by impacting press reporting on Brexit.",
        "background": "A referendum such as on Brexit relies on informed decision making by the public. It is understandable that each side will represent their position in the best light possible. But we need to understand if any persons manipulated public opinion through press reporting beyond the legally acceptable.",
