        "additional_details": "When signing up for a driving licence, we are asked if we would like to join the organ donor register - most 17 year old are asked the question. They could also be provisionally registered to vote at this time with an 'opt out' clause here.\r\nRegistration for further licences, e.g. HGVs, could prompt the same option.\r\nInteraction with other government agencies could offer scope for a similar opt out option arrangement - e.g. student loans, pensions, benefits, HMRC\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "In the past few days, people have struggled to register to vote at the 'last minute' - an hour before closing. Every citizen over 18 has the right to do so. We should not be putting an arbitrary barrier in the way and should be making it as easy as possible to register to vote.",
