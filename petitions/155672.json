        "action": "Hold a referendum on the terms of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU",
        "additional_details": "The referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the EU was held before the terms of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU were known. Therefore voters were asked whether they wished to leave or remain in the EU without having important facts available to them. The terms negotiated may, or may not, be beneficial to the UK, for example, in relation to employment rights, jobs, exports and economic growth. Therefore there should be a referendum on the final terms of exit from the EU.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call upon HM Government to hold a referendum giving electors the choice of either accepting the terms negotiated for the UK\u2019s exit from the EU or remaining a member of the EU.",
