        "additional_details": "A shop with a lower rateable value can have sometimes free business rates. They could be selling thousands of pounds worth of items everyday.  A premesis that is on the larger side may only be taking hundreds of\r\npounds a day and has to pay an astronomical business rate as their premesis is larger how is this fair, surely a business is a business and everyone should contribute which would lower the rates for all. Rates should be worked out on your Profit not your square meterage or takings.",
        "background": "The new increase that has been brought in on business rates is crippling small towns. I am the owner of a buisness in a small town in North Wales. My business rates have now increased \u00a3300 a month due to my new rateable value. The system is unfair.",
