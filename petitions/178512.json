        "additional_details": "The Crystal Palace was first constructed in 1851 in Hyde Park for the Great Exhibition, which showcased new technology from the Industrial Revolution. It was moved to the Sydenham/Penge area in 1854 and opened by Queen Victoria.  \r\n\r\nAs an attraction the Crystal Palace showcased a wide variety of festivals and events.  Reconstructing the Palace would be a fantastic opportunity to reinvigorate the area as a cultural hub and return a part of our history that should never have been lost.",
        "background": "The Crystal Palace was an impressive architectural feat with a design that was arguably ahead of its time.  This impressive piece of Victorian heritage was cruelly destroyed by fire in 1936, depriving too many from ever having seen it in all it's glory.  Please re-build this long lost treasure.",
