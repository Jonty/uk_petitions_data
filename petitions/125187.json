Should evidence be needed, it could  be provided after going through the appropriate channels so as not to breach the confidentially of the individuals that I support and only to those on a need to know basis, with the assurance that it would not be disclosed to any other individual and furthermore because it could affect real change",
        "background": "I run a home for people with learning disabilities. They are vulnerable people who are unable to work because of their disabilities. They are unable to live at home, but need support to live in the community. If their benefits are cut much further, they may no longer be able to be supported to do so",
