        "additional_details": "Every motion should have the option of a positive or negative vote as demonstrated by the recent Donald Trump issue where much press coverage was given to the \u2018Ban Trump\u2019 motion in contrast to the \u2018Don\u2019t ban Trump\u2019 motion which was almost unknown due to minimal coverage.  \r\n\r\nWhilst the e-petition system should enable members of parliament gain better understanding of the public opinion they are representing, it is fundamental that a conventional resilient and unbiased voting system be adopted.\r\n",
        "background": "In parliament it is customary to conclude a vote with ayes to the right and nos to the left. It is therefore remarkable that e-committee members have not followed established convention by introducing a flawed system vulnerable to distortion according to the relative publicity given to a motion.",
