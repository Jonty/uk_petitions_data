        "action": "Offer the British people a general election before the current PM leaves office",
        "additional_details": "The government over the coming years will be primarily focused on the withdrawal from the EU and reaching a new constitutional settlement within the UK. The process of \u2018leaving\u2019 will be prolonged and there is no consensus amongst the \u2018leavers\u2019 or 'remains' about how to proceed and the UK longer term future. Likewise, between the constituent parts of the U.K. Therefore, a general election to allow the public to provide a new mandate is not only required but essential for national unity.",
        "background": "The political and economic circumstance within the United Kingdom have materially and fundamentally changed as a result of the referendum result. Therefore the current government no longer has a mandate as their manifesto is no longer relevant and therefore should seek a new mandate immediately.",
