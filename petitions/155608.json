        "action": "Hold a general election on the resignation or removal of the Prime Minister",
        "additional_details": "The petition does not include the death of the Prime Minsiter since that might cause inappropriate incentives.  This general election should be interim and take place only if the resignation or removal happens more than 2 years before the next scheduled general election to allow for political parties to replace leaders in advance of a general election.  This might require the cooperation of MPs before an appropriate amendment to the Fixed-term Parliament Act 2011 could be enacted.",
        "background": "A change of Prime Minister as a result of resignation is strongly indicative of a significant change of the political direction of the government previously elected. It would be fundamentally undemocratic for the electorate to be denied the opportunity to choose an alternative political direction.",
