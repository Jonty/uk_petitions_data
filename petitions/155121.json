        "additional_details": "Another perceived benefit of the large turnout produced by compulsory voting is that it becomes more difficult for extremist or special interest groups to get themselves into power or to influence mainstream candidates. Also high levels of participation decreases the risk of political instability created by crises or charismatic but sectionally focused demagogues. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Compulsory voting systems can cover a high degree of political legitimacy because of the high voter turnout. The winning party truly represents a majority of the population, not just the politically motivated individuals who would vote without compulsion. ",
