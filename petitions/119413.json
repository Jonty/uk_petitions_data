        "action": "Re-regulate bus services to ensure a better service and fair price for all.",
        "additional_details": "De-regulation occurred in 1986 and the private companies run the services without regulation (Outside of London) which means prices can be set at any level the companies wish to set. They look to increase profits more and more each year which has a detrimental affect on the service they provide to paying customers - who rely on these services daily as a crucial transport link to get to where they need too. \r\nMy local bus service recently raised ticket prices by up to 9.4%.",
        "background": "Bus companies, nationwide are increasing prices despite poor service and lower costs to them in terms of lower price in fuel & utilities. Services often have route extensions or sometimes removed altogether which reduces overall bus numbers on the road which leads to longer waiting times.\r\n",
