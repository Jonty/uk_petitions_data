        "additional_details": "I have worked part time in various roles since having my daughter 10 years ago. I was previously a project manager, latterly in  Adult Education, Work Based Learning.\r\nMy career has had to take a back seat due to the lack of opportunity for job share roles. I haven't contributed to a pension pot for over 10 years as the roles I've taken on have generally been hourly paid. I've lost continuity and valuable experience. At 51 I am now looking to make up my pension and re establish a career. ",
        "background": "The lack of job share/ flexible roles results in Women resorting to low paid roles to dovetail around child care.Vacancies advertised as full time roles, preclude working mothers (mainly); thus precluding career continuation and advancement. This also has a significant effect on  pension provision.",
