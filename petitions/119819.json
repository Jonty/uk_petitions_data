        "additional_details": "Travel times along the a27 would be greatly reduced if the lights were removed and the roundabouts restored to be free flowing and uncontrolled, whenever the Traffic lights are disabled, traffic flow is greatly increased and fuel economy, travel times etc improve also.  It shouldn't take over half an hour to drive from one side of worthing to the other along a major road such as the A27, and often traffic on a dual carriageway is stationary for 2 miles approaching the crossbush traffic lights.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to remove the traffic lights from the crossbush junction,the offington roundabout and the lewis roundabout , the lights are unnecessary as power outages with the lights has proven the traffic flows better without and reduces congestion and travel times.",
