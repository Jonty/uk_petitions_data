        "additional_details": "MS affects 100,000 people in the U.K. \r\n\r\nRelapses lead to an accumulation of neurological damage which cannot be reversed. I am a medical doctor and currently walk to a full-time job. My frequent relapses will eventually force me out of work. The NHS Chief Executive did not reply to my MP asking for meat-free oral capsules.\r\n\r\nDisability benefit cuts on one hand, and preventing the use of oral tablets which reduce the frequency of relapses by over 60% on the other hand is illogical and cruel.\r\n",
        "background": "The two most effective NHS oral tablets to prevent Multiple Sclerosis relapses without the need for regular hospital stays for injected treatment are made of beef gelatin, so cannot be taken by many. With 100,000 MS sufferers in the UK and, benefits being cut, people's health needs to be preserved.",
