        "additional_details": "The refugee crisis is not going away. People are desperate to flee the war and violence in Syria. They are particularly fearful for their children. Many many are still dying as they cross from Turkey to Greece. Greece is becoming a holding camp and cannot cope. We need to help the children in particular. 1. Because they deserve to live in saftey. 2. Because we are losing their potential skills. 3. Because disatisfied youngersters grow into dangerous disatisfied adults.",
        "background": "After November 9\u201310, 1938, Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) the British government gave permission for transports of German Jewish children to escape the horrors of Nazi Germany. It was a great act of humanity. This petition asks that such a system be put in place for Syrian refugee children.",
