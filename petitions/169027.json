        "additional_details": "According to mind.org.uk, 1 in 4 people in the UK will experience a mental health problem each year. This means that within a class of 28, for example, at least 7 pupils may potentially be experiencing a mental health problem or disorder in the time span of one academic year. Regarding issues within schools such as bullying and current cases in relation to this, I passionately believe mental health awareness will aid in combatting bullying and other issues, thus improving mental health care. ",
        "background": "With many mental health issues and cases going unnoticed and often being taboo and disregarded, mental health should be taught to children from a fairly young age. Not only does this give them the knowledge of one's mental state, but it will assist in developing generations to come. ",
