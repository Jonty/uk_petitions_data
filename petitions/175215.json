        "additional_details": "Jobs would be in the U.K. not abroad, they would be where you live & benefit the local economy.  Whereas large-scale manufacturing is very centralised. This will expand the number of companies giving these kinds of services so It\u2019ll be easier for consumers to have things repaired.\r\n\r\nIt will be easier for people to buy high-quality products because they know it\u2019s affordable to have them fixed if something breaks, giving an  incentive not to buy as cheap as possible and then scrap something.\r\n",
        "background": "To combat its \u2018throwaway consumer culture\u2019, Sweden has announced tax breaks on repairs to clothes, bicycles, fridges and washing machines. Repairs are more labour-intense than production, which is largely automised, repairs actually contribute to an expanding labour market decreasing unemployment.",
