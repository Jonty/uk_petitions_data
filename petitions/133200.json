        "additional_details": "The official Vote Leave campaign is deploying \"dishonesty on an industrial scale\" (Professor Dougan).  The 350m/week figure is known to be wrong but is still often reported as 'contested' which is incorrect.  The quarter million EU migrants figure is not 'net', so is misleading.  \r\n\r\nOften journalists fail to determine and state the facts, preferring the \"balance\" of merely airing opposing views.\r\n\r\nWithout retraction or effective challenges these inaccurate facts prevent a meaningful referendum.",
        "background": "Most referendum voters are reliant on campaign leaders for facts, and most are reliant on the media for their analysis.\r\n\r\nWhere campaign leaders knowingly make false statements and fail to retract them, they are abusing the democratic process; often aided by journalists' lack of impartial analysis.",
