        "additional_details": "In May 2015 I was reassessed for personal independence payment. I thought it would be straightforward and that I would be awarded the same again as my condition had not improved but had got slightly worse. However I was not awarded anything at all. I have taken it to appeal but got no joy. I am now under financial strain as I am still on active treatment. I have had to cut my hours in workdue to the harsh side effects. Getting this extra help makes us feel normal and have a good quality of life.",
        "background": "In 2013 I was diagnosed with secondary breast cancer of the liver which can be treated but not cured. In October 2013 I was awarded the enhanced rate of both components of personal independence payment which has helped my quality of life as I struggle to work full time due to the harsh side effects.",
