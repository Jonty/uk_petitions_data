        "additional_details": "In the hours following the EU referendum, the UK's second most asked question on the subject was \"What is the EU?\". This implies firstly, that many people didn't vote because they didn't understand & secondly, that many people made poorly informed decisions regardless of which side they chose. It is time to stop blaming people for being lazy & acknowledge that we have not equipped the electorate with the knowledge & skills they need to analyse political rhetoric & properly inform themselves.",
