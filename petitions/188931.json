        "additional_details": "The government are saying that under 21s are old enough to join the army, but are not entitled to Housing Benefit.\r\nIt's a truly disgusting cut. I'm 20 and had to use the benefits system to flee abusive parents who stopped me from achieving anything and caused me to have mental health issues. Now I work 20+ hours a week. Surely people like myself need support so we can find our feet? We don't need to be pushed aside!!",
        "background": "Recently, Theresa May has given the go ahead to scrap Housing Benefit for under 21s in April this year, the cut was first announced by David Cameron and the Conservatives in 2015. \r\nHowever many young people leave home with no income or job due to abuse and have no other family to turn to.
