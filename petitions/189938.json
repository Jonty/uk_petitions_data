        "action": "Remove Section 10 of the Swedish Derogation used by some Recruitment Agencies.",
        "additional_details": "The Swedish derogation is unfair to British and other EU based agencies that have no such deal.  There should be fairness in the marketplace for employers and workers alike, and the Swedish Derogation is not fair to British workers or other non-Swedish Agencies who don't have an agreement like this.  Also, the likelihood of benefiting from the Derogation is non-existent if the Agency keeps you in the same place of employment as most factory based agencies tend to do.",
        "background": "The Swedish Derogation is being used by Agencies allowing them to have Government exemption from Regulation 5 of the Agency Workers Regulation of 2011. Regulation 5 makes it law for Agencies to pay their workers the same basic pay as permanent staff of a similar grade after 12 weeks of employment.",
