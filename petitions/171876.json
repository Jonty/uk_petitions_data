        "action": "Make political education a compulsory lesson in schools",
        "additional_details": "Not once in my education have I ever had a politics lesson. Even though I didn't choose to study this subject at a level, I am interested in it and feel it is vital that every student has a basic understanding of it. By scheduling compulsory political lessons for everyone you are telling young people that it matters and that their vote matters. Lack of education leads people to make uninformed choices that can have a huge effect on the end result. Let's end uneducated votes. ",
        "background": "I am an 18 year old who has been shocked with the political results in 2016. Many have complained that recent referendum and election results are due to uneducated voters. Politics affects everyone, so why is it that not everyone understands or it taught about it?",
