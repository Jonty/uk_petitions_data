        "action": "Refund child maintenance if DNA testing proves a man isn't the biological Father",
        "additional_details": "The only way to attempt to get the money back is by claiming fraud in court which is costly, time consuming and not guaranteed. \r\n\r\nThis is totally unfair and I believe the Mother should have a legal obligation to pay this money back via an attachment of earnings or a deduction of benefits, in the same way that Father's are forced to pay maintenance by the government.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to have the issue debated in parliment, and bring about change in a system which unfairly favours women.",
        "background": "My husband recently discovered that the child he has been raising for almost six years is not biologically his, following DNA testing.\r\n\r\nAs the Mother had always maintained that he was the father, he has been paying maintenance through the CSA for five years. \r\n\r\nHe has no legal right to a refund.",
