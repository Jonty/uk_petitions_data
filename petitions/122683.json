        "action": "Create UK specific symbol that represents visible and non-visible disabilities.",
        "additional_details": "Much has been learnt about symbolism and imagery. The UK are world leaders in addressing this in terms of equality. It would therefore be advantageous to make the final step to acknowledging all disabilities.. Paving the way for a future-proofed global emblem, coupled with positive communications tackling negative attitudes experienced by many when benchmarked against physical/visible conditions. Complimenting the current accessible symbol would start us down that path.",
        "background": "The International Symbol of Accessibility (ISA) - Wheelchair Symbol - is often confused being representative of all disabilities. This can, itself, cause discrimination for people with non-visible disabilities e.g. mental-ill health. A UK symbol to sit alongside the ISA would be a powerful message.",
