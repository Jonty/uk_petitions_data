        "additional_details": "The archaic viewpoint that sex is something a man does to a woman is reflected by law of the United Kingdom, when in reality it is a mutual experience that requires the consent of both parties. \r\n\r\nEssentially, the law in the UK is that an erection is equal to consent, however in reality an erection responds to physical stimulus and one has no control over whether this occurs or not. All laws that apply to penetration with a penis should be amended to apply to forced penetration from either party.",
        "background": "Currently the in the UK laws regarding rape are phallocentric, that is to say they focus on the idea that one has to have a penis in order to rape someone. This has meant that men and women are not persecuted equally when it comes to the crime of rape, in contrast to the concept of legal equality.",
