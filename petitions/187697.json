        "action": "Curb betting adverting around football matches and ban impulse bets.",
        "additional_details": "Since legalisation of advertising for betting in the U.K. we have seen an increase in problematic gambling, coinciding with the rise of betting on apps and the subsequent increase in advertising spend. New demographics are targeted, the industry now intertwined with football and is impossible to ignore.\r\nCompanies are now failing in their duty of care to their customers by providing quicker and quicker ways to bet, alongside aggressively advertising odds to encourage impulsive betting patterns.",
        "background": "A ban should be placed on betting advertising within 30 minutes of the start of football matches; and a ban should be placed on in play and 'impulse' bets and their aggressive advertising.\r\nFirms should be forced to allow 1 minute cooling off period on all bets to stop people betting impulsively",
