        "action": "Call for the resignation of Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt.",
        "additional_details": "Jeremy Hunt has wasted millions on consultations, including prolonged meetings with junior doctors, and with consultants to plan further cuts to staff & services. He failed to accept that 98% of staff know the NHS better than him. He continues to deny there is a shortage of resources & infrastructure, and has let the total PFI debt grow to over \u00a3300 billion. If this were wiped off, the NHS, once pride of the UK around the world, could operate successfully once again. ",
        "background": "Jeremy Hunt has neglected the problems of the NHS. He continues to dismiss the severeness of the financial crisis, and has not gained any increased funding. Money has been wasted on consultations leading to cuts in service, and morale amongst medical staff is at an all-time low.",
