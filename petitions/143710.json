        "additional_details": "My daughters levels were not checked.  We were discharged and she subsequently fell into a coma and had seizures.  This has left her with damage to her brain and epilepsy. A simple test prior to leaving hospital would have shown low blood sugars and immediate attention could have prevented the ensuing damage.  I wish to prevent this happening to anyone else. ",
        "background": "The test is a simple heel prick.  It can help to indicate if your baby is\u00a0 converting its milk feed into the required source of glucose. If the level is too low the body/brain cannot function sufficiently,  the baby may have seizures and fall into a coma. Stop it happening to someone else's baby. ",
