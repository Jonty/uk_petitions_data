        "action": "Stop our Government sending financial aid to China, India and Mexico.",
        "additional_details": "It has been widely reported in the media that our Government is planning to spend \u00a31.3 billion UK tax payers' money on the improvement of social care for the elderly of China, India and Mexico.  \r\nThis Government and others have eroded our Military, we have thousands of people living on the streets, our NHS is in severe crisis, our schools are over populated and our own elderly live in fear of significantly high heating bills. This is so wrong! I would ask that the Government looks after the citizens of the UK who are in need and let other countries look after their social care. ",
        "background": "This Petition is asking the Government to re-think the idea of sending financial aid to China, Mexico and India.\r\n",
