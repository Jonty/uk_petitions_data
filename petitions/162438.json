        "additional_details": "It has become increasingly apparent the implications of a police caution and unfortunately it is not realised until it is too late. The bodies able to dispense a caution, police and CPS, often work together and it is a biased system in that those who investigate also give the reprimand.\r\nThe following links shed some light on this matter.\r\nhttp://www.govyou.co.uk/remove-cautions-from-crb/\r\nhttps://iaingould.co.uk/2013/06/03/a-caution-is-for-life-not-just-for-christmas/",
        "background": "Police Cautions are to be used as an alternative to prosecution in minor cases. However they are so frequently used that people who accept them are unaware of the future implications of having a caution. Regulations & review on the dispensation of a police caution and length on a record is required.",
