Those who wish to die are forced to end their lives earlier than they might do (if at all) by travelling to organisations like Dignitas (as was the case for Jeffrey Spector) or condemned to locked-in syndrome (Tony Nicklinson) or simply to die in a protracted and agonising manner.\r\n\r\nAny one of the above can be you. Don\u2019t wait until it is.  Time to take the decision out of hands and consciences of MPs. Let us live with it, or opt not to!\r\n\r\n",

Only 118 MPs were in favour.\r\n\r\nThis does not reflect public opinion, which various polls have demonstrated supports and desires the right to assisted dying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
