        "additional_details": "\u00a312 per hour on a basic 9am to 5pm (with an unpaid hour break) week with full paid holiday still only amounts to \u00a321,840 per annum (52 weeks worked per year)\r\nThe government stated a few years ago you are required to be earning no less than \u00a335,000 per annum to affordably live comfortable lives. The most common tax code is 1000L meaning the majority of people in this country are living on minimum wage. Doesn't sound like a democracy to me! Vote now to make a change!",
        "background": "Everyday people are living in poverty while we're all living in a \"first world country\" the living wage has been increased but is still inadequate, it is optional for businesses while the minimum wage is forcing millions to go hungry and without the ability to provide shelter for their families. \r\n",
