        "action": "Stop the planned closure of Children's Centres.",
        "additional_details": "In my local area of Kettering, Northamptonshire, we currently have seven designated venues spread over the local towns. The proposed cuts will close five of them, reduce one to operating on a part time basis and only one open full time. In an area which is growing hugely with massive new build developments including new family housing and schools. It is unfair for children and parents to miss out on the support these Centres provide. Stop the closures!!",
        "background": "These services are vital for both parents and children. They provide a safe, friendly place for families where friendships are made, important parenting information is learnt, babies have access to toys to aid development. Losing them will cost more in the long run, financially and emotionally.",
