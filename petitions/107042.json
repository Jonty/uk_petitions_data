        "additional_details": "We ask you to act on the following:\r\n- Abolish Leasehold & replace with Commonhold so although they can't own a house they could own a flat (cheaper) without any added leasehold fees.\r\n- Put a cap on rent. The rich are getting richer, buying houses, splitting them into tiny apartments & charging \u00a31000+ a month to live in them. The government has a responsibility to stop this extortion.\r\n- Match living wages to the cost of living, a place to call home shouldn't be a luxury for the young & working.\r\n",
        "background": "We ask you to address the housing crisis where (mostly) young working people are unable to buy a house/flat & are forced to rent at unreasonably high prices! A place to call home shouldn't be a luxury for the young & working, but with rent costing over half their salary this is not a reality.",
