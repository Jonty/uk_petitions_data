        "action": "Extend the new 'Sugary drinks tax' to include milky drinks with additions.",
        "additional_details": "There is a huge disparity in additional sugar in such drinks with some outlets containing 3.6g sugar per 100ml of drink (plus milk) and others containing as much as 15.25g sugar for the same. Comparisons are made based on a hot chocolate drink made up with preparations from Real Hot Chocolate Co, and Caff\u0450 Nero, based on official figures from the companies in question. The preparations are responsible for this, and milk itself is not taken into account. Other drinks have the same issue.",
        "background": "To exempt these drinks from the tax is horrifying considering recent press regarding these hidden levels of sugar. To avoid such an exemption, drink preparations should also be included \u2013 ensuring that low-sugar hot drinks are exempt where high-sugar versions are held to the relevant accountability.",
