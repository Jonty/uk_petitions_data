        "additional_details": "The stat maternity pay at the moment is currently between \u00a3500-\u00a3600 a month which for a single parent is a large drop in salary, but doubled costs (or greater) for twice as many nappies, formula, clothes etc. means that this money is not sufficient for the needs of the family. \r\nThe first child receives standard child benefit, the second however is treated as if they were not born at the same time. \r\nMultiple births are natural but parents aren't helped with that burden.",
        "background": "Currently there is no extra maternity pay for multiple birth parents despite the cost being greater.  \r\nThe child allowance doesn't assist either having the second child at a reduced rate.\r\nBoth of these should be revised to help parents who are already over worked by a multiple birth.",
