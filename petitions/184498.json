        "additional_details": "In the period Jan-15 to Mar-15, 6574 PTW's were reported as stolen (source www.met.police.uk/foi/pdfs/disclosure_2016/may_2016/2016030001373.pdf)  Many of these, especially in the London area have been used in robberies of individuals and shops.  As information on stolen PTW's is already available on pay to use sources, I would like to request that information held by Govt. agencies regarding theft status, colour changes and insurance history (e.g. write offs) be made freely available.",
        "background": "Information pertaining to stolen powered two wheelers should be freely available. Registration numbers, VIN numbers and engine numbers of all vehicles reported stolen should be available on a free to use Government website with the aim of reducing theft by making stolen PTW's harder to sell.",
