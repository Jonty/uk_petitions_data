        "additional_details": "I propose that it should become an offence for any Politician to provide misleading information whether a deliberate act or through negligence in order to gain electoral advantage. This includes the wilful use of \"Spin\" in order to deceive or cloud factual information.\r\n\r\nAny Politician found to breach the above rule regardless of their level of seniority within a party will be held accountable with a ban from all political duties of between 12-36 months.",
        "background": "The EU Referendum has highlighted a need to hold Politicians to account for deceiving/misleading the public by providing inaccurate information in order to influence votes. Not only is this simply unethical, it brings the whole political system into disrepute and can have far reaching consequences. ",
