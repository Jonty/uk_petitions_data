        "additional_details": "Other European countries i.e Germany are doing so much more. As a civilised nation we can't just sit back and let this happen. In the name of humanity let's show the world that we care about life, regardless of race and culture and do something positive to protect these people. None of us have or would dare to walk a mile in their shoes! The time for action is now. The UK spend \u00a37,000,000 to try and keep these people out, money better spent on giving these families a home. SHAME ON US!!!!!!!",
        "background": "The refugee crisis is an humanitarian crisis. These people are human beings, fleeing a life threatening situation. Any government that puts an economic argument before an humanitarian argument is failing! This country is big enough to offer a place of asylum to those in such desperate circumstances.",
