        "action": "Any Brexit plan to be put to a referendum before Article 50 is invoked.",
        "additional_details": "The government should give the British people the chance to vote on any Brexit plan in a referendum, or via a dissolution of Parliament, followed by a General Election in which the Government would make its Brexit plan a manifesto commitment. If the Brexit plan is not endorsed by the electorate, Article 50 should not be invoked and Britain should remain in the EU. Any subsequent Brexit plan should follow the same democratic procedure outlined above, prior to any invocation of Article 50.",
        "background": "This petition is not a call for a \u201csecond referendum\u201d with the same question as the first, but for a proper democratic endorsement of any Brexit plan. The Leave campaign's failure to present a plan before 23 June creates a democratic deficit.",
