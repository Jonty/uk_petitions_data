        "additional_details": "As a single person who travels alone or with friends its unfair that we have to pay extra for a holiday if its during a school break. This also limits the amount of time we can take off work lossing around 8 weeks per year. A holiday for example to spain costs around \u00a3150-\u00a3250 more at such times. If like myself due to your work (healthcare) you cant take time off during half of November, all of December and half of January because of school break costs it limits exactly what you can have.",
