        "action": "Stop charging patients for recreational services in hospitals.",
        "additional_details": "It is immoral to be charging a patient for recreational services when they have already been installed and are already using electricity to display adverts. \r\n\r\nBeing entertained is an essential element of human biology and psychology, so why are patients being denied of that? \r\n\r\nA compromise for not making TVs free would be to provide free books, magazines, or games which could be donated to the hospital by people.",
        "background": "In hospitals, patients have to pay money to use recreational services offered such as TVs. \r\n\r\nElectricity is wasted to power the TVs to show adverts, yet the patients have to pay money if they want to watch a film or channel. ",
