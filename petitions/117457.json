        "action": "Record both 'registered keeper' & 'legal owner' on V5C (vehicle 'log book').",
        "additional_details": "My son's car was bought by his dad and gifted to him and registered in my son's name as the 'registered keeper'.  After a 'falling out', the dad re-registered the car in his own name, without my son's permission or signature.  The DVLA told me that, as the dad had paid for the car, he was the 'legal owner'.\r\nIf the 'registered keeper' & 'legal owner' were both recorded on the V5C, and both had to sign for a change of keeper/owner, we would all know where we stood & there wouldn't be this problem.",
        "background": "In the present system, when you buy a car you can only see the registered keeper's details, so if the car is actually owned by someone else, you could have to return the car to the legal owner.  Also, if a car is given as a gift, say from a parent to a child, the parent can legally take back the car",
