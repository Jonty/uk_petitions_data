For example, your petition doesn't specify who should decide whether the Prime Minister has given an acceptable answer to a question, or how an acceptable answer would be defined. \r\n\r\nIn any case, the rules of the House of Commons are not usually set out in law. You could start a new petition calling for the rules of the House to be changed, to give an individual or body the power to intervene if an answer to a parliamentary question does not meet an agreed standard. For example, in the past we have accepted a petition calling for the Speaker to have this power:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/118388\r\n"
