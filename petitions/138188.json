The answer is \"However many it takes until they win!\".\r\n\r\nRegardless of how many people sign this petition, the fact is that leave won the referendum by a difference of 1,269, 501 votes. 17,410,742 voted to leave the EU, and this decision must be final & respected. \r\n\r\nWe wouldn't be allowed to have a 2nd general election because we were unhappy that the conservatives were elected. \r\n\r\nThe result is final.\r\n",

If Bremain had won the vote, David Cameron would have ensured Brexit supporters were made to accept the result (something he said before the referendum). The same works both ways.
