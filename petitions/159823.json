        "additional_details": "1. The British Pound has lost more than 10% of its value against most foreign currencies since the EU referendum result was announced.\r\n\r\n2. Whilst the Bank of England suggests further monetary easing including lowering interest rates and printing more money, this may push the value of  Pound sterling further down.\r\n\r\n3. We need to improve business confidence & international investor confidence in the UK. This may be best achieved if a new PM is selected soonest who can outline UK policy towards EU.",
        "background": "UK is a great country and after EU Referendum the nation is polarised and uncertain in regard to the future.  New PM helps to bring direction to the nation and also removes uncertainty.  All this will help to strengthen confidence in the Pound and firm up household and business investment decisions.",
