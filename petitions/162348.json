        "action": "Lift the ban on Tyler the Creator entering the United Kingdom.",
        "additional_details": "On the 26th August 2015, Tyler was banned from entering the country by our current Prime Minister Theresa May under the terms of Home Office policy on \"behaviours unacceptable in the UK\" - a set of guidelines drawn up in 2005 to try to prevent suspected terrorists entering Britain. The albums Bastard (2009) and Goblin (2011) are expressions of art and Tyler does not promote violent or extreme behaviour. His wit and charisma are in fact conducive to the public good.",
        "background": "Tyler the Creator with his uplifting personality has been at the forefront of innovation in the music and fashion industry. The fact he has been banned from the UK for his songs goes against the values this country strives for. His creative genius should be appreciated all around the world.",
