        "additional_details": "I've lived with CKD for ten years, and now I am in need of a transplant or face years of dialysis. I am so lucky that a group of people have come forward as potential Living Donors.\r\n\r\nThese people are willing to undergo invasive surgery to change lives. This surgery would also save the NHS millions, transplanting kidneys is more cost efficient than dialysis. \r\n\r\nIt's the principle - if someone is willing to undertake such a selfless act, as a society let's not ask them to pay for the privilege. \r\n",
        "background": "If someone is willing to be a Living Donor, undergo invasive surgery to change peoples lives, and at the same time save the NHS money - surely, we can provide them a blood group certificate on the NHS and not ask them to pay for it? \r\nIt's a selfless act, & being forced to go private is prohibitive.",
