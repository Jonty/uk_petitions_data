        "action": "We must have a 2nd EU Referendum: Vote restricted to those aged 16 to 50 years.",
        "additional_details": "The political elite and the political media have entirely failed the British people. The 2nd referendum should only take place once a mechanism has been devised to moderate the arguments put forward by the Remain and Leave campaigns.  At the very least, arguments would require references which support the argument, in a similar way to academic papers being considered for publication in a journal.",
        "background": "The result of the first referendum is essentially a tie.  The result of the first referendum is made null and void by the deliberate misinformation and lies of both the Leave and Remain campaigns.  The first referendum failed to recognise that the primary stakeholders are the young and not the old.",
