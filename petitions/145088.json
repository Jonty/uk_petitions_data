        "action": "Only a Prime Minister chosen by a general election may invoke Article 50 of TFEU",
        "additional_details": "Since the main leaders of both the Remain and Leave side came from one political party, and the losing leader has resigned as PM, his successor will be elected by that same party, rather than the electorate. If that successor PM invokes Article 50, then they do so with no more democratic authority than any EU leader. The principle of democracy demands that the UK electorate is given the opportunity to consider the threats to the future of their state by means of a general election.",
        "background": "The organisers of the referendum to leave Europe failed to anticipate that differences in regional voting would threaten the present existence of the UK. That threat requires a general election to allow the electorate to chose which government they want to handle the referendum outcome. \r\n\r\n",
