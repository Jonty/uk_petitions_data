        "additional_details": "There is very little understanding about what a \u2018Registered Nutritionist\u2019 is and how it compares to a nutritional therapist, nutritionist, nutrition advisor (the list of terms goes on). Yes, we have a UK voluntary register of Nutritionists held by the Association for Nutrition but this goes (mostly) unnoticed by the media and the public. It\u2019s vital that we increase the awareness of this register so that people understand where to go to for accurate, evidence based advice.",
        "background": "Currently, due to lack of regulation, anyone can set up and practice as a nutritionist/nutritional therapist, meaning there is no real protection for consumers. The Government should take action to prevent unqualified people from potentially putting people\u2019s health at risk.\r\n\r\n",
