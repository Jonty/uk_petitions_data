        "additional_details": "In the current climate Homelessness is rising and there are no easy solutions to this. Local Authorities are struggling to cope with the demand and are not able to house most people registered as Homeless due to the lack of Housing supply.\r\n\r\nWe believe that it would be only just fair that as a great country, United Kingdom would allow anyone who is registered as Homeless to have free public transport. This would enable them to go to work, attend job centres, hospital or housing appointments.",
        "background": "Whilst we find ways and seek solutions to Homelessness it would be a good start by offering access to public transport. This way we would offer them some respite and support that they need in order to improve their lives. Moreover, it would not cost us much as it is already there.\r\n\r\n",
