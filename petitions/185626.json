        "action": "Prevent the UK defence from becoming useless, fulfil the NATO pledge of 2%",
        "additional_details": "The IISS said Britain\u2019s defence spending had dipped below the NATO benchmark figure, despite the government vowing to meet the target. However has continued its campaign of unnecessary cuts to defence by selling of well-established bases weakening the defence of the nation. This is a great error in judgement as fails generations of hard work in building our defence to be the best it can be in the modern era.",
        "background": "To be spending less than 2 per cent of GDP on defence is utterly unacceptable, particularly in this time of immense global uncertainty.",
