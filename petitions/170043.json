        "additional_details": "Many social housing properties are in disadvantaged areas with high crime, making them unsafe for many adults with learning disabilities, or properties are ill suited for the person's physical disabilities... this results in many people having to continue living wth parents long into adulthood... with complex care needs that place unsustainable pressure on the family relationship increasing the risk of crisis or carer breakdown.",
        "background": "Many local authorities have social housing problems... but more so for adults with physical disabilities and/or learning disabilities (who may require shared living). Where housing associations have stepped in to provide properties they charge rents far beyond what is affordable on housing benefit.",
