        "additional_details": "Challenges have been made by voters who voted to remain asking that the Government \"implement a rule that if the remain or leave vote is less than 60% based a turnout less than 75% there should be another referendum\". The referendum result was a majority decision in favour of leaving the EU, post creation of a modification such as this would be undemocratic. No such rule currently exists within the European Union Referendum Act 2015 or The European Union Referendum (Conduct) Regulations 2016.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call upon HM Government to protect the democratic decision of voters in the EU Referendum 2016. On 23rd June 2016 the UK voted to leave the European Union. We ask UK Government uphold the decision made by the majority of UK citizens, and act decisively as directed by this result.",
