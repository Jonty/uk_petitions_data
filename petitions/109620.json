        "action": "Make it compulsory for all public places to be equipped with a defibrillator.",
        "additional_details": "12-15 young people every week are having cardiac arrests in our country, most of these needlessly losing their lives. Around 30,000 people every year suffer a Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) outside of hospital with the current survival rate estimated at 4%. With a defibrillator present, the chance of survival can be increased to 50%. We also petition the government to add basic lifesaving skills (CPR) to the curriculum and ensure every child leaves school equipped with the skill to save a life.",
        "background": "Defibrillators are lifesaving. They are simple to use and inexpensive. The government already supports schemes providing subsidised equipment to schools but not enough of them are enrolling in this. Many charities and local groups are supporting fundraising but a change in legislation is imperative.",
