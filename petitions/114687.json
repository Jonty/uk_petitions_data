Such intentional lying should be frowned upon by all parties and MPs.\r\n\r\nMP's should act honorably and honestly and as such her actions should deem her to be unfit as a representative of the people who she serves.\r\n\r\nDaily Mail Article - http://goo.gl/yHS1Ky\r\n",
        "background": "Lucy Allan recently posted a constituents email on her facebook page and added the words \"unless you die\" in order to create the perception she has received a death threat for her choice of vote re:Bombing Syria. Such actions are deceitful and should not be tolerated of a Member of Parliament.  \r\n\r\n",

The expression \"vote of no confidence\" is used when talking about a vote in the House of Commons which tests whether or not the Government of the day has the confidence of a majority of MPs in the House of Commons. That's why we allow petitions asking for a vote of no confidence in the Government or in individual Ministers. The concept of the House having \u201cconfidence\u201d in someone does not apply to backbench or Opposition Members."
