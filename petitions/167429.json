        "additional_details": "No universally effective treatment exists for M.E. Current NHS treatments for the illness are based on the controversial PACE trial, and have been found ineffective or even harmful. Good quality research into the root cause of the illness is needed. The current annual budget for biomedical research works at roughly \u00a31 per patient per year. We want the budget for research to be dramatically increased. We also ask for the formation of a work group focussing on the issues surrounding this disease.",
        "background": "M.E./CFS is a debilitating autoimmune disease currently affecting 250,000 people in the UK. Many sufferers are unable to work or care for themselves, and 25% of M.E. patients are bedbound. Most M.E. sufferers are on ESA or disability benefits, causing a significant economic burden.",
