        "additional_details": "Reduction in spasticity is immediately apparent after the procedure, but SDR unmasks any weakness and difficulties with co-ordinating movements. Through the physio programme, children will learn to use their body in a new way. There's now enough evidence to demonstrate that SDR is associated with substantial long-term benefits. These not only relate to reduction in spasticity, but also relate to improved movement, walking and an improved quality of life for both the children and their families.\r\n",
        "background": "SDR is a neurosurgical procedure aimed at reducing spasticity (tight and stiff muscle tone) in the lower limbs\r\nThe surgery aims to:\r\nAchieve a long-term reduction in spasticity\r\nImprove function and mobility\r\nIncrease independence \r\nIncrease range of motion and improve positioning. \r\n\r\n",
