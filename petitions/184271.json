        "additional_details": "As it stands there is no 'cure' for SMAS (Wilkie Syndrome). I would like more research be conducted to gain a better understanding for the illness and to raise awareness. I believe there could be more people suffering with the syndrome but there isn't enough evidence to support a diagnosis. \r\nMore research could benefit people who currently suffer with the syndrome. I didn't know about the syndrome until I met my friend who has SMAS. I am aiming to help her and possibly other 'SMAS Warriors'.",
        "background": "Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome (SMAS) is a digestive condition that occurs when the first part of the small intestine is compressed between two arteries. This compression causes partial or complete blockage of the small intestine. Which causes severe discomfort and drastic weight loss.",
