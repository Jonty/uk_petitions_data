        "additional_details": "The motorway M6 jct 17-20 is about 13 miles long. Highways England are upgrading the central reservation with plans of upgrading to smart motorway. The planned works will be around 2 years before completion. There are constant delays every day. The m60 ring road manchester is the same. \r\nI propose the highways agency concentrate on a smaller area. 3-4 miles max at any one time, to minimise delays. ",
        "background": "Smart motorways are supposedly  helpful in keeping traffic flowing, But the upgrading works are being undertaken all over the major networks at the same time, Causing big delays for motorists. I think the upgrading works should be restricted to a 3 mile max distance to minimise delays to motorists. ",
