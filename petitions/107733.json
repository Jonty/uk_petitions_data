        "action": "Punish those who steal someone's pet with an automatic 10 years extra sentence.",
        "additional_details": "When a pet is stolen it causes the family deep emotional distress. The pet they raised has vanished. To some people this is almost as bad as having a child abducted. The law should be changed to punish those who ruin the lives of others because it's harder to replace a member of the family than it is an item such as a television. Dogs and cats are members of a family and should be treated with the same love and protection as everyone else. They are not simply property! ",
        "background": "When a burglar breaks in to your home or if you are robbed, we want the law to be changed to deter criminals from stealing people's family pet by giving them an automatic 10 year sentence on top of the sentence for the crime committed. Pets cannot easily be replaced, a television can. ",
