        "additional_details": "The rule that a British citizen, living outside the UK for more than 15 years, cannot take part in national elections, amounts to an unjustified and arbitrary disenfranchisement and is thus undemocratic. A holder of a British passport has, regardless of the number of years living outside the UK, nevertheless, an interest in the government of the UK and should be able to express this interest by being able to take part in national elections.",
        "background": "Currently, British citizens, living outside the UK for more than 15 years, cannot register and therefore vote in UK national elections. They often cannot take part in the national election of their country of residence as a British citizen and have no role in the (international) democratic process.",
