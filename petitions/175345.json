        "additional_details": "In 2015 the UK Foreign Aid budge rose to \u00a312.2bn, all of which had to be borrowed.\r\n\r\nThe Independent Commission for Aid has produced a report saying that \"The DfID\u2019s plans are \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d \r\n\r\nThe National Audit Office has severely criticised the policy. In 2013 the DfID had to spend \u00a32bn in just 8 weeks to ensure the target for spending was reached !\r\n\r\nWe have budget constraints at home, particularly with defence, the NHS and Education yet the Foreign Aid budget is ring fenced. \r\nWhy ?",
        "background": "The arbitrary target for Foreign Aid spending set by the Cameron Government of .7% of GDP is clearly not working. \r\n\r\nThe Department is struggling to spend all of the budget. 40% ends up being thrown at the EU, the UN & NGOs where we have no control or certainty that our money is being spent wisely.",
