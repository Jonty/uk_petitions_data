        "additional_details": "The intention of Leeds City Council is to close Seigen Manor and leave it empty and boarded up for 2 years pending a further decision on its alternate use. We understand the Council's spending commitments and necessary cuts to balance budgets, but this proposal seems counter intuitive when assessing alternative location costs and the frail nature of those impacted by relocation, which is likely not to be in the local vacinity and also not of the very high standards we see at Seigen Manor.",
        "background": "Seigen Manor, Morley has been targeted by Leeds City Council for closure as a result of recent assessments into local elderly care arrangements.\r\nA decision on its closure will be publicised on Wednesday 21st September. Residents will then be assigned an Elderly Care Worker to determine their fate.",
