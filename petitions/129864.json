I have tried it, and it is SO effective!\r\nOther countries are very reluctant to send it to me, as it could result in us both facing charges. \r\nThis seems SO unfair, when I KNOW that safe pain relief is possible from this avenue, and yet I am not allowed to access it. \r\nI am unable to drive, because of my physical health, so even DUI is not a danger. \r\nPLEASE change the law which is at present barring myself and so many others from access to relief from suffering!",
