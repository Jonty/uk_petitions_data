        "additional_details": "The word democracy stems from the Greek word, d\u0113mokrat\u00eda, comprising two parts: d\u00eamos \"people\" and kratos \"power\". Without a demos, there is no democracy. But people without power is not democracy either.\r\n\r\nOur current system of government is known as \"representative democracy\". That phrase is a misuse of the word democracy. People do not hold power: that system cannot by definition be a democracy.",
        "background": " After an appropriate sized petition is raised, of maybe 400,000 people, a nation-wide referendum is called to annul any act of parliament, law or treaty in effect within the UK. ",
