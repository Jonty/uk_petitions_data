The case should not be passed over to a private charity and become a private case in the eyes of the law.  In recent years there have been many cases were members of the public have had wrongful attempted prosecutions brought upon them. For example, Bob Skinner & Mr Pig in 2015.

Once the case has passed into private hands, what is right and wrong becomes subjective and the lines of the law become blurred, and opinions start to overrule the facts. \r\n",
