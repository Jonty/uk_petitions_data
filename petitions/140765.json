Should agreement not be reached collectively by all countries then the status quo must remain.   ",
        "background": "We the undersigned call on HM Government to implement a rule that all 4 UK nations must agree collectively to either remain or leave the EU, consistent with the 1975 EEC referendum (both UK and NI were in agreement). Executing the votes of 2 nations within a 4 nation union is unconstitutional. ",
