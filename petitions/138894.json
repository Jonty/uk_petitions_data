        "additional_details": "They all voted remain, so they should get what they want rather than being forced by another constitution that a lot of Scottish and N. Irish people want to leave. As we are the British, we pride our selves on being democratic so we must respect their decision even though we might not agree with it like when Germany, France and USA respected our decision when we voted Brexit.",
        "background": "There is a great divide between England, N. Ireland and Scotland because Scotland and N. Ireland both had majority remain but were dragged to leave the EU, we need more democracy, if they want to stay, let them, don't force them",
