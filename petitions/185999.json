        "additional_details": "A recent case; Hinckley where a man stole a defibrillator from a public box whilst a 1 man paramedic was attending to a incident, He has been arrested for theft, there have been other cases around the country. As a first aider & a volunteer responder I feel that a new law with a substantial minimum fine &/Or a prison term for theft/Damage of lifesaving equipment is needed. More public units are available & need to be protected. Potentially someone could die if the equipment is damaged or stolen.",
        "background": "Equipment such as Defibrillators or any lifesaving equipment. At present the law seems to be that they are only covered under simple theft act. We are now seeing more defibrillators in public; some that have been supplied by community fundraising/private donations surely they need more protection?",
