Women I feel, do not realise how very cruel withholding this information can be and I should know I have to live with this torment day in and day out.\r\nI know Human rights are banded about these days, but I really do feel my Human rights have been trampled on.\r\nA Father has a responsibility to support a child so his name should be on a birth certificate and in the case of a rape, this information should be available to the child at the age of 18.\r\nPlease government do the right thing and legislate!",
