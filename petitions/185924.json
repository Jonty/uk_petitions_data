        "additional_details": "If a family earns a total household income of \u00a362,000+, their children who are planning to go to university receive the lowest maintenance grant of \u00a33,821 to cover rent, food, and supplies for the year, and parents/carers are expected to contribute around \u00a33,000 to the student's living cost. This is despite the fact many parents get heavily taxed, have to pay their own bills, buy food and pay for their mortgage and because of this many students can't even cover basic living costs.",
        "background": "Soon-to-be students from middle income families are in a state of worry year in year out as they prepare to go to university receiving the lowest maintenance grant - expected to receive thousands from struggling parents leading them to having to work many hours on top of uni work in order to get by.",
