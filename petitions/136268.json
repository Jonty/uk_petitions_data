        "action": "Give MP's a free vote on whether to invoke Art 50 Lisbon Treaty and thus Brexit",
        "additional_details": "A very slim majority of the electorate has decided the future of the UK.  This momentous decision has been taken in part founded on lies and propaganda. The economy is in freefall.  Scotland, and possibly Northern Ireland, may now leave the UK.   However the Prime Minister is under no obligation to invoke the legal process of our removal from the EU.  Such a momentous decision for the UK should be properly debated and considered by our elected MPs, with a free vote on Article 50 and Brexit.",
        "background": "The UK electorate has decided by a slim majority that it should exit the EU.  This decision is non-binding and advisory only.  Such a decision is far too complex to be decided by an in/out referendum by the public and requires a full debate and vote in Parliament prior to possible Brexit.  ",
