        "action": "Reverse the decision to scrap replays in the FA Cup from round 1",
        "additional_details": "Financially for years to come in some cases. By signing this petition, we urge the government, specifically the minister for Sport, to demand a reversal to this decision, to help protect the future of not only the game, but the smaller EFL clubs, as well as the non league clubs who often reply on this tournaments prize money. Not to mention fans of these clubs who dream of going to the big clubs like Liverpool, Man City and United etc.",
        "background": "The decision was made by the FA amd Premier League, without any consultation from clubs outside of the Premier League. Not even all Premier League clubs wanted this decision. Hundreds of thousands of fans and players around the country love the idea of replays, and it helps set lower League clubs up",
