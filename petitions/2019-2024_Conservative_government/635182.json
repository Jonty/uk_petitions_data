Often they are asked what salary they are on now so the hiring company can get away with continuing to pay them below market.  If the salary was advertised all of this goes away.  The candidate knows the range and if they are a good fit it does not matter what pay they were on previously. It will make a huge impact on pay gaps.",

The pay offer will be based on their current salary.  If they are below market now then they will continue to be.  If the salary was advertised all of this would go away.",
