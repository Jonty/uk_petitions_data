        "action": "Raise Government funding for Mental Health Services and increase awareness",
        "additional_details": "In 2001, Mental Awareness Week was launched to bring awareness to the number of people suffering from mental health disorders. Since then, mental health has been fluctuating in the UK, with a steep decline due to COVID, Brexit, and other social factors. Consequently, the UK has been plunged into a severe mental health crisis that will only worsen if the Government does not take action.",
        "background": "As the mental health crisis in the UK has worsened over the past few years, the Government must increase funding towards mental health services. More must be done in order to offer support to those who need it since too many people do not have access to suitable support networks.",
