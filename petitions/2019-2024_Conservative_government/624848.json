        "additional_details": "Those with respiratory issues e.g. asthma, emphysema, CPOD, pneumonia, bronchitis, lung cancer or an acute viral infection may be sensitive to synthetic anthropogenic aerosols. Studies show that synthetic room fragrances e.g. sprays, diffusers, candles, pot pourri etc cause symptoms such as breathing difficulties, headaches, sickness, neurological issues, skin irritation, mental debility etc and may cause permanent hormonal changes. The public have a right to breathe uncontaminated air.",
        "background": "Synthetically produced fragrances are used in public places. Smoking is banned in public places due to the detrimental effects of synthetic anthropogenic aerosols. A ban should be placed on using synthetic products to fragrance the air in public places to avoid causing sensitivity and illness.",
