Unfortunately I was there and had to witness her death and carried her as she died in my arms. This has now traumatized me and I can never forget what happened to my Lucy. I had to bury her yesterday and now I need for there to be a law put in place to stop this from happening to other people's cats as it's literally the worst thing.",
