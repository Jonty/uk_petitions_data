        "additional_details": "The current national anthem \"God Save the Queen\" focuses on one person, great though she is, rather than on our nation. It has an uninspiring and unoriginal tune that does not embody the greatness of this country in all its glory. Some even see it as divisive (with the original version calling for rebellious Scots to be crushed).",
        "background": "\"Rule Britannia!\" is a rousing and already widely recognised song that celebrates our nation, and Britons are proud to unite behind it. I therefore propose officially changing the United Kingdom's national anthem to \"Rule Britannia!\".",
