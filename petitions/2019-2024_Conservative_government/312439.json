        "additional_details": "London's West End is one of the biggest culprits with all lights outside all shops, theatres and buildings still on. Do we really need them? Shops don't need flashing signage lights on right now, the screens in Picadilly Circus, Pier lights in seaside towns, do these all need to be on.\r\nIf we must all be mandated to stay in our homes at the threat of a fine or arrest, can attention also be paid to our carbon footprint and have all unnecessary lights turned off.",
        "background": "As the UK is under lockdown, looking at the traffic cams, towns and cities are deserted but they are all brighter than a Christmas tree. Imagine what two to three weeks of at least half of these lights off would do for the environment and for the electric bills.",
