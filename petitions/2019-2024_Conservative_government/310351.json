        "additional_details": "During these exceptional times, the government has enacted exceptional policies which prevent eviction for renters and provides landlords with a mortgage holiday. \r\nFor many students, we pay to live in close proximity to our university but these have now been closed. We demand that you take this out of the hands of landlords who refuse to hear our demands and address this oversight which affects one of the most financially vulnerable groups in our society - students.",
        "background": "Many students have had to return home due to COVID-19 yet are still required to pay for a term\u2019s accommodation. Thousands of student homes are now empty but landlords refuse to offer any parity between the leeway they have been offered (3 month mortgage holiday) and the leeway we too deserve.",
