It\u2019s aim is to get single parents off benefits completely and into full time work. A lot of single parents don\u2019t have the support for that and part time work is what works best for them. Single parents are not being supported by our government even though promised in 1942 \u201cfrom the cradle to the grave\u201d.",

For example, we could accept a petition calling for the amount of earnings a claimant can receive before this affects their Universal Credit claim to be increased."
