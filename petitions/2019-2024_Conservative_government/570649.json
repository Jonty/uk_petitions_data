        "additional_details": "It speaks to the health of the economy that ordinary people can purchase even the most in demand items without fear of a grey market inflating prices. Yet for technology this is not the case, and with no legislation stores have no incentive to improve the buying process for consumers.\r\n\r\nNobody cares that normal people are preyed on by scalpers. Which is why Government must intervene.",

Such legislation is in place for secondary selling of tickets, but nothing for technology.",
