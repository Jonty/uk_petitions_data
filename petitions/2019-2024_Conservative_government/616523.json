        "additional_details": "In the UK, approximately 65% of the adult population are considered overweight or obese. Even more shockingly, approximately 20% of children are considered obese. \r\n\r\nObesity related illness or disease currently costs the NHS approximately \u00a36.5 billion.\r\n\r\nA person who has various co-morbidities such as diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease could rack up a cost hundreds of thousands for the NHS, whereas accessing bariatric surgery sooner could help - approx cost of the surgery? \u00a312,000.",
        "background": "I\u2019d like the government to consider funding half of the cost of bariatric surgery for those it is deemed medically necessary; enabling access to bariatric surgery sooner would save the NHS millions of pounds in the long run, and help people take control of their weight and health earlier.",
