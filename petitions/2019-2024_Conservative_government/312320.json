        "additional_details": "Since the mid 90's when the Sunday opening laws were changed, many people's stress levels have been heightened, due to the way we work, shop and do other things at weekend. Families would have more time together, as would individuals too. Whilst I realise that Sunday has become the main shopping day of the week, this has only happened since the mid 90's and would soon be changed again. Shop workers would have more time off, and traffic levels would reduce thus reducing emissions.",
        "background": "The Covid 19 pandemic, has shown that many families and individuals have had more time together and the majority of people I have spoken to really enjoyed the peace and quiet that was apparent on Sunday. Although it perhaps isn't possible to return to the mid 90's, somethings could be done to assist",
