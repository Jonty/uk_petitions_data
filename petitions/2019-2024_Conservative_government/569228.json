        "action": "Continue the ban on non-bee-friendly pesticides (neonicotinoid and thiamethoxam)",
        "additional_details": "As we leave the European Union, the ban on these two pesticides will be ceased. It is important that, as a government so committed to 'one-nation conservatism', that said one nation includes our wildlife and our farmers, and this ban remains in force. It is likely that 30% of the bumblebee population has been lost in a single generation (The Guardian), and the government has a moral responsibility to keep the ban.",
        "background": "The EU had a ban on two forms of pesticide due to their lethal effects on bees: neonicotinoid and thiamethoxam. This ban should be continued, as bees pollinate 3/4 of Britain's crops, and their population is quickly decreasing. This trend cannot continue, if not for the bees, for British farming.",
