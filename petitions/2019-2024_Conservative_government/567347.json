If it is not \u2018possible\u2019 for students to sit GCSE\u2019s, why is it ok for those at university to? And be expected to deliver sufficient coursework throughout the year, as well as paying \u00a39250 in tutition?! That\u2019s without  accommodation rent. This year alone will put students in around \u00a313000 of loan and debt for a zoom call twice a week that is considered to be \u2018high quality learning\u2019? what about those going into medicine, paramedics, nursing, midwifery?? All of those KEY WORKERS that we need at this time, that have dedicated their days to go out into hospitals or high risk areas and on top of that need to complete assignments.",
