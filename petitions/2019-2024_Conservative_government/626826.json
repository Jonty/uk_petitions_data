        "additional_details": "Consuming marijuana can decrease blood pressure and reduce anxiety. It can help with alcoholism and drug addictions as well as depression and PTSD. It's used to treat chronic pains, epilepsy and many other diseases and pains. Marijuana is the UK's most used illegal drug, so legalising it would decrease the amount of drug crimes, like selling.",
        "background": "The Government should legalise the use and growth of recreational marijuana. Tobacco and alcohol have many health risks and they are legal and can be just as, if not more dangerous than marijuana. Marijuana does have some health risks but also a lot of benefits.",
