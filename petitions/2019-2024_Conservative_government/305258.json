        "additional_details": "The NHS is severely under-resourced to deal with the current epidemic, to the point that private health care is profiting. It is estimated the NHS is being forced to spend \u00a32.84 million a day alone on renting beds from the private healthcare sector. Meanwhile the NHS is unable to adequately protect its own staff against the virus, test appropriately, or respond to other medical needs. The people call on the government to put its citizens' health before private profit.",
        "background": "All private healthcare provisions including medicines, laboratories, beds, personnel and other amenities to be brought under public ownership and control in order to adequately respond to the Coronavirus pandemic. This has already happened in Spain and must be enacted in the UK immediately.",
