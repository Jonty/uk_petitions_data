        "action": "Ban online product scalping and hold online retailers to account to enforce it.",
        "additional_details": "Online retailers are not interested in meeting the genuine needs of their consumers so long as they move stock, and have no plans in tackling the use of scalping software. Reseller platforms such as Ebay, Facebook and Amazon are also not interested in protecting consumers and placing limits on re-selling products for significantly higher prices than the RRP. This pernicious way of capitalising on parents and genuine fans of the product is only going to get worse as online shopping normalises.",
        "background": "Products can now be acquired by using automated software, which is capable of buying up a large amount of stock at release which is later sold on at a high profit. Outlaw the use of scalping software and regulate both retailers and reselling platforms to enforce pricing rules around RRP.",
