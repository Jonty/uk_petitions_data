While other policies are often implemented within days without Parliamentary debates, for immigration policies it can take years. The HO must take responsibility for:\r\n- inability to address the people's lasting concerns over immigration\r\n- continuously incorrect predictions over immigration\r\n- bureaucracy leading to an uncontrolled immigration.",
        "background": "Within a matter of months sort out the immigration:\r\n1 Reduce overstay numbers and the inflow of illegal migrants to zero\r\n2 Invest into deporting ALL refused alyssum and FNOs\r\n3 Prioritise UK's nursing & other training before overseas staff\r\n4 Ban the use of hotels to accommodate alyssum seekers",

You can find out more here: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8062/\r\n\r\nFurther, not all undocumented migrants entering the UK are doing so illegally - many will be entering the country for the purpose of seeking asylum: https://www.gov.uk/claim-asylum.\r\n\r\nThe type of housing used for asylum seekers is an operational decision, so we would not accept a petition calling on the Government to ban authorities from housing asylum seekers in hotels.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what actions you would like the Government or Parliament to take."
