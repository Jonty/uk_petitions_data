        "additional_details": "Dog attacks are increasing at an alarming rate. I firmly believe that just like weapons, dogs are ultimately as dangerous in the wrong hands.  Responsible dog owners will not mind paying for a license to own one. As most dog attacks are dogs offlead I believe that all dogs should be on leads in every public setting.  I believe that an attack  is an attack whether on a human or another animal, any dog has the potential to turn and owners have a duty to protect their dogs, other people and their pets.\r\nI believe reintroducing the dog license with mandatory leads will significantly reduce dog attacks and should an attack take place that owner should rightfully take responsibility.",
