        "action": "Allow UK people to see their families in Europe without prohibitive testing cost",
        "additional_details": "We are campaigning for a solution to remove these prohibitive testing costs for people's.\r\nThis could include: \r\n1. Creating a vaccine certificate compatible with the EU green card system, which Norway, Switzerland and Iceland have pledged to do.\r\n2. Removing the need for expensive testing for children and vaccinated adults, for example by using the cheaper lateral flow test.\r\n 3. Allowing free NHS tests for those travelling to see family in Europe.",
        "background": "The current Covid rules mean that people that wish to visit their families in the EU face prohibitive costs. For example a family of 5 requires 1500 pounds worth of tests in total, which is unaffordable for most. Many adults and children have not seen their families in the EU for up to two years.",
