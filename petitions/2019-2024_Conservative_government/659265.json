        "additional_details": "Due to the small access road into the village, the significant increase of houses being build in the area, the access for lorries into the industrial estate, the severe congestion already at the A46 round into Witham in the mornings and evening (before the build site started), we call upon the Government to build slip roads on both sides of the A46 Witham St Hughs roundabout to aid access in and out of the village. It does make sense to do this now while the  building site is under construction.",
        "background": "Due to heavy congestion during rush hours at the A46 roundabout into Witham St Hughs, the industrial estate and a significantly sized building site currently being constructed in the village, this is creating significant delays in and out the village creating mayhem for commuting and school runs.",
