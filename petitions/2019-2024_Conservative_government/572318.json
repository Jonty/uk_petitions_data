        "additional_details": "We need a competent leader to guide us through these unprecedented times and Johnson is not that. He reacted too late to the pandemic and that is why we\u2019re in the situation we are today. He boasted that he shook hands with COVID patients on the day SAGE warned him not to which resulted in him catching COVID himself. Even he isnt following his own rules so how does he expect us to, New Zealand are back to normalitity due to competency and confidence in their leadership.",
