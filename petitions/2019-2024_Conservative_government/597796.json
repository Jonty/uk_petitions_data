        "action": "Do not add Fluoride to the UK Public Water Supply.",
        "additional_details": "Parents need to know that Fluoride is an extremely active chemical when it gets in to the human body. It can interfere with the Pineal gland and the thyroid gland. A real concern with babies especially is that the blood/brain barrier is not fully developed and when they drink a formula made with fluoridated water, they get an inappropriate dose of fluoride in their developing brain which could cause a loss of IQ. How are low-income families going to avoid giving their children fluoridated water?",
        "background": "After a statement from the UK Chief Medical Officers, Fluoride is expected to be added to drinking water across the UK. This should not be done as the benefit from fluoride on teeth is topical rather than systemic. There is no reason for people to have all their internal organs exposed to fluoride.",
