        "additional_details": "I think maybe 100mph is too dangerous at the moment especially with the infrastructure we have considering Germany has no limit but they do have 7 lane motorways which the UK doesn\u2019t have. \r\nHowever increasing the motorway limit to 80mph -90mph would be more efficient especially as we start to see more smart motorways and the introduction of electric cars meaning less pollution.  Cars are a lot of sophisticated from the 60s and our laws should reflect that.",
        "background": "The 70mph speed limit has been in 1967 when cars were more dangerous and not as well equipped. \r\n\r\nConsidering it\u2019s 2021 and we have more eco friendly, more sophisticated and more well designed automated cars it makes sense to increase motorway limits.",
