Even if the relationship breakdown is amicable and no need for court or solicitors being involved is a shambles, dads get no help from councils or the government and this needs to change as its discrimination on good hard working dads who only want to prove and be involved with their children.",

Single dads have no rights to housing to allow children to have their own bedrooms despite dads having access to their children in amicable breakups without court orders.",
