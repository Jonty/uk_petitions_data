        "additional_details": "We\u2019d like the government to either offer grants to all small businesses, even if they don\u2019t have premises, or to give directors who receive a small salary and are paid mainly in dividends the same support as PAYE and self employed people (up to \u00a32500 per month for 3 months). Many wonderful small businesses cannot afford to take out loans. We hope you will consider this.",
        "background": "Whist we appreciate the efforts the government has taken to compensate those affected by the Coronavirus, some are left without help. If you\u2019re a small business owner who is paid a small salary and receives the rest of their income through dividends there is no help other than to take out a loan.",
