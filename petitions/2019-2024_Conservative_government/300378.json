        "additional_details": "It was recently stated that universities would close early in a potential Coronavirus pandemic, yet during this time of paranoia and fear of contracting the virus A Level students are expected to perform as well as normal in the examinations that decide whether or not they go to the university of their dreams? This not only ensures lower results, but also forces added stress on young adults/adolescents who are the most likely age group to have pre-existing mental illnesses. How is this fair?",
        "background": "Give A Level students their predicted grades rather than forcing or delaying A Level examinations on paranoid and fearful students who would inevitably be at increased risk of catching the virus if they had to complete the examinations.",
