        "additional_details": "Civil rights that were so hard fought for are getting stripped away from a specific community that only makes up 1% of the UK population. Which is unfair and degrading to the transgender community, this also includes people that identify as non-binary. We should not let one person\u2019s view define how 600,000 people are treated, they have lives just as important as anyone else. Transgender activists like Martha P Johnson fought for freedom. Should we really put all their efforts to shame?",
        "background": "Our government should keep the civil rights of transgender individuals in the Equality Act. After the painstaking efforts, the transgender community had to fight to become equal to their cisgender counterparts it only makes sense the transgender community is on par with cisgender people.",
