As long as the father and family members are stable and safe to be around the child. Women. Should not be allowed to use their child as a weapon in a bitter breakup. Courts are not cheap and not all fathers can afford to take it to court. Especially when the father is on the birth certificate there should be more power to having access to your child without having to go down the court route.",

For ex; if there is a relationship breakdown the sole carer should not be allowed to stop the father/mother from seeing their child out of spite",
