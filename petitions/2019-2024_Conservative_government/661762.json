We deserve TRANSPARENCY!\r\nFamilies are PENALIZED: Unlike Europe, everyone in a UK family needs separate insurance. This system NEEDS an UPDATE!\r\nThe government is MISSING IN ACTION: We need stronger regulations to PROTECT consumers from PRICE GOUGING!\r\nBy demanding an investigation, clear pricing structures, and family-friendly policies, we can create a FAIRER car insurance system for ALL UK drivers.",

It is already possible to get car insurance that covers multiple people. Decisions about what car insurance products to offer are a matter for individual insurers, not the UK Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
