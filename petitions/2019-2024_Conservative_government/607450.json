        "additional_details": "Knife crime in the U.K. has risen year on year. Many children's and young adults lives have been cut short from knife crime. The law is too weak allowing a person to get caught carrying a knife without a prison sentence. The law needs to change so that anyone carrying a knife without a police permit serves a minimum of 7 years in prison. New police knife permits should be issued to people who have to legally carry a knife for their work or trade. These knife permits have to be renewed yearly.",
        "background": "Currently the maximum penalty for an adult carrying a knife is 4 years in prison and an unlimited fine. You\u2019ll get a prison sentence if you\u2019re convicted of carrying a knife more than once. Change this offence to 7 years in prison on first offence of carrying a knife.",
