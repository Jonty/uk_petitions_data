        "action": "Include a \"none of the above\" option on ballot papers for future UK elections",
        "additional_details": "At present voters can spoil their ballot paper to register dissatisfaction, and these spoilt papers are counted. However this does not seem to be widely used as an option; it is also not a very constructive way of registering dissatisfaction. This simple tweak, i.e. adding this option when printing the ballot papers, will allow all voters to register the fact that the options presented to them do not represent their wishes. This may also help to encourage participation and improve turnout.",
        "background": "All future elections, e.g. general, local, mayoral etc. should have an option on the ballot paper allowing voters to indicate that they do not wish to support any of the candidates in that particular vote. This can be done through the simple addition of this option at the bottom of the ballot paper.",
