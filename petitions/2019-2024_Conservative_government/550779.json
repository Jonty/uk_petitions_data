This is only made more dangerous by road users who do not have the basic knowledge of the highway code. Today, anyone can pick up a bike and go cycling on some of the busiest most congested roads in our big cities without knowing any of the Highway code. This not only causes a danger to cyclists themselves, but also other drivers and pedestrians.",
