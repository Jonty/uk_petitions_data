        "additional_details": "My daughter came home from her private student house when lockdown began. I lost all of my income as a Co Director and advised the Rent Management Company. Despite this, they kept sending demanding texts and emails for unpaid rent. I requested the Landlord apply for a mortgage holiday to which he declined. My daughter also has to pay deposit and half rent for July + August for next year despite no household income. This is causing stress to hundreds of students during these unprecedented times",
        "background": "Private Landlords should be waivering rent to students. Since lockdown began most students have been obliged to go home yet Landlords are still demanding rent. Landlords are entitled to apply for a mortgage holiday and from a moral & ethical perspective they should not be charging students rent",
