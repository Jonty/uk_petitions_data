        "additional_details": "Access to modern energy is an entitlement for every household and is therefore deemed a basic human right. The UK Govt should therefore ensure people have access to energy at an affordable rate during this Coronavirus pandemic. Thousands of employees have already been laid off due to uncertainty in these difficult times and the self employed and employees have been asked to stay at home. Energy should really be free or atleast subsidised during these crises to avoid households falling into a debt spiral",

Utility companies charging higher rates during working hours should be asked to reduce/relax charges.",
