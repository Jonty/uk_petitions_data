        "action": "Make available WEEKLY testing for COVID-19 for Home Care Workers urgently.",
        "additional_details": "This scheme has been rolled out in Care homes now and it is only fair to give other Carers in the sector the same opportunity to keep safe on the frontline. Currently it is perceived by many that the Government views the safety of Home Care workers as \u2018less\u2019 than Carers who work in a Care Home. \r\nNot only this but it is vital that we protect our Care Workers on the frontline as without them fighting healthy, they will be unable to help vulnerable people like me, which could be life threatening.",
        "background": "I, as well as many others, would like my Care Workers to be protected and treated with the respect they deserve by giving them weekly tests for COVID-19. \r\nThis will help to protect me, a member of society with complex health issues, and importantly my Care Workers who work tirelessly everyday.",
