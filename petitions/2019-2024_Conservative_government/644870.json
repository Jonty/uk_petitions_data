        "action": "Allocate funding to mitigate the impact of RAAC on St Leonard\u2019s, Durham",
        "additional_details": "Three of the four worst affected schools are in the North east demonstrating increasing inequality between the North East and the rest of the UK. Extensive academic research on the impact of learning during the Covid pandemic has demonstrated lower academic achievement, widening inequality and poor mental health from online learning. We need plans in place to rebuild St Leonard\u2019s now alongside a robust interim plan for full time f2f education for all pupils to prevent long-term adverse impact.",
        "background": "In 2010, the government cancelled the Building Schools for the Future programme. St Leonard\u2019s is one of the most seriously affected schools. We need investment now to ensure effective education for all children affected who are receiving on average only one day per week of face-to-face education.",
