        "additional_details": "Holyrood is an expensive failed experiment. Scots are taxed higher than anybody else in UK yet have poorer services. Education, health and many other core services are floundering. The voting system does not see reflected in the chamber a fair perspective of the views of the people of Scotland. The devolved Assembly has failed in all but creating unwelcome and unnecessary division in Scotland. The population need the opportunity to confirm their rejection of it and demand it\u2019s closure.",
        "background": "The Assembly at Holyrood is a waste of funds. It is a huge duplication and is not competent to manage simple tasks. The disastrous failures in hospitals, shipbuilding etc show how poor it is. HM Government should give the people of Scotland the chance to have it closed and to centralise operations.",
