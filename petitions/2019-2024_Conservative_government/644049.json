No selling/buying online (actually regulate this)\r\n- Actual punishments for animal abuse/neglect to be implement and tightened \r\n- Animal welfare education in our schools, so the next generation doesn\u2019t repeat this\r\n\r\nWith all due respect the attacks are not on the dogs, they are on the people in power ignoring the problems. \r\n\r\nWe are better than this. Let\u2019s come together and create a world without suffering together",

Whist some are neglected & abandoned\r\nIt\u2019s time we stop passing blame to innocent animal & create a solution",
