        "additional_details": "Animals should not be put down under any circumstances! Dogs typically become violent via the treatment they have received from owners and people in the past. Aside from this animals are killed merely because there isnt enough room or facilities to protect and look after them. We need more facilities and animal shelters in order to look after animals in order to prevent this and make it illegal to kill any animals. The only circumstance an animal should be put down Is when in pain with no end.",
        "background": "56 percent of dogs are put down in animal shelters when not rehomed, over 70 percent of cats are put down in animal shelters. If a dog attacks a staff member more than once, no matter the circumstances, they are put down. There are many other circumstances where animals are put down in shelters.",
