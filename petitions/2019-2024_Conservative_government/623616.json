Olive was our 5 month old kitten who died tragically in our tumble dryer. This could have been avoided if the person responsible was educated on the risks. Too many manufacturers hide the warning in difficult to read manuals. Manufacturers need to make it clear that there can be a danger to small animals and people if not handled properly.",
