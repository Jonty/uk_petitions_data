Students are paying full tuition fees and receiving minimal in- person contact hours at the discretion of the university. The government must take action and ensure that all teaching is delivered in person for as long as no legal social contact limits apply. Students are frustrated, lonely and have been pushed aside for the entirety of the pandemic. It is time to take action.",
