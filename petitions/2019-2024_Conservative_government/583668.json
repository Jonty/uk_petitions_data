        "additional_details": "Football is the peoples game. Increasingly greed has taken control of and corrupted it. The proposed European Super League will be a monopoly that will cripple grassroots football clubs and destroy the foundations of sporting fairness. \r\n\r\nThe FA has the power to sanction or remove from its competitions, any clubs that play in unauthorised competitions. In combination with this law, the Big 6 can be compelled to remain within the existing football pyramids.\r\n\r\nEarn it on the the Pitch\r\nSave Football",
        "background": "Legislation should be put in place to require all professional British clubs that are registered and play in the UK to be a member of at least 1 domestic UK FA sanctioned football competition. This will allow the FAs of the UK to prevent British clubs seceding from the British Football pyramids.",
