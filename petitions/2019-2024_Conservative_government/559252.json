We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nIt is already a legal requirement to wear face coverings in shops, and premises can take reasonable steps to promote compliance with the law. However, enforcing fines and criminal offences such as the above is a matter for law enforcement and other authorised bodies.\r\n\r\nSee: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own\r\n\r\nYou could start a petition calling for extra resource to support the police to enforce mask wearing in indoor settings including retail venues, if that's something you'd like to see happen."
