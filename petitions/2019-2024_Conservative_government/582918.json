        "action": "Make it illegal for all landlords to rent out damp & mould infested properties.",
        "additional_details": "Mould produces allergens and toxic substances. When inhaled mould fragments or spores can inflame the airways, causing nasal congestion, wheezing, chest tightness, coughing and throat irritation.\r\n\r\nProlonged exposure to high levels of indoor dampness can reduce lung function and cause chronic health problems such as asthma. Those who already suffer from asthma and allergies are more likely to have more severe symptoms when exposed.",
        "background": "As seen recently in the news, there are thousands of families living in mould infested properties in the UK.  We want to see landlords prosecuted if the problem is not fixed within 3 months of it being reported. Also for it to be made illegal to evacuate tenants for reporting the problem.",
