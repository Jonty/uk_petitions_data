        "additional_details": "It is incredibly frustrating for millions of people across the UK and around the world. People are being ripped off, scammed and mislead by these cyber criminals. \r\n\r\nIn my research, I have found that they use automated bots to constantly scan ALL retailers for a certain product such as the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, computer components and many more. \r\n\r\nThey then use proxy addresses, multiple accounts and VPNs to bypass any retailer restrictions. Clearly, we are not winning.\r\n\r\nPlease make a difference!",
        "background": "Market scalping is not new, it has been around for many years and UK law has already deemed ticket scalping illegal.\r\n\r\nNow hackers are exploiting retailers to buy mass stock of a product to resell at ludicrous prices.\r\n\r\nLike ticket scalping, any form of scalping should be deemed illegal.",
