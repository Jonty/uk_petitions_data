        "additional_details": "In the current situation with everything that is going on with this pandemic many universities are suspending teaching, some are switching to online classes. We should be refunded the difference in the fees paid as paying for online classes is far cheaper as seen with institutes such as Open university.  \r\nOur assessment, exams, placements and graduations will be effected. This is not what we paid \u00a39,250 a year for.  \r\n\r\nRefund the tuition fees we've paid while universities are closed",
        "background": "If its the government's decision or the universities themselves that have decided to close we should get refunds for the fees we are expected to pay during this time.\r\nThe cost for only teaching is substantially less than campus based, yet students are still footing the same bill of \u00a39,250 per year.",
