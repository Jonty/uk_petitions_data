We all still want to go. I could also name a number of other schools that are very disappointed in what had happened. Skiing in particular is a trip that happens rarely and me being in year 11 leaving my school this year this is the last time i can go on one as a school trip. However i\u2019m no longer allowed to. Me and people at my school are very upset",
