        "additional_details": "The UK faces immediate crises like the underfunding of the NHS and the global climate issue. Before spending billions of pounds on more nuclear warheads and new Dreadnought submarines to deploy them, we could better use that money to properly fund our NHS, ensuring an ongoing fit for purpose healthcare system for everyone, retrofit insulation to our housing and provide infrastructure for electric vehicles, improving the real everyday lives of UK citizens and ultimately citizens globally.",
        "background": "Step back from spending billions of pounds of public money on additional military nuclear capacity, thereby breaching our legal duties under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, and put the money to socially beneficial ends, such as on the NHS and tackling climate change.",
