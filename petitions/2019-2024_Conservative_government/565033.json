        "additional_details": "I want the government to allow couples that do not live together meet, I\u2019ve noticed a huge decrease in many friends mental health due to being away from the ones they love most. Forming a support bubble with each others households should be made legal as it is in Scotland. If both partners family\u2019s agree to form an extended household bubble there is no reason why this can\u2019t be made a rule. Mental health matters and many relationships are struggling now.",
        "background": "Being in a relationship is having a huge toll on people due to the covid lockdown which has been in place for almost a year. Allowing couples to move only between each others households should be permitted to prevent further stress and mental health issues that I see are starting to develop in many.",
