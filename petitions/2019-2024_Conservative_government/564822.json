July Christmas in 2021 could be an extraordinary, multi-faith, symbolic and unique national event. Losing Christmas to the pandemic feels like admitting defeat. Christmas isn\u2019t cancelled, it\u2019s not just a poorer, disappointingly \u2018different\u2019 version ...it\u2019s been moved. We\u2019re going to do it again, properly, as a unifying gesture of having come through this ...in JULY!",
        "background": "Pass the appropriate & necessary legislation to allow the UK to celebrate Christmas properly on 25th July 2021. This unique, once in a generation event, would be a national celebration of all those who sacrificed so much to help the rest of us through the challenges of the Covid pandemic.",
