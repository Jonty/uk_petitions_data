        "additional_details": "The government should consider changing this date to better support those who have been let go from jobs and have had to find new ones, or those who cannot work from home but have been forced out of work due to Tier restrictions. \r\n\r\nMost notable the addition of Tier 4 from the 19th December has meant many people have suddenly been put out of work due to going from Tier 2 to Tier 4 very suddenly.",
        "background": "Many people who cannot work from home and currently do not know where they will be financially one week to the next feel let down by the government. \r\n\r\nDue to the current cut off date for the Job Retention Scheme being the 30th, October, many people employed after this date cannot get any support.",
