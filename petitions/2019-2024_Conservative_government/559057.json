        "action": "Ban UK broadcasters from charging to watch football matches during lockdown.",
        "additional_details": "The return of free live football during lockdown gave a huge boost to many people at a very difficult time. Broadcasters were only allowed to show games on free-to-air channels. In doing so they were able to move kick off times in order to avoid matches clashing. Unsurprisingly, they have now taken advantage of the situation, maintaining all of the concessions they were granted while reneging on their side of the bargain. Expect to see more top games on PPV when the next schedule is released.",
        "background": "Revoke permission to broadcast all Premier League games unless they are free-to-air. Sky, BT Sport and BBC were granted permission to show all PL games during the first national lockdown to allow fans who are banned from stadia to watch their team. Sky and BT are now profiteering from COVID-19!",
