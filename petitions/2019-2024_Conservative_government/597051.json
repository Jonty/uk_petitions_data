        "action": "Scrap plans to raise National Insurance for workers earning below 100K per annum",
        "additional_details": "Over the last two years the government has overlooked social care issues in the UK & wasted money in other areas: \u00a337 Billion on test & trace, \u00a3220 Billion+ on Brexit (and more). The average British citizen did not choose to spend our money in this way and we should not have to pay for the mistakes made by the government when they would be detrimental to the quality of many lives. Raising the tax for the richest in society is the only logical and ethical way forward in the long-term.",
        "background": "Change the policy so that it applies to those who earn above 100K a year. In doing so, the rise will be less significant for those affected; especially as energy prices are rising too. Currently, the increase will cause those who already struggle to be forced into more detrimental circumstances.",
