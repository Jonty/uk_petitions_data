        "additional_details": "Violent crime has been rising in London and very little seems to be done to address it. An increasing amount of young people now claim to carry knives for their own protection. This measure will restore public confidence and reduce the number of assaults, intimidation or antisocial behaviour that school children and commuters experience daily on buses.",
        "background": "Knife crime in London must be tackled. We can start by introducing PCSOs on buses during the school run. A visible police presence will deter violence and anti-social behaviour that has become far too prevalent. This could be funded by limiting free travel to under 18s to 6am-9am and 3pm-6pm",
