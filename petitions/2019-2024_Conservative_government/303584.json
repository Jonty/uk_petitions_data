        "additional_details": "We have all seen the photos online and all over social media, elderly people, people with underlining serious health conditions who are most vulnerable to Covid19 standing infront of empty shelves in supermarkets. It is a shame that many panic buyers are purchasing in excess of what they actually need and leaving those who need it the most without, this is risking lives and the health of the people that need it the most. I would like to government to help enforce a time to allow those that need it the most to purchase in advance of others who are more healthy.",
        "background": "1. Allocate a time daily for elderly and those most vulnerable to Covid19 to shop for basic supplies in supermarkets. i.e 8am-10am.\r\n2. Priortise a time when stores are stocked up early in the day to allow those who need it most to purchase basic supplies and avoid the panic buyers",
