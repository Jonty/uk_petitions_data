        "additional_details": "The government should recognise that the country could not run without teachers, and that they are already underpaid as it is! The teacher pay cap should be lifted immediately, and pay rises should be awarded as normal in line with the performance of the individual!\r\nTeaching is a job with an incredibly high level of responsibility, and pay should reflect this- the government needs to prioritise and be thankful for key workers outside of the NHS also.",
        "background": "I think it is disgusting that the government has decided to cap the pay of our teachers, who have worked through the pandemic with little or no PPE, in close contact with students- in bubbles that do not work.",
