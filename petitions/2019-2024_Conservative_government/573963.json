        "action": "Allow Driving Theory Tests to be completed online through Proctors Exam System",
        "additional_details": "The Proctor Exam system is the same system used by medical students to complete their exams while still maintaining exam like conditions online. By doing this, it eliminates the opportunity to cheat. This would be highly beneficial to those waiting on a test as it allows them to be examined in their own home, safe. With current COVID guidelines, I believe this would be the most beneficial, safe and honest solution to avoid 6-month long waits.",
        "background": "Millions of people have had theory tests booked, cancelled and unable to reschedule due to current COVID-19 guidelines. To ensure maximum integrity of the test and ensure safety to all, I would like the government to allow the DVSA to proceed with Theory Tests online.",
