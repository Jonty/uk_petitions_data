There are no lucrative television contracts to keep the club afloat whilst spectators are unable to attend. The strength of English football is solely reliant on the health of the \"football pyramid\". If the lower leagues crumble, the top flight suffers too.\r\n\r\nIt is vital (and perfectly feasible), for spectators to attend matches at this level on a socially distanced basis, whilst upholding the Government's rule of 6.",
        "background": "Football clubs at National League Level (and below) rely entirely on match day income generated from fans to survive. These community driven clubs are often operated with the help of dedicated volunteers and any money raised from ticket sales is generally reinvested straight back into the clubs.",
