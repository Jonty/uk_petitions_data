        "action": "Automatic loss of parental responsibility when someone is proved to be abusive",
        "additional_details": "A lot of children are forced to be in contact with abusive parents and are mentally and physically abused. I think if someone poses a risk to a child or other parent they shouldn\u2019t be allowed contact or control over the child and other parent. A lot of abusers use parental responsibility as a way to continue control and abuse and this causes a lot of problems not only for the safe parent but also the child.",
        "background": "I would like perpetrators of domestic abuse to automatically loose parental responsibility when there is evidence of abuse and would be a risk if exposed to a child or other parent",
