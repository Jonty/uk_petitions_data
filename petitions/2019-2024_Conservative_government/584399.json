        "action": "Introduce a recycle system like Pfand in germany.",
        "additional_details": "I want the government to do this as it would help towards recycling and keeping the country clean, litterless, and the oceans/rivers/lakes clean. I believe that if people are given an incentive to do this, then it would influence people to do the right thing for the country and its wildlife. I believe ,as a young person, that people my age will be more likely to recycle, as wll as their families, if they know that recycling hold value instead of just shunning the fact we are killing the earth.",
        "background": "I would like that we introduce this system as it encourages people to recycle and it helps influence people to stop littering as the bottles/cans they have in their hand holds value. In Germany, it is effective and i see no cans/bottles on the floor.",
