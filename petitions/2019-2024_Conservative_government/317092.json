        "additional_details": "The reasons for this is it's good for an active lifestyle. Prevents relationships breaking down in this hard time due to people been in each others faces all day. Good to get the kids out doing outdoor activities instead of been stuck in house living on internet and youtube. It's got good educational purposes learning about natural wildlife while missing out on a school education at the present minute in time. It's more dangerous going to the supermarket or even work than it is fishing even if you are a key worker.",
