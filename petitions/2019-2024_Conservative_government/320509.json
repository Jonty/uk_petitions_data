        "additional_details": "We are amongst the strangest,toughest times of our lives right now. And with the biggest death toll in Europe it is clearly too soon for teachers and children to return. Children would surely be carriers of the virus? Teachers are then at risk of contracting it or then becoming carriers themselves passing it to people they live with, or come into contact with be it at home or work. As much as children\u2019s education is important surely their health is more important.  They are not the country\u2019s guinea pigs. School return should be pushed back !",
        "background": "No to sending schools back in June it\u2019s too soon. Our teachers and children are not guinea pigs to trial this experiment on. When parliament are all happy to go back into the House of Commons it will obviously be safe enough for our teachers and children to return also.",
