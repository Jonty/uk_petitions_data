        "action": "Allow Churches to Meet for Traditional Services",
        "additional_details": "There are many people of faith throughout the UK who would welcome the return of traditional services.  It gives them a means to worship God and learn about Him.  It also gives them the opportunity to pray together for their own needs, for the needs of others in their communities, and for those in government.  As nurses and doctors offer physical help, churches offer spiritual and emotional help, which is just as important in this current crisis.",
        "background": "We would like government to allow churches to resume holding traditional services.  Many churches have small congregations and it would be easy for them to practice social distancing.  Churches can also hold multiple services, allowing them to minister to their congregation in small groups.",
