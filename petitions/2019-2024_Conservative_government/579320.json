        "additional_details": "The lack of education and information spread causes so many misconceptions which can be harmful later in life.\r\nAdditionally, children aren\u2019t talked to about sex education young enough. Year 7 should be the year that sex education is taught in detail and there should be a mandatory week dedicated to sex education and it should be this way up until students are in year 10.",
        "background": "Sex education has always been lacking in the UK with poor information which doesn\u2019t talk about important things such as pleasure, stereotypes etc. Additionally, sexual assault isn\u2019t discussed so people don\u2019t understand a lot of it and people grow up not knowing what is or isn\u2019t sexual assault.",
