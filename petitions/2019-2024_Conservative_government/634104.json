        "additional_details": "The Equality act legally protects people from discrimination in the workplace and wider society, such as sex, race and disability.\r\n\r\nHowever many neurodivergent people feel they are different not disabled, and are therefore not protected.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the Equality Act 2010 not only protects sex, but sexual preference and gender reassignment, it's important to protect neurodivergent people and will encourage more neurotypical people to learn about neurodiversity, ADHD, Autism, PDA, etc.",
        "background": "I want Government/Parliament to add Neurocognition to the list of protected characteristics in the Equality Act 2010.\r\n\r\nThis is an important first step in recognising and protecting Neurodivergent people.",
