        "additional_details": "I am the founder of a social media mental health awareness campaign called Walk the Mind. We have over 34,000 members and we see and hear first hand every day the impact mental health issues and illness has on every single one of us on a daily basis. By reviewing our spending, services and education we can prevent an unprecedented mental health crisis. Parity of esteem in 21st century Britain is an absolute must.",
        "background": "I am starting this petition to push for parity of esteem between mental and physical health in the UK. We need an urgent review by our government due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
