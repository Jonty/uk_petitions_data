        "additional_details": "I am thinking temporary installations that are more convenient to use than regular toilets i.e. at the entrance to classrooms, within trains, or near escalators on train stations.  This would be far more effective in curbing the spread of the virus and would encourage people to go about their daily lives with less worry.  This should be done as quickly as possible.",
        "background": "A simple and effective way to curb the spread of Covid-19 would be to install as many handwashing stations in public places as possible, like train stations and schools.",
