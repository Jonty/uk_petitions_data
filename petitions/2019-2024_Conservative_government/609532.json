According to ONS data, 49.9% of pupils in the UK achieved passes in both Maths & English GCSEs.\r\nFailure in these exams at age 16 should not exclude future study at level 4, 5 or 6.\r\nSchool does not always produce a successful outcome & those who have ambition & interest in changing their educational path should not be prevented from applying at 18+ by failure at a youthful 16.",
        "background": "The current Augar Review proposals suggest student finance applicants should have passed GCSE Marhs & English age 16.\r\nThis will greatly impact on ethnically diverse & working class students gain access to HE who may otherwise have had successful outcomes in Higher Education at a later age.",
