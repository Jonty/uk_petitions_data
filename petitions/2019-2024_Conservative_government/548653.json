        "additional_details": "As I work in industry and can see the difference day by day, the eat out help out scheme really helped the restaurant businesses to start recovering. But what happens when this is going to end on 31st of August?  Monday to Wednesday feels like 2nd weekend and restaurants have been busier than ever. \r\nExtending the scheme until end of September will encourage restaurants to open full time and start hiring.That means even more people will be going out to eat. Some people are finding out about the scheme now, on 3rd week. \r\nThe food suppliers have started recovering too as well as the farmers, bakers, fishermen etc.\r\nIf the scheme will end, probably many restaurants will be closed again these 3 days and work part time.",
