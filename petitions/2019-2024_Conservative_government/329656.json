No visits are traumatic and the Human Rights Act, Article 8- Rights to Family Life has been denied. \r\nPatients are dealing with life changing cancer diagnoses and expected to undergo intensive treatment themselves, staying for more >4 weeks with no loved one to be with them.\r\nNo updates from clinicians to the next of kin adds further distress.",
        "background": "Patients are going through intensive cancer treatments. Pre covid, loved ones were allowed to visit and given PPE. Now being denied and kept in isolation for weeks. Loved ones care 24/7 for the patients at home and during Covid. Worst, no transparency on the level of care being received.",
