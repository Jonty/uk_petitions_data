        "additional_details": "A permanent extension of stamp duty threshold could provide a fiscal surplus of \u00a3139m per year, generated by higher consumption and increased housing market activity, according to Kensington Mortgages. \r\n\r\nKensington's analysis shows that higher property values could lead to SDLT, LBTT, and LTT receipts generating \u00a3256 million in additional revenues each year. Combined, higher property values and transaction numbers could generate \u00a3523 million of annual revenues to the Treasury.",
        "background": "Newly released research has highlighted how many homebuyers could benefit each year should the government permanently increase the tax thresholds. The current stamp duty holiday has helped boost demand amongst homebuyers. \r\n\r\nThe archaic tax should be revised as it encourages owners to stay put.",
