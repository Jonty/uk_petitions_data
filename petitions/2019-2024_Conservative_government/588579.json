        "action": "Ban the sale of petrol powered garden tools with a view to phasing out their use",
        "additional_details": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that, around the world, more fuel is lost when filling lawnmowers & other garden equipment every year than the oil that was lost in the Exxon Valdez disaster.\r\nPetrol machinery also produces a variety of airborne pollutants that can impair breathing & aggravate existing heart & lung conditions.\r\nA Swedish study has also found that the emissions from a petrol mower used for one hour are equivalent to those released by a car on a 100-mile journey.",
        "background": "With the world in the grips of an environmental crisis, and a wide range of alternative technology available, there is absolutely no excuse for the continued use of garden tools that pollute the atmosphere with chemicals and noise, damage people's health and perpetuate our reliance on fossil fuels.",
