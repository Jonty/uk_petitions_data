        "additional_details": "Industry are beginning to mandate vaccination , which is unethical and discriminatory. The government need to intervene with immediate effect to make it clear that this should not be at their discretion. Our freedom has been limited for a whole year and we must accept that viruses are nothing new and continue to live with them whilst attempting to reintroduce some normality into society. Taking away our freedom is not the way forward. We must be allowed to make our own decisions as individuals.",
        "background": "Prohibit industry from requiring mandatory vaccination  in order to access jobs/travel/services etc. They are unqualified to implement such a requirement.  We must not allow our freedoms to be further curtailed as has been the case for the past year.",
