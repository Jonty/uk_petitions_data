        "additional_details": "I think the government should increase the threshold to \u00a370k and include both couples income. It's very unfair policy. People that earn more than \u00a350k in combined income can keep their child benefit. People on a single income of \u00a350k can struggle with young children.",
        "background": "I think it is very unfair of the government to cut child benefit for those families who have one earner over \u00a350k. How about the couples who earn far more in combined income. They can keep their child benefit. Where's the justice in this?",
