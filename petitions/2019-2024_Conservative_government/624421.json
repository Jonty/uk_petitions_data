        "additional_details": "In a cost of living crisis where Energy & Water PLC's are effectively profiteering from the chaos, the least that can be done to help alleviate the cause & effect of this on the public is for Government to legislate to abolish the standing charge. When these PLCs should be addressing core failures in their business model, they are increasing costs & taking handouts. This does not address the issue. People are struggling & as the PLCs can't be trusted to do the right thing this needs intervention",
        "background": "Standing charges on energy & water adversely affect the poorest in our society. At a time when energy & water PLCs are making huge profits, paying their senior staff eye-watering salaries & making huge payouts to shareholders this is punitive and immoral. The Government needs stop this injustice",
