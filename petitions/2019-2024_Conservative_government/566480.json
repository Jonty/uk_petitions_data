        "additional_details": "The weekly course hours have also been dramatically reduced for part and full time courses. Although blended or online teaching can take place, this is of no use in the practical field and for assessments.\r\nYet students will still be burdened with the full cost and paying back any loans they have had to take out for a minimised education and training.",
        "background": "Wipe all debt acquired by UK students for the period 2020-2021. Some skills need to be practiced physically and sometimes on others to gain real time experience; this is not possible through a computer screen. Students are paying for a service and not getting it and being stuck with the debt.",
