I want them to be able to live on a planet that is healthy and well cares for by its human inhabitants. \r\n\r\nWe have the means, but we don't have the time. We need our leaders to take care of our children's future and to use their power to make positive change. Working nationally and at regional and community level, leaders can make this happen.",

Agree to a Green new deal that takes the climate crisis seriously and does everything that it can to reverse the damage. Invest in rewilding, local food, local energy and climate emergency centres.",
