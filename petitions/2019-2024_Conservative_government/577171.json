        "additional_details": "Much of the money used to fund the development of medicines/vaccines for COVID-19 is public money. Thus, it is inappropriate to funnel much of this money back into profits for Big Pharma at the cost of high COVID-19 rates in other countries. \r\nFurthermore, high infection rates Worldwide increase the chance of the new strains with possible immunity to our current vaccines.",
        "background": "The government currently supports the intellectual property system relating to COVID-19 vaccines on the world stage. This will limit the production of vaccines whilst supporting Big Pharma. The government has the responsibility to make these vaccines available during this global struggle.",
