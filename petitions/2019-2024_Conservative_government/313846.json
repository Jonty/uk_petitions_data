        "additional_details": "Students are experiencing significant financial and personal hardship due to Covid-19. Most universities have recognised this and have allowed students not to pay summer term rent payments. Some private companies are demanding students pay 100% of their rent for the summer term. If students return to the accommodation they would be going against Government advice and putting themselves and others at risk. We want to negotiate a fair and reasonable compromise.",
        "background": "Private student accommodation companies should be open to negotiation around rent payments due to COVID-19. Manor Villages and private student accommodation companies are demanding rent for the summer term even though students cannot return to their accommodation due to Coronavirus.",
