        "action": "Prohibit the Sale/Use of Glue Traps in the UK",
        "additional_details": "It's impossible to regulate the use of these traps, and any amount of time an animal is stuck to the trap it will be suffering. It will likely die of starvation or stress before it's discovered to be killed. \r\n\r\nWhilst the traps are designed for rodents they are indiscriminate; other wildlife and even pets have been injured or killed after becoming trapped.\r\n\r\nThe only solution is a total ban on the sale or use of glue traps.",
        "background": "Current legislation states that glue traps are legal to use and the onus is on the user to ensure they're only used as a last resort, and that they're checked regularly so that any animals caught can be humanely killed. This needs to be reviewed and the sale and use of glue traps should be banned.",
