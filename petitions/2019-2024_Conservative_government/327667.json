        "additional_details": "the government is controlled by the Saudis. the Saudis have organised attacks on civilian targets and the Yemen people are suffering. I hate to accuse but some may suggest that world\u2019s governments don\u2019t do anything about it because that would break ties with the Saudis who provide them oil. I think that military action should be provided aswell but that is my opinion and that should only be used as a last resort",
