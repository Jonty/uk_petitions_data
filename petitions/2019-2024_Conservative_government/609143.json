        "action": "Impose a windfall tax on the oil & gas industry",
        "additional_details": "Over the past year the huge rise in global oil and gas prices has provided oil and gas companies with vastly expanded profits. BP has just announced 2021 profits of \u00a39.5bn (compared with a loss of \u00a34.2bn the year before) and Shell \u00a314bn (a four-fold increase). If these additional profits were taxed, the revenues could be used to help reduce energy bills for hard-pressed consumers.",
        "background": "While the likes of Shell and BP make colossal profits, consumers face huge bills. The solution is morally and economically clear - impose a windfall tax on the oil & gas industry",
