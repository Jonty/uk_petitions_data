        "additional_details": "Under Driver Identity Section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 registered owner of the vehicle can be charged 6pts and up to a \u00a31000 fine. As a commuter, I have been a victim of multiple crimes when the car was weaponised against me. Many experienced the same. Failing to name the driver should result in an instant driving ban, vehicle seizure and default to the registered owner as the driver during the event. As for legal entities, it should result in a fine being percentage of their turnover.",
        "background": "Compared to other countries, i.e. Ireland, drivers committing traffic or criminal offences decide to not name the driver in order to avoid more serious charges. Fixed penalty, often given in absence provides them time to further obstruct justice. That allows i.e. weaponising the car against others.",
