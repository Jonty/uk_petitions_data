        "action": "Provide a form of acknowledgment for babies lost prior to 24 weeks.",
        "additional_details": "According to the Charity Tommy's, 1 in 4 pregnancies end in loss. This means there is a huge percentage of the adult population who have lived through this experience, often multiple times. Pregnancies lost prior to 24 weeks are not officially recognised and this is exacerbated by the pervasive view that pregnancy loss is just 'one of those things'. The result leaves couples often feeling alone in their grief with a sense that their baby didn't count and/or was forgotten by others.",
        "background": "By providing a Baby Loss Memorial Book and Commemorative Certificate to parents of babies lost prior to 24 weeks (recently announced by the Scottish Government) we can address the sense of loneliness often experienced by couples following miscarriage and support them through the grieving process.",
