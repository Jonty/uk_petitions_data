        "additional_details": "For the 2020 University entry make sure UK students are prioritised over non-UK students as currently 20.4% of places are given to non-UK students. UK students should have their University offers honored even if Universities are over subscribed as A-level results will be estimated on UCAS predicted grades which would be generally higher than exam results due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Though this will have a impact on University finances as Non-UK students are charged more put UK students first.",
        "background": "Non-UK students now account for more than 485,000 of the 2.38 million higher education students at UK universities, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, Universities will be over subscribed with UK students they gave offers to. The UK government should prioritise UK students over Non-UK students.",
