        "additional_details": "I personally disapprove of the fact that men can get free contraception at a certain age to have protected sex despite sex being a choice, where as women don\u2019t have a choice of whether they want to have a period or not but they still have to pay a lot of money for tampons and period pads. Even by making something that is similar to a C-Card but for women would be a start to making a difference for young women who are in need of assistance.",
        "background": "Sanitary products are have increased in price due to this current pandemic making it harder for many women in the UK to be able to afford them. By making them free it would save all women a large amount of money throughout their lifetime.",
