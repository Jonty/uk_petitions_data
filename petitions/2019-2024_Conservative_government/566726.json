        "additional_details": "Parliament has completely neglected universities throughout the whole pandemic, showing 0 guidance or empathy towards them. Mental health issues are increasing among students as many aren\u2019t receiving the same guidance and access to resources that they normally would have; to allow them to complete their exams and assignments efficiently. This has left many in a frenzy, as they\u2019re not receiving the proper amount of attention that comes with the \u00a39,000+ fee and are unable to produce quality work.",
        "background": "I want parliament to: lessen the work load for uni students, to cancel major exams and allow some leniency to the amount of work students are able to produce in the current circumstances as they no longer have full access to the resources that they would utilise to aid their work.",
