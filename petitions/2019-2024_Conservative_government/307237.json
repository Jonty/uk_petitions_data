        "additional_details": "The Government has stated they will support those in employment by covering 80% of wages yet have left the self-employed to apply for support through the complicated universal credit system where the most they can get is around \u00a35,000pa. It is also unclear who is able to claim when savings and partner's income are taken into account. There are 5 million self-employed people in the UK, making up 15% of the labour force. It is only right to treat this extrememly valuable sector equally.",
        "background": "Support the self-employed by setting up a simple system where they can apply for significant income support regardless of any savings or partner's income. This is not taken into consideration for supporting the employed through this crisis so why should it be for the self-employed?",
