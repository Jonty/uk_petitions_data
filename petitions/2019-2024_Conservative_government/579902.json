        "additional_details": "Wildlife already have limited space due to human expansion and are suffering greatly due to human behaviour. Demolishing areas full of trees, shrubs, plants etc to make way for a corporation such as supermarkets is only adding to the problem instead of helping to reduce it.\r\nCorporations should be required to counterbalance the loss of wildlife habitat when building by creating protected areas for wildlife to reside and clearly display to the public what exactly they have done to offset the loss.",
        "background": "Make it mandatory for corporations to build new wildlife habitats when demolishing existing areas wildlife reside. If it is an area that has trees/plants growing and therefore clearly wildlife living there, then new wildlife habitats should be built to counterbalance the loss of habitat for animals.",
