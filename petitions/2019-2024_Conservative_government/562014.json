        "additional_details": "The injustice is self-evident, but regardless:-\r\n\r\n1. MP's current pay of 82k is already over \u00a350k more than the average salary and MP's get considerable expenses and subsidised food & drink. They can easily cope with current economical woes.\r\n\r\n2. 100's of thousands lost jobs. Furloughed have taken a 20% pay cut. The rest have nothing. To keep a pay rise now is unconscionable.\r\n\r\n3. Other leaders have taken pay cuts. Public sector workers a pay freeze. This is simply unjust.\r\n\r\nDo the right thing.",
        "background": "If the proposed pay rise from IPSA goes ahead, as MP's cannot themselves turn down the raise, I want all MP's to form a cross party alliance to pledge to the public that they will arrange for the net difference in their take home pay be donated to the NHS or charity of an equally worthy cause.",
