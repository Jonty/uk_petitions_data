        "additional_details": "1. Tolls are unfair and arbitrary in where and how they are applied. They are an inefficient way of charging for the use of roads and can increase congestion and pollution. \r\n\r\n2. In the current crisis it is important to give the economy some relief and this can be done at a relatively low cost by suspending tolls. This has already happened in China.\r\n\r\n3. A lot of people that the UK need to carry on working are increasingly likely to have to travel to work by their own transport.\r\n\r\n4. Many tolls are wholly or partly cash tolls. There is a relatively high risk of spreading disease because there is a quick turn around of the cash.",
        "background": "The Government should suspend all road tolls, river crossing tolls and 'congestion charges' for at least 12 months because of the Coronavirus COCVD19 epidemic. \r\nWhere this needs additional powers then they should be sought from Parliament.",
