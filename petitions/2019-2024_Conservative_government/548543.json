        "additional_details": "The current system lacks fairness. It unjustly affects individuals based on where they go to school. It is arbitrary in its impact, and lacks a transparent and justified connection with the real efforts of individuals. It is demonstrably discriminatory, even if that is not the intention. The algorithm reflects the Government's decision to prioritise the overall pattern of results, disregarding the exceptional circumstances of 2020, at the expense of the interests of students and society.",
        "background": "I want the Government to scrap the algorithms used to award A-Level and GCSE grades and revert, for this academic year, to predicted grades provided by schools.",
