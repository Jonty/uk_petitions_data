Too many parents alienate, groom and condition their children to hate and ultimately cease contact with their mother or father. For the child, this has long lasting and far reaching psychological consequences and impacts on their education and mental health. For parents, its devastating, lives are ruined and relationships between children and their parents destroyed. \r\n\r\nThis should be a crime for those responsible.",
