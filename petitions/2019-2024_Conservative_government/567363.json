        "additional_details": "Universities have not listened to student unions or student pleas despite requests en mass. Even though we pay tuition, the only input and guidelines they will respond to in a timely manner are those set by the government. Many of us have spent our entire savings to go to university only to have a terrible experience this year and to top it all off, are expected to produce exceptional work under extreme stress. We need a rule set in place that the university cannot refuse or ignore.",
        "background": "Students have had minimal support and resources during the pandemic over the last 10 months, yet are expected to turn in assignments the same as any other year. Both undergraduates and postgraduates are struggling academically as well as mentally and financially. We need a no detriment policy.",
