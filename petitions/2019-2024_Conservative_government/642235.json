ET is a incurable and debilitating illness that worsens with age. It can also take a toll on people's work life if they have the condition.\r\n \r\nWe want the Government to get Essential Tremor recognised as a disability so that people with ET are protected under the Equality Act 2010. We believe this will ensure doctors take ET more seriously and provide better care and treatment for their patients with the condition. We think this will also help to prevent discrimination against people with the condition.",
