        "action": "Ban the sale and use of all fireworks due to the pollution they cause.",
        "additional_details": "Fireworks cause extensive air pollution in a short amount of time, leaving metal particles, dangerous toxins, harmful chemicals and smoke in the air for hours and days. Some of the toxins never fully decompose or disintegrate, but rather hang around in the environment, poisoning all they come into contact with. The UK government should have already made this decision especially with Covid19 present. Other countries have banned them for this reason, it's time the UK government did also.",
        "background": "We want the government to act responsibly during this pandemic and ban fireworks sale/use altogether and seek cleaner, safer alternatives. Fireworks cause air pollution-air pollution causes respiritory problems-Covid19 thrives on respiritory problems. This needs done before the festive period 2020.",
