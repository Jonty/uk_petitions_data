        "action": "Amend the British Museum Act 1963 so as to enable the repatriation of artefacts.",
        "additional_details": "The 'Elgin' Marbles rightfully belong to Greece. Their removal from the Parthenon in the early 19th century and their later placement in the British Museum constituted no less than ruthless imperialism. It is highly objectionable and unfortunate that the Trustees of the British Museum, by virtue of the British Museum Act, have the ability to ignore the continuation of this injustice. Now is the time to change the law so as to facilitate the return of the Marbles.",
        "background": "The British Museum Act 1963 does not make provision for the widely supported permanent return of the 'Elgin' (Parthenon) Marbles to Greece. In the name of justice and decency, Parliament must respond to the British public's calls for the repatriation of the Marbles by amending the Act.",
