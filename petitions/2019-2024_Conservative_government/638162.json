        "action": "Allow parents to take children out of school for up to 5 days per year",
        "additional_details": "For years, the government has asserted that taking kids out of school during term time to save money on holidays was wrong. However, many families have been unable to afford vacations during school holidays. My children lost 5 school days this year due to the government saving money on teachers' salaries! This demonstrates that 100% attendance is not as vital as money savings. The rules should be the same for both, parents and the government. We just ask for equal rights.",
        "background": "We propose that the UK government reviews the existing guidelines and allows parents the flexibility to take their children on holidays for up to 5 days during term time. This adjustment would strike a balance between the importance of education and the value of family experiences.",
