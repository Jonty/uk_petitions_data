        "additional_details": "A third of the UK bee population is thought to have vanished in a decade, yet up to three-quarters of crop species are pollinated by bees, studies show.\r\n\r\nA 2017 study in the UK, Germany and Hungary found a link between higher levels of neonicotinoid residues and lower bee reproduction, with fewer queens in bumblebee hives and fewer egg cells in solitary bee nests.\r\n\r\nEvidence suggests the pesticides harm bee brain development, weaken immune systems and can leave bees unable to fly.",
        "background": "Neonicotinoids where banned however the Environment secretary George Eustice has recently agreed to them being allowed to be used again. I would like this decision to be overturned, Neonicotinoids banned once again and action taken to help save our bees.",
