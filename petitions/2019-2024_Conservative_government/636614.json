        "additional_details": "The standard for the dvsa practical driving test requires the learner to be fully proficient in driving and manoeuvres. \r\nThere is a 3 month back log in most popular test centres for practical driving tests this is a lot to do with the fact the pass rate is around fifty percent clogging the system.\r\nThe unprivileged poorer people are unable to afford driving lessons costing as much as \u00a350 per hour.. \r\nI believe a learner should be tested on basic driving awareness and nothing more. After gaining his licence he will pick up the full driving experience and eventually become a confident well skilled driver. \r\nThis would create less back logs in test centres seeing as more people would pass and allow the unprivileged people to acquire a license seeing as less lessons would be necessary.",
