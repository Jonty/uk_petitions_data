        "action": "The man, The man: Change the Sexual Offences Act so rape is gender neutral",
        "additional_details": "Under the current Uk legislation, the definition of rape only focuses on a male forcibly penetrating another person and completely disregards the forcible penetration by the individual being penetrated, which has similar psychological effects on the victim. The current law places these acts under 'Causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent', which not only undermines the individual experience but has a lesser sentence compared to a rape crime (life vs 10 years imprisonment).",
        "background": "Under Current Uk legislation, within the 'Sexual Offences Act 2003', rape can only be committed by a male with a penis, the focus is on him penetrating another person without consent. This petition aims to change the legislation to ensure a rape offence is taken from a gender neutral perspective.",
