        "additional_details": "Due to the current pandemic which is putting this country in financial turmoil. I believe this would save us if not better our current situation. The money alone saved on police investigations is enough to consider. The main benefit would be taxing the sale of it, I also believe that regulating the sale and cultivation with a license cost will have a major impact. The positives completely outweigh the negatives on this. Just look at Canada and the states in the US. Put it to the people to decide",
