There are people with sensitivities and PTSD that can't bear to see or hear Fireworks because of how traumatising it is for them. It can also kill off animals that are important to our environment e.g. bees, they collect pollen for honey and with Fireworks they can be killed off due to shock. As well as day to day pets that have been in armed forces and kill them dye to the stress it brings to them.",
