        "action": "Implement compulsory registration for all social care workers across England",
        "additional_details": "The protection and safeguarding of vulnerable people receiving social care is crucial. Sadly, we still see coverage in the media about people being subjected to dreadful abuse, and one incident that amplifies this was the treatment of vulnerable adults within the Winterbourne View residential setting which was exposed by the BBC's Panorama programme undercover investigation in 2011.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of compulsory registration will enable the barring of workers who are found guilty of abuse.",
        "background": "Following Matt Hancock's (Secretary of State for Health and Social Care) announcement on the 15/04/2020 to recruit thousands of new social care staff, the time is now right for Government to implement compulsory registration of all current social care workers and for those who are new to the sector.",
