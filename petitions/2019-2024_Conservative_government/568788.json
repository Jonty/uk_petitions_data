        "additional_details": "The gap between receiving the 1st and 2nd shot has increased from 3 weeks to 3 months. This is an approach BioNTech and Pfizer have warned was never tested during trials.\r\nThe vaccine is therefore being used 'off-label', outside of tested usage parameters, and this increases the risk of an 'escaped mutant' variant becoming resistant to the vaccine. Given what's at stake, the UK should follow official guidance from WHO and the vaccine manufacturers and not gamble based on untested assumptions.",
        "background": "The UK Government has made the decision to administer the 2nd COVID Vaccine up to 12 weeks after the first vaccination. \r\n\r\nThis is against WHO advice and has a 'small but real' risk of creating an 'escaped mutant' variant which would be resistant to the Vaccine, posing a global threat to lives.",
