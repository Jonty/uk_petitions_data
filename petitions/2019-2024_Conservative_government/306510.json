        "additional_details": "The loss of Summer term from the 2019/2020 academic year has huge social implications for the young. Students in years 6, 11 and 13 are being robbed of a \u2018right of passage\u2019 which would usually be taken for granted. \r\nThe opportunity to say goodbye to friends going to different schools, universities or work. The end of year productions, parties and proms. \r\nAllowing 2 weeks of closure to help heal the social wounds caused by this crisis will undoubtedly be beneficial to their ongoing mental health.",
        "background": "The Covid-19 crisis is undeniably putting immense strain on all sectors of the community and the government\u2019s decision to close schools is entirely justified. Allow students to return to their current year group for 2 weeks in September in order to minimise the negative social impact of the crisis.",
