            "details": "We know that the cost of childcare is a key concern for parents which is why the government has made an unprecedented investment in childcare over the past decade.\r\n\r\nAll three- and four-year-olds in England are entitled to 15 hours of free childcare each week, providing children with high-quality early education and helping parents to return to work. Disadvantaged families in England are also eligible for 15 hours of free early education a week for their two- year-old children. \r\n \r\n30 hours free childcare was introduced in England in September 2017 and is an entitlement for working parents of three- and four-year-olds, benefitting around 345,700 children in January 2020. It aims to help working parents with the costs of childcare so they can take up paid work if they want to or can work additional hours. To be eligible, both parents, or a single parent, must earn the equivalent of 16 hours a week at national minimum/ living wage (for parents aged 23 or over, this would work out at just over \u00a37,400 per year) and less than \u00a3100,000 per year. \r\n\r\nAll the department\u2019s entitlements provide free early education for parents across 38 weeks of the year. They can also be \u201cstretched\u201d if parents wish to use fewer hours over more weeks and this is an option their childcare provider offers.\r\n\r\nWe have spent over \u00a33.5bn in each of the past three years on our early education entitlements and the government continues to support families with their childcare costs. The Chancellor announced on 25 November 2020 a \u00a344 million investment for 2021-22, for local authorities to increase hourly rates paid to childcare providers for the government\u2019s free childcare entitlement offers.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the free early education entitlements, the government offers Tax-Free Childcare for children from 0-11 years old, or up to 16 if disabled. This scheme means that for every \u00a38 parents pay their provider via an online account, the government will pay \u00a32 \u2013 up to a maximum contribution of \u00a32,000 per child each year, or \u00a34,000 if disabled.\r\n \r\nWorking parents on a low income may also be eligible for help with up to 85% of their childcare costs through Universal Credit Childcare. This is subject to a monthly limit of \u00a3646 for one child or \u00a31108 for two or more children, payable in arrears. \r\n\r\nData published by Ofsted shows that the number of childcare places available in providers on the Early Years Register as of August 2020 has remained broadly stable since August 2015.  \r\n\r\nThe Department currently offers a range of support to early years settings during the pandemic, such as the furlough scheme (where settings have experienced a drop in either their income from parents or government), Business Rates Relief Nurseries Discount and support from the Recovery Loan Scheme. \r\n\r\nAs childminders are usually self-employed, they may benefit from the continuation of the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme.\r\nFurther information regarding business support packages can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus/business-support\r\n\r\nWe are committed to supporting the sector to develop a workforce with the appropriate knowledge, skills and experience to deliver high quality early education and childcare. We are investing \u00a320m in high quality, evidence-based professional development for practitioners in targeted disadvantaged areas.\r\n\r\nIn February 2021, we announced a further \u00a310m for a pre-reception early language recovery programme to support early years staff in settings, and in June, we announced a further investment of up to \u00a3153 million over three academic years, including funding for training early years staff to support the very youngest children\u2019s learning and development.\r\n\r\nWe are not currently planning a review of early years funding, but we continue to evaluate the support on offer and endeavour to provide support to both parents and providers to ensure the sustainability of the sector.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education",
