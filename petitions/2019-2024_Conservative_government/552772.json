        "additional_details": "If you are a woman, you will know that being 'cat-called' is a common problem, and can leave you feeling embarrassed, ashamed and violated. \r\n\r\nSome of you may be surprised to hear, that women getting shamed and humiliated on the streets can be a DAILY thing, and is presently not at all punishable by law.\r\n\r\nIf laws were in place to fine people who cat-call it will deter so many from doing it. It has been a year since France outlawed cat-calling, and since, French police have imposed over 450 fines",
        "background": "Having a changed law in place would mean fewer people would dare to cat-call in public spaces. It means people will more likely step in and help. It means people will increasingly report incidences to the police. It finally means that humiliating women in public is considered a serious offence.",
