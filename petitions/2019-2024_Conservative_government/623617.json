        "additional_details": "Between 2015-2018 Gluten Free prescriptions for staple foods were withdrawn in a lot of areas within England. As the cost of living crisis has progressed, Free From food prices have also increased to an exorbitant amount. My personal monthly food shop following a strict meal plan to help keep costs down is over \u00a3300 for 1 adult & 1 young child. These prices are not sustainable for anyone needing to eat a certain diet for medical reasons, it is certainly not sustainable for those on low incomes.",
        "background": "As the Cost of Living crisis has progressed, the prices of Gluten Free and Free From foods/drinks have risen to an amount that is no longer sustainable for those on medical diets and is negativity impacting those on low incomes. Something urgently needs to be put in place.",
