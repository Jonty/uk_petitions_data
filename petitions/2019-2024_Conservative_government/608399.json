        "action": "Lower the Voting Age to 16. We want participation and legitimacy.",
        "additional_details": "Because 16 year old's need the vote, they need to have the ability to make decisions that will later affect them. It is wholly and easily possible to take action on this matter and it would be in the benefit of the country. I myself used to believe that children(16-18) are immature but once seeing more I have begun to understand I am misguided as will many of my opposition if they take the time to see and understand 16 - 18 year old's.",
        "background": "Exactly as stated above, lower the voting age to allow 16 and 17 year old's to vote on key matters of this democratic country. We need the opinions of the younger whose futures are at stake here.",
