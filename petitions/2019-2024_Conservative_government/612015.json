        "action": "Ban the use of any physical discipline used to moderate a child\u2019s behaviour.",
        "additional_details": "Multiple studies on the topic of child development show us that emotional well-being links to most areas of development. Because of this, there are many reasons why physical discipline should be banned.\r\n\r\nChildren learn via role modelling. Hitting them will likely lead to them hitting others.\r\n\r\nFeeling safe and secure at home is imperative to a child\u2019s overall character, development and mental health.\r\n\r\nIf I were to hit an adult, I could be charged with assault, how is it legal to hit a child?",
        "background": "When our brain perceives a threat, the part that controls logical thinking is in essence shut down. When a parent chooses physical discipline as a means to create boundaries, it prevents the use of logic and understanding. Likely leading to a repeat in the very behaviour they are trying to stop.",
