It will also aid in getting veterinary treatment to injured pets.  With an unregistered chip the pet is deemed to have an owner because it\u2019s chipped, but permission can\u2019t be granted as they can\u2019t be contacted. This applies to all pets, not just cats",
        "background": "I volunteer for a local cat rescue.  If a cat has an un-registered chip we cannot reunite them in most cases\r\nMost implanting a microchip register it. Many don\u2019t.  We\u2019ve had chips confirmed as supplied to vets/charities where no information is known as to whom the cat was owned/adopted by.",
