        "additional_details": "These groups teach impressionable minors unscientific views on abortion to shame them into never having one. 13/1000 minors became pregnant in 2020. Whilst this number is decreasing, schools that allow these organisations to deliver talks are actively working against reducing this number and are instead encouraging the continuation of teen pregnancy. Make it an offence for schools to allow these organisations to deliver bias talks to pupils.",
        "background": "At just 14, I was made to sit through a 2 hour anti-abortion workshop in school with the message that if you get pregnant, even under age 16, you should not have an abortion. This is still commonly happening today. It must be stopped. We must protect both minors and women\u2019s rights.",
