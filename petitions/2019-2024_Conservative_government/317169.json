Govt wants businesses to survive to boost the economy after the crisis and will appreciate people vacating in the U.K yet it is a tourism sector being overlooked. We have outgoings and yet no income and for how long?  Many FHL owners are not just renting out \u2018an inherited cottage as an income stream on the side\u2019 For many of us this is our main employment and income.",
        "background": "Provide financial support for closed FHL business owners with their livelihoods taken away. Not qualifying as self employed we are a totally overlooked sector.  Would the Chancellor address this to help us through the crisis. We  still have costs to pay and no main income.",
