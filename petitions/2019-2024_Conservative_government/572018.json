        "action": "An 8-month extension on the learner driver theory test 2 year expiration date",
        "additional_details": "Due to the Coronavirus pandemic learner drivers have been unable to pass their practical tests as quickly as they would in regular circumstances. This means that people's driving theory certificates will be expiring after two years without giving the learner a fair chance at passing their practical. This is putting learners at a further disadvantage as they have to endure paying more money to redo a test they have already fairly passed simply due to time constraints",
        "background": "If an individual hasn't passed their practical test within 2 years of doing their theory exam they have to pay to redo it. There should be a minimum 8-month extension on the 2-year expiration date to allow people more time to pass their driving test as a result of the backlog caused by the pandemic.",
