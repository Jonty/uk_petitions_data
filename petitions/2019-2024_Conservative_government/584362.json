        "additional_details": "The UAE has provided a successful vaccination program and a significant amount of the population has been vaccinated. Whilst this proposed action would be good for the 240,000 expats in the UAE, thousands of teachers and families are are part of this group and would like to travel to UK during the summer holidays - many of whom have not traveled to the UK or seen family for over a year. The hotel quarantine is not suitable for those who have property in the UK and are able to isolate at home.",
        "background": "UK citizens arriving from the UAE should be allowed to quarantine from home, due to the wide availability of PCR tests before flying (being able to complete and receive results 48 hours before travel). Additionally, vaccinated individuals should be allowed early release after home PCR test.",
