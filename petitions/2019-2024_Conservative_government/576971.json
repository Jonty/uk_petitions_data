        "additional_details": "School children should not be required to wear face coverings during school hours. Covid cases are now lower compared to September 2020 when face coverings were not required during lessons. We now have vaccinated over 18,000,000 people including the top four most vulnerable groups. Face coverings are detrimental in many ways. They hinder communication, therefore acting as a social barrier and we should not normalise this abnormal human. behaviour.",
        "background": "The government needs to balance the risk (physical, emotional, educational and developmental) to our children compared to any possible benefits of face coverings. Precisely who benefits from children being made to wear face coverings for seven  hours a day and is this benefit proven or assumed?",
