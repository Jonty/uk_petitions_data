        "additional_details": "The government is playing Russian roulette with our lives and our health. Scarily, it\u2019s children\u2019s health at risk here as they haven\u2019t been vaccinated, and it\u2019s likely there will be a new variant of concern if we let Covid rip through our community. \r\n\r\nBoris Johnson has made clear that how people protect themselves and others now is a matter of personal responsibility. This is a complete abdication of government responsibility. \r\n\r\nWe are risking long Covid surges and dangerous new variants.",
        "background": "Not even 50% of the UK population have been double vaccinated.\r\n\r\nHerd immunity target has increased to 85% as the Delta variant is so much more transmissible.\r\nWe need to keep mask wearing measures in place until more people have been vaccinated. \r\n\r\nMasks are proved to reduce transmission.",
