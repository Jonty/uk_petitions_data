        "additional_details": "Because over the last 12 years we have suffered austerity and now a severe cost of living crisis and this Government is not doing anywhere near enough to remedy it. We need urgent action and we need a Government that will deliver what we all need. \r\n\r\nThe energy cap needs to be fixed, water companies need to be made to stop putting raw sewage into our rivers, the NHS and Police and Social Care are struggling to get enough staff to make people safe. The list is too long for this petition.",
        "background": "We want a GE so that we, the public, can make a democratic decision as to whom we think will be the most democratic, honest and work hardest to remedy the problems we currently face such as: the cost of living crisis, the NHS including all aspects, care sector, water companies etc.",
