Right now the only way electric scooters can be used legally is through private property. And since the pandemic the rise of the use of these scooters has increased dramatically and I feel with the right restrictions and requirements we can use them safely. Restrictions and requirements for the scooters could include speed caps, helmet and age requirements.",
