        "additional_details": "NHS staff currently don\u2019t need to self isolate if they are fully vaccinated when they come in contact with a Covid positive person outside of work.so what is the point in hotel quarantine for NHS staff who have had their vaccine and tested negative on PCR swab testing,upon return from a red list country?So kindly wave off the 10 days hotel/home quarantine for NHS staff returning from abroad as long as they have tested negative and has full course of vaccine.Foreign origin nurses and doctors and allied health workers have been working really hard and not had a break and have not been able to visit their family and parents living abroad since the pandemic has hit and it is important that they should be able to visit them just to have that work life balance.",
        "background": "kindly wave off hotel quarantine for NHS workers as they are fully vaccinated and tested negative for covid PCR when they travel from red list countries .we,NHS workers still come to work without self isolation when we come in contact with covid positive people as we are fully vaccinated.",
