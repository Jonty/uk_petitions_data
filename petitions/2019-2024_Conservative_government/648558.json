        "additional_details": "Research by TeacherTapp, an app that surveys 10,000 teachers on a range of issues every day, found that 60% of schools already have policies that do not allow the use of phones throughout the day, including break times and lunch times.\r\n\r\nThe use of phones at schools could help or be used for many reasons like Emergencies, Digital Identification, Student stress relief, time management/scheduling and many more.\r\n\r\nMoreover many children forget things such as rulers and whiteboards so with phones allowed children can message parents and ask for their things to be brought into school.",
        "background": "Freedom to use phones at school at lunch and/or break without consequence, For example once at lunch I had to call my mother because I was being bullied so I had to go under a wooden table and call her under there or else they would have taken it away.",
