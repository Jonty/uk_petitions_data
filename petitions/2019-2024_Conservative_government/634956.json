        "additional_details": "I want the government to do this because women should not have to pay for pads and tampons every month when they can\u2019t control what their body does. There\u2019s a lot of medication out there for people that they get for free due to certain health conditions. Therefore I think women\u2019s products should be free as we can\u2019t help what happens to us every month.",
        "background": "I would like the government to consider making women\u2019s hygiene products free everywhere. In my opinion, women should not have to pay for something that their body cannot control doing.",
