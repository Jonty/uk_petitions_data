        "additional_details": "We have learnt a lot about the world in the past century, and one major part of this learning curve is that we have been destroying the planet with GHG, This needs to stop. And although MP\u2019s may say they are onboard with the 2050 goal of net zero; It seems very unlikely to happen at this particular moment. This needs to change.  Funding must be poured into the renewable market. This will soon be a factor of making or breaking political parties. They need to act now.",
        "background": "I would like parliament to discuss and work out a way to create a scheme/regulations to help the general public add PV panels and EV chargers to their houses. This includes other means of renewables; however solar is now widely available to the public. Public buildings should also be converted.",
