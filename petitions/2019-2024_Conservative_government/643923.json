        "additional_details": "There are many bullies being bred in the UK for the wrong reasons, but there are still thousands of bully dogs that are perfect family companions and these intelligent dogs can be easily well trained, and should not be punished or put down just because of the bad reputation. The owners need to be held accountable for training and the breed should not be banned, the owners should be assessed on a case by case basis",
        "background": "The government should bring in Licences for dog owners, as opposed to punishing the breed for poor behaviour/lack of training.",
