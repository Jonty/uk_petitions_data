        "action": "Stop the introduction of apprenticeship degrees to become a doctor in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Those who graduate from the apprenticeship, like those who graduate through the traditional route, will go on to do F1 and F2 training during which they will train in the area in which they will practice. This apprenticeship will be a Level 7 qualification, equivalent to a Master's degree.\r\n\r\nThis will mean that you no longer require an undergraduate degree in medicine to become a doctor in the UK. This undermines the medical profession and lowers the standards of academic rigour in this country.",
        "background": "A new medical doctor degree apprenticeship has been approved by Department of Education.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to reject this absurd proposal. \r\n\r\nThe UK government should alternatively remove the cap and increase the number of medical students going to university.",
