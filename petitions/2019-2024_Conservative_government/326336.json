Rather than removing statues perhaps more information about the history of the person should be written on a plague.  I fear that many of the people protesting to get the statues removed are requesting this without the knowledge of the history of it and just following the crowd .   It scares me that the BAEM have given a list of Statues they want removing do the rest of us not have a say .",
