        "background": "As a psv driver, you are driving vehicles that are longer than a class 2 lorry. And busses can weigh a lot more than a lorry as well. With a bus you are carrying precious cargo (passengers) so why can you not allow a psv licence holder to be allowed an automatic right to a class 2 licence",
