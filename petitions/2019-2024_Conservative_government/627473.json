        "additional_details": "Corvids are the only bird used in these traps and yet they\u2019re one of the most intelligent  birds meaning they suffer immensely from it, they\u2019re terrorised by predators, they\u2019re often neglected, sometimes their wings are clipped and they often die from the psychological damage alone. The birds are likely to have physical injuries as well meaning any chance of release is unlikely. In most countries (including its country of origin) Larsen traps are banned due to its cruelty. Why is it legal here?",
        "background": "Corvids are trapped in small cages and left vulnerable and exposed in fields for predators such as foxes to prey on them or even their own kind so they can be shot in front of them. The bird is traumatised by the experience and will often die because of it. It is animal cruelty and yet it is legal.",
