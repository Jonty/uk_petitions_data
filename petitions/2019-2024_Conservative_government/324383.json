        "additional_details": "The national curriculum should be changed to include black British history and civil rights movements that happened here in the UK.\r\nI have read a lot about the issue with racism over the past few days particularly the UK\u2019s involvement. As a country we should be ashamed and be doing more to prevent racism. This starts with the education system, and educating young children. \r\nI am a privileged white british and I understand that I will never understand but I will stand.",
        "background": "Racism is just as big of an issue as it was 50 years ago and the UK is a part of this. \r\nUntil we change what we teach our children\u2019s and the young generation things will not change in society.",
