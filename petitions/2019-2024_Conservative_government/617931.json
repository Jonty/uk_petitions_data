Our politicians are quick to condemn brutal attacks against other religions yet remain silent when it comes to Christians.  We are a predominately Christian nation and it is right that we vocalise our disgust when any religion is persecuted. This MUST extend to our brothers and sisters in Nigeria. This pure terrorism is unacceptable and all civilised nations must unite and stand against this. Let the UK lead the way.",
