        "action": "Urgent appeal for greater transparency of UK government amidst COVID-19 outbreak",
        "additional_details": "The UK government\u2019s dynamic risk assessments are inconsistent with government action across other European nations, and its planning principles do not align with current measures to discontinue testing of all potential cases. The strategy is poorly justified and there is no transparency as to the reasoning behind the \u2018herd immunity\u2019 approach. Public trust is low due to lack of transparency and this will reduce effectiveness of government strategies.",
        "background": "There is currently no publicly accessible research to support key decisions, aside from references to studies conducted outside of the UK and listing of scientific committees. Implementation of key strategies requires scientific evidence which must be communicated to the general public.",
