        "additional_details": "There is much information showing that wearing a face mask to protect against Covid 19 specifically, has little, if any value and can in fact be harmful.  Masks designed for use in contaminated environments expels toxins without filtering. Surgical ones are for sterile environments having little effect outside of this and are potentially virus spreaders when used incorrectly. A home made one has no protection at all. Breathing your own toxins is bad for you. We MUST have the right to choose.",
        "background": "Wearing a facemask should be optional NOT mandated!  This is taking away freedoms and rights of the general public and is not based on evidence from a reliable source.  Masks do little to stop transmition and in fact can make you ill. Healthy people should not be forced to wear one!",
