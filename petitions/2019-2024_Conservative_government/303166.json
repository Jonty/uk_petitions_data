        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom has become one of the only nations in the world to only test patients in hospitals for COVID-19. It is crucial that the Government adequately report numbers of the disease, and their it is paramount that testing is open to those that are concerned. The country must report the correct numbers, and therefore testing must be open to concerned members of the public, but give testing priority to those in hospital or with underlying health conditions.",
        "background": "Following COBRA on Thursday 12 March 2020, the Government announced they will only test those in hospital for COVID-19. This is highly irresponsible, and the public deserve to know the truth about how bad the spread of the disease is. Testing must be available even to those with mild symptoms.",
