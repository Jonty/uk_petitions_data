        "additional_details": "With the UK driver shortage causing multiple supply chain issues due to multiple factors the government is investing heavily in training new HGV drivers. Unfortunately many smaller transport companies struggling to find drivers are having to turn down new pass drivers as the insurance companies are unwilling to insure them or their insurance premiums are simply too high. Caps on premiums or help with the cost of insurance will allow smaller companies to hire new drivers and remain competitive.",
        "background": "Many smaller companies although short of HGV drivers are unable to take on new drivers due to the insurance premiums associated with hiring new pass drivers. The government needs to do something about these insurance costs to allow more smaller companies to take on new drivers.",
