        "additional_details": "Due to COVID19, this is making it difficult for us to even look for jobs, as there aren\u2019t as many left. We would like the government to reintroduce the graduate route to current international students. This would give us a peace of mind, knowing that the current international students are going to get something out of our education. The extra 2 years of post study work visa should be granted for current international students as well.",
        "background": "Distance learning has made it hard to cope with our assignments. Our post study work visa is only for 4 months, with a majority of students who are back in their home countries are finding it difficult to even find a job.",
