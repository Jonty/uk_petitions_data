        "additional_details": "Many people have been hit very hard by COVID; job losses, zero hours, furloughed then made redundant. Small businesses, shops, hotels and restaurants dont have money to support them; no regular salary increases for these people. The government pledged to do all it can;  take some pain along with the rest of us. Salaries of \u00a383k far more than the avg worker.  It is time you really showed you care about COVID and the cost by enduring some 'hardship' by freezing your own costs.",
        "background": "Government has said many Public Sector workers are to have salary freezes to offset cost of COVID.  MPs should instruct the 'independent' bodies who arrange their salary/expenses/office budgets (like budget for home offices \u00a310k) to freeze their salaries / expense rates / budgets for 2021/2022",
