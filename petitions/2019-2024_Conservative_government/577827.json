        "additional_details": "The Health Secretary recently stated there is a \"value\" in giving COVID jabs to children, and a leading scientist said the UK's vaccine rollout should turn to younger age groups \"as fast as we can\".\r\n \r\nHowever, large-scale studies have suggested younger children are lower drivers of Covid transmission than adults, and the majority of children with Covid display no or minor symptoms. The risk to the population from not vaccinating them is therefore low. It is unacceptable to rush this for children.",
        "background": "Long-term safety of Covid vaccines should be evaluated in trials over several years before considering rolling out to our youngest generation. Evidence suggests very few children develop serious illness or symptoms from Covid and most adults will soon be vaccinated, reducing overall transmission.",
