        "additional_details": "The George Corss can be awarded collectively; past recipients have been the island of Malta and the RUC.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange now, but the memory of these times will fade, and with it the massive part the NHS played in keeping the population of Great Britain safe. Awarding the National Health Service, the George Cross, thereby renaming it The NHS GC, will remind future generations of the extraordinary service it gave during these times and why it should be protected for the future.",
        "background": "This petition is to ask the UK Government to award the National Health Service the George Cross as recognition of it as an organisation, and to all those who work in it, of the unfailing duty and service both it, and they, have provided during the Coronavirus pandemic.",
