They allow high-ranking public officials to meet in secret with influential people in the private sector and represent a challenge to democratic principles in that they could allow members to circumvent the law in certain ways. It represents a challenge to the fairness of trials if a magistrate or judge is a member of a secret society and has a vested interest in prosecuting someone at the wishes of other society members.",
        "background": "Abolish all societies that fail to make available to the public an accurate list of their members. Furthermore, to prevent secret meetings of members of those societies and to allow public access to meetings of those societies and the properties held by them.",
