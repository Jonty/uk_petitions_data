        "additional_details": "We work in clean sterile environments with training in handling blood-borne diseases and viruses. Tattooists working in studios that have been trained know how to work in a sterile clean and safe environment. I think that the decision to stop the tattoo industry from working should be reviewed as it can\u2019t be compared to hair dressing for instance. We see two customers maximum a day usually and the working environment is one of the most safe and clean.",
        "background": "I\u2019m a self employed tattooist and I need to be working to survive as thousands of others in the industry need to be also. I think that our sector should be reviewed and put into a separate category rather than health and beauty.",
