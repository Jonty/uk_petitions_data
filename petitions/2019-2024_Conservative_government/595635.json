        "additional_details": "274,000 flats are homes with dangerous cladding \u2013 this may equate to over 650,000 people who are prevented from moving to more suitable accommodation as their families or jobs require thus blighting their lives as well as their properties. Those affected are being forced to find as much as \u00a330,000 more to fund their next home as against unaffected homeowners putting them at a serious disadvantage. The Government should recognise this and act to eliminate this tax discrimination and inequality",
        "background": "Owners of unsellable flats with cladding issues should be relieved from the 3% Surcharge when buying their next home. Owners could defer payment of the 3% surcharge until 3 years after rectification work has been completed and the property becomes sellable.",
