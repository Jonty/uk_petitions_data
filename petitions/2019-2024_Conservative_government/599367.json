        "action": "Reintroduce household isolation to help prevent spread of covid in schools",
        "additional_details": "I feel that if a person tests positive the household should isolate. One person tests positive, the rest of the household don\u2019t need to isolate but get a pcr test. Pcr comes back negative. Continue with daily lives. After that pcr is done all still share a house and enclosed living spaces they could then get covid but don\u2019t know and then they pass it on to others around them. Household isolation needs to be returned to help stop the spread in schools",
        "background": "I want household isolation reintroduced, children who do not have to isolate if in contact with someone who tests positive can continue to go to school and while I appreciate things had to change as too many children were off school I believe it should be different when living in the same household",
