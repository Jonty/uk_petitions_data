        "additional_details": "Despite schools having shut, the numbers of cases of Coronavirus are still rising rapidly and are likely to peak in the coming weeks. This is mainly due to interactions such as going into supermarkets to buy food due to the lack of online delivery slots, and waiting in very long queues. To reduce the spread of the disease and, ultimately, the number of deaths, the Government should deliver food instead (which would enable supermarket closures and allow more people to stay at home, saving lives).",
        "background": "Everybody should be assigned a standard food package for the week which should be delivered to households by sufficiently paid supermarket workers. Supermarkets should then be closed for most of the week. Some dietary requirements such as vegetarianism or common allergies can be taken into account.",
