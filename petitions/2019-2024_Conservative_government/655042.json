After going way past my insurance limit and spending almost \u00a317,000 I started to think of the families who would have been unable to pay that amount. I looked in to it and saw all the top known free/low fee veterinary services only help those in certain postcodes. This needs to be changed so all families on a low income are able to afford to take care of their beloved pets without fear of being in the wrong postcode",
