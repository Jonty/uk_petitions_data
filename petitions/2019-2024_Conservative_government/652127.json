        "additional_details": "The 6 Nations Championship is a national treasure, culturally important to all the nations of the United Kingdom.  Getting tickets to a 6 nations match can be difficult and expensive, being beyond the means of many genuine rugby fans. Hiding it behind a paywall would deprive many fans access to international rugby.  The home nations' summer tours, autumn internationals and most of the Gallagher Premiership are only available of a pay per view basis.",
        "background": "The Rugby Union 6 Nations Championship should be listed as a Group A event under the Broadcasting Act 1996, so that it is offered to free-to-air terrestrial television broadcasters on fair and reasonable terms.  There is currently a very real risk the championship wukk disappear behind a paywall.",
