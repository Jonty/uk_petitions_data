        "action": "Continue to require face coverings/distancing on public transport after 19 July",
        "additional_details": "The UK is making significant progress with the COVID vaccine, although we are still in the midst of the 3rd wave and around half the country have not had the chance to get fully vaccinated. In addition transport employees are at particular risk each day at work. Wearing a mask and trying to maintain distance is not very hard or invasive, but can make a big difference to public health and make people more comfortable to use public transport, helping to keep the UK on the path back to 'normal'.",
        "background": "Extend the legal requirement for public transport passengers to wear face coverings (unless exempt) and keep a safe distance, where possible, beyond 19 July 2021. Until anyone who wants the vaccine has had the opportunity to get both jabs, it does not seem fair to remove these preventative measures.",
