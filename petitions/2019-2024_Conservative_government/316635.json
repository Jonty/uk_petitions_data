        "additional_details": "Many tour companies are multi-million pound enterprises while their customers and families live on limited means and save hard for an annual break. The financial impact of COVID-19 has placed many customers and their families in crisis. They are in dire need of monies which were committed to a holiday which is now cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government must ensure that operators fulfil legal obligations to make refunds and reject ABTA's call to relax regulations.",
        "background": "Package Travel Regulations mean those who have booked package trip are entitled to a full refund within two weeks of a cancellation by their agent or tour operator but many companies are flouting these rules. With COVID-19 many customers are in financial crisis and need their money back.",
