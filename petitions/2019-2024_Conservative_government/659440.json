The flag of England's representative football team should most definitely not be changed in relation to anything. Our flag should not be multicoloured on our kit as we have been red for years and will be red for years to come. I don't know the reason for this colour change but it is definitely receiving backlash from our country. We should not allow politics, other countries, people's sexual orientation, etc have an impact on our flag.",
