        "additional_details": "Students had to decide to go ahead with university with little evidence of how their courses would be delivered, with timetables not available until close to the start date. Students who decide to defer will pay pro-rated university fees, but some in accommodation with private landlords are locked in for the year.  If they defer they will not have the student loan to cover the c. \u00a3500 a month rent.",
        "background": "Many students are suffering mental health issues as a result of the pandemic lockdown and associated isolation.  Many are considering deferring the year. But, private landlords will only allow students to sub-let and will not allow the contract (a year) to be broken despite these exceptional times.",
