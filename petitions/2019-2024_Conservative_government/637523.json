        "action": "Stop capping grades for BTEC assignments",
        "additional_details": "We think that it's very unfair for students who are very smart to have their potential capped just because of one bad assignment. It can be the reason as to why many students don't get into their desired university/job or the reason as to why many people drop out of their BTEC course and are forced to degrade to a less desired course. Uncapping grade potentials will also allow students to feel less anxious/stressed and will help them to keep a positive outlook for future assignments.",
        "background": "We want BTEC assignments to not have any grade caps based off how another assignment went. We think that one assignment grade shouldn't ruin your potential for the rest of the unit. Being capped on a certain grade for a unit can ruin a student's overall grade for the whole course.",
