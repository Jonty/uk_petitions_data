        "additional_details": "Vulnerable families and those on low incomes are having to pay significantly higher costs towards heating and electricity whilst their children are homeschooling. Extortionate energy costs already force poorer families to choose between food and heating/electricity. During these difficult times, when incomes are already stretched, the extra burden of energy should be supported by the government.",
        "background": "Parliament need to discuss a way to make one off support payments to eligible families for their heating and electricity bills, on top of the Warm Homes discount. Warm Homes discount is given on the basis that children are at school in the week, and costs for electricity and heating would be less.",
