        "additional_details": "The recent response of the British government reminds me of the famous quote attributed to Marie Antoinette 'Let them eat cake'. We are the subjects who won't be able to afford a 'luxury' of energy in the 21'st century, similar to the 17th century peasants who were starving and couldn't afford bread. The government HAS to act now or risk people dying this winter. The question is are they willing to sacrifice our wellbeing for the sake of the profits?",
        "background": "I want the Government to either match people's wages to the rising inflation or nationalise the energy companies to ensure stability and affordability to the public or pay up and cover the difference in the energy costs but most importantly to not let people starve AND freeze to death this winter",
