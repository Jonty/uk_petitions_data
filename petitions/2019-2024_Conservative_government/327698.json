        "additional_details": "The government has already stopped issuing export licenses to Saudi Arabia as arms exports were found to be illegal in 2019, however they must go further and prohibit ALL arms exports. We are indirectly responsible for the deaths of thousands of Yemenis, including children and we must acknowledge this and help prevent further suffering by stopping ALL arms exports to Saudi Arabia.",
        "background": "The government needs to take urgent action on the war in Yemen by prohibiting sales of arms to Saudi Arabia, and other gulf countries that take part in air strikes in Yemen. These air strikes do not discriminate and have resulted in thousands of civilians being killed, supplied by western countries.",
