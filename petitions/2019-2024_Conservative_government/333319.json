        "additional_details": "It is so incredibly detrimental to those with eating disorders to see how many calories there are in the food they\u2019re eating. I would even say it can cause eating disorders. Also, calories don\u2019t equal health! So a plate of fried food could be fewer calories than a salad but the salad would help your  body more! People aren\u2019t dying from the lack of calorie information but sadly the same cannot be true where calorie information is present due to the prevalence of eating disorders. Stop this.",
        "background": "The government are implementing that all restaurant chains include calorie information onto their menus to \u2018combat obesity\u2019. This shouldn\u2019t happen and should not be implemented.",
