        "additional_details": "Education is something many thrive to gain but becomes a luxury item by the time the price tag is attached to it. In the case of some people a lot of sacrifices are made in order for them to attend university, whilst in some cases the money is easily assessable. However, whatever the case maybe it is not right for thousands of students to have to pay unnecessary funds. From dealing with strikes to two weeks off before the actual easter break starts, too remote learning and assessment mayhem etc",
        "background": "To reimburse all students who have been affected during this period. It's not right or fair to make students pay for services they are not receiving. There's a lot of talk of what is happening to employment and the workforce but little is being provided for students - the upcoming workforce.",
