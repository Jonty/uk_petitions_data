        "additional_details": "I want the government to return to the original vaccination programme. \r\nPfizer have said it has tested the vaccine's efficacy only when the two vaccines were given up to 21 days apart.\r\nPfizer and BioNTech have both warned that two doses of their vaccine were required for maximum protection against Covid and that they did not have evidence that the first dose alone offered protection after three weeks. The risk is that no one will be properly immune with an extension to the 2nd dose.",
        "background": "I do not believe that the government have made an ethical decision in extending the time between vaccinations. The research clearly demonstrates that the scientists are not clear that giving the vaccine more than 12 weeks apart actually gives an assurance re immunity as published.",
