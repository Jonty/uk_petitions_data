        "additional_details": "All women I know, especially young women and teenagers experience frequent sexual harassment and catcalling by men who seem to believe women should enjoy it. Instead, women feel intimated and threatened. If women smile and laugh it off it is usually because of fear and trying de escalate the situation. Women and girls have a right to feel safe and be respected in public spaces.",
        "background": "Make cat calling illegal. This will help spread the message to men that this behaviour is unacceptable and not to be tolerated and may help women feel safer on the streets.",
