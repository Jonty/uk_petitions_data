Most reasonable people would agree that an estate agent was an example of non-essential retail which was mandated to close. However, the insurance companies argue otherwise, and claim such businesses should have remained open. Government must clarify its advice to end the scandal of illegally denied claims.",

But, Insurers are denying such firms had to close and refusing to honour their claims. Gov UK must provide clarity.",
