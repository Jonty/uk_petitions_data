        "additional_details": "Students are outraged that GCSE's and A Level's are still continuing and the best the government can do is postpone them for three weeks, quite frankly parliament are being selfish, they are trying to do this for the 'best option' however logically it cannot work for us. You didn't listen the first time and so this is our request to you, listen to the people, this is a democratic society and if the choice solely effects the youth then let the youth decide. Thank you.",
        "background": "pushing the exams forwards by three weeks creates unfair increased pressure on the students taking their exams, three weeks will not ever be able to make up for 6 months of lost school time. Continue and the countries academic levels will drop. Do you want to take that chance?",
