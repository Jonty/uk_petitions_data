An example - after not receiving our regular order of bread from Tescos, I asked the manager of our local branch and also the online delivery department if they could please help us. The online department said she would come back to me with an answer which she did some hours later to tell me there was nothing they could do for us. The manager of our local branch after a lot of pleading allowed me to purchase 4 loaves, even though there was a lot of bread in the store.\r\n4 loaves of bread will not feed 40 residents!",
