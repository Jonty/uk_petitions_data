        "additional_details": "I struggle to find a priority seat on a train they are taken and there isn\u2019t enough onboard. I have had to sit in toilets and on the floor. I am registered disabled. It causes me distress and alarm when there is no priority seating available and which they are mostly taken by people, who don\u2019t move when you tell them you need that seat. People are rude and disrespectful towards you which causes anxiety, stress and upset.",
        "background": "I want more trains to have more priority seating for disabled people and to make priority seating areas have a link to the train manager for any issues if you travel alone this can be very difficult and frustrating",
