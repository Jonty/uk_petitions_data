        "additional_details": "These rights are protected under the 2010 Equality Act. Stripping them away serves only to exacerbate unfounded fears about the marginalised trans community.\r\n\r\nSince the passing of the 2004 Gender Recognition Act, less than 5000 trans people have gone through the intrusive and bureaucratic process of obtaining a Gender Recognition Certificate, needed to change their gender on important legal documents.\r\n\r\nTrans people should not have to jump through unnecessary hoops just to live their lives.",
        "background": "In 2017, the Government promised to update the process for transgender people to change their legal gender. 70% of responses to a Government consultation supported this reform but the Government have abandoned this and are denying trans people\u2019s rights to use facilities that align with their gender.",
