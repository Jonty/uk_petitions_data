        "additional_details": "Many students are simply not getting the education they were promised. Many university courses have been ruined or severely hindered by the inability to do anything in person. I myself am a film student, and when I agreed to pay \u00a39000 a year for my education I was promised on set training an industry experience. over a year and a half into my 3 year course and I have not made a single film or been on a single set production, and yet I am still being charged the exact same amount. It is not fair.",
        "background": "Many students are still being charged the same amount despite significant drawbacks and limits to their education. To compensate for how covid has effected many students, students should not have to pay as much for their school fees and/or should be allowed an extra year of education, cost free.",
