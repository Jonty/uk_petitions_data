        "additional_details": "I feel that this is a bad practice. My email made no mention of the fact that the policy would be auto renewed. A fact only to be found upon downloading documents via a link in the text. Most people I have spoken to were unaware they had agreed to auto renewal at the time of inception of the policy, and generally they found out by noticing a debit from their bank account.I found that companies are profiting by charging disproportionate amounts for a few days cover when people claim a refund too.",
        "background": "Stop the practice of sending out emails at renewal time which do not state that the policy will be renewed if the recipient ignores the email. It must make it clear the recipient needs to take action one way or the other, in accepting or rejecting the renewal offer, and update their information too.",
