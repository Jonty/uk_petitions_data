        "additional_details": "It is only just that as our university experience decrease this year, so should the tuition. Why are we still paying 9k to do an online course from home?\r\n\r\nOur whole experience is vertical, our work placements have been compromised and this is vital to our ability to take up graduate jobs after study. In effect, the quality of study this year isn't worth the tuition. \r\n\r\nWe need a refund of between 25% to 50%.",
        "background": "Collaboration is a big part of the university experience, this has been limited. Our homes are now being used as places of study giving us limited access to the facilities afforded by out tuition. Electricity, gas and water bills as well as mental health issues are increasing because of this.",
