        "additional_details": "During this whole pandemic the treatment of international couples has been disgusting by most countries. Even those with families or who are engaged, are being treated as though they are only tourists. The only thing which will allow exemption is a marriage certificate, which cannot even be obtained in lockdown and despite the already difficult process for international couples, there has been not even the slightest consideration or exemption made.",
        "background": "For international couples who are wishing to get married during COVID19, we are being forced apart by travel bans and not even allowed to get married to allow us to be together again. Not even documents which will let us do this can be issued, making the process even longer and more heartbreaking.",
