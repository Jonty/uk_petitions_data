        "additional_details": "The government won\u2019t extend theory test certificates, and learner drivers have now been impacted through 2 lockdowns and backlogs. This has caused financial challenges for pupils and heighten anxiety.\r\nDriving lessons are educational, but yet have not been treated as such. A levels and GCSEs have been awarded on teacher assessment. Let\u2019s make this the case with driving instructors and their pupils. \r\nA driving test is 40 minutes of luck, instructors know their pupils abilities and safe driving.",
        "background": "The DVSA have unfairly put those impacted by lockdown 2.0 to the back of the queue for tests. \r\nThe backlog on driving tests, brought by the pandemic are extreme, and will continue to cause challenges for a long time to come. It\u2019s time to review how licenses are rewarded as a priority.",
