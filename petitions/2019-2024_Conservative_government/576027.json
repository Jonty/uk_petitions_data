        "action": "Maintain the Foreign Aid Budget at 0.7% National Income",
        "additional_details": "The Covid pandemic has hit all countries and whilst the richer and more technically advanced countries have been able to develop and manufacture vaccines and engage in mass vaccination programs, the smaller and poorer countries have been left behind unable to afford a mass vaccination program. \r\nThe pandemic is an opportunity for the UK to demonstrate to the world our commitment to provide vaccines, save lives and rebuild industries of the poorer nations. It is not a time to reduce the Foreign Aid Budget  from 0.7% to 0.5% of the national Income. The savings achieved by this reduction will amount to about \u00a36 billion pounds but if this sum is spread around the globe to the poor countries less able to protect themselves from this pandemic the impact can be tremendous in saving lives.",
        "background": "We implore the government not to reduce the Foreign Aid Budget in the Spending Review but rather utilise the whole \u00a320 billion budget to freely provide vaccines to poorer countries and grants to support their basic infrastructure industries where these are in danger of collapsing.",
