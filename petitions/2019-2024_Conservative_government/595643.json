        "additional_details": "As you know, since the US forces withdrawal from Afghanistan, Taliban terror has taken control over the country: putting millions of Afghan lives at risk and forcing many to seek refuge abroad. \r\n\r\nAfghan lives, particularly those of women, ethnic and religious minority groups (including the Shia\u2019 Hazara community), journalists, academics and those who have aided US-UK efforts in Afghanistan are in grave danger.",
        "background": "Safely evacuate 50.000 Afghan nationals who wish to leave the country, in a period of 4 months.\r\nProvide humanitarian aid for those left back. Prioritise women and children.\r\nWork with Allies (UN, NATO) to tackle the issue.\r\nEnsure the UK won't do any harm under the name of exporting democracy.",
