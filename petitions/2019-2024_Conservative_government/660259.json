        "additional_details": "We need politicians to speak plainly, focusing on facts and future plans, and not past faults of others. Clear and honest talk helps everyone make better choices. We want to clean up political talk on TV, radio and online, making it more about real solutions and less about finger pointing. We want politics to be clearer, more honest, and trustworthy. This is vital for bringing back faith in our leaders and ensuring decisions are made for the right reasons.\r\n\r\nWe demand straight talk, and no jive.",
        "background": "We call upon the Government to establish a mandate requiring all politicians to stick to fact-based, blame free communication in public. We want a political environment where information presented is factual, unbiased, and free from negative references to the opposition's past performance.",
