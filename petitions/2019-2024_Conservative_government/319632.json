        "additional_details": "If this compatibility issue is not addressed, it will mean we have no way of knowing if inbound tourists have had contact with an infected person prior to entry to the UK. This will put the UK's entire hotel industry at risk if we cannot verify the health issue of inbound guests.\r\n\r\nThis would also mean that hotels abroad will be unable to verify that UK-based holiday-makers are free of this coronavirus. This could potentially mean that British people will be prevented from booking many hotels abroad, or even using nightclubs, restaurants, and other leisure facilities.",
