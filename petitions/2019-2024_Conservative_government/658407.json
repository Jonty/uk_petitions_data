Each year, around 167,000 people die from cancer in the UK, an average of 460 people every day.\r\n\r\n(MacMillan.org.uk 4 March 2024, https://www.macmillan.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/research/cancer-statistics-fact-sheet)\r\n\r\nI believe that the figure of 167,000 deaths could be reduced by thorough and accurate x-ray reading by two consultants (one of which must be a cancer specialist).\r\n\r\nThis could result in reduced cancer treatment, costing less to the government/NHS, a reduction in the use of theatres (early cancer can, in most cases, be treated with chemotherapy and ongoing maintenance) thus freeing up more beds.",
