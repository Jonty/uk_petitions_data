        "action": "Keep all gyms open during lockdown from January 2021 until foreseeable future.",
        "additional_details": "We are in the height of winter and freezing temperatures. It is unreasonable for the government to ask us to exercise in freezing temperatures or in heavy rain where we may get ill. Exercise plays a key role in keeping our bodies and immune systems strong along with a healthy diet. There is no evidence to say gyms are a place where the virus spreads. It is also vital for mental health sufferers who can not see counsellors and therapists on a face to face basis. Humans are social creatures and denying us the right to keep ourselves mentally and physically well is a major factor in depression and suicide spikes and other rising health issues currently. The government is denying us our basic human right to sustain a happy lifestyle.",
        "background": "Take a logical approach. Healthy and happy people are less likely to fall ill and put additional pressure on the NHS.",
