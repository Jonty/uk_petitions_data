        "additional_details": "Ministers have said they are committed to a registration system for children who are not in school, despite not having published responses to a 2019 consultation on children not in school.\r\nThere is no evidential basis for increased requirements for home educating, for registration, assessment or testing. If introduced, these recommendations would stigmatise and even destroy the very essence of home education: it is not school. We, the undersigned, call upon the Government not to introduce any such measures.",
        "background": "The Education Committee has recently recommended introducing a statutory home education register, and greater assessment of home educated children. These recommendations are in contrast to the views of many parents who home educate.",
