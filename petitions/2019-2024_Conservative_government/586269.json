        "additional_details": "Since the UK added the UAE to the red list, case numbers have halved and continue the downward trend, that\u2019s despite the UAE increasing covid testing to around 1/4 million tests a day. That\u2019s 3% of the population each day and is the highest amount of tests per capita of any country in the world. \r\n\r\nAllowing the traveller to tranist through other countries of a higher infection rate now puts thier health at risk but also exposes individuals to tranist the variant to the UK from that countries.",
        "background": "If a UK Citizen can prove direct travel from the UAE then why are the UK Government discriminating against these persons and not allowing direct flights?\r\n\r\nRed list countries have no direct flights, so why are there direct flights from India? This makes the Tranist Hub statement quite irrespective.",
