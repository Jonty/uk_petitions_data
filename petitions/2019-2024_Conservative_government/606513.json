        "additional_details": "We often hear people describe various British institutions as \"the best in the world\". In fact the BBC may be one of very few things we do that really is the best in the world.  Impartial news is under threat everywhere and has never been more necessary. It's important to all of us even if we aren't regular viewers. We pay for children's education even though we have no children.  And for the NHS even if we are healthy.  The BBC license fee is no different.",
        "background": "Retain the BBC license fee. The universal fee is the best way to fund the BBC, which is a vitally important part of our democracy, our national life, and of Britain's influence around the world.",
