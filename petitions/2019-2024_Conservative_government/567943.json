        "additional_details": "It is appalling to see the lack of support offered by our Government to University students from both 2019/20 and 2020/21 cohorts. As a collective community, we ask, how can this Government justify the costs of a Masters degree, which is anywhere between \u00a35,000-\u00a325,000, in a pandemic whereby students are paying for inadequate video calls and PowerPoint presentations. Our education matters. University qualifications count. However, these costs simply are not reflective of the services provided.",
        "background": "Following the emphasis placed on the education of primary and secondary school children due to the damaging effects of COVID-19, it is crucial that the Government takes a long hard look at the United Kingdoms university system, which has arguably been impacted in even more ways.",
