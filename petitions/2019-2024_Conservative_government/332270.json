        "additional_details": "Nurses paid the biggest price in the coronavirus pandemic. Nurses are the biggest work force in NHS and put their lives on the front line while many others enjoyed the furlough in their back garden. Many nurses lost their lives catching coronavirus from workplace, Many are still sick. The pay rise they received in 2018 was not even a above inflation rise. It was the only offer on the table. The clap for NHS workers is a shame on this Government if it is not reflected in their actions.",
        "background": "Government should review its decision to exclude Nurses and other NHS workers, who received a negotiated pay rise in 2018, from its proposed pay rise for public sector workers including police, teachers, doctors etc.",
