        "additional_details": "The government must take over this very costly testing process. If the same procedure can be performed by other countries five times less than the United Kingdom, then why is it not available in the United Kingdom? Moreover, international travel will generate revenue for the country if people pay more for a test than the cost of their ticket, which will have a detrimental impact. We are therefore pleading with the government to urgently intervene in this matter and establish an affordable and standardized rate for the RT-PCR test.",
        "background": "In the United Kingdom, RT-PCR testing charges are too high. While in other parts of the world, it is just similar to \u00a330 - \u00a335, but in the United Kingdom, it is about \u00a3150. That's too much for a traveling family, having paid the price of their ticket.",
