        "action": "Rather than increasing Trident warheads, we should reduce the stockpile.",
        "additional_details": "This represents an escalation of the nuclear stockpile in times when the world should be reducing nuclear weapons. It is the first increase in many years and flies in the face of the concept of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.The money spent on such weapons could be redeployed for the benefit of the British people, for example to give NHS staff the pay rises they deserve which it is said we cannot afford.",
        "background": "It was reported that the Government plans to increase the  number of Trident warheads from 180 to 260. In these difficult economic times it is immoral to be spending money on weapons of mass destruction. We wish the Government to abandon the increase in the nuclear stockpile and instead reduce it.",
