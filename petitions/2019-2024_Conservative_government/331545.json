        "action": "Release clear guidance on wedding receptions in the coming months for the UK",
        "additional_details": "The UK wedding industry is a multi-billion pound industry, and has been affected massively by the covid-19 pandemic. Similarly, engaged couples stand to lose thousands as a result of postponed/cancelled weddings. The guidance for hospitality does not extend to the wedding industry, and both couples and suppliers need clarity on when wedding receptions can resume, and guidance on the restrictions which will be imposed. If reception venues are covid secure, can they follow hospitality guidelines?",
        "background": "From 4th July 2020, wedding ceremonies of up to 30 people were permitted in England. However, no further guidance concerning wedding receptions has been released, despite pubs and restaurants reopening for business. Couples need clarity on when and how wedding receptions will be able to proceed.",
