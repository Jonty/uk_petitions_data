        "additional_details": "Since 2010 there have been number of Overseas families who have come over to U.K. on student visa and have studied here in UK and during their studies they have done part time work in health and social care sector. Many of these students are registered nurses in their own countries and can be used as workforce in UK.  Such UK residents who have applied for FLR visa and are waiting can be an additional work force for the NHS in this time of crisis and UK govt should use them towards NHS workforce",
        "background": "Visa rules be relaxed under FLR category for applicants who are nurses in their home country and can add value to the NHS in the time of crisis. \r\n\r\nSuch applicants have the expertise of working in health & social care already and such a relaxation in visa rule will provide additional NHS workforce",
