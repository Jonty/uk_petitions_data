        "additional_details": "It belittled the efforts of hardworking mothers when they constantly have to endure the loss of an hour on their special day because it coincides with the start of British Summer Time (BST) in March. It is usually a day marred by cold weather. Especially bearing in mind that father's day is in June, a month which usually has much better weather. It would also bring us in line with other countries i.e. Australia which also celebrate mother's day in May",
        "background": "Move Mothers Day to May so it is in line with the majority of countries that celebrate it & also so mothers in the UK are not belittled by the fact they have to lose an hour on their day when the clocks go forward an hour to mark the start of British Summer Time (BST)",
