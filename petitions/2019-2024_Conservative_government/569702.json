        "action": "Require universities to refund 30% of tuition for 2020/21 due to COVID-19 impact",
        "additional_details": "With little to no access to physical facilities and substandard education, students deserve at least 30% of their fees refunded for what they are not receiving from their institutions. The simple fact of lessons being delivered virtually must be considered a financial loss to students. Regardless of how well universities may be providing online instruction, it cannot be claimed that the value of education currently being delivered to students is equal in value to the tuition prices.",
        "background": "COVID-19 has irrefutably reduced the quality of student experience while students are paying the same amount in tuition. The government needs to require UK universities to refund all students 30% of what they pay for tuition in each term of the 2020/21 academic year where classes are taught online.",
