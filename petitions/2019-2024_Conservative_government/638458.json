Around 95% of medics and consultants have no understanding of embedded UTI and do not know how to treat or recognise the condition. One of the biggest hurdles to treatment is lack of adequate testing for women with UTI. Over 90% of chronic/embedded UTI infections are MISSED due to the use of unreliable MSU tests which are flawed. Millions of women across the UK are needlessly suffering.",
