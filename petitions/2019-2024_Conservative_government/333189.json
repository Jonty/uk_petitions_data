        "additional_details": "Rail travel is an important component of de-carbonisation of transport in the UK, as well as the promotion of active travel methods to get to and from stations will help with modal shift towards greener methods of travel. \r\n\r\nThe reduction of air pollution is seen as a priority by Government, and will assist in combating the Coronavirus Crisis as well as tackling obesity and other health issues. \r\n\r\nThis will also help the railways become much more financially sustainable.",
        "background": "While understandably social distancing has to take place to prevent spread of the virus, the message 'not to travel by bus or train' will not assist in the green recovery. Changing the message to 'safe bus & rail travel' will work alongside and complement the recent active travel measures.",
