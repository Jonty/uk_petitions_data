        "additional_details": "Transition between pre-school and mainstream school is important for all children. Due to COVID-19 and closures of schools we are unsure if our children will get the right transition period so I am proposing for our government to allow all children who are due to start school from this September to delay the intake till January 2021. This will allow for a smoother transition between pre-school placement to mainstream school and this will allow the children to be more prepared.",
        "background": "The government should delay the intake for reception aged children who are due to start school this September due to the uncertainties surrounding Covid-19. We are still no clearer in finding out when schools will reopen and this could impact on our children starting school in September",
