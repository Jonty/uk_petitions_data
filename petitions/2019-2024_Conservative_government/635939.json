The Equality Act 2010 says that you must not be discriminated against because of gender reassignment. In the Equality Act, gender reassignment means proposing to undergo, undergoing or having undergone a process to reassign your sex.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about what the Equality Act says about gender reassignment discrimination here: https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/advice-and-guidance/gender-reassignment-discrimination\r\n\r\nIf there is something specific you want the Government to do to enhance rights for trans people you could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
