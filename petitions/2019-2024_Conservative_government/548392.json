        "additional_details": "Government should follow the princple of subsidiarity, whereby social and political issues should be dealt with at the most immediate (or local) level that is consistent with their resolution. \r\n\r\nDistrict councils are more responsive to local needs than county councils, or national government, and consequently 41% of people trust local councillors to generally tell the truth, as opposed to 17% of government ministers and 14% of politicans in general (Ipsos MORI\r\nVeracity Index 2019).",
        "background": "Government plans to force the creation of unitary councils everywhere and thus ending district councils are wrong.\r\n\r\nThis policy reduces the ability for many communities to make their voices heard in local government and is very much counter to the government's own rhetoric of 'taking back control'",
