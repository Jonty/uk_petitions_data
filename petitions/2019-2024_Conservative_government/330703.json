        "additional_details": "The UK is involved beyond the bombs, also supplying the expertise to fuel the war, resulting in 80% of the Yemeni population in need of humanitarian aid.   \r\nCountries such as Germany, Austria, Norway, etc. have halted arms sales to Saudi Arabia but the UK continues to value profit over human life.\r\nThe UK recognises there are 'credible incidents of concern' breaching humanitarian law, but argues these are 'isolated incidents'. 24 million people in Yemen are in need of humanitarian aid.",
        "background": "British Law states it is illegal to license arms exports if they might be used to violate international humanitarian law, i.e. cause the death and suffering of innocent civilians, yet Yemen is facing the biggest humanitarian crisis in the world, and the UK is directly complicit.",
