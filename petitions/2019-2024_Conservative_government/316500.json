        "additional_details": "It makes sense to lift the burden of tickboxing targets \u2013 30,000 of which constrain the efforts of staff in north-west London alone \u2013 and which cause such wastage of time and money in the NHS.\r\n\r\nEvery week, millions of people applaud NHS staff for their courage and effort during the pandemic. It is time that the government stops infantilising NHS staff and starts treating them with the respect and trust they have shown, throughout this crisis, that they richly deserve.",
        "background": "1. Permanently abandon all form-filling and bureaucratic processes that, to gain efficiency, have been abandoned during the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\n2. That money saved like this should be re-directed to frontline services.\r\n\r\nIf decision taking can be streamlined now, why not always?",
