        "additional_details": "Our country declared that we had fallen into recession in 2020. According to the BBC, 1.72 million people were unemployed, with this figure predicted to reach 2.6 million by mid-2021. Legalising marijuana for reacreational use, just like the USA and Canada, can help us to 'build back better', and help us the create more jobs. As well as this, it will allow for people to leave a life of crime behind, which will keep them out of UK prisons; prisons that are already over-crowded to begin with.",
        "background": "Legalise recreational marijuana in order to boost the economy, and also to create jobs, as well as to allow individuals to leave behind lives of crime, to make honest money, and keep people out of already over-crowded prisons.",
