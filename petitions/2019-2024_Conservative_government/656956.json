        "additional_details": "The UK's decision to leave the EU has had significant implications, particularly the loss of free movement rights. Since the original referendum, public opinion has shifted, with many expressing regret over the decision. It's crucial for the government to recognize this change and hold a second referendum, allowing the current will of the people to be heard and acted upon.\r\nThe government keeps holding on to a decision that people regret. It's time to listen to those who vote for you.",
        "background": "We urge the UK government to organize a second referendum on EU membership to ensure current public sentiment is accurately represented and considered in the decision-making process.",
