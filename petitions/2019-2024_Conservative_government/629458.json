Applications for research licences almost never state dogs can be rehomed if healthy after the procedure. Rehoming is not valued highly enough in the UK. Dogs should only have one experimental procedure and not be used repeatedly allowing the possibility of rehoming of Vet checked healthy dogs.\r\nhttps://www.lasa.co.uk/PDF/LASA%20Guidance%20on%20the%20Rehoming%20of%20Laboratory%20Dogs.pdf",

Parliament/Secretary of State needs to revise the ASRU procedures so there is mandatory rehoming options using charities/organisations such as the RSPCA.",
