        "additional_details": "Most university students were asked to return home at the start of December following the direction given by the Government. Many will not be starting back until the end of January, or early February, with universities once again taking direction from the Government. Meanwhile students are still required to pay rent for university or private halls of residence which they are being asked not to occupy. This is unfair and morally wrong, particularly as students are paying tuition fees as well.",
        "background": "The Government must engage with universities and companies providing student accommodation to provide equitable rent refunds for the period students are being asked not to occupy their accommodation.",
