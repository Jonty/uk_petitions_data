This current lockdown will mean people losing jobs not once but twice maybe three times during this pandemic and through no fault of their own.  You are forcing companies to let staff go, how is this fair",
        "background": "The current date to qualify for furlough is 31st October,  any employee had to have been registered with HMRC in order to qualify furlough.  This needs to be changed as many lost jobs but were lucky enough to obtain new employment but in November or December which will result in a job loss",
