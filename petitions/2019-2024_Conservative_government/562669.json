It could also have the potential to save so many lives if it is availible for medical treatment and research, as there are cases of it treating certain types of cancer. It will also cause a drop in crime rate as it eill kill the market for dealers as there will be a safer and legal way to obtain it, so will therefore force dealers to stop.",
