Asking current year 10's and current year 12's to sit exams next year knowing full well they haven't had the requisite time in school and will not have enough time to cover all of the exams specifications, the government should ask teachers to make grade assessments based on work conducted in school.",

Students are already under enough pressure and stress. The government should scrap GCSE's and A levels for next year.",
