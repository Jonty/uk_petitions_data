        "additional_details": "The Russia Report refers to our capital city as 'Londongrad', the centre of reputional laundering. It says all aspects of UK life are awash with Russian money, especially politics. This calls into question whose interests politicians are promoting, the UK's or Russia's? \r\n\r\nWe the people deserve to know the full extent of what is going on, and what the impact has been on key political decisions + democratic events, including the 2014 Scottish independence ref, the 2016 Brexit ref and the 2019 GE.",
        "background": "ISC members say it was not that there has not been any interference, but rather our Govt decided not to investigate it. Russian interference is \"the new normal\". This is a catastrophic failure to safeguard UK Democracy. \r\n\r\nIn line with ISC's recommendation, we're calling for an immediate enquiry.",
