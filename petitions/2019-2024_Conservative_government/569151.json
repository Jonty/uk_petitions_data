        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to make it mandatory for all hospitals to provide free parking for NHS staff who work at their hospitals. The NHS work hard for the people of the UK, especially over the past year and this is something so simple that would make a huge difference to them.",
        "background": "Allow staff to have free parking whilst they\u2019re at work. Some friends who are NHS workers have to pay for season tickets in advance and they aren\u2019t guaranteed a space when they get to the hospital and end up driving round trying to find somewhere to park, when they just want to get on with their job",
