I think Black people should be proud of their culture and teaching others about the amazing contributions they have made in society can help to wean out prejudices in the next generations to come.",
        "background": "Ensure that Black History that is taught in the UK does not just entail brief excerpts about the Slave Trade and has positive things like; the first black voter, black peoples involvement in the wars, Bristol Bus Boycott, Windrush Scandal, and even African Empires such as the Benin Kingdom",
