It is shocking & appalling that a train company can just remove our vital train services, which so many local people rely on.\r\n\r\nI urge the Government to consider the social & economic impact of such cuts; at a time when the Government wants people to go back to work, school, & spend for economic recovery. Please do not cut us off from the cities. There are almost 40,000 people within these communities combined.",
