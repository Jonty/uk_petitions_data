        "additional_details": "In my situation I am still at home after an outbreak at my university hall in Manchester using online learning. I got the same level of education from my free college qualification, and still paying rent for a room I am not using but still need to have access to due to possible changes in restrictions in the future this is a scam and we deserve reparations. Full price education in times like these shouldn't even be considered.",
        "background": "I want the government and private companies to refund half of tuition fee and student accommodation for 2020. This is due to coronavirus outbreaks in many universities restricting students to live in small halls and use online learning materials whilst still being at full price for a normal year.",
