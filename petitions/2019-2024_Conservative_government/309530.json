        "additional_details": "Despite Sir Simon Stevens' explicit recommendation that 'emergency admissions, cancer treatment and other clinically urgent care should continue unaffected', over the past week there have emerged numerous distressing reports of life-saving and life-prolonging procedures, including those promised to advanced cancer patients, being cancelled.\r\n\r\nThis is simply out of line with the Government's assurance that 'vulnerable...people in our society [be] left in no doubt of their importance to us and our determination to protect them as best we can'. In fact, many seriously ill people - like uterine cancer patient Claire Elliott, 51 - have been left feeling their 'life isn't worth anything'.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, demand that the Government adhere to the recommendation that ONLY 'non-time-sensitive elective surgery' be cancelled or postponed in order to maximise hospital capability in light of the COVID-19 crisis.",
