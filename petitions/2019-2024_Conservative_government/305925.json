        "additional_details": "People are already panicking and suffering because of Covid-19, items that they will need such as paracetamol, baby milk, toilet paper etc. should be available to all and not be sold on at such huge costs.  If you are a family on a low income how can one afford baby milk that is at least \u00a320 per tin and sometimes over \u00a3100, or pay \u00a36.50 for 16 paracetamol when it would normally be 55p? We need to pull together during this crisis, not profit from peoples misery and support those most vulnerable.",
        "background": "Our government needs to stop people who have bulk bought essential items such as paracetamol and baby milk which are then being sold on at hugely inflated prices.  Selling sites such as eBay, Amazon and social networking sites like Facebook should be penalised should such profiteering be found.",
