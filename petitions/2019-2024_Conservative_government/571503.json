There is an unprecedented rise in feelings of isolation, worry & financial hardship.  \r\nIt is not acceptable that those suffering should have to find a charity to call in an emergency, when they may not have the mental capacity to do so. It is abhorrent that so many people, are not helped, causing mental suffering to be terminal, and lead to suicide.",

There should be specific access via 111 or 999 to help those in a mental health emergency - with joined up working between agencies.",
