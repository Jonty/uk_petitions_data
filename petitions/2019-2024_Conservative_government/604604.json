        "additional_details": "NHS Staff are being requested to get the Covid-19 Vaccination by April 2022 unless they have an exemption. The NHS staff who have not yet been vaccinated have been caring for patients since the beginning of the pandemic without needing a vaccination and have done so safely. Therefore, making Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory with the risk of losing their livelihood; is coercive and is a direct infringement on their human rights in accordance with Article 8 (HRA 98).",
        "background": "We would like the Government & Parliament to withdraw mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations for NHS & Frontline workers. This should remain a choice for Frontline workers without facing the risk of; loss of their jobs, reduced income and/or redeployment if they decide not to get vaccinated.",
