        "additional_details": "Since 1st January 2021 the UK pet passport is no longer valid. The UK has only been granted Part 2 Listed Status. This means that any person in the UK wishing to take their pet to the EU must now obtain an animal health certificate for every trip to the EU. This will incur a cost of upwards of \u00a3100 each trip. Pet owners in the EU, on the other hand, can still use their pet passport to enter the UK. This incurs no additional cost to them. This is obviously not fair. The government should seek parity with the EU on this matter.",
