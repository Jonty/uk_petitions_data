        "additional_details": "We are supposed to live in a democratic country not a country ruled by a dictator. In our industry, we are responsibly for risk assessing many situations ourselves such as fire, overcrowding, dispersal, crime and disorder, protection of children from harm, \u201cslips, trips and falls\u201d... the list goes on. Allow us to conduct our own risk assessment and put our own preventative measures in place in relation to Covid-19.",

We, the hospitality workers, demand that the government allows us to trade our licensed hours and allow us to effectively risk assess Covid-19 ourselves and take necessary steps.",
