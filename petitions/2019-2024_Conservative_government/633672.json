        "additional_details": "For most other utilities and financial services, for example, energy, water and insurances, a price is fixed for the duration of the contract. For some reason, mobile phone contracts work differently. The consumer is fixed to the same tariff for the entire length of the contract, whereas the company are permitted to change the cost as they see fit.\r\nThere is a fundamental inequality between the consumer and the provider in this case.",
        "background": "Mobile Network Providers should be prohibited from raising prices for a given customer, during a fixed-term contract that they have with that provider. An alternative would be providing consumers with a statutory right to leave a contract early if the price is raised.",
