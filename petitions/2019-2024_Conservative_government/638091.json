They should be held to the same scrutiny as businesses in marketing and advertising law.\r\n\r\nWe need a media that communicates fact not propaganda.\r\n\r\nWe need all thoughts to be heard and be taken into account when making decisions. Policies should benefit the most amount of people without causing harm.",
