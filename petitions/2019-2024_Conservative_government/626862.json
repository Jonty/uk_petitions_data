        "action": "Create affordable and standardised train travel across the UK.",
        "additional_details": "There are a number of ways to go about this, by separating the rail network into regional zones, similar to the underground maps. Or by charging a fixed fee for the duration of travel. \r\n\r\nTravellers would be able to purchase day tickets, travel passes or simply use their card to pay, and tap in and tap out, similar to infrastructure already in place and familiar to so many in the Capital. \r\n\r\nThe aim is to make rail travel affordable and easy for all, and encourage people to travel within the UK.",
        "background": "This country is steeped in history of rail travel, but recently, the industry has been hit by delays, strikes and mass cancelations. \r\nThis petition proposes all train stations use a tap in, tap out system, similar to the London Underground, and fares should be standardised and affordable.",
