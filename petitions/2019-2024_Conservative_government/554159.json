        "additional_details": "The National Foundation for Educational Research show that those children now in year 11 have lost at least 3 months of classroom time. As such 3 extra weeks simply will not give this school year a chance at getting reasonable grades. At the same time as English students are being expected to catch up 3 months in 3 weeks, National 5 exams are to be cancelled in Scotland in 2021 and replaced with teacher assessments and coursework. Let us trust our teachers to know their students.",
        "background": "We request UK Gov recognise that 3 extra weeks before sitting GCSE exams is woefully insufficient to make up for the months of classroom time lost due to Covid-19.  We ask that the current year 11 GCSE exams are scrapped and the Scottish \"teacher assessment and coursework\" system be adopted.",
