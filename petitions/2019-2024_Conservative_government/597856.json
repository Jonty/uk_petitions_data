        "action": "Ban adding fluoride in U.K. drinking water",
        "additional_details": "The main reason for that is the fundamental position of the drinking water sector that it is not its task to deliver medicinal treatment to people .  It\u2019s  widely perceived that drinking water should not be used as a vehicle for pharmaceuticals.\r\n Furthermore, fluoridation of drinking water would conflict with the freedom to choose for natural drinking water. This principle of freedom of choice is considered as an important basic principle . It\u2019s not ethical and is against human rights",
        "background": "Sajid Javid, the health secretary, is understood to be keen to press ahead with adding fluoride to the water supply and will gain powers to do so across England . This needs to be STOPPED like most European countries have done",
