        "additional_details": "Many companies suffer the cost of unpaid invoices. It's easy for rogue Directors to make lots of money by transferring company monies into personal investments/accounts, instead of paying their suppliers. Suppliers (creditors) then go through the costly process of legal proceedings, only for these 'customers' to dissolve their business due to zero funds. They can then start a new business with a similar name and clearing their debt. This process must stop! the cost to our economy must be huge.",
        "background": "If a Director chooses to liquidate their company due to creditor debts that they are unable to pay, is there a process that can investigate if the decision is legitimate, or if the reason is unethical. Eg, has the Director transferred excessive funds into personal investments prior to the decision?",
