        "additional_details": "Across England, early years settings have been told they can continue to open despite areas of England are being forced to shut due to the threat of coronavirus. There is still a high risk to children and adults in these settings, some of which take a very high number of children. This petition proposes that, if primary schools are required to shut, that early years settings should be required to follow suit, only opening for critical workers or vulnerable children.",
        "background": "Treat Early Years settings as equal to primary schools in terms of the threat of children and staffs safety due to Covid-19, requiring closures to all but critical workers or vulnerable children in areas where primary schools are to shut.",
