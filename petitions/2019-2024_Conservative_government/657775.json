        "action": "Place a legal maximum limit on car insurance costs",
        "additional_details": "Having car insurance is something required by law, however many car insurance providers are providing minimum quotes on vehicle insurance that is unreasonable and unpayable for many people. If it is a law to have this insurance, there should be a maximum value that these companies are allowed to charge for insurance, dependent on vehicle or vehicle classification, to prevent exploitation by vehicle insurance companies. The increasing cost of insurance is also predicted to cause a large increase in drivers who drive uninsured due to unreasonable costs, therefore this will also assist with crime reduction.",
        "background": "The government should limit car insurance costs to a maximum fee that is a reasonable sum dependent on each specific vehicle or vehicle classification. The government should require car insurance providers to not exceed the maximum fee per annum.",
