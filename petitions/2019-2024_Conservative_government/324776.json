        "additional_details": "Although a TS is not legally a promise to invest, it is a contract promising interest and due diligence with exclusivity periods meaning founders can't approach other investors. This means anyone can pretend to have life-changing sums of money to hand to a founder, should they choose to invest it. As a result, businesses can wait many months or even years for the funding to appear, ultimately bankrupting the business and in turn the founder.",
