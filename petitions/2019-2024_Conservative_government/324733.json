        "additional_details": "As someone who has recently left the UK education system, I know that all too often people are leaving school with little to no understanding of black history. I feel that this largely contributes to peoples racism and ignorance. Racism is still a large issue within the UK and introducing black history to the curriculum will help white students understand more about their friends who are people of colour and teach them how to challenge other peoples racist views.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to implement an extensive segment of the national curriculum that focuses on black history and the injustices that people of colour have faced throughout history. I also think that this should be touched upon in primary school to increase tolerance from a young age.",
