        "additional_details": "Doing this would be fairest way possible to students who have lost so much time due to the pandemic. It would help if they also just had 2 or 3 exams to focus on instead of the 9-11 they usually do. There would just need to be a predicted grade by February for the students that would be submitted by the teacher, and then students can make up their own mind on which exams they would like to sit. This would decrease mental health issue in year 11's and 13's this year.",
        "background": "Let students have predicted grades that would be submitted in February and given back out in April and then they (the students) decide if they would like to sit that exam or not. Just like they did this year, the exams would still take place in May/June, but with students only sitting a few exams.",
