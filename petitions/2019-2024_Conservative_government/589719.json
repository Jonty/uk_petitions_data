Yet again showing its them and us, another messed up system allowing the rich to get away with paying nothing while the person working long hours has to struggle each month. \r\nChange needs to happen!",
        "background": "Council tax in most areas of the UK are ridiculously high! \r\nPeople up and down the country are struggling to pay despite both or one adult working. They are being summoned to court with court fees and charges added on causing undue stress and financial difficulty. Families are struggling as it is.",
