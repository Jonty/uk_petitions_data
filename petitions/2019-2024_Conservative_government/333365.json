        "action": "Abandon government plans to include calories on restaurant menus",
        "additional_details": "Whilst obesity is a serious issue, and one that needs tackling, 1.25 million people in the UK suffer from a diagnosed eating disorder and more suffering in silence, undiagnosed, with restrictive eating patterns. For many people calories on menus will be triggering and enforce negative associations around food, potentially leading to an obsession with calories, harming a large % of people. Promoting exercise, price reduction of healthy food and changing mindsets, we believe, are better options.",
        "background": "The new plan to tackle obesity involves placing calories on menus at larger restaurants, we want this to be abandoned as its effects could be detrimental to anyone suffering from eating disorders or restrictive eating. There are other, more viable, alternatives that will be better in the long run.",
