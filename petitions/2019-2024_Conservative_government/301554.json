In our view, the government and health officials are currently 'reactive' rather than  'proactive'. Such behaviour will result in a crisis worse than the current Italian one. Data suggests the UK is only 10 days behind Italy and the NHS is not be prepared to cope with the pressure the virus would have on densely populated areas such as London and other cities.",
        "background": "We would like the Government or Parliament to close all public spaces such as restaurants, shops, museums, cinemas, and so on until the virus COVID-19 is contained. Moreover, companies should be forced to use smart working wherever feasible. New measures for public transport would also be welcome.",
