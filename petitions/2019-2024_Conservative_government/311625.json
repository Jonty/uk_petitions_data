That these categories introduce further complexity and risk does not warrant their neglect. The newly self-employed may be more in need than established traders. Many self-employed people were required to adopt limited company structures in order to win contracts, e.g. in the public sector. The current advice- that directors self-furlough- is inadequate.",

Having been self-employed for <1 year should not be an exclusion criterion. For ltd. company directors, both salary and dividends should be taken into account.",
