Many people with a 'side hustle' are not making huge amounts of money, the second hand market is far more ecologically friendly for the environment and allows those on a lower income to be able to purchase items otherwise out of reach.",
        "background": "Eliminate the new tax on goods which are Used or faulty, eBay and other platforms have filters for new/used/faulty items and therefore this can be easily filtered out from New items which could be subject to tax.",
