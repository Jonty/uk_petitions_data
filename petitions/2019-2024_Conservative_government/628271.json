        "additional_details": "The current wording of the Equality Act provides protection for trans people to use the correct public facilities and spaces, such as toilets. Changing the wording to differentiate between cis and trans people purely serves to put trans people in danger, it does not protect cis women and girls from predators. \r\n\r\nFor example, this would make it illegal for trans women to use women\u2019s toilets, which would actively make us less safe and force us away from public life in order to protect ourselves.",
        "background": "There are currently discussions revolving around changing the definition of \u201csex\u201d in the Equality Act 2010 to make it distinct from gender. The current wording of the Equality Act 2010 must not be changed as to do so would be catastrophic for the safety of vulnerable people.",
