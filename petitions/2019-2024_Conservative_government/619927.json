Some venues make a profit, while in other venues the cost of providing the service exceeds the income received in sales due to the irregular hours and unpredictability of parliamentary business.\r\n\r\nCustomers of the House of Commons Catering Services include some of the 650 MPs but also around 14,500 other pass-holders, many of whom are staff on lower wages that work irregular hours. In addition, members of the public and non pass holding visitors to Parliament also have access to these services.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons publishes details of the cost of House of Commons catering services: https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/foi/transparency-publications/hoc-transparency-publications/catering-services/transparency-reporting-catering-services/\r\n\r\nIt is up to the House of Lords what payments to make to members of the House of Lords. Whether tax has to be paid on any payments will depend on the type of payment made."
