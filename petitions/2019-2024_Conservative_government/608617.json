People who are vaccinated are still getting covid and whilst the majority have mild symptoms, covid could still be serious for those with severe lung disease etc (not just the immunocompromised) leading to hospital admissions.  If access to antivirals is not pre-arranged for these people they (along with their families) will be scared to go out meaning they won't support the economy and will likely require mental health support",
