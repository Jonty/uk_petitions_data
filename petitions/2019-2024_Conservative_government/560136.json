        "action": "Amend the Building Regulations Act 2010 to make Solar PV Panels mandatory.",
        "additional_details": "In order to achieve goals on carbon emissions the UK must decrease use of non-renewable fossil fuels. Harnessing the energy provided by the sun through the implementation of Solar PV panels will assist with this. While the widespread use of Solar PV panels and the subsequent saving on energy bills for the occupiers would reduce some of the financial burden on the 22% of the UK population living in poverty. As well as creating employment opportunities and helping minimise climate change.",
        "background": "We the Undersigned want the government to amend the Building Regulations Act 2010 to make it mandatory for all new build domestic and commercial properties to be fitted with Solar Photovoltaic Panels as standard.",
