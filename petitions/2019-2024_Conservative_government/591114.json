        "additional_details": "Many British citizens are Ex-Pats around the world. Most of these have not yet been able to travel to see their family due to the travel restrictions.\r\n\r\nPlease consider allowing British citizens vaccinated with vaccines approved for use in the UK to be afforded the same exemptions as those vaccinated by the NHS.\r\n\r\nThe vaccine is approved for use regardless of the country in which it is administered and the current policy risks creating a sub-tier of British citizens with fewer rights.",
        "background": "On Thursday 8th July, the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced that UK residents who have been vaccinated using by the UK vaccination rollout will not have to self-isolate when returning from an amber-list country.\r\n\r\nWe ask that this exemption be extended to British Ex-Pats living abroad.",
