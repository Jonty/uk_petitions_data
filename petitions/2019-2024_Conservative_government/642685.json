        "additional_details": "Death from sudden cardiac arrest doesn't have to be inevitable. If more people knew how to effectively perform CPR, we would have more survivors. A victims chances of survival fall 7 to 10% each minute that they do not receive CPR. Around 70% of the public are not comfortable to give CPR. Putting that into perspective, there are around 67 million people in the UK. 47 million of those people would be unable to save the life of a victim. How scary is that? Lets change those numbers!",
        "background": "I would like the Government to make it mandatory for schools to teach CPR to students. Early CPR has shown to more than double the chances of survival in cases of out of hospital cardiac arrests. However, less than one in ten people survive due to the lack of skills to successfully perform CPR.",
