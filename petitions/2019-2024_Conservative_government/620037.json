        "action": "Amend the UK laws regarding cyber sexual assault.",
        "additional_details": "Currently the UK cyber flashing laws will be requiring proof of intention to cause distress. How would a victim be able to prove that & why are these laws limited to cyber flashing? It's illegal to sexually harass someone on the street, why is it any different online?\r\nCyber sexual assault survivors exhibit similar trauma symptomology to physical sexual assault survivors. We are asking for the laws to be amended with the victims in mind & provide severe punishments to prevent future recurrence.",
        "background": "In March 2022 the British Government announced that cyber flashing will be outlawed as part of the Online Safety Bill. This has proven to be a system that fails its victims. Since 2010 cyber flashing has been outlawed in Scotland but there is a major downside. 1 in 20 reports result in a conviction.",
