All people have the right to be equal to one another and feel safe. To achieve this we must start educating children at a younger age so they are able to understand in a safe environment before they are taught differently elsewhere.  Teachers have a platform that should be used to achieve change for the next generation.",
        "background": "The primary national curriculum does not make it a statutory requirement to teach about race and equality. The current statement \"Teachers should take account of their duties under equal opportunities legislation, that covers race..\" is not enough and specific lessons need to be taught on the matter",
