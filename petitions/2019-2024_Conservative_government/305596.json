        "action": "Change Brexit leave date in law to 31/12/21 at least to allow for Covid-19 delay",
        "additional_details": "We are in unprecedented times. No country is able to devote proper time to trade negotiations while fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. We must delay the leave date by at least a year so that adequate preparation can be made and proper deals can be struck to avoid a second massive hit to our economy. For Boris Johnson to continue to refuse to extend the date under these extreme circumstances is irresponsible and pig-headed.",
        "background": "The PM is refusing to change the law made to leave the EU on 31st December. Given the current Covid-19 crisis this does not allow anywhere near adequate time for proper negotiations to happen as countries rightly focus on dealing with their crises. It is fiscally and morally irresponsible to refuse.",
