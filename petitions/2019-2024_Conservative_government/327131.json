        "action": "Stop the UK involvement in arming the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen",
        "additional_details": "As you are aware an estimated 100,000 civilians have already died in this proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran since March 2015. The UK is complicit in this mass genocide as they are one of the largest suppliers of arms to the Saudis. The blockade imposed by the Saudi-UAE coalition is the primary cause of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, pushing millions to the brink of famine. An estimated 85,000 infants have died from starvation. British complicity in that ought to be unthinkable.",
        "background": "The UK has been supplying weapons and providing military support to the Saudi-led coalition, responsible for the highest number of reported civilian fatalities in history. We want the government to STOP arming and supporting the massacre of Yemeni civilians.",
