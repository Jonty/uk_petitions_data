        "additional_details": "I have suffered with mental health due to a very troubled past and the current medications I have access to have made my condition worse and talking therapies have been ineffective leaving me to find my own solutions. Cannabis has been something I have tried many times and works perfectly, it made my life better but the law makes it impossible to remain consistent with it and the law has created a living hell trying to obtain such a wonderful medicine. It works and the side effects are easier",
        "background": "I want the government to understand the fact that Cannabis has been subject to vast propaganda and political corruption which is what has led to the current blurred lines around it's risks and benefits.",
