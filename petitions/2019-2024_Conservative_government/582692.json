        "additional_details": "Some students have only recently received the resources to participate in home learning. Many did not have a proper learning environment and not all content in school will be covered at the pace of students will therefore results will most certainly not reflect the true efforts of pupils. Perhaps the government fails to see everything is still not yet 'normal' so how can we take 'normal' exams. Hence why I am writing to the Government for heavy Leniency on Grades if not cancel them  for some.",

The Government and Education Minster want the exams to be taken place to return everything to 'normal'. Yet they are no aware of the troubles students have gone through.",
