The Secretary of State for health has stated that they will need to claim payment through the existing benefits system, as there is no time to put a new sickness benefit in place. It must, therefore, be made possible for self-employed people to simply claim universal credit or contribution-based ESA, with no waiting time, if they need to stop work due to suspected COVID-19 infection.",
