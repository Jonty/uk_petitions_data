        "additional_details": "Registrable child adoptions in the United Kingdom have a history of a 100 years but over this time contact with the child for birth families has been phased out.  Currently adopters or social workers choose whether birth families have contact where a placement for adoption order or where a final adoption order has been made. The law is not applied fairly as judges do not apply section 1 (2) - (4), ACA 2002 for where a judge \"comes to a decision\" for adoption contact or equivalent.",
        "background": "This is a petition to the UK Government to amend the Adoption of Children Act 2002 so that contact for child adoption situation genuinely has the child's welfare for life. Over the course of 100 years the birth family rights to continue relationships with the adopted child has been phased out.",
