        "additional_details": "The average person with their period will spend about \u00a313 every month. They are estimated to spend around \u00a34,916 in their lifetime just on sanitary products. But this data doesn\u2019t allow the fact that different people have different preferences and flows when on their periods and I believe that it\u2019s the government\u2019s duty to make sure that all people with periods are provided for, because like I said before, we can not control this.",
        "background": "I want the government to give people with periods free sanitary products each month. Periods are something that we can not control and happen naturally, therefore I believe that we should not have to pay for products to help us with things that we can not stop.",
