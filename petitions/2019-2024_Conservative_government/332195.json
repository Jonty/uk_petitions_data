The avg woman will have 468 periods in her lifetime; 468 times a woman will purchase sanitary products as well as pain relief. Stats from 2015 show that women spend on avg. \u00a313 a month on sanitary products & \u00a34.50 on pain relief. These numbers are outdated by 5 years, but based on them, the cost over a lifetime is just under \u00a310,000. Women didn't ask for a period, it's biological so why should we pay?",
        "background": "'Tampon tax' is being removed from tampons, however women should not have to pay for something they did not ask for. \r\nIn 2019 the gender pay gap was 17.3% - women are paid less than men and then expected to pay for products that aren't a choice? \r\nWe want ALL sanitary products to be free.",
