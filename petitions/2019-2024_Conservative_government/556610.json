        "additional_details": "I am a mature (40 year old) student nurse, my partner is disabled and cannot claim ESA (not enough NI contributions) and we are on UC.  I receive \u00a34,405 a year from SFW to support me, but this is being deducted from our UC because its classed as earnings?  I cannot work because of my contract with the NHS (they paid my tuition fees) which leaves the weekend, but there is no work, covid has closed everything down?  I WANT government to look at the way student nurses are treated, we are the future",
        "background": "A nurse student who is in receipt of any benefit that then receives a student loan or financial assistance from any other organisation, has their benefit sanctioned and the same amount of money deducted from their social benefits. I ask government to stop this and give nurses the help they need.",
