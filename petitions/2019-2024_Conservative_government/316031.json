        "action": "Ban Sky Lanterns from UK skies",
        "additional_details": "When a Sky Lantern is released it is done so without control or direction & falls as dangerous flaming litter. The deliberate lighting & releasing of Sky Lanterns across the UK has resulted in wildlife & farm animals being badly burnt, choked & even killed. in 2020 Lanterns were responsible for burning Krefeld zoo to the ground. Lanterns have caused crop fires & damaged buildings. The Welsh Government has already banned Sky Lanterns from Welsh Skies, I am requesting UK Government to follow suit.",
        "background": "I would like to petition the UK government to ban the lighting and releasing of Sky Lanterns across the UK, making it an offence for companies or individuals to release Sky lanterns either recreationally or as part of a display. I would like to see the sale of Sky Lanterns banned in the UK.",
