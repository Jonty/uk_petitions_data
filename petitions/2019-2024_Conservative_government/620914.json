        "additional_details": "As of 2021, 1 in 6 people aged 6-16 had a mental disorder, which had gone up from 1 in 9 in 2017. What we can get from that statistic is that more and more young people are developing mental conditions, and our schools are not trained to help them, and that needs to change. The ways that children with these conditions are treated is incredibly unfair, and is detrimental to a child\u2019s mental health, which in turn will impact their learning.",
        "background": "Provide better support for young people with disabilities and disorders, such as offering more in depth training to the teachers so they that have a better, more fair understanding of the children\u2019s behaviours. The way that some children are treated is completely unfair, and not acceptable anymore.",
