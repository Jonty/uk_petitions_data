        "additional_details": "The latest Home Office figures show that in 2017/18, there were 94,098 hate crime offences recorded by the police in England and Wales, 76% of which were racially aggravated. The reality of racism operates in many ways, particularly through the lack of education and understanding of Black British history. The Macpherson Report produced 20 years ago, showed that cultural diversity within the curriculum is one of the ways to prevent racism.",
        "background": "We want the government to discuss updating the national curriculum to include Black British history. Students across the UK are not being taught  Black British History as part of the national curriculum in a committed manner, despite numerous findings demonstrating its importance.",
