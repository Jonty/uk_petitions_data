Your petition refers to security, but it's not clear if you mean private security staff employed by hospitality venues, or police. Decisions about policing are a matter for individual police forces, but we could accept a petition calling for new legal requirements for hospitality venues to introduce additional security measures.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nMake it a legal requirement for nightclubs to thoroughly search guests on entry: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/598986\r\n\r\nRequire licensed venues to introduce anti-spiking policies, and fund training: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/599289"
