        "additional_details": "Parliament should enact legislation requiring all retailers to accept cash payments in addition to digital methods. This law would protect the rights of the elderly, unbanked, and tourists who rely on cash and ensure inclusivity in our economic transactions. By making cash a mandatory payment option, we uphold its status as legal tender and protect consumer privacy, preventing economic discrimination against those not participating in digital banking. This is essential for fair consumer access.",
