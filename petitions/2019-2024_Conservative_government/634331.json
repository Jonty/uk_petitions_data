Under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 patients can be treated without giving consent if they do not have the capacity to make this decision due to an impairment of the mind or brain. The NHS is responsible for making decisions about when to apply this legislation in respect of individual patients.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for one or both of the above provisions to be removed. If that's what you want to happen you could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
