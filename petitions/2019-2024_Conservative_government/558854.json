        "additional_details": "Numerous studies have found that the risk of Covid-19 transmission while playing football is negligible. A study by the Dutch FA found that 98% of matches present 'minimal or no risk' for footballers to transmit Covid-19 to one-another. Professor Chris Whitty recently said he was \"not aware\" of any cases of Covid-19 transmission between children playing football outdoors.",
        "background": "The government should make an exemption for the playing of football outdoors from the latest round of restrictions. The physical and mental benefits of the exercise provided by a game of football far outweigh the minimal risk of transmission during a match.",
