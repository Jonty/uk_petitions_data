The amount of distraught there would be to the family would be tremendous.\r\n\r\nThere should be speed humps because there is 2 local nurseries and an entrance to Avery Hill Park. There is also Charlton Athletic Training Ground and all this means lots of cars some speeding.  This is one of the busiest roads in New Eltham without speed bumps.",
