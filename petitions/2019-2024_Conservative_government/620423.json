        "additional_details": "We understand that parliament are not cifas, however they have influence and they have a voice more powerful than any of us have. I believe parliament should bring in a law that limits fraud prevention organisations from placing a marker on your credit file, or holding information on you for longer than 18 months. Lasting 18 months is hard but it\u2019s manageable. However 6 years is too harsh. The world is hard enough for vulnerable young people as it is, I think it\u2019s time we do more to help.",
        "background": "In todays world, we more than likely get our wages paid to us online by bank transfer, and having a cifas marker makes even that difficult. Uneducated Young people are being exposed to money mueling by cruel fraudsters and are then facing too harsh of a punishment because of it.",
