        "action": "Hold a referendum on abolishing the monarchy.",
        "additional_details": "The British people were given a choice on whether to remain part of the European Union. They voted to leave it because they disliked a foreign democratic organisation having controls over British laws. So why are we expected to continue supporting an expensive, useless and undemocratic organisation like the Royal Family, without any choice in the matter? The age of deference is long gone - let us decide for ourselves if we want a monarchy.",
        "background": "The British people have been denied the right to choose whether we have a monarchy. With our economy in crisis due to Covid-19 and the vile behaviour of royals such as Prince Andrew, we need a referendum to decide whether we want to continue funding this outdated institution.",
