        "additional_details": "The 10pm curfews have attracted criticism, including from the Greater Manchester Mayor, Andy Burnham. The impositions are the direct cause of overcrowding of people in cities such as York and Liverpool, as pub-goers are dispersed onto streets in a short space of time. This is a conflict of interest if mass gatherings are to be avoided. Rises in job-cuts, including 1/4 of City Pub Group's Staff, and a 37% drop in sales at 7000 outlets has been directly attributed to these measures.",
        "background": "10pm curfews have been in place in bars, restaurants have been forced to close at 10pm since 22 September 2020. This curfew has already demonstrated a potential for danger to both the economy and to public safety.",
