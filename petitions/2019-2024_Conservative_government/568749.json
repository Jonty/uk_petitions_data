        "additional_details": "Russell Groups should not have the power to implement this decision across all of their member universities since they have no idea of the individual circumstances of each university's conditions let alone every individual at the institution. \r\n\r\nThe government should demand that the decision be overturned and restore autonomy to each university so that they can act within the best interests of their students. \r\n\r\nStudents need academic support and a no detriment/ safety net policy guarantees this.",
        "background": "No detriment policies are more vital than ever given the impact of the past 10 months on students. The Russell Group should not be able to ban universities from implementing NDs on an institutional level. Many students have had to complete their studies through 3 lockdowns and they need support.",
