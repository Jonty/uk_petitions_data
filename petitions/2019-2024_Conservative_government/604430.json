        "additional_details": "The job market relies on the assumption that those who work can negotiate a fair wage through the market based on the supply and demand of their specific job. However, the value of one\u2019s work depends on the tools that they have access too, or the means of production. Predatory employers in the UK can use this to their advantage, knowing that there is no other business with tools that can make the employee\u2019s work as valuable as their tools. In essence, they are permitted to steal from employees.",

Allow a 10-year transition period for all businesses in the UK to give their employees a stake in their workplace, which can be proportional to salary or equal among the employees.",
