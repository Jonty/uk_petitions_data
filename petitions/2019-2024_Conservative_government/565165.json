        "additional_details": "The summer festival season is currently in its planning phases, and is a massive contribution to both the economy and emotional wellbeing of the country's citizens. A lot of festivals rely heavily on artists coming from abroad, and a lot of countries won't have had access to the vaccines we are currently rolling out here. This will severely limit the number of artists able to perform safely in the UK, and threaten the viability of a large number of festivals.",
        "background": "The government should offer free visa extensions of one month for coronavirus-unvaccinated artists (musical and otherwise) that wish to tour the UK. The artists should be offered free vaccination and accommodation during this month.",
