        "additional_details": "In light of recent events (Black Lives Matter movement receiving lots of media attention) and from personal experiences of working in schools - it is clear that the curriculum does not fully teach children about the country that they live in today, nor does it give them a good representation of the world that we live in today. \r\nShould this be included into the curriculum, children of colour may gain a stronger sense of identity and white children may gain a stronger sense of how society blends.",
        "background": "The curriculum in primary and secondary schools should include:\r\n* Black Bristish History (slavery, colonisation, windrush)\r\n* Literature and non fiction writing from BAME authors \r\n* Calender of all religious festivals (Eid, Diwali, Passover etc) with teaching and acknowledgment of these",
