We should not, therefore,\u00a0allow their opinions to rush decision-makers into\u00a0policies\u00a0regarding vaccination. Whilst some NGO\u2019s such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation contest that life will not return to normal\u00a0until people are widely\u00a0vaccinated - their views and opinions should not be permitted to influence policy making decisions here in the UK on a coronavirus\u00a0vaccination program.",

Equally, Government should forbid anyone trying to vaccinate minors\u00a0for the coronavirus\u00a0against the will of their parents or guardians.",
