Luckily, my 2 close friends have had experience of my seizures; they were the only people who knew what to in the room. What could have happened if they weren't there?\r\n\r\nThe curriculum should include, but not be limited to education on:\r\nCPR/defibrillator \r\nRecovery position\r\nTreating wounds/burns\r\nHeimlich maneuveur\r\nHelping someone having a stroke\r\nCommon chronic health conditions",
        "background": "Making basic first aid mandatory during secondary school would equip the current generation with essential skills and potentially save many lives a year. Only 7% of the population is confident to carry out basic first aid, this percentage would increase dramatically if first aid was made mandatory.",
