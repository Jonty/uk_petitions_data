        "additional_details": "This will help avoid traffic congestion and help with the prevention of air pollution. It is better for the environment. \r\nThe e-scooters are safer than the average bicycle because they are slower and easier to stop in an emergency. \r\nBut I do not believe anyone under the age of 18 should be allowed to use either. They need to be classified as a form of transport and not toys.",
        "background": "Legalise the use of privately owned e-bikes/e-scooters for over 18s who have a driving licence and insurance.\r\nThese should be allowed to be used on cycle lanes and roads with a speed limit of 30 miles per hour or less.\r\nScooters could be allowed on pavements where there is no danger to pedestrians.",
