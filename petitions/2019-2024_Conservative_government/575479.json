        "additional_details": "Many families and loved ones have been separated throughout this pandemic, who may live abroad from one another. Should they continue to be separated because of vaccine passports? International travel is vital for so much more than just holidays. The Government needs to be completely clear that no citizen will be coerced into taking a vaccine so that their basic human rights of free travel can be achieved. We want our freedom.",
        "background": "We want the Government to respect our human rights and choices to whether we decide on taking the vaccine or not. Therefore we ask them to scrap the idea of vaccine passports so no one is discriminated against for their personal choice on having/not having the vaccine.",
