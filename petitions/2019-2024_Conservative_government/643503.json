        "action": "Exclude telecommunication installations from permitted development legislation",
        "additional_details": "Permitted development legislation introduced in 2015 is being used to install what we believe is unnecessary infrastructure on pavements to deliver broadband internet to areas already well served by an established network of underground cabling.\r\n\r\nAmending legislation will ensure that planning permission is only granted when there is good reason for an installation. This should help reduce risk posed by cluttered streets to the visually impaired and wider community.",
        "background": "Require telecommunication installations in the public realm to go through the local planning process so that they need to be granted planning approval in the same way as most other installations.",
