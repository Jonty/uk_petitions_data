        "additional_details": "with the current situation it isn't fair nor is it going to help decrease the amount of cases. And this goes against what the  Prime Minister wanted. and if the students still have to go to do the exams what's the point of the 3rd lockdown? if there is people going to gather in large groups for hours without breaks, inside a closed room. the government needs to cancel these exams or the lockdown that was set in place will not be as effective and cases will get worse.",
        "background": "i would like the Government to cancel BTEC January 2021 exams. this is because we are in tier 5 yet every other exam/GCSE has been cancelled and it isn't fair for those BTEC students that have to risks their lives and others to do exams.",
