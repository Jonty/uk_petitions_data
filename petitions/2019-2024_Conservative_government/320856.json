        "additional_details": "Patients who need root canals with infections are unable to access this treatment and are in extreme pain. Patients cannot get routine check ups which diagnose important early issues such as mouth cancer and cavities. Cavities can lead to infection and this can subsequently lead to death. A similar outcome will occur with cancer. As a government you have to protect your people, by keeping dentists closed, you are not fulfilling this.",
        "background": "Dentists in the UK have now been closed since the start of the lock-down. It is now time for dentists to re-open to support those who need work. Even if this is just for remote diagnosis (using photos) and only asking patients to come in for treatment. Excluding those that are vulnerable.",
