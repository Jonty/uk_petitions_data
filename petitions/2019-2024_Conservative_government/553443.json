        "additional_details": "We are getting less hours of lectures compared to last year, and less access to university resources and buildings. We are paying the same amount for a lesser standard of learning - the open university charges \u00a36192 per year for an online only, full time course. I believe we should be paying less than \u00a39250, as due to Covid regulations, many university resources such as libraries are limited, and therefore push us further online.",
        "background": "We want the government to lower the maximum legal cost of tuition fees for both home, EU and international students for the academic year 2020/21, due to teaching being mostly online due to Covid-19.",
