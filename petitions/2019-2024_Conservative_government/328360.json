        "additional_details": "I want the government to reconsider spending the money on a much better cause such as poverty, homelessness or the pandemic going on right now. Anything other than painting a plane!! There are so many important causes which would benefit so much from this amount of money and painting a plane is not one of them. The government could use this money to help the environment or help other poorer countries which cannot cope because of the pandemic.",
        "background": "\u00a3900,000 of TAXPAYERS money to paint a plane is a ridiculous idea and will be of no use to anyone. The country is in more debt then ever and this money should go towards other causes which would greatly benefit the people in the country or outside!",
