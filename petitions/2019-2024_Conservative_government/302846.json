Projects like HS2 focuses on connecting wealth cities and do nothing to help the regions.  Bring back the vital connectivity needed for those who live in all 4 corners or the UK.",
        "background": "If the UK's Aviation industry's request, lead by Virgin group but supported by other UK airlines, for financial assistance is approved there should be action taken to resurrect Flybe either re-starting the airline or building a new one prioritising ex-Flybe staff for employment.",
