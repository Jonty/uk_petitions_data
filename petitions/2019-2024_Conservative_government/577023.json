        "additional_details": "A UBI would build resilience into our society and our communities, while providing the stimulus we need to rebuild our economy. It would level up our regions & nations, helping us build back better.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish Government, Welsh Senedd and councils across the UK have all expressed their intention to trial UBI. But they need cooperation and support from the DWP and HMRC to move forwards. UBI could be our generation\u2019s NHS. We are calling on the government to take action to support these trials.",
        "background": "Covid-19 has shown that we need to strengthen our welfare system. Millions have fallen through the cracks of the government\u2019s support packages. The creation of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) \u2013 a regular and unconditional cash payment to every individual in the UK \u2013 could be part of the solution.",
