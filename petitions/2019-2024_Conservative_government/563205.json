        "additional_details": "More than 640 health and care workers in Britain have lost their lives in the struggle against COVID-19. Other groups of essential workers and local volunteers have doubtless also suffered casualties. Hundreds of others will have paid a price with long-term health problems such as long COVID, or in other ways. We owe all these people, as well as the medical scientists who have worked flat out to produce, test, and distribute vaccines, a huge debt of gratitude. Our feelings should be expressed collectively in the most public and emphatic way, before we move on into the safer world which they have made possible.",
        "background": "Either use a Bank Holiday or a one-off national holiday. Local commemorations and tributes should be encouraged as well as those in national capitals.",
