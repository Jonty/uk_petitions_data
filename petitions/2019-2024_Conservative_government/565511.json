        "action": "Renew the hunting act to prevent exploitation resulting in the death of animals",
        "additional_details": "Review the hunting act and renew the loopholes. Hunting groups get away with breaking the law on a regular basis. Police investigations results in \"no evidence\" of intent to kill. If this was the case why does it still happen? All Hunting needs to be banned completely, including trail hunting. Private lands need to use professional pest control. All \"legal\" hunting activities still result in the killing of wild/domestic animals. These hunting groups need to be prosecuted when breaking the law.",
        "background": "Year after year, in particular, \"boxing day hunts\" have resulted in the death of foxes, or people's pets. The hunting act was introduced in 2004, banning the hunting of wild mammals with dogs. This law has had no effect. Hunters get around this with loopholes and foxes are still being killed.",
