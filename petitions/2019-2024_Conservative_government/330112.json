        "action": "Allow Hong Kong citizens born after 1st July 1997 to apply for BNO status",
        "additional_details": "The BNO scheme in place at the moment will grant 2.9m current BNO holders temporary refuge in the UK. However this will leave an average of 4.5 million citizens out of this scheme, the majority of these being students or younger people who are currently protesting for their own freedoms. Allowing these people to apply of their own free will would help these protestors escape from persecution.",
        "background": "Not all who are risking their lives protesting currently in Hong Kong were born before the handover of 1997 happened and are in imminent danger. Citizens of Hong Kong no matter what age should be eligible to apply for BNO citizenship be it through familial ties or other means.",
