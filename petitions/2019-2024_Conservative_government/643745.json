If you tackle the humans behind the dogs then maybe things will change because poor ownership is the real problem. Then maybe there wouldn't be as many out of control dogs around. Any dog small or large out of control can be a danger just as any dog with training, time and care in the right hands and can be perfect family companion.",

American xl bully like any breed can be well behaved and gentle family pets when trained and socialized properly.",
