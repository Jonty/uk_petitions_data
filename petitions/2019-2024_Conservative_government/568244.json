Supermarkets do not pay for the brakes of there staff, it is not a legal requirement unless stated in their employee contract. Supermarkets have proven to be one of the most profitable and sustainable business during these times, yet they do not pay for breaks even though most have had record profits this year. Clapping for keyworks doesn't pay their bills. Covid-19 has left the nation\u2019s appreciating keyworkers, its time we start paying there accordingly.",
