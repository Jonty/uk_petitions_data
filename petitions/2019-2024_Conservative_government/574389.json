We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nThe Government's guidance on disability under the Equality Act 2010 states that you\u2019re disabled if you have a physical or mental impairment that has a \u2018substantial\u2019 and \u2018long-term\u2019 negative effect on your ability to do normal daily activities:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/definition-of-disability-under-equality-act-2010\r\n\r\nIt is therefore already the case that under the Equality Act, anyone with a physical or a mental condition which has a substantial and long-term impact on your ability to do normal day to day activities is protected under the disability protected characteristic. This could cover people who have irritable bowel syndrome, where this has a a \u2018substantial\u2019 and \u2018long-term\u2019 negative effect on their ability to do normal daily activities. So it's not clear what else you would like to happen.\r\n\r\nFind out more about the Equality Act here:\r\nhttps://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/about-discrimination/equality-act-2010-discrimination-and-your-rights/\r\n\r\nFind out more about irritable bowel syndrome and the Equality Act here: https://www.theibsnetwork.org/equality-act/\r\n\r\nWe only reject petitions that don\u2019t meet the petition standards."
