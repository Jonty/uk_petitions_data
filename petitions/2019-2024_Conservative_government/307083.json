        "additional_details": "Whilst measure have been taken to encourage social distancing, this only adds to our fears and our worries. In particular key workers and our most vulnerable still remain at risk with massive uncertainty. Offering COVID-19 tests in these groups that request it will help them stay active, give reassurance, those that need help early can get it, and key workers can keep doing their jobs safely knowing they are not inadvertently spreading it.",
        "background": "I want the government to increase the amount of testing for COVID 19. This needs to include:\r\n- any and all key workers and families.\r\n- anyone showing cold or flu symptoms.\r\n- anyone in an at risk group.\r\n\r\nThis is in line with the WHO advice that as much testing as possible should be taking place.",
