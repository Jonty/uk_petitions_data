        "additional_details": "This xenophobic policy creates a two-tiered existence that does not stop the spread of COVID.\r\n\r\nExposed individuals vaccinated in the UK do not have to test and do not have to isolate.\r\n\r\nExposed individuals vaccinated abroad must isolate for ten days after every exposure, even with negative test results, no symptoms, and recent recovery from COVID.\r\n\r\nVaccines are effective regardless of their country of administration. Yet people vaccinated abroad live in fear of perpetual isolation in the UK.",
        "background": "The UK must recognise vaccinations administered abroad immediately to close the self-isolation loophole. Currently, exposure to COVID triggers mandatory ten-day isolation for individuals fully vaccinated abroad, while those vaccinated domestically have no obligations.",
