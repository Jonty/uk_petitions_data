As you bag yours the person behind you can unload theirs and so on.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a supermarket packer if there was a really big queue, I\u2019d open up several tills & I\u2019d get people doing this. I\u2019d also start by having one member of staff bag the shopping at the other end. It\u2019s far quicker. This should be legislated for.",

It also gives great scope for theft and the costs are passed onto honest customers. Banning them increases taxation revenue and reduces work for the police. They should be banned!",
