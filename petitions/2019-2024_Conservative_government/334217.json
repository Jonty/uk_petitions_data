        "additional_details": "It is unacceptable that in the 21st century anyone can be allowed to make money from racism and oppression. By allowing shops to sell \u2018Golliwogs\u2019 the UK are consciously or subconsciously perpetuating the view that black people are in some way inferior or lesser than white people. Not only are these dolls extremely offensive, dehumanising and upsetting but they \u2018perpetuate racism as they hark back to a time when the mockery and stereotyping of black people was considered a social norm\u2019.",
        "background": "Make it illegal to sell \u2018Golliwog\u2019 toys or anything featuring the \u2018Golliwog\u2019 image in UK shops. The \u2018Golliwog\u2019 image is highly offensive, portraying a negative racist stereotype/caricature which has strong links to Black Minstrels, Blacking-up and the oppression of the black community.",
