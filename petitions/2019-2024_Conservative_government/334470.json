        "additional_details": "Just because a man gets an erection at a woman DOES NOT MEAN HE IS AROUSED! Just like if a woman gets wet while being raped does not mean they\u2019re aroused. It\u2019s a natural factor within our body that creates this and makes it hard.",
        "background": "I want the Government and Parliament to look in to Female-to-Male rape as it is a thing. \r\nWoman can rape too and I believe the law is discriminatory against men with this; due to the theory and stigma of a man should \u201cman up and fight back\u201d, it\u2019s not that easy when in fear.",
