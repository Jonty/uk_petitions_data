        "additional_details": "I request that the UK government enact a law, mandating that businesses offer, without prejudice, the right to desk job employees to choose to work from home as an ongoing practice. If employees have worked from home during lockdown, this should automatically entitle them to continue to do so. Where employees work part-time from home and part-time from the office, this should also be allowed to continue.",
        "background": "Working from home should be offered for all desk job staff in small, medium and large businesses in the UK. Employees should be offered the choice to maintain such jobs: choosing to work in office full-time; part-time and home; or full-time from home. Less commuting translates to less air pollution.",
