        "additional_details": "Swansea council took it upon themselves to erect a height restriction in this single car park. \r\nWith no reasoning or consultation with locals living in the area and no warning. \r\nSince it\u2019s become known,  reported on local news sites, there has been a lot of backlash from users, locals and the wider Swansea community. \r\nThis height restriction is 2.3m so does not prevent the use of this car park for overnight stays but simply limits the height of a van for no apparent reason.",
        "background": "Knab Rock has welcomed motorhomes & campervans for as long as I can remember. In the last year alone I have stayed there on many occasions meeting the locals, fishermen & people from all areas of the UK. \r\nThis little spot has become a small community in itself and forms part of Knab Rocks charm.",
