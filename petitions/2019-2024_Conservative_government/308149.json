        "additional_details": "The government should take this course of action to pick up those spreading the virus, many of whom will be showing no symptoms. By finding spreaders, and isolating them it will drastically reduce stress on our NHS, and reduce the unnecessary deaths of both Covid-19 victims, and those suffering from other illnesses that are being pushed aside. We will be able to take back control sooner reducing economic damage and the social and mental issues caused by prolonged isolation.",
        "background": "The Government must start a programme of aggressive testing for COVID-19, and this must be followed by the aggressive tracing of contacts, who must also be tested. \r\nThe Government must also send messages to everyone pinpointing the location of new cases, and set up drive through test centres.",
