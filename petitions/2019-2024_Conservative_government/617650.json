        "action": "Public enquiry into failures of the visa system for those fleeing war in Ukraine",
        "additional_details": "Time taken at the DMC varied from days to months with applications not retained in family groups so that often a family had visas for weeks but could not travel because one was missing.  Once applications entered the DMC they could not be tracked even when an MP made the request; many notification emails were never received by applicants.  Women and children fleeing war were left in dire circumstances while safe homes were waiting for them under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.",
        "background": "The Government should order a public enquiry into how people fleeing the war were let down by failures in the UK visa system.  Applications often took too long with no traceability once submitted.  Families were left in danger while the Decision Making Centre (DMC) caused delays in getting to UK.",
