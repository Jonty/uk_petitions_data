        "additional_details": "There are to many company in UK which provide transport to make some solution apart of national action. This could be temporary until situation come back to normal, but I strongly believe every idea to promote public transport instead of driving own car quite often as a single person would bring benefits. Also public transport on many occasions is more expensive than using own cars what should be reconsidered. The public transport is often wasted as provide transport to air instead of people.",
        "background": "The Government should issue national ticket for public transport to make people use less fuel. The idea to provide people extra money to fight with higher prices is like fighting with fire by flammable liquid. The solution is to make pressure to deflate inflated fuel prices by decrease demand.",
