Turnout at Mayoral elections has been low and there is no interest in having a Metro Mayor in the areas which have had one forced upon them. \r\n\r\nThere is no reason why a Combined Authority cannot function without a Metro Mayor as the individual Council Leaders of the local authorities can govern the Combined Authority between themselves.",
