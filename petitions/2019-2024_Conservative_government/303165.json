        "additional_details": "Currently, people with serious illnesses and healthy people are being put at risk of COVID-19.\r\nWe need university buildings to close and extend the deadlines. Some students cannot afford a computer or specialist software needed for their courses. This puts them at risk for having to choose between continuing their assignments and running the risk of infection or failing their assignments.\r\nMoreover, students on placement are at risk following statements that their placement employer should decide as and when they would be able to pause their placement.",
        "background": "We are concerned about how the general safety is affected by our campuses being open to the public because students can unknowingly infect other people outside of their universities, especially students who work part-time.",
