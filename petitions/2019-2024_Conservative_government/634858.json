        "additional_details": "Because I believe its a public duty to safe guard our population. By doing this, judge and jury will gain a better understanding of the type of person they are sentencing (ie how dangerous they are, if it's out of character for them or if they are repeat offenders). How it stands, not doing this, is highly unfair on victims and completely sides with criminals & is beneficial to them. I wonder how many criminals got off with offences which they wouldn't have if courts were given the full picture.",
        "background": "I'd like the law changed so that judges & juries in court are made aware of offenders past criminal activity before sentencing is decided, or any information police have which is relevant to the case (eg if they've been arrested for similar offences etc).",
