Introducing a right for any reason, up to 24 weeks, or 12 weeks in common with NI, would secure access to this important healthcare need. \r\nReducing certification for other reasons to one practitioner also increases privacy and ensures prompt access to services.",

Either up to 24 weeks, or 12 in common with Northern Ireland. \r\nAlso require only one practitioner to certify that any of the other grounds are met, rather than two.",
