        "additional_details": "Many people already have their driving tests booked. However, with driving lessons unable to take place during lockdown, performance on the day will inevitably be negatively impacted. \r\n\r\nFor most this will have been the second time they have had their driving tests cancelled and rebooked due to the lockdown, with little or no time for lessons to take place. Additionally, this has a negative financial impact, as many will be expected to pay for further tests, and contributes to further stress during this time. Driving is a necessity and the choice should not be taken away from individuals.",
        "background": "Driving lessons must continue with appropriate safety measures in place. Measures were already in place before the lockdown to ensure the safety of both the driver and instructor.",
