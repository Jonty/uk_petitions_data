We stand with the Ukrainian people and help stop the supply of wealth to the Russian leaders who have illegally invaded Ukraine. The Ukrainians do not have much time. We need to act fast. This is bigger than Ukraine. It is a fight for freedom. If we fail to act and allow this to happen, the world we create is a dystopian one. This is a small act but one in the right direction. Act now. Take a stand. We are all war. Step up.",
