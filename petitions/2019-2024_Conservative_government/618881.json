It has a nasty taste and can cause bloating, sickness and diarrhoea to name a few. Not only is it in our food \u00e0nd drink but is in toothpaste and mouthwash which is near impossible to purchase without sweeteners in. The blame for obesity has been targeted with the consumption of to much sugar yet you take it out of our food and it's  made no difference apart from the fact that we are now becoming ill due to the sweeteners. Rather than replace sugar with sweeteners why not make less sugar products exactly  that and add less sugar and not replace sugar with sweeteners.",
