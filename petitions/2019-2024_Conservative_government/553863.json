        "additional_details": "By announcing the cancellation of the 2021 exams now, the government can rid the students from the incessant impotence in the face of a looming disaster. Leaving it to the last minute to announce the cancellation of exams would be catastrophic, as many students would face the same disaster as experienced by the previous A-level students. It is the ONLY way that students from all socio-economic backgrounds can have a fair chance of receiving the grades they truly deserve.",
        "background": "On behalf of myself and my peers we implore the government to cancel the 2021 A-level exams with immediate effect. I suggest that with exams cancelled, the government give the grades to students based on their coursework and end of topic tests completed after the announcement.",
