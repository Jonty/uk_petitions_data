        "additional_details": "The Home Office has pledged to stand by Ukrainian citizens, and yet has been refusing to allow refugees, even those with family currently in the UK to enter the country outside the terms of peacetime. In this extraordinary circumstance, surely the government can do better? By following the example of the Republic of Ireland, the UK would facilitate a great deal of humanitarian relief and be able to stand by our European partners.",
        "background": "Following the example for the Republic of Ireland the UK Government should immediately lift all Visa requirements for Ukrainian citizens, at least for the duration of the current crisis. This means an immediate cessation of any restriction that would prevent such a citizen from entering the UK.",
