        "additional_details": "The average cost of an undergraduate degree is \u00a39250 per year, and the average cost of a postgraduate degree is around \u00a37946. Students are still being expected to pay their final term tuition fees, either through Student Finance, or directly to the universities. Considering that students are no longer receiving lectures or face-to-face learning time, they should not have to pay tuition fees for the Easter term, nor should they have to continue paying rent when they have been asked to vacate.",
        "background": "On 11th March 2020, it was announced that universities would have to close as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Thousands of students were told they would be moved to 'online learning' and would have their exams and graduations postponed indefinitely. Students were also asked to leave accommodation",
