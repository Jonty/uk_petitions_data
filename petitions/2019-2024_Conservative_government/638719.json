        "additional_details": "There are very few safeguards in the NPPF that planners must consider regarding airfields.\r\n\r\nDfT policy, whilst supportive, is easily dismissed.  The new 'GA Handbook', for example, begins by explaining that planners can ignore the guidance if offers.  The UK CAA offer very little assistance in this area.\r\n\r\nThere is frequently a tension of interdepartmental government policy, that is undemocratically decided at a local level, failing to take into account the national asset that airfields are.",
        "background": "Airfields are under increasing threat from developers, who often acquire an airfield under as an operator.  Think Coventry, think Doncaster.\r\n\r\nLegislation needs to be enacted to protect airfields in recognition of them being national assets.  Current law is largely weak in preventing redevelopment.",
