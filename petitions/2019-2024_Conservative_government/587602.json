        "additional_details": "An example is a country like Portugal which is on the Green list, it has 22,633 active cases and 17,023 deaths, \r\n2 Red list examples are Tanzania which has 305 active cases and 21 deaths and Mozambique which has 389 active cases with 836 deaths, (source - worldometers, which uses Ministry of Health websites)\r\nthere is evidently a severe lack of logic in the way these countries have been classified and could even be a covert punitive measure from one government to another by cutting off tourism",
        "background": "We the public would like transparency around the methods used by the UK government in its colour coded grading of countries and reform in the system in which the lists are updated, for example a country with less than a specific amount of active cases have their colour status automatically updated",
