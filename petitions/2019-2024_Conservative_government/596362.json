        "additional_details": "Evidence shows that household contacts are most likely to catch and spread Covid-19. In comparison with other safety measures, such as sending home whole school classes, self-isolation for household contacts is highly effective and causes relatively little disruption. Abandoning this measure will massively increase Covid-19 cases, endangering vulnerable members of our society and causing further disruption in schools.",
        "background": "Reinstate self-isolation for under 18s whose household contacts have Covid-19. Alternatively, require self-isolation until a negative PCR result has been obtained, and daily lateral flow tests thereafter until the end of the 10-day period.",
