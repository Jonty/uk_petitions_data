        "action": "Abandon Brexit because of COVID 19",
        "additional_details": "Abandoning BREXIT (rather than simply deferring it, which would only prolong the continuing uncertainty surrounding the imminent negotiations with the EU) would send a strong message to the world that the people are the priority instead of dogma. As this is a step which goes against both the 2016 vote and the Government's mandate from the 2019 election, this 'force majeure' calls for democratic consent with a people's vote in due course but swift action is needed first to avoid imminent crisis.",
        "background": "As there is universal agreement amongst independent analysts that BREXIT will damage the economy in the short and medium terms, the international economic fallout from the COVID 19 epidemic can be mitigated in the UK by abandoning BREXIT to support UK businesses and livelihoods at a point of crisis.",
