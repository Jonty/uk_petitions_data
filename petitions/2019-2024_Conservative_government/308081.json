Allowing any religious gatherings to continue will result in the accelerated spread of the corona virus. In view of the governments concern about the risk it is imperative that all religious gatherings be stopped immediately.",
        "background": "We would like the government to seriously consider banning all organised religious gatherings either inside religious buildings or outside in any location as a matter of urgency, in addition to taking necessary actions to prevent further spread of the Coronavirus COVID-19.",
