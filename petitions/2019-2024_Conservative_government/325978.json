        "additional_details": "A nation state only exists because of its shared culture and heritage. The recent BLM protests are not just asking for recognition, they are now demanding the erasure of British history. It is clear that they do not hold any attachment to Britain so cannot understand the importance of our history. \r\n The fact remains that these protests are a minority of people. The majority who voted this government in are not protesting in the streets, do not forget them.",
        "background": "The government needs to put in place legislation that protects our historical statues and our heritage as a whole. The recent civil obedience has led to calls for removal of statues that represent our history which should be considered unacceptable to protect Britain as a nation.",
