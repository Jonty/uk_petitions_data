        "additional_details": "I feel it's important for something to change as I know there's signs informing the public to give the seals ten meters space but unfortunately the fast majority of people aren't taking the information on board. The next beach along (Horsey) is closed off to the public to protect the seals and I feel now is the time to do the same at Waxham as there's just as many seals that need protecting.",
        "background": "Close off Waxham beach to the public, as there's more and more people with children and dogs going straight up to seal pups, forcing them back into the sea to drown. Also there's been lots of sightings of seals with severe wounds from dog bites.",
