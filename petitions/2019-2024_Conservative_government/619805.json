        "additional_details": "We believe Pvt W. Tongs should be awarded the Victoria Cross, but because the Government does not make retrospective awards, we cannot nominate him for this honour. We believe this is unfair, and that retrospective nominations and awards should be allowed.\r\n \r\nWe understand that medals are not awarded retrospectively in part because of Army Order (AO) 433/19 from 15 December 1919, and Army Order 193/19, from 5 May 1919. These orders, and the Government's policy not make retrospective awards of medals, should be overturned.",
        "background": "We want the Government to revoke long-standing policy not to make retrospective awards of medals, so that nominations for awards can be considered in respect of historic individual and events, especially in the case of awards of the Victoria Cross to those who fought in the First World War.",
