In many cases, not even on a part-time basis.  This is unacceptable and they should be rewarded for their commitment and not struggle to pay the bills just because a loved one needs round-the-clock care.",

A community carer can earn upwards of \u00a320,000 per year (before tax).  At home carers should be paid the same as they are unable to work due to their commitments at home.",
