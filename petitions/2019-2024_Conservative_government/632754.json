        "action": "Help reduce the homeless population and set them up for job interviews",
        "additional_details": "With the current housing crisis, millions of families are unable to pay rent and energy bills to stay warm during winter. 271,000 people are recorded as homeless in England, including 123,000 children, who can't receive education to the standard the government expects will be needed to provide a steady income for the future. The number of homeless people may only continue to rise, potentially increasing the risk of crime, persistent poverty and reduced economic productivity.",
        "background": "A place to prepare the homeless for job interviews. By providing amenities and accommodation including showers, food and specialist support, the homeless will suffer with decreased psychological distress, less difficulty obtaining employment, and increased safety, health, and discrimination.",
