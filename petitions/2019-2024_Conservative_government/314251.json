        "additional_details": "My wife works as a domestic assinstant in the NHS hospital. She and her colleagues take care of cleaning the infected areas and are as exposed to the coronavirus as other members of the frontline staff. And yet nobody even mentions the domestic assistants or porters, when talking about the heroic frontline staff. They deserve better. In fact, they deserve the same level of recognition, as anyone else working on the frontline of the fight with coronavirus. This fight cannot be won without them.",
        "background": "I want the work of the domestic and portering NHS staff to be recognised in exactly the same way as the work of the doctors, nurses and other professional NHS staff, both materially and morally. They are the lowest paid and unsung heroes of the coronavirus epidemic.",
