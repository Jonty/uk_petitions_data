        "action": "Cancel BTEC exams for College Students amid COVID-19 & delayed opening",
        "additional_details": "Despite colleges best efforts to make online teaching a success, it has been a real struggle to keep up with work, assignments and exams without face to face teaching. Students have missed out on so much content for courses. I study a BTEC Applied Science Course and myself and friends and other college students believe that BTECS have been left out in response to the pandemic. So I write this petition to help me and other students have the best possible chance of passing exams by cancelling them.",
        "background": "There has been millions of college students including myself that have been affected by Coronavirus. Personally, I have struggled completing assignments because of the lack of face to face teaching. I have also, as I speak for my friends too, struggled to revise as we have missed out on so much.",
