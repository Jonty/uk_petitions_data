        "additional_details": "if the year 10 students get their predicted grads/ teacher based assessment they will thrive and be able to succeed in college and university, but if they continue to learn this way, in google classroom and eventually when schools open, then they won\u2019t be able to get the grade that they would be able to get if the lockdown hadn\u2019t occurred. This will be a very negative occurrence and it will be very common; students all across the UK will be more likely to turn to crime and away from school.",
        "background": "The government should review the case with year 10 students as it won\u2019t be fair for them to sit their gcse exams as they have missed 3 months of school and it will have a negative effect on their education.",
