        "additional_details": "I want the Government to do it because ultimately they are the ones who have the power to bring something like this into play, to make the nation recognise its importance. I understand we have a NHS Sustainability day but also understand this focuses on how to sustain the NHS Service not necessarily celebrating the nations heroes.",
        "background": "Just like we have a Red Nose Day I think we should have a NHS DAY to celebrate our nations heroes, as I think it is shocking it took until the Covid-19 pandemic for us to recognise them. On this day we could fundraise and hold events to celebrate as well as doing a country wide clap for heroes.",
