        "additional_details": "The students who are passing out this year, have their visa valid till August. They will not be getting any opportunity to do internship, launch a start up or do jobs because of the corona virus. After investing more than \u00a360000 in education they should be given an extension post expiry. Lot of students have gone back to their country and because of the lockdown they are not able to travel back to UK. They should get the benefits of post study visa.",
        "background": "The government should consider giving visa extensions to students who have passed out this year as most of them are unable to gain any experience post their study due to the lockdown. In past years the government did give post study extension but had stopped it few years back.",
