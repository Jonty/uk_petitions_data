Part of this reconciliation process would involve removal of any inflammatory commemorations, such as statues and plaques honouring the slave trade. \r\nThere has been precedent set in professional sport for a more culturally appropriate name. Examples: NBA - Tri-Cities \"Blackhawks\" = Atlanta Hawks; MLB - Burlington Indians = Burlington Royals.",
