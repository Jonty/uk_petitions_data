        "additional_details": "Thorium is readily available & can be turned into energy without generating transuranic wastes. Thorium\u2019s capacity as nuclear fuel was discovered during WWII, but ignored because it was unsuitable for making bombs. A liquid-fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR) is the optimal approach for harvesting energy from Thorium, and has the potential to solve today\u2019s energy/climate crisis. LFTR is a type of Thorium Molten Salt Reactor (Th-MSR). It would provide cheaper more abundant energy and is much safer.",
        "background": "I want the Government to look in to, research and invest in liquid-fluoride thorium reactors (LFTR) as an alternative to the current uranium nuclear reactors. Thorium nuclear reactors are much safer, cheaper to run and Thorium is much more abundant element.",
