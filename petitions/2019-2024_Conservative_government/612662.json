However, it will put a training doctor in \u00a345,500 and nurses \u00a327,775 debt before they have even graduated to pay for their education. How is this fair, when they are trying to amend the crisis the NHS is facing? Nurses not making enough to be in a stable position to repay. Doctors as well, facing an impossible debt to try and repay!",

This includes: medicine, nursing, radiology and the many other branches. The government could scrap all student debt, half the costs or pay students a sum of money monthly.",
