We drive in on Saturdays and Sunday to unload goods and stock. It's going to be near impossible for us to start making a living again. Please, please don't do this. It's going to be hard enough to encourage people into markets and retail, let alone making it unaffordable. You will endanger peoples lives being forced onto trains and public transport.",
