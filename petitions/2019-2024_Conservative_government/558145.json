        "additional_details": "Physical activity is vital for our health, both physical and mental. There are more barriers to running than simply having the opportunity: lack of motivation, personal safety concerns, lack of knowledge, or simply feeling nervous or self-conscious. Running clubs and groups combat all of these. In an organised group people can be supported to exercise regularly. It is safer for women to run in groups, especially in the winter. Running is a socially distanced activity with no surface contacts.",
        "background": "Allow Running Clubs and RunTogether Groups which are registered with England Athletics to continue with covid-secure outdoor group activities during the second lockdown period.",
