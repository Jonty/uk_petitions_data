        "additional_details": "Kwasi Kwarteng recently announced in his 'mini-budget' a range of ill-advised tax cuts funded by borrowing (so unfunded) to help stimulate the stagnant economy. However, it will increased national debt, inflation rates and interest rates whilst lowering the value of the pound. All of this increases pressure on the cost of living and actually encourages more stagnation in the economy - Do the right thing for the country, not your careers.",
