        "additional_details": "Having a \u00a33000+ pay rise on already a very comfortable salary is not fair on the vast majority of the British public. \u00a379,468 is too much already and it\u2019s about time this was frozen or reduced all together. \r\nAt the same time allowances for 2nd homes should be scrapped and if Accomodation is needed then a B&B can be used both reducing costs and putting into local economies rather than MP\u2019s own pockets.\r\nA review of allowed expenses should be held with a mandatory cheapest item purchase requirement",
        "background": "In times of national crisis when many are loosing their jobs it is wrong to allow MP\u2019s to get very large pay rises. All pay rises should be scrapped, allowances reduced and a rule made to make MPs find the cheapest item for what can be claimed as expenses and 2nd home allowances scrapped altogether.",
