We could all be doing our bit, we can all afford it, we have the option to opt of if needed.  But you watch, the UK will be fully behind this . . . some might say the UK government should be funding more (they can opt out). This is our (the workers of the UK's) opportunity to give a massive thank you to the NHS and offer ongoing continued support. THANK YOU NHS.",
        "background": "Every UK worker fund NHS, with opt out option, \u00a35 per month. Based circa 30,000,000 working people this would generate \u00a3150 million per month, that's \u00a31.8 billion per year.  The time is right, the whole of the UK is behind the NHS, we need the NHS and the whole of the UK will support the NHS.",
