        "additional_details": "The Government have the power to tax companies who make substantial profits at the expense of the people it serves.

These increased costs make inflation rise and then have a knock-on effect in every area of life.  Big companies should be made to pay when the have profited from the citizens of this country.",
        "background": "Many energy companies have recorded substantially large profits whilst consumers are being faced with ever increasing fuel costs.  We are now in a situation where people are faced with fuel poverty - a choice where they have to decide between fuel or food, or some other item.",
