        "additional_details": "It's now been a year and over 100,000 people have died in the UK - a devastating figure in itself and one of the worst proportionally among developed nations across the world. From ignoring the science to confused public messages, private outsourcing, lack of PPE, absence of early mass testing, open airports, poor resources for NHS and schools, the list goes on. The UK government has demonstrated failure at every level.",
        "background": "There should be an inquiry into the quality of decision making, exposure of the scientific and expert recommendations and why some of this was ignored or acted upon too late, leading to one of the worst death rates since WW2 which many other developed countries have largely managed to avoid.",
