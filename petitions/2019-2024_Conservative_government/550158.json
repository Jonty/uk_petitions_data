        "action": "End the mandatory wearing of face masks in schools",
        "additional_details": "By imposing the wearing of masks, amongst other authoritarian COVID measures, we are in danger of psychologically damaging the current generation of children in schools. We have already seen children returning home in distress as a result of the COVID measures that schools have been forced to implement. 2020 has been traumatic enough for children, and given the extremely low health risk posed by the school environment, we feel it is only right that the wearing of masks should be a personal choice.",
        "background": "To ensure that children and teachers can thrive in the school environment, we ask the government to remove the need for pupils and staff to have to wear a face mask when on school campus. Pupils and staff should be given the right to chose for themselves whether wearing a face mask is necessary.",
