        "additional_details": "This will give tax payers confidence that MP\u2019s understand the financial pain that employees and businesses throughout the UK have been undergoing for the last 7 months and are likely to suffer for many months to come. It is not comforting to know that MP\u2019s and members of devolved governments are insulated from the financial pain they are inflicting on business and employees. If we are truly \u201call in this together\u201d, then the financial pain must be shared equally.",
        "background": "Parliament can voluntarily reduce MP\u2019s salaries to the same levels being offered to employees on Furlough or JSS. The balance of salaries  can be donated to health charities. Many business owners have worked for no salary to keep business afloat, an equivalent gesture from MP\u2019s is needed.",
