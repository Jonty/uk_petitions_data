However the equivalent of the national minimum wage for over-18s, known as the national living wage, increases steadily between the ages of 18 and 23. It's therefore not clear which of these wages you want under-18s to be required to be paid. You can find out more about these rates here: https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates.\r\n\r\nYou might like to sign this petition which calls for a very similar action:\r\n\r\n'Make the minimum wage equal for all': https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/600960"
