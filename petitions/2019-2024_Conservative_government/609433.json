        "additional_details": "Off the back of Covid and rising costs, small businesses must be protected from practices including the posting of fake negative reviews. Small businesses generated \u00a31.4 Trillion in revenue and contribute \u00a3110bn in tax (as of 2017-18).\r\n \r\nWhen someone hasn't visited a business itself but takes to review platforms and social media to post negative reviews about a business this can have a detrimental effect on the business, and also the business owner's mental health. It is not acceptable.",
        "background": "The Government should make it a criminal offence to post a fake negative review, so people who post fake negative reviews about businesses can be prosecuted. Offenders should face substantial fines, equivalent to the financial losses affected businesses experience.",
