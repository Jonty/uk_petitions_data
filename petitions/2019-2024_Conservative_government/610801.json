        "action": "Protect hedgerow habitat from excessive use of mechanised equipment",
        "additional_details": "Annual and bi-annual hedge cutting across the UK has brought about sharp declines of hedgerow-dependent wildlife. There is widely visible evidence that Government guidelines on the frequency of mechanised cuts are not being followed and field margin setaside payments are being wasted on sterile ecosystems as a result. The Health and Harmony document cites the importance of sustainable land management and the role landowners play in the welfare of the countryside. We agree with this citation.",
        "background": "Make annual / biannual hedge and underbrush cutting with tractor-driven blades illegal.\r\nLicence flail and rotary cutting equipment operation.\r\nEnsure setaside subsidies are provided only where the entire ecosystem within the given boundary is protected, including hedgerow cover in such a mandate.",
