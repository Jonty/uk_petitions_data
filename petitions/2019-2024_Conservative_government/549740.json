        "action": "Gov. should setup TV channels for school teaching until corona virus is gone.",
        "additional_details": "We are taking too much risk by sending children to school as social distancing is not realistic specially in primary schools. Children coming from different households and sharing a class room for some hours in a day. there is a risk of children becoming carriers of the virus and pass it on to elderly parents and grand parents at home. At least until it is safe the government should consider setting TV channels for schools teaching same like Gov of Kerala successfully implemented.",
        "background": "As social distancing is not practical especially in primary schools. It is not a wise option to send children back to school in the midst of this crisis. We may be potentially accelerating the risk of an surge in infection. Hence gov should consider setting up TV channel for each year group.",
