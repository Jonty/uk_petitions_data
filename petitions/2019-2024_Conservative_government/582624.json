        "additional_details": "Therefore, we want the government to address the institutional failings that BAME experience on a daily basis and highlight how these will be eliminated. BAME need to operate in an equal playing field and not face discrimination through activities like racial profiling due to perceived notions of race, sex, age and faith. The reality is equality of opportunity does not exist for those it defines as BAME.",
        "background": "The government must not use this report as a credible reference for addressing racial equality in the UK as it is inaccurate and fails to deliver. We request a more thorough examination of the evidence supporting the ideology that institutional racism does not exist in the UK.",
