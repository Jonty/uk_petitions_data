        "action": "Stop supermarket and energy companies increase their prices more than inflation",
        "additional_details": "I have a keen head for numbers and have realised that supermarkets especially are increasing their prices way above inflation and taking advantage of the cost of living crisis.  I have noticed a great deal of products being increased by almost 50% over the past 12 months.  I go shopping in our household on a weekly basis and even own brand products have been increased extortionately.  When companies like shell announce \u00a332.2bn profit, this is not acceptable and I know the supermarkets will be the same.",
        "background": "Limit the amount that big companies increase their prices by no more than inflation on a yearly basis ie supermarkets & energy companies as this is having a detrimental effect on peoples standards of living and causing a lot of mental health and stress related issues.",
