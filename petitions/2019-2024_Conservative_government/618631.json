Transport for London should work with local bus garages to set a deadline to make sure that all London buses have a functioning air conditioning system for when temperatures rise.",
        "background": "TFL should install air conditioning on all London running buses. Currently, temperatures inside the drivers' cab are reaching highs of 45+ degrees. This is not safe for the driver and can impose a serious health risk which can affect their ability to safely carry out their duties in this heat.",
