        "action": "Make causing someone harm by using a knife automatically wound with intent.",
        "additional_details": "Recently an associate of mine was stabbed with a knife in a public space. The attacker ended up receiving community service. The attacker did not go to juvenile prison because there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to support that this was wounding with intent. The victim has been left with no justice or protection. I feel that if wound with intent was automatic when carrying a knife it would get more victims justice and help to lower knife crime as there is a repercussion for their behaviour.",
        "background": "To make it law that if you are in possession of a bladed article (knife) in a public place and then use it to cause harm to someone it should automatically be wound with intent. This will help to make it easier to prosecute the offender with a tougher sentence.",
