This acts as a deterrent for defending ourselves. People wouldn\u2019t break in to a house when they know that they might end up dead. We propose a stand your ground law, where we use any means necessary to neutralise a threat, be this using a knife or other item in a house.",
        "background": "Ideally, the outcome of this would be that self defence laws within the uk would change to allow the victim of a crime (burglary, mugging etc) to use any force that they feel is necessary at the time. This would mean they were exempt from being charged with assault.",
