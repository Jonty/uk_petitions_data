        "additional_details": "Focussing on calories in food and fat-shaming can trigger and exacerbate eating disorders. Calories on menus should be optional, e.g. information available online or on separate menus on request. \r\nA campaign for people to lose weight needs to be done in a sensitive manner that does not fat-shame overweight and obese people or stigmatise obesity. Fat-shaming does not help people lose weight.\r\nSee www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk for further information.",
        "background": "I would like the government to:\r\n\u2043 change the proposed legislation requiring calories to be put on menus;\r\n- make sure the campaign to lose weight does not fat-shame or stigmatise obesity;\r\n\u2043 review existing anti-obesity measures to assess their effectiveness and make sure they don\u2019t cause harm.",
