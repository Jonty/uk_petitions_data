        "additional_details": "As a vegetarian, many places do provide a good variety, however just as many still limit the options. Often I enjoy \u2018pub grub\u2019 on a Sunday afternoon and many places don\u2019t have option of a simple sausage and mash as vegetarian. The traditional hearty foods you want to enjoy at the pub aren\u2019t available while others around you can enjoy it. It would be great to see those simple, hearty dishes with the option of vegetarian. Nothing fancy, just your tasty, traditional meals.",
        "background": "I would love restaurants/bars to feel inspired to provide more of a variety of vegetarian meals. Simple options such as vegetarian sausages with mash and veg. Many places have a vegetarian burger or a cheese pizza, which seems unfair.",
