My GP has basically said to me they cant do anything about it which has led them to putting me on 4 different medications within 3 months causing horrible side affects. I have spoken to a number of people across the UK and they have experienced similar. It seems they only get involved once it's too late. This could save many lives and improve many as well. It is about saving and improving lives!",

Right now the NHS are stretched thin regarding mental health support and there needs to be more effort put into this. To make it clear this has needed done before COVID-19 and needs done after as well.",
