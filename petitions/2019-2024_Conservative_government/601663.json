Churchill famously said 'I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat', and without a rapid change of course we will soon face food and water scarcity and a breakdown of society as we know it. Collecting more duty from all fossil fuels will force consumers and businesses to change habits and fund a fundamental shift across the entire nation.",
        "background": "The UK Government must collect an increasingly higher duty on all types of fossil fuel used for all private and business uses. These extra funds must be aimed at fast-tracking sustainable and affordable green energy and support a generational transition to sustainable business practices.",
