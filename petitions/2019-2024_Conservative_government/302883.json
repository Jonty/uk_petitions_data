        "additional_details": "I have recently spoken with the secretaries at  both of my children's schools regarding keeping the children off and they have both said that this would be viewed, and thus documented as unauthorised absence. I feel that if a parent is able to keep a child at home then they should be allowed to do so without being penalised at this unprecedented time.  I find it ludicrous that large corporate companies are relaxing the rules in this pandemic yet this school rule remains.",
