        "additional_details": "For many people fleeing war zones or other forms of persecution, there are no accessible legal routes they can take to claim refuge or  asylum in the UK. Instead of paying Rwanda millions of pounds to provide refugee camps, proactively seek out and support people fleeing war or persecution and invest in their integration into the UK to contribute to the economy. This will encourage them to use this route rather than turn to people traffickers and will make migration managed.",
        "background": "Address the real problem by stopping the people traffickers who profit from providing illegal transfer of refugees and asylum seekers to UK shores because legitimate routes are inaccessible. Sending vulnerable refugees to countries with poor human rights records is complicit and inhumane.",
