        "additional_details": "Businesses have spent millions trying to stay afloat during the pandemic, made problematic without any customers. Now face insolvency.\r\nAfter spending millions, redesigning spaces to make them COVID safe and passing new government inspections, it is outrageous to waste all this and tax payer\u2019s money for insurance companies who insured pre-pandemic without issues are now refusing to. We are all tax payers as are our customers, we now need government to instruct insurance companies or to step in.",
        "background": "We need government to underwrite liability insurance due to Insurance companies refusing to provide it to the Adult hospitality industry. After a long year of Government support providing loans and furlough for staff, millions will be wasted if businesses are arbitrarily barred from opening.",
