        "action": "Due to Covid, hold children back a year to catchup and give kids an equal chance",
        "additional_details": "The kids missing so much of the school year means that the social gap has widened. Even homeschooling is hit and miss, some parents can't home school, some parent have to work. Our Children's education is suffering, and they will continue to suffer and will become the Covid generation. Extending the school day for kids to catch up is difficult, so this could be a win win. Our kids education shouldn't be inadequate due to covid. Turn a negative into a positive; Start the year again",
        "background": "Give our children a second change to be educated. Let them re-take the last academic year. Close the social educational gap that Covid has created. Most learning is stepping stones, and this year there will be huge gaps in our kids education which will hinder educational attainment for future years.",
