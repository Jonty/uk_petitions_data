Government has successfully and generously supported other sectors including leisure, hospitality, and retail. We call on you to debate the findings of the Semple WhitePaper and provide support for visual artists and safeguard creativity.",
        "background": "There is no doubt the pandemic has had a catastrophic impact on various sectors and whilst the government has provided for many, sadly there is a noticeable lack of specific support for our visual artists. New research shows a crisis in visual artists and they desperately need help.",
