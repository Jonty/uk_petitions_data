        "additional_details": "Currently, hair strand tests carried out to suit the growth of European hair. Afro hair has a much slower growth rate. Hair is tested at 1cm per month. Afro hair grows between 0.3cm and 0.6cm per month. This means that if a black person has been abstinent from drugs for 3 months, they will not produce a negative hair strand test result for at least 5 months but it could be longer.",
