        "additional_details": "The statistics for coronavirus cases clearly show countries such as India, France, Russia, Italy, Spain and Germany having more cases per day and also more deaths from Covid than Pakistan. If the countries that pose more threat to the UK have not been added to the red list then on what basis and what data has the Government used to place Pakistan in the red list. The Government has not taken a fair decision and we would request the Government to reconsider and remove Pakistan from the red list.",

We would like a clear explanation to why Pakistan and its community here in the UK has been discriminated against.",
