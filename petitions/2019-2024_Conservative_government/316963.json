        "additional_details": "Not everyone in the UK is eligible to claim benefits. In fact, there are many people who are struggling to pay rent, like full-time students. If the government has offered a 3-month 'mortgage holiday' to help landlords, then they should do it for renters too. People like full-time students and others who cannot claim benefits are either still paying full or partial rent. To discuss rent arrears with landlords is not always a solution, as people might not be able to reach an agreement.",
