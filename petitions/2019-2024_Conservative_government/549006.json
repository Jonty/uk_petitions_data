But let's also do the same for homeless UK citizens that also need similar levels of support, who may have paid into the welfare system, may be a service veteran, may have fallen on hard times etc or may need mental health support that is in short supply within the NHS system. \r\n\r\nIf the govt can afford to provide services to those breaking the law we can also provide it to others.",
