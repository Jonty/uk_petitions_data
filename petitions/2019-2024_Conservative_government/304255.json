        "additional_details": "If golf courses are to close, potentially 30% could go bankrupt and close affecting thousands of employees and associated industries. The green staff would stop maintaining the course and it will take years to bring it back into condition. Around 2 million people play golf each week, many are under 70 years old! The loss of their recreational activity and social discussions will be lost and long-term will affect well-being. It is easily possible to maintain a safe distance while playing golf.",
        "background": "Whilst we all fully understand the very serious issues the Coronavirus is presenting to the world; The UK Golf Federation want the Governments support to keep golf courses open through the term of the Coronavirus.",
