        "additional_details": "The exclusion of alcohol in the takeaway option for hospitality puts publicans at a disadvantage. Many essential shops are selling alcohol. People are less likely to support their local pub or restaurant if they cannot buy takeaway alcohol to go with their meal. In the previous lockdown, alcohol was included in the takeaway option if it was sold in a sealed container and taken from the premises. Publicans have already ordered and paid for their November wet supplies which is just a waste.",
