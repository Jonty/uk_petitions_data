        "additional_details": "Uphold original employment contracts on the terms and agreements originally signed. It's illegal in Spain and Ireland. It should be illegal here too. Large corporate companies should not be able to make such changes, forcing people into different contracts for sometimes less pay and working conditions. Change Employment legislation to protect workers from this loophole.",
        "background": "Companies are deliberately firing people to rehire them on worse contracts. It is legal in this country, but it's leaving thousands of us in the lurch. Companies shouldn't be able to force staff into choosing between worse contracts and redundancy. Change employment law to protect UK workers.",
