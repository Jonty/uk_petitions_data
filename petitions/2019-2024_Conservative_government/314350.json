        "additional_details": "There's a mountain to climb before the coronavirus pandemic is over. We want to give thanks now to all NHS staff, doing their day-to-day duties with kindness and humanity in extreme circumstances. We hope that the George Cross will help honour key workers who have sadly lost their lives in doing their job.\r\n\r\nEvery household has something to thank the NHS for, from birth to death, in all nations and regions of the UK. The George Cross has been awarded to organisations before. Time to do so again.",
        "background": "If you've stood on your doorstep this week to clap for our key workers, then sign this petition for the George Cross - a lasting tribute to the NHS. \r\n\r\nThe George Cross is the UK's highest civilian honour. The NHS should now receive one too for courage and service during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
