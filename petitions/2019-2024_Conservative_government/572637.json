We want to be recognised and we want the degree to go back to being fully funded. We are training because we love what we do but it is difficult, it is testing and right now, a lot of us are asking why we are doing it? Upon graduation a lot of us will be in \u00a360K worth of debt. This could be slashed by up to half of the degree was funded.",
