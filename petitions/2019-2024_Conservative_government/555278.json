        "additional_details": "The UK National Minimum Wage is defined by the government as the minimum amount which it is possible for a person to pay their basic living costs. Many workers on minimum wage work in the hospitality sector which are being temporarily closed under COVID. Paying only a total of 80% of minimum wage will force large parts of the working population into increased poverty. The government has defined a minimum wage and this should be guaranteed even when your place of work is closed by COVID",
        "background": "Change Universal Credit for those workers on the National Minimum Wage so that the 66% government wage support to employers is topped up to 100% of the National Minimum Wage, not 80% as is currently the case. pubs and hospitality venues are being shut due to COVID and the poorest should not suffer.",
