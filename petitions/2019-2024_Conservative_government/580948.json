In a buoyant market; buyers are not fully doing their due diligence before making an offer on a property and there is little to no recourse if they simply change their minds. This is the biggest purchase most people will make in their lifetimes and should be treated as such. A legally mandated deposit will aid buyers treating their decisions with a much greater deal of commitment.",
