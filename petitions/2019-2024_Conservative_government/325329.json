        "additional_details": "Edward Colston was a Bristol-born English slave trader, merchant, and Member of Parliament who acquired significant Part of his wealth through the trade and exploitation of slaves.\r\n\r\nHis name is commemorated in several Bristol landmarks, streets, three schools and the Colston bun.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a disgrace for a slave trader to still be celebrated or commemorated in this day and age.\r\n\r\nWe ask that all such roads and landmarks drop the Colston name and instead are more appropriately renamed.",
