Some people are having to travel abroad due to helplessness and inevitable circumstances, however it seems as if these cases are being neglected.  It is comprehensible as to why this measure has been implemented, however people should be able to isolate in their homes. People are struggling to pay the \"hotel fee\" and are having to take debts to do so. Allow people to isolate in their own homes.",
