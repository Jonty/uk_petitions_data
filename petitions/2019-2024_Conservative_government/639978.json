        "additional_details": "The rising thefts in the area are becoming more alarming, people are getting too comfortable with stealing bikes as they are now doing it in broad day light, every day there\u2019s a new post about someone\u2019s bike being stolen, this has to stop. We pay our taxes just to have a bike stolen and then the police won\u2019t or can\u2019t do anything, this has to change, even if it was a small thing like Mandatory GPS trackers, or more motorcycle police in and out of the area.",
        "background": "Invest some of our hard earned money into the police to combat the rising motorbike theft problem. As you may not know, the police are under funded and under manned, when a bike is stolen they produce a crime number and that\u2019s it, no other investigation, we would like this to change.",
