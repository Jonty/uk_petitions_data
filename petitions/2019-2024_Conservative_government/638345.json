        "additional_details": "Banning Confucius Institutes in the UK, as the Prime Minister called for in June 2022, would help stop Beijing\u2019s propaganda that damages core British values.\r\nConfucius Institutes are a threat to universities' academic and freedom of speech as the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill have debated in the House of Commons. Their influence has led universities to restrict students' speech and academic rights.",
