        "additional_details": "The majority of the sector is self-employed and given that live performances will not return until the end of the year at the earliest, the government needs to adopt an industry specific and targeted approach to help theatres and the people who work within it. The sector employs tens of thousands of people and contributes billions of pounds to the economy every year. The second SEISS payment (although welcome) will not cover living costs for the amount of time theatres are likely to be closed.",
        "background": "Investment in theatre equals investment in communities. The government should find a way for live performances to recommence, to avoid the risk of industry collapse and to avert financial hardship on its many employees.",
