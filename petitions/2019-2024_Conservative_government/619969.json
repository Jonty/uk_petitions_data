        "additional_details": "We feel that our freedoms are being slowly taken away since parking restrictions have been introduced. These changes restrict forest access for people on low income, create crowding and limits exploring opportunities for our children. We believe we should have a right in the decision process. Moreover, our community should benefit from a substantial amount of the income generated by these restrictions and changes introduced over the last two years.",
