        "action": "Stop the government from replacing juries and delivering fair justice",
        "additional_details": "The court backlog was caused by govt cuts, not Covid\r\nWe had a bigger backlog in 2014 and nobody suggested abolishing juries\r\nAny decision to replace juries with judges & magistrates would be in the interests of government, not justice.\r\n41,000 cases is unacceptable. Our reaction shouldn't be tearing up the right to jury trial, and replacing it with trial by a single judge and two magistrates. Action means resourcing the system properly, re-opening courts, sourcing alternative venues.",
        "background": "The gvt has had since March to identify 'Nightingale' courts to make jury trial workable. It has done nothing &let the backlog grow.\r\n\r\nNow it will say that there is no choice but to replace juries - lie.",
