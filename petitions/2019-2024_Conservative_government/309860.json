        "additional_details": "The government are struggling to support the self employed in the same way they are supporting those on PAYE. Many self employed people will have already made an advance payment towards their 2020/21 tax bill and that payment was calculated on expected earnings for that tax year, which are now highly likely to be much lower. Refunding these payment should be relatively simple and will go a long way to helping to support these people until a longer term solution can be put in place.",
