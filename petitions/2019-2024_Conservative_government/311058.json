I have had cold symptoms (no cough or fever) from Sunday last week, during that time I attended my workplace. If I had been tested before I would have known not to go to work and further infect others. Frontline staff should be tested to maintain operation capability and reinforce the strength of NHS staff helping the most vulnerable.\r\n(Also we need more PPE urgently)",
