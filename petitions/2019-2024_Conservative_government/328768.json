We wear full PPE and have a very strict clean down policy after each client before Covid 19. We work in a clinical environment with no soft furnishings and use medical grade disinfectant after each client. We are used to dealing with blood and are trained on blood born pathogens. \r\nWe work on one client at a time rather than two like hairdressers.\r\nWe are more equipped and trained than hairdressers to go back to work safely.",
