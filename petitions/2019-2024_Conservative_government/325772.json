The Review does however make certain other recommendations to address concerns about the treatment of BAME people by the justice system. You can find out more here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/643001/lammy-review-final-report.pdf.\r\n\r\nYou may wish to sign this petition which calls for systemic racism to be addressed by implementing the findings of the Lammy and Angiolini Reviews: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/329097."
