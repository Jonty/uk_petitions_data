        "action": "Re-open universities with some face to face/lectures learning by mid February",
        "additional_details": "Students are becoming very isolated which effects mental health and long term effects. They are in need with more support and need to experience their time at university as much as secondary schools and colleges have been. There are many more suicides each year from work related stress, to depression and anxiety - opening campuses and face to face learning will encourage students to stay motivated and encourage individuals to work more effectively and happily. Their future career relies on this.",
        "background": "The government should re-open university campuses and have face to face lectures by mid February to ensure students to learn effectively. Last year (3rd/4th year students) are not experiencing their last year of university with effective and thorough learning which juggles with their future career.",
