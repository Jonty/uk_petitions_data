        "additional_details": "Recent events have highlighted flaws in the enforcement of the Ministerial Code of Conduct.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the Prime Minister has a conflict of interest having appointed both the Minister and the investigator. If there is a conflict between the two, the Prime Minister is left with the politically difficult choice of deciding whom to back. If the decision were made independently, this difficulty would not arise.\r\n\r\nFurther, it is important that justice be seen to be done. Among other things, this means explaining how the decision was reached. If the decision was reached in an open manner, it is more easily accepted by the Public.",
        "background": "We request that in future the Government pass the judgement whether the Ministerial Code of Conduct has been broken to an open and independent body. It would not be necessary to create a new body for this, the existing Courts would be suitable.",
