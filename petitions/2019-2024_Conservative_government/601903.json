These people struggle to feed themselves and their children.\r\n Yet, supermarkets, restaurants, bakeries and greengrocers throw out masses of food each year. This food could be used to feed those in need!\r\n Obviously, the food that is donated to those in need should be of edible and safe quality - food that is past its use-by date shouldn\u2019t be eaten. But there is no need for such waste!",

Sometimes, homeless people don\u2019t eat for days! Despite this, some UK supermarkets UK throw out the equivalent of 190 million meals a year!",
