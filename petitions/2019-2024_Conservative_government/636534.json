Its unfair to have to pay for something that makes you well. Just how i collect my monthly prescription from the gp because i dont work i dont have to pay for them. This would give many people a better quality of life whilst improving their financial needs.",
        "background": "i am prescribed medical cannabis, however this is ta private clinic and is costing me alot, i have low income due to not been able to work due to my health. In Scotland it is available on the NHS. Yet people are having to go without things to get their medication to have a \u201cstandard\u201d quality of life",
