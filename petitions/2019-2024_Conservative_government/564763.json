        "additional_details": "Historically the scrap metal trade has been a cash in hand industry. This creates difficulties as there is no audit trail, making identification of individuals who may be trading stolen metal near impossible. An amendment to the Scrap Metal Merchants Act 1964 to prohibit cash transactions and introducting a scrap metal tax, would make payment by cheque or directly into a bank account mandatory and would be a significant component in reducing metal theft.",
        "background": "Due to a significant rise in value metal has become a much sought after commodity. This increased demand has resulted in a sharp rise in metal theft nationally. Recently we had the catalytic converter stolen off our family car, my husband was chased down with weapons when he tried to stop the theft.",
