        "additional_details": "As year on year the issue of dog attacks keeps being raised and so far the only move made by parliament was to ban 4 types of dog that has not made any difference to the number of attacks on people, infact according to PDSA since 2018 dog ownership has increased by 15% and  FOI requests revealed in March that police records have seen a staggering 34 percent rise in incidents of out-of-control dogs causing injury",
        "background": "Instead of blaming specific dog breeds, lets focus on responsible breeding and ownership. All dogs require proper training and socialization. The rise in unruly dogs is partly due to unregulated, quick-fix training tips on social media. These often include harsh methods that only suppress issues.",
