Over this timeframe NHS waiting lists doubled from 2 to 4million.\r\n\r\nCompared to the timeframe of 2001-2009, funding grew by 2.5%GDP. In this time, waiting lists peaked at ~4million, but declined to ~2million.\r\n\r\nThere's clear trend between funding (in %GDP)& the quality of care the NHS can provide. Meanwhile fossil fuels kill us with tax money.",

We want taxation of this profit to directly fund our NHS which- despite increased \"real terms\" spending- has seen funding cuts in terms of %GDP since 2010.",
