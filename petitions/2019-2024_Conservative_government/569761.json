        "action": "Ensure early COVID vaccination for unpaid family carers",
        "additional_details": "There are hundreds of thousands of unpaid carers, working quietly and unnoticed, supporting disabled family members throughout the UK.  Their selfless efforts save the UK economy billions of pounds every year but mean long days and months or even years of hard work without a break.  Lockdown has increased the physical and emotional pressures exponentially.  The toll is already great and they should not be left behind by the vaccination programme.",
        "background": "The roll out of the COVID vaccination programme is divided into 8 tiers, but nowhere are unpaid family carers mentioned, even though they do a job every bit as critical as frontline staff.  Unpaid family carers should be a priority for vaccination too.",
