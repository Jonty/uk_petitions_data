This would cover suffering caused by taking a dog for a walk in excessive heat.\r\n\r\nThe Government's code of practice for the welfare of dogs, which provides owners and keepers with information on how to meet the welfare needs of their animals, and can be used in courts as evidence in cases brought before them relating to poor welfare, specifically highlights the risks of heat stress: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/697953/pb13333-cop-dogs-091204.pdf\r\n\r\nDecisions about investigating alleged animal welfare offences and prosecuting these are a matter for the police and Crown Prosecution Service, not the Government or House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIf you are concerned about how police in your area respond to reports of animal cruelty, you could raise these concerns with your Police and Crime Commissioner, who is responsible for overseeing policing in your area. You can find contact details for your Police and Crime Commissioner here: https://www.apccs.police.uk/find-your-pcc/"
