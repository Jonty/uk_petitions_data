If we was to make all dog breeds/types be muzzled we could stop dog attacks on the vulnerable dogs that have to already wear muzzles and keep their owners from being bitten by the none muzzled dog",
        "background": "Since the xl bully ban there has been more attacks on the xl bully type dogs that have to wear muzzles and to stay on the lead , this is unacceptable ownership of the other dog  with no control of it ,\r\nSo to keep all dogs safe all dog breeds/ types should wear a muzzle over the months you have",
