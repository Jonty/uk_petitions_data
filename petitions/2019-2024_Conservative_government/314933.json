        "action": "Start rolling out Covid-19 test via local authorities",
        "additional_details": "Currently we do not know if people have already been affected by the virus or not. We need to follow a similar system as China to allow people a verification code or some form of result to say that they are virus free and can resume some form of normality. The longer the lockdown progresses without any structured method of testing, the worst the consequences will be for everyone. By placing the responsibility with local authorities we can systematically rule out which areas are virus free.",
        "background": "In order to help the country out of lockdown. This petition calls for testing to be placed in the hands of local authorities in order for each household to be systematically tested to show if they are clear of Covid-19. That way we can start to move out of lockdown.",
