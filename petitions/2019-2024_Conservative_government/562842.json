        "additional_details": "Although this is not the final outcome we want to achieve, it is a step on the road to empowering parents to have the opportunity for equal parental leave. \r\n\r\nFrance has already implemented this as law and Spain offers 12 weeks currently moving to 16 weeks, so why are we so far behind? It's time to take the first step - the UK needs to make paternity leave 4 weeks.\r\n\r\nIf we get this, we double the amount of time we spend with our little ones at one of the most important times in their development.",
        "background": "Dads want more time with their children, the UK has fallen behind in parental leave in this area, offering only 2 weeks. This is the first step in making parental leave equal in the UK. By making paternity leave for dads a minimum of 1 month we will be able to spend more time with our children",
