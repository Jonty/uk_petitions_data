University students haven't had any support whatsoever from the money hungry government. University students are expected to pay full price for an accommodation most of them aren't using. This is unfair, unjust, and inhumane to expect us to pay thousands, putting ourselves in debt for something we don't need anymore. We are fully within our rights to request this.",
