        "additional_details": "By removing planning restrictions around boundary walls and gates, citizens can begin to take proactive steps in safeguarding their homes and assets from potential criminals. Enabling the construction of secure boundaries should act as a deterrent against criminal activities and offer a heightened sense of security to residents in their neighbourhoods.",
        "background": "The Government should remove requirements for planning permission for boundary structures and provide residents with the autonomy to build robust boundary walls and install gates without a time-consuming planning process. This could help mitigate crime and protect citizens in a quicker way.",
