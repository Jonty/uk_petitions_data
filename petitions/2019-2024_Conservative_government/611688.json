Students sometimes can't even take their minds off homework.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to stop homework, this will reduce stress. A recent experiment shows that 70% of the students at a school say homework is too stressful for them. Homework is not useful at all and most students do not put any effort into it. We want homework to be reduced or stoped!",
