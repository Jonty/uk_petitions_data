        "action": "Completely overhaul the Mental Health Service urgently",
        "additional_details": "There is not enough support or emergency support available currently to those with serious mental health problems, experiencing psychosis or other \"episode\".  Only 2 options are available out of hours that mean a place at The Haven (of which in Hove we only have 4 places available) or a trip to A&E.  Sending a mental health patient to A&E whilst they are in crisis is not an acceptable option.  Waiting 4 - 6 hours in a heightened state to see a Mental Health Worker is unacceptable.",
        "background": "Conduct an urgent & complete overhaul of the Mental Health Service in the UK - it currently does not provide adequate support for Mental Health patients in crisis due to serious underfunding and understaffing - this needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.",
