        "action": "UK wide ban on the sale and production of Glue traps",
        "additional_details": "We want Parliament to recognise the abhorrent nature of these glue traps and stop the selling and production of them in the UK . The RSPCA has revealed that 243 glue trap incidents were reported to its cruelty line in the last five years (2015-2019). These reports included incidents with cats, garden birds, hedgehogs, squirrels and even a parrot .  With the wide variety of alternatives present on the market we believe that this is unnecessary and easily preventable .",
        "background": "Glue traps are used as a technique to trap animals . This results in a slow , painful death with animals either suffocating or starving . They are indiscriminate in nature so despite them being placed to catch vermin , animals such as birds , cats and even dogs have been caught in them as well.",
