Doctors who complete death certificates are required to record the causes of death to the best of their knowledge and belief. Whether or not Covid-19 or complications from a Covid-19 vaccination are listed as a cause of death is a clinical judgement for individual medical professionals.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nRequire vaccine history be recorded on death certificates: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/587506"
