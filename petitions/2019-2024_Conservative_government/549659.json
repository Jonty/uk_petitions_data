        "additional_details": "Please, for the protection of people like me, make it compulsory to carry exemption cards, given by a registered GP, with you, if you are really exempt from wearing a face mask. Simply saying you\u2019re \u2018exempt\u2019 is providing an easy excuse for the masses not to wear face coverings, even when they have no health issues. And it\u2019s putting vulnerable lives at risk, as it has been stated that those with COVID-19 can spread the illness if they are not wearing face masks, even if others are wearing them.",
        "background": "Face masks are a matter of safety, not of choice. Doctors have clarified that wearing a face mask does not affect your breathing. In places where it\u2019s compulsory to wear one, most people pretend to be \u2018exempt\u2019 simply because they don\u2019t want to wear one. I have breathing difficulties and wear one.",

For example if you would like to end exemptions for all but specific medical conditions, you could start a petition calling for that to happen."
