        "action": "Stop the sale and use of fireworks for all animals' welfare",
        "additional_details": "Animals have very sensitive hearing, meaning that loud noises can scare them more easily than it would people. When hearing fireworks most animals cower with fear and go into 'fight or flight' mode which can make them run away into dangerous settings such as the middle of the road. Not only can they be killed from the stress, it can also be because of the dangerous settings they run to. For the sake of their welfare, fireworks need to be banned and the animals will be safe and happy.",
        "background": "The use of fireworks should be banned as many animals every year become stressed and even pass away due to the anxiety caused by using fireworks. This should include banning of firework displays. Even when used responsibly, the volume of the fireworks still cause fear in the animals, wild and pets.",
