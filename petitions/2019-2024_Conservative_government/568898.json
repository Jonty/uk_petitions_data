        "additional_details": "Neonicotinoids have been banned in the U.K. as an EU member since 2018 following studies which showed a link between the use of these products in farming and a decrease in bee reproduction when using these pesticides. Please roll over these protections in order to protect the bee population of the U.K. and avoid setting a precedent for other harmful products to be used in the future.",
        "background": "All products containing neonicotinoids such as thiamethoxam should be banned for use in the U.K. due to their detrimental effect on bees and other pollinators.",
