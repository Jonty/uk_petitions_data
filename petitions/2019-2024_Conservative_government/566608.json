        "additional_details": "We will have had over a year of online and disrupted learning by the time Alevels come around. Some people aren't lucky enough to have the resources to access remote lessons and remote learning which makes these exams unfair as they will be easier for those who had necessary resources. Furthermore, students from Scotland and Wales don't have alevels this year but they are applying to the same universities as us giving them an advantage.",
        "background": "Cancel the alevels this year or at least inform us about what is happening with them so we don't have to constantly worry about what is or is not happening. Some people are worried about going to college because of the pandemic and aren't getting the education they deserve.",
