        "additional_details": "A recent report showed that expanding free school meals would result in substantial benefits to the economy over 20 years, including increased cost savings to schools, increased lifetime earnings and contributions, and savings to the NHS. Expanding free school meals to all would cost \u00a324.2bn and result in \u00a399.5bn benefit to the whole of society and the economy.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is no economic justification for not extending the provision of free school meals. Nor is there a moral excuse.",
        "background": "Chronic hunger is a form of toxic stress. This type of stress is harmful to the brain and mental health.\r\n\r\nHungry children have twice the anxiety of their non-hungry classmates and suffer increased irritability, poorer self-regulation, poorer mental health, and lose an hour of learning every day.",
