        "additional_details": "Apparently this is already under review (since 2018) but we believe should be pushed immediately through. Considering that Covid-19 has meant many couples have had to change plans, \r\nrelaxing the rules would give people the flexibility to get married in places they feel safe, at a lower cost considering the likelihood that only small numbers can be present. It would also provide capacity to cater for the \"backlog\" of weddings in 2021 by opening up more possible venues.",
