        "additional_details": "If this happens then Drops can be made more efficiently. Roads will be clearer and improved traffic flow due to less long trucks taking up large proportions of the tarmac space at junctions. More vehicles will get through traffic light sequences,  less polution due to less idling time. Also safer roads for all including cyclists. It will make cyclists and HGV drivers even more aware of each other just as it has with bus drivers. Boris Johnson confirmed this with his comment on TG 2 years ago.",
        "background": "All bus lanes throughout the UK should also  be able to be used by HGVs. The shelves in shops are becoming emptier due to the driver shortage. If HGV drivers could use Bus Lanes then this would make the job faster, more efficient and better use of drivers limited hours.",
