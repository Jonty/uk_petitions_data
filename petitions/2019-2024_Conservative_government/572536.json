We are aware that the Help To Buy Scheme was extended so that all plots can legally complete before or on 31 March 2021, however further COVID-19 restrictions have made it even more difficult to hit this date. It would be a massive benefit to extend the legal completion date to 31 May 2021, the date that reservations made before 30 June 2020 are able to complete by. Please help families move into their dream homes.",
