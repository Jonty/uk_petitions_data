        "additional_details": "Before anyone judges-My Brother was in a remote part of Cambodia with little communication. As soon as he found out the severity of the situation he booked flights home. He was turned away at the airport due to new regulations made that morning. Let down by the Embassy saying they could not and would not help. \r\n\r\nIt is the duty of our Government to safely bring its Citizens home its no fault of his that the airlines restrictions change hour by hour. SCARED FOR HIS AND HIS COMPANIONS SAFETY",
        "background": "My brother, partner and friends are stranded in Cambodia with hundreds of other UK Citizens. Showing no signs of COVID19. Flights wont accept them without fit to fly - Professionals won't test for fit to fly as they don't have COVID19 symptoms. I want them bought home with all other UK Citizens",
