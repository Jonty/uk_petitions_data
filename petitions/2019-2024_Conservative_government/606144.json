Suitable provisions preserve the safety, dignity and privacy of all children. \r\nThe Department of Education suggest that separate toilet and washing facilities must be provided. \r\nThe School Premises Regulations (2012) also state that separate toilet facilities for boys and girls age 8 years and over should be provided.",
        "background": "Ensure schools provide girls with same sex toilets to enable them privacy when going to the toilet to avoid 'period shaming'.  \r\nChildren are skipping school or holding off from going to the toilet or avoiding drinking, causing damage such as infections.",

It's therefore not clear what additional requirements you want the Government to impose."
