        "action": "Strike down the 'Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts' Act 2021",
        "additional_details": "The act grants authority to break up protests that are 'seriously disruptive', but does not clearly define what this means. All protests are disruptive, that is part of their function, so all are vulnerable, compromising freedom of assembly. The charter ensures public protection from abuse of power on the part of individual police, and institutional barriers such as surveillance. A 38 degrees petition striking down the bill and supporting the charter has over 50,000 signatures.",
        "background": "The bill should not be passed by Parliament. Instead, we demand a 'Charter for Freedom of Assembly Rights' be applied to the National Police Chiefs' Council. The charter forces greater accountability, including an end to civil disobedience as an excuse for protest shut down.",
