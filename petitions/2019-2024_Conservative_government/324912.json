We don't have to neglect achievements by white people, but it is vital that we recognise the progress made by BAME that helped shape our nation.\r\nIt should also be noted that we learnt about the Holocaust or racism in America, but no word on our shady past. Events like the Amritsar massacre are never mentioned, leaving many surprised when our government apologised for past \"mistakes\".",
        "background": "I took history at GCSE, and it was very clear that the majority of the syllabus was white-centric, even when it didn't make sense to be. We learnt about the work of Florence Nightingale, but Mary Seacole was never mentioned. In KS3, we learnt about the Empire, but not the atrocities because of it.",
