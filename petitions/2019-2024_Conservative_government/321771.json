What is the point in applauding our NHS staff and carers every week if we then demand that - out of their meagre salaries, on which they already pay taxes and national insurance - they pay a surcharge to use NHS services?",
        "background": "Immigrant NHS support staff and social care workers are among our low-paid workers, and they are in many cases risking their lives to protect us all from Covid-19. Yet they are being asked to pay a surcharge (which will increase to \u00a3624 in October) to use the NHS themselves.",
