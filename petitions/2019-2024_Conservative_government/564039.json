This is discrimination.\r\n\r\nYoung workers are then taken advantage of because they're simply cheaper labour and it is simply not fair.\r\n\r\nA business advertises a job as it requires help to run a business, in return for the labour and time, young workers require an adequate wage for being able to live and giving over their time of day.\r\n\r\nThere is no valid reason for this divide.
