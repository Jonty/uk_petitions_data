        "additional_details": "Childminder settings will have lower numbers and ratios of children than schools will with just key workers children. Childminders will lose entire household incomes due to closures of safe and hygienic settings that are safer and more protected than schools. Keeping them open will provide care, stability, safeguarding and support for both families and childminders alike and will maintain community links in a safe controlled way.",
        "background": "During uncertain times with Covid-19 schools, nurseries and early years settings have been asked to close except for children of key workers. I feel the UK government should keep childminders settings open in line with Welsh governments.",
