        "additional_details": "We want this for the simple reason of fairness. The government has awarded the 2020 students their teacher assessed grades. This has lead to an increase in grades, potentially being 12% higher than they were in prior years. And due to grades being given later than expected many students have defered until next year, making the competition much greater than in prior years. Also, the education of the 2021 A level students has been severely worsened by COVID-19 as they have missed so much of it.",
        "background": "We would like the government to award the students of 2021 with their teacher assessed A level results just as the students of 2020 have been in the name of fairness.",
