During trials e-scooters will continue to be classed as motor vehicles, meaning requirements to have insurance and the correct type of driving licence will continue to apply. You can find out more about these trials here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/e-scooter-trials-guidance-for-local-areas-and-rental-operators/e-scooter-trials-guidance-for-local-areas-and-rental-operators\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling on the Government to make it illegal to sell e-scooters to people aged under 18, if that is what you want to happen."
