        "additional_details": "It is clear that the UK did not handle the COVID 19 pandemic as well as it might have done. It is also clear that we will not be free of COVID for some time to come. It's therefore essential that we learn from the current experience in order to put in place better contingency arrangements to deal with a new surge in coronavirus infections or with any other similar pandemic in the future. It is essential that this should be done as soon as possible and should not be delayed for political reasons.",
