        "additional_details": "The World Food Programme describes the situation in Afghanistan as \u201cthe worst humanitarian crisis on earth\u201d. At least a million children under five are at risk of dying of malnutrition. 95% of people don\u2019t have enough to eat.\r\n\r\n80% of Afghanistan\u2019s budget comes from external aid. Most of this was suspended following the change in government and financial assets (~$10bn) were frozen causing economic collapse. Afghanistan is also suffering from the worst drought for 27 years.\r\n\r\nThe withholding of foreign aid is a form of collective punishment on the people of Afghanistan. Starving an entire country and destroying its economy is not going to get rid of the Taliban.",

Sign this petition to demand the UK government pay its part of the $4.4 billion the UN is requesting to help save Afghanistan and use its international position to encourage other countries to do the same.",
