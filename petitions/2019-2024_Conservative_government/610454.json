        "additional_details": "The District Heating industry is not currently regulated by a governing body, for example, OFgem. Due to this its customers who are reliant on a District Heating network to heat their homes are being unfairly treated by way of having to pay unit prices for gas which are not controlled by an industry regulator. Customers have no opportunity to switch heating suppliers and have a very limited right to redress, should the service a supplier fail to meet expectations. This needs to be addressed.",
        "background": "I wish for the government to raise this issue in parliament, the District Heating industry should become regulated by a governing body, currently this isn't the case.",
