        "additional_details": "The students need structure so they can plan their approach to whatever form of assessment will happen. Whether it's teacher assessment/coursework/internal assessments, or a reduction in the curriculum. But schools need time to make sure they can implement changes & support students. Putting a plan in action now is essential.  Many schools follow a 3 year GCSE plan starting in Y9.  In 2020 Y9s lost 50% of in-school education due to lockdown.  This year it's not looking much better.",
        "background": "Whilst attention has been on sorting this year's cohort of GCSE, A level & BTEC exam students, the Government has failed to consider those in Years 10 & 12 who are falling behind in their preparatory studies for 2022 due to the pandemic. This is creating huge anxiety and needs urgent intervention.",
