        "action": "Give citizenship to Hong Kongers and protect Hong Kong from Chinese aggression.",
        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom owes a duty of care to all Hong Kong citizens from when it transferred sovereignty over the island back to China in 1997. When this occurred the government made an oath to continue to protect the people of Hong Kong. Parliament therefore must live up to the oath it\u2019s predecessors made to ensure that the people of Hong Kong can continue their free and meritocratic way of life, safe from the oppressive and undemocratic regime  that controls the rest of China.",
        "background": "Parliament must in the face of illegal action from China grant full citizenship to the people of Hong Kong, not simply provide a temporary refuge for them. Furthermore Parliament must commit itself to ensuring that The Basic Law is upheld and that Hong Kong\u2019s laws and way of life remain unchanged.",
