        "additional_details": "This would be a progressive step forward in the way Parliament works. It would demonstrate that the House of Lords is open to people of all ages. It would also show that we are willing to accept a perspective from someone who is younger and has different experiences to those of the current members. This would be an excellent way to provide a platform for a younger person to express their opinions. Furthermore, it would provide a voice to those who cannot access the same opportunities as current members.\r\n \r\nThe Government should seek to amend the rules on the age of members of the House of Lords, so that people under the age of 21 can be peers, and nominate someone under the age of 20 to be appointed to the House of Lords.\r\n",
        "background": "We feel it necessary that there is a peer who is under the age of 20 so that they can represent youth in the House of Lords. Currently the youngest member of the House of Lords is only 29. This isn't inclusive of the population and therefore requires attention.",
