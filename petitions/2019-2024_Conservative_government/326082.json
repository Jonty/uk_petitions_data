        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition to make 'The Black Curriculum' mandatory.  Give children a chance to make informed choices, to change institutional racism and bias from within, from the very beginning. Teach them to be angry about the past so the apathy doesn't continue.  Teach them to think and feel differently to the way we were and are taught.  Teach them to be better humans than we are right now.  \r\nwww.theblackcurriculum.com is a free resource, you could start using this right now.",
        "background": "Black History is not mandatory teaching in UK schools. Black History is British History. It should not be sidelined to a month. We cannot hope to affect change unless our children are taught, from Primary School age, about history, culture, heritage and suffering.",
