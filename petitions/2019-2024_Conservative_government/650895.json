People do not use these responsibly and these should be removed from public sale and if people decide to ignore then high penalties put in place. This has to stop. Innocent animals are being scared to death. Being injured so badly they have no choice than to put to sleep. These need to be banned immediately from public sale and penalties in place.",
        "background": "More and more people are buying fireworks and not using them responsibly. The public use of fireworks should be banned. These should only be available for large organised events with a licence. There should also be high penalties in place for people who ignore this. Stop fireworks for public use!",
