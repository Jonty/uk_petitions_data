Many parents face difficulty with the fees of mandatory hotel quarantine.\r\n \r\nMany parents are facing difficulty paying for hotel quarantine, and many hotels are already full and booked. This has caused even more of a financial burden to parents. The guidelines put in the place to help those with financial difficulty are not good enough. Think about the parents with children who have missed out on their education because of the price of hotel quarantine. Under 18s should be exempted from this and be allowed to quarantine at home, to reduce financial difficulty.",
