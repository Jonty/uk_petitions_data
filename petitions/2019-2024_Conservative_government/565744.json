        "action": "Implement the same laws for hunting hound packs as domestic dogs",
        "additional_details": "It is well documented that hunting packs allow the hounds to run amok, uncontrolled and often causing great distress and making mental stress a huge issue for those landowners that do not allow hunting on their land. There have been many instances where hounds have jumped closed gates, over fences and in one case even entered a protected species rehabilitation centre causing unrivalled stress to the animals there due to the hunt masters inability to control hound packs. This terrorises homeowners, pets, animals and damages land beyond comprehension .... this must stop",
        "background": "It is a common occurrence that hunting packs allow their hounds to run free and uncontrolled. We would like to see the same laws in place for hunting dog packs as domestic dogs therefore making it illegal to run these hounds if not under proper and safe control over any land",
