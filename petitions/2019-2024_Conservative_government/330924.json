        "additional_details": "The event industry was one of the first affected by Covid-19, and is unlikely to return to work until 2021. Businesses have had no income since March, and the furlough and self-employed schemes are ending long before events will be allowed to resume, making wide-spread redundancies and unemployment inevitable. Additional support is urgently needed in the form of: \r\n\u2022 Grants for businesses in the event supply chain \r\n\u2022 Extension of the Job Retention and Self-employed Schemes until events can resume",
        "background": "Whilst we welcome the \u00a31.57bn rescue package for theatres and music venues, the bailout won't reach the thousands of businesses and individuals who work in the events supply-chain, including suppliers, freelancers and manufacturers who urgently need the support.",
