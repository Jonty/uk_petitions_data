        "additional_details": "This Law would save a great deal of lives, it would help with mental health also as men feel like they cannot come forward as its not manly enough. Already there is a Law for woman called Clare\u2019s Law and nothing for a man which personally i think there should be. Through many conversations with different men they all said it would be a good idea to have a Law for men to know about there partners pasts and convictions. Being a Student Nurse i see men who are too scared to come forward about their partners and this would really help. I want to make a difference to as many lives as i can and stand up for the men that are to scared to speak, i want to be there voice. Personally through experience there has always been a stigma which leads to woman being favoured",
