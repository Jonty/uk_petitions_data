Urgent care is overrun as it\u2019s in the main hospital here William Harvey. New builds are popping\r\nUp all over the borough which will require more strain on the nhs here. With more GP surgeries here and maybe an additional arm\r\nTo help a&e and urgent care like a separate health centre which could aid and lessen the massive strain Ashford nhs is under.",
