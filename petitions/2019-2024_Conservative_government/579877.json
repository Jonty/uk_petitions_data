        "additional_details": "97% of women have experienced sexual harassment (The Guardian). 58% of people have witnessed sexual harassment at work (Musician\u2019s Union). Especially for freelance workers, which are a huge portion of creative workers, there is hardly any legal support to report or be protected from sexual harassment. The audience and workers in creative spaces need more protection including a physical place to go, mandatory training on employment, and an efficient, legally enforced, reporting service.",
        "background": "Evaluate current laws; make mandatory training and create physical and digital safe spaces for freelance workers, contracted employers and audience members to report and be protected from sexual harassment and abuse in creative spaces including festivals, venues, studios, offices, and classrooms.",
