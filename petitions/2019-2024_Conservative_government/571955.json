        "additional_details": "Unless the directive is changed, the water companies won't be measured against a suitable standard to protect human health when in the water. Without these raised standards changes will be unfunded and voluntary and won't happen. The directive would force higher standards. Water companies would have to calculate the cost of, and charge for, maintaining those standards, benefitting people all round the country and coastline. The environment agency should be monitoring the new standards all year.",
        "background": "The bathing water directive was written in 1976 and does not reflect current use of Britain's beaches and waterways. Sampling only happens May-Sept, but people are in the water all year. The standards are environmental standards, not human health standards leading to increased risk of sickness.",
