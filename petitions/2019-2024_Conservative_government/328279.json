        "additional_details": "With regards to recent events with COVID-19 and riots in some cities, the way the BBC has handled this has been disgraceful and for this reason the BBC should be defunded and the TV license should be abolished. A lot of false information has been reported by the BBC in recent events and it\u2019s a joke that the public are expected to pay for this. It\u2019s very expensive (\u00a3160 a year) and they still advertise. For these reasons the BBC should charge to use there app instead of the TV license.",
        "background": "I think it\u2019s time for the government to scrape the TV license. People should have a choice and this is not being given. Instead what should happen is the BBC should charge for their app instead like Netflix, Disney, Amazon prime etc. This way people have a choice.",
