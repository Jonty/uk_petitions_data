        "additional_details": "As London is the epicentre of COVID-19 in the UK at present, it is not acceptable for some 250,000 people per day to still be using the tube. Trains and platforms are often overcrowded, making observation of social distancing rules impossible, and the entire system thus serves as an incubator for the disease. Alternative arrangements should be offered for key workers, such as NHS staff. London's black taxi drivers could usefully assist with this, as many are currently unable to work.",
