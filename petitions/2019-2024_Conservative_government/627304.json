        "action": "Ban the public sale of fireworks and restrict only to organised events",
        "additional_details": "The effect the Firework noises have on our pets, wildlife and people suffering with PTSD is massive, sometimes deadly. Its heartbreakng watching the suffering these noises cause, knowing there is nothing that can be done to stop it.\r\nLimiting purchasing to organised events would restrict the amount of nights these noises can go off, allowing everyone to prepare more on just 1 or 2 nights, rather than the random nights/days they are currently set off over several weeks. Prolonging stress levels.",
        "background": "I propose Fireworks be limited to be bought by organised events and banned from public general sale. \r\nThe effect they have on humans and animals regularly increases stress levels and can often be deadly. The use of Fireworks against police on Halloween also could have been so much worse.",
