We GCSE students think is wrong because postcodes don't define and hard work does. We students don't want grades 8's or 9's, we just want grades that define our hardwork since Yr 10.",
        "background": "Results day should be delayed because we GCSE students think is unfair because schools in Westminster have achieved higher grades than school in deprived area. We want you to use CAG or predicted grades not postcodes. Rich and poor doesn't defines anything but hard work does.",
