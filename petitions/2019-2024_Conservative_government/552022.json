This will not change after 31 December.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition asking the UK Government to withdraw from international treaties that give people the right to seek asylum in the UK, if that's what you'd like to happen.\r\n\r\nLocal arrangements for housing are a matter for councils, not the UK Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou could raise your issue with a local councillor who represents you. You can use this page to find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors"
