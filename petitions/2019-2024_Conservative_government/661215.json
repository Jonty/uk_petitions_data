        "additional_details": "I envision the government or parliament reallocating resources from war tax towards initiatives that promote peace, diplomacy, and humanitarian efforts. By investing in conflict prevention, education, healthcare, and sustainable development, we can create a world where the need for war becomes obsolete. Abolishing war tax could symbolise a commitment to building a more peaceful and prosperous future for all. Those who advocate for war should shoulder the financial burden.",
        "background": "It's important for leaders to be accountable for their decisions, including those related to military action. If advocating for war, they should be willing to share the burdens of conflict.",
