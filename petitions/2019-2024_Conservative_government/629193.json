        "additional_details": "Major things that affected me and others whilst inpatient: \r\n1) Improper training staff had when handling difficult situations.\r\n2) Not enough staff or facilities like psychiatric wards for under 18s.\r\n3) Some wards couldn't afford crucial equipment to keep patients safe like cameras.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I had paragraphs explaining each point in detail but it doest fit here! Feel free to contact me for more questions.",

Psych wards are meant to be a safe place for high-risk patients that cant keep themselves safe, however, inpatient suicides are on the rise due to improper training and understaffing.",
