        "action": "Allow healthcare workers' dependents in the UK switch to a healthcare work visa",
        "additional_details": "Rejecting dependents of primary candidates who want to move to a healthcare work visa in the UK runs the danger of undermining hiring, aggravating the labor shortages, and sending a message of unfairness and unequal treatment. Healthcare workers are essential and should have equal rights. Support from family is essential for good performance, adequate discharge of duties, effectiveness and well-being. Concerns about discrimination surface, which could harm the profession's reputation. Current employees' mental health may be impacted by their worry of renewal uncertainties. We implore the government to change this decision, prioritize and uphold family unity treating everyone equally and acknowledge the crucial role healthcare workers play in society.",
        "background": "We would like to voice our concerns over the recent decision to prevent care workers who are currently in the UK on a post-study work visa from moving to a care work visa in the UK with their partners and children along, and we are calling for this decision to be reconsidered.",
