        "additional_details": "Women during the pandemic are more likely to have lost jobs, quit since the first lockdown or furloughed. The Fawcett Society found 35% of working mothers have lost work & hours due to childcare support. 78% of employees in health & social work & 71% education are women. Women have to make the decision if they can afford to return to work with childcare costs vs if they want to return. Returning to work, allows for mother/fathers to also increase their mental health by connecting with others.",
        "background": "For childcare costs and child support to remain at the full entitlement amount, UK citizens using UC, are in low income jobs. These deductions are pushing citizens into poverty and debt. This would also support mothers returning to work instead of making the decision if they can afford to go back.",
