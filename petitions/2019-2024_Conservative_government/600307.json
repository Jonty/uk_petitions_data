        "additional_details": "British Sign Language is used by over 150,000 people in the UK and for many of them it is their first language due to hearing or speech impairments. Over 20,000 children use BSL as their first language but upon starting school are unable to or have difficulties in communicating with other children of the same age due to very few people knowing BSL. The limited number of people who know BSL creates a split within society and users often find themselves excluded from society but this can change.",
        "background": "Introduce British Sign Language into the national curriculum, potentially in place of a Modern Foreign Language,for primary and secondary schools. \r\nBeing a hearing student but having learnt BSL, I have been able to run a BSL club within school to allow other to learn the vital skill.",
