        "additional_details": "We believe that The North is an economically, culturally and historically distinct nation. \r\n\r\nNortherners are not 'English' \u2013 they are Northumbrian. For much of this island's history, Northumbria was a historically independent nation with a unique system of government and set of traditions. \r\n\r\nCOVID-19 has revealed that the North-South divide is built into the very fabric of the \"United Kingdom.\"  There is only one solution: a North-South border. \r\n\r\nWe demand freedom for the North.",
        "background": "We believe that the UK Parliament should hold a referendum on an Independent Northern England. \r\n\r\nAll those North of the Humber and South of Scotland have a fundamental right to autonomy from Westminster and Self-Rule. A 'yes' vote will lead to the establishment of a sovereign Northern Republic.",
