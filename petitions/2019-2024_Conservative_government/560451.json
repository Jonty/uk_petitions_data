        "additional_details": "Most people across the UK are struggling and the waiting list for counselling is 2-3 years. 11 students have killed themselves since the start of the year. More people killed themselves in September than people dying of COVID. There is a mental health pandemic within the COVID-19 pandemic. If the government can afford \u00a33000 pay rises and subsidised meals they can afford to put money into our mental health services.",
        "background": "Put additional funding into mental health services (mainly counselling services) for adults and CAMHS. The waiting lists for counselling are too long and unless someone attempts suicide their mental health is disregarded. This needs to be recognised as a pandemic in itself as well as Covid-19.",
