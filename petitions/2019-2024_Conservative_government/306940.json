        "additional_details": "It is now estimated that 4.8 million people in the UK are self-employed. This means the number of self-employed workers now accounts for around 15% of the working population.\r\n\r\nThe chancellor has decided that employees who cannot work will receive 80% of their salary, up to \u00a32.5k/month, however, the self-employed are offered \u00a394 a week. This will completely destroy the businesses some of us have put our blood sweat and tears into and will have a devastating ripple effect on our families and lives.",
        "background": "We the self-employed, want to be considered and supported just as those who are PAYE have been. \r\n\r\nThere is no reason why we should be left behind as if we are not just as vulnerable if not more so than those who are employed. We pay taxes just like everyone else and as much we deserve a fair deal.",
