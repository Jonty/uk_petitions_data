        "additional_details": "The government have the power to reduce the tuition fees of universities across the whole of the UK simultaneously to make university accessible to teenagers and adults from all different backgrounds. Everyone should get an equal chance to further their education as far as they would like to go, without the worry of not being able to afford it. COVID-19 has also affected the quality of teaching at universities yet the tuition fees have remained the same as other years.",
        "background": "\u00a39,250 per year is a lot to pay for further education. Tuition fees are overpriced and leave students with crippling debts from student loans and those who must pay from their own pockets suffer considerably. Universities used to run efficiently on tuition fees of \u00a33000 in the past.",
