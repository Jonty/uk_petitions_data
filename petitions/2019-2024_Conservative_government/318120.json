        "additional_details": "This issue is more apparent as all of the UK is on lockdown due to having a pandemic of Covid -19.Coercive and mental abuse does not leave physical scars and bruises, therefore as the police cannot visually see evidence of abuse, the police are unable to provide protection for a victim and provide justice as they would for physical violence offences.",
        "background": "Currently, the police have the power to arrest a suspect of physical domestic violence where physical injuries are apparent, irrespective of whether the victim wants to press charges or not. However, mental and coercive behaviours can impact a victim just as much if not more.",
