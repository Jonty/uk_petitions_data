Vehicles now have much better braking systems etc from when this law was made up!! \r\nAlso The fact of the matter is when I phoned the police to challenge my speeding ticket even they agreed with me that the law should be changed \r\nI even had proof from FORD that my van was a MPV it still didn\u2019t matter because of this stupid prehistoric law",
        "background": "I don\u2019t understand why some vans because they have a rear window can do an extra 10mph \r\nFor instance a transit panel van is restricted to 50mph but a transit Toreno with the EXACTLY the same running gear and braking system can do 60mph just because it has a rear window!!!",
