        "action": "Keep the schools closed until September.",
        "additional_details": "I think that reopening the schools will be careless because at the moment students receive the same amount of work as they would in schools and they are able to get more help from the teacher that can focus on students separately. Opening the schools would put a lot of the student at risk and the workers as well, not only the workers of the schools. This is because the overall public movement would increase, what I mean is that there would be more people in public and using public transport which can increase the risk of spreading the virus.",
        "background": "As a concerned parent, who values the health of my child I would like for the school to stay closed during this awful pandemic crisis. This is because I think that reopening schools might put at danger not only the students but the workers that will have to come in and the general public.",
