        "additional_details": "The battles the NHS fights on the country\u2019s behalf will continue long after the COVID-19 war has been won. The service will continue its fight against every conceivable illness, disease and injury, just as it did before taking up arms against its current enemy. During the UK\u2019s lockdown, the nation\u2019s applause every Thursday evening has provided NHS staff with an immense boost through dark times, which is particularly powerful given the lack of morale the service has suffered from in recent years.",
        "background": "This petition calls for the formal creation and recognition of an annual \u2018NHS Appreciation Day,\u2019 so that when COVID-19 has passed, the nation can stand on its doorstep, shout its appreciation into the sky, and send the NHS that powerful, uplifting and globally recognised love all over again.",
