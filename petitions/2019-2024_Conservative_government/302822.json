        "action": "Make testing for COVID19 available to everyone, not just those hospitalised.",
        "additional_details": "The Gov's plan to flatten the infection rate curve over time relies on public co-operation and trust. We are told symptoms are mostly mild. Without freely available testing, people may be unsure if they have had the virus or not, and whether they are now immune. Once immune, people can revert to caring for those most vulnerable. Whilst immunity is not fully guaranteed, the alternative is public fatigue with self-isolation and further mistrust in the Gov's approach.",
        "background": "The Gov. should make the test for COVID19 freely and publically available throughout the UK for everyone, with the result within a maximum of 24hrs. Testing people within the community (not just in hospital) will enable those who have had the virus and are now immune to assist those who are not.",
