It is all to clear to the general public that the Ukrainian people are being subject to the horrors of an urban ground war. Those fleeing this conflict should be offered shelter because it is the humane and civil thing to do. Ukraine's neighbours have already opened their doors and will take in the majority of people. We should assist those countries by lightning their burden and welcoming as many people as we can.",
        "background": "Many countries have waived visa restrictions for Ukrainians in a humanitarian effort to offer shelter to those fleeing conflict. The UK government should do the same so as to provide shelter for as many refugees as possible and to help relive the burden on Ukraine's neighbours.",
