        "additional_details": "I want police horses being used on the front line to be abolished. No matter what training they have been subject to they remain frightened and are often injured and they have no choice in the matter. It is barbaric and it seems that we have not moved on from the days of taking horses into war. It is the same thing when faced with rioting mobs wielding knives, guns and other weapons and in the 21st century surely this is totally unacceptable.",
        "background": "Take police horses off the front line in potential riot situations.  These are innocent animals and should not be subjected to riot situations no matter what training is provided. When bricks, flares and knives are used to injure animals it becomes totally unacceptable.",
