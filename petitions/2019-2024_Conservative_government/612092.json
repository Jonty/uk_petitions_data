        "additional_details": "How are pensioners expected to live on a figure that is less than half of the weekly miniumum wage?\r\n\r\nThe triple lock was an effort to raise the pension to compete on the international stage. Our pension was one of, if not the lowest in Europe.  \r\n\r\nWith one stroke of the pen Rishi Sunak took pensioners back years.  \r\n\r\nThe Tories will never again receive my vote until this is looked at and adjusted.  \r\n\r\nThey say the silver vote is influential.  Please sign this petition if you agree.",
        "background": "Today Rishi Sunak delivered the mini-statement.  Pensioners were not even worthy of a mention. The triple lock was axed by this government and instead of the 8+% we should have received, this was replaced by a 3.1 percent increase. Current inflation rate is 6+%  and expected to reach double figures.",
