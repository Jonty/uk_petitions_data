        "additional_details": "I want this to happen for many reasons: most people regret it as they get older and can't reverse it, it's mentally damaging for people to see on social media as they may want to look like that, it's risky surgery that isn't necessity or saving someone's life, it is far too easy to go and get cosmetic surgery without any form of mental support in order to conquer these thoughts, and it's very expensive so people could be wasting their money and going into debt just to change their appearance!",
        "background": "I want all cosmetic and plastic surgery such as lip fillers, breast implants, buttocks implants, facelifts, botox etc..., illegal in the UK. I believe that instead of having the surgery, they should be given help to get to the root of why they want it and help them feel comfortable with themselves.",
