        "additional_details": "So people can still go into school/university and mix with their class mates, however they can\u2019t take their driving test with appropriate PPE and extra cleaning precautions in place... They also have to get on public transport and mix with MORE people as a result. In July the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has commented earlier that Driving lessons and tests are vital in helping people get to work and visit loved ones, and provide the skills for a lifetime of safe driving.",
