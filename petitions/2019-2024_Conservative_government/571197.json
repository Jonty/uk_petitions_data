        "additional_details": "Goole has a population of almost 20,000 people and to leave our town with no college to give young adults a solid education to build upon, in order to line pockets in other areas is greedy and abysmal. For too long Goole has fallen behind its partner site at Hull - people\u2019s livelihoods and education depend on saving Goole College. Simply offering to relocate students to Hull calls into question serious concerns around safeguarding and the maintenance of routine for vulnerable young people.",
