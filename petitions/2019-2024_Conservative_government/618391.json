        "additional_details": "We believe 2 or 3 exams at the end of a 2 year course is not a fair assessment of a pupil\u2019s understanding or knowledge of a subject, and places too much focus on memory.\r\n \r\nWe are all aware of the increase in mental health issues in our children over the past few years. In addition, we believe the current system is particularly unsuitable for neurodiverse children, many of whom will struggle with anxiety around exams and be limited in being able to fulfil their potential. We need to move to a fairer system for all.",
        "background": "As a parent of a Year 13 student I would like the Government to re-evaluate the current structure for A levels. I believe the Government need to overhaul the A level grading process and introduce a greater focus on coursework and gradual assessments and reduce focus on final exams.",
