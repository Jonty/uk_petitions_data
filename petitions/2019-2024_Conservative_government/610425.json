This wealth is immense, it is a windfall for us as a nation and would clean up our country if taken from these oligarchs, but more importantly, it could be used against Russia in this unprovoked invasion they have now engaged in.",
        "background": "We demand that the British parliament take immediate action to seize all property and assets owned by Russian oligarchs linked to Putin, without exemption. Liquify these assets as best possible and use them to support Ukrainian military efforts, humanitarian aid, and Ukrainian refugees.",
