        "action": "Hold an Emergency Referendum on Rejoining the European Union.",
        "additional_details": "The UK decided to join the EEC / EU 47 years ago, over serious concerns regarding food security and the desire for continued peace in Europe. With the UK government threatening our friends and allies with gunboats in the English channel, and 'just in time' food deliveries severely curtailed and disrupted, the UK's peace and overall security is, clearly, seriously under threat. In the midst of a global pandemic, the reasons the UK joined the EU are even more prevalent in 2020.",
        "background": "Hold a referendum to seek public opinion on applying to rejoin the European Union; before the end of the transition period. The promises made to persuade UK citizens to vote to leave the EU have NOT been honoured. It is therefore imperative to seek clarification on 'the will of the people'.",
