If the meeting in question was indeed for the purpose of tackling the Covid-19 emergency situation, as is claimed, the public have a right to be informed and the Government have an obligation to provide details of anything discussed in this context.

The full minutes for the meeting itself, in the best case, must be made a matter of public record, as well as fully transparent details of all legislative consequences.",
