        "additional_details": "Mental Health (MH) conditions are more common and longer lasting than physical illnesses (which also impact on a persons MH). We have guide dogs for people with physical disabilities. Legally recognising and developing a policy and programme to train emotional support dogs can only help to improve and mitigate against detrimental effects to someone's MH & Wellbeing. Animals have been proven to help with a person's overall wellbeing. It is about time we were given the same rights.",
        "background": "Change the Equality Act 2010 to legally recognise emotional support dogs as assistance dogs. Equalities office say \"there's no intention to change this for animals to be trained & legally recognised for people with Mental Health (MH) conditions\". Thus discriminating people living with MH illnesses.",
