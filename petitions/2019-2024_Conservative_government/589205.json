We advocate zero tolerance for assaults on social workers but it does beg the question: what might some social workers be doing to provoke such attacks from those they serve. There're indications that whistleblowing is unpopular, recourse for aggrieved persons inaccessible or hopeless. IPPs will ensure free, fair process devoid of fear of retribution, shame, stigma or public embarrassment.",
