        "action": "Amend domestic abuse laws to protect people from being forced into a career",
        "additional_details": "When I was a student and junior doctor I saw several people suffer from serious mental health issues because they didn't want to be on the course. Their families forced them either for financial or societal reasons or to gain a higher price dowry in a forced marriage. Sadly it is a reality for too many, but this practice is not illegal and needs to be made a criminal offense.",
        "background": "Domestic abuse legislation needs to be amended to include \"forced careers\". In some communities, children are forced to enter particular careers, e.g medicine, dentistry, law, accountancy or engineering against their will. This can have significant adverse affects on welfare and mental health.",
