        "additional_details": "Make the bedside TV\u2019s across hospital wards free to watch by those in NHS care. It isn\u2019t right that people are lay there looking into space, alone. People need some form of escape from this awful virus. Some people don\u2019t have family that can top up their TV and even if they did, we are not allowed near the wards to top them up. It\u2019s not morally right to leave people sat in silence when they could simply switch on a TV and help pass the time of their recovery.",
        "background": "People are in hospitals recovering from this awful virus and the basic necessities aren\u2019t there! The poor people are lay staring into space whilst attempting to recover. It\u2019s absolutely appalling that something so simple as a few tv channels are not watchable for those in NHS care.",
