        "additional_details": "Students often find it necessary to supplement their student loan with income from part time jobs, in lieu of or in addition to a parental contribution. Many are employed in the retail/hospitality industries, which are amongst those most badly affected by the social distancing and self-isolation necessary due the recent COVID-19 pandemic. With many of these students using their loan entirely to fund rent, they rely solely on part-time income for food, hygiene products and bill payments.",
        "background": "The Government should do their best to support students through the COVID-19 pandemic. They should allow students to claim UC, or create an equivalent fund to support students who are struggling to support themselves in this difficult time, who are unable to claim ordinary benefits whilst studying.",
