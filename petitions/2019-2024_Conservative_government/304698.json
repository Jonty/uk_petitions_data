        "additional_details": "Teachers should be allowed to give their students grades which reflect their work ethic and potential as stress related to COVID19 and the uncertainty it presents for many students. This will allow students to gain access into university and colleges which require conditional offers. This will ensure that the academic world can function post COVID19 come September 2020 whilst having the mental health of teenagers at the heart of this pandemic rather than league tables and examinations.",

Predicted grades which the school give should be given in replace of examinations with the expectation of the courses been completed and clear evidence of work quality at that grade.",
