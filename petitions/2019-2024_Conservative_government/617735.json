We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nWe understand you're concerned about the issues that occurred at the Champions' League final last month, but we're not sure what action you'd like the Government or Parliament to take in response. The Government is not responsible for reviewing the operational handling of policing and security at events that take place outside the UK.\r\n\r\nOn Monday 6 June, MPs debated the significant problems that arose at the Champions League final. This included questioning a Government Minister, Nigel Huddleston MP, about the Government's response to the issues that occurred.\r\n\r\nRead the transcript of that debate: https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-06-06/debates/C5897318-57BC-48EE-ACD2-CC4DEB5E195F/ChampionsLeagueFinalParis\r\n\r\nWatch the debate back: https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/2c2ecba4-39cc-4aa1-95a4-25a381d35830?in=15:50:34"
