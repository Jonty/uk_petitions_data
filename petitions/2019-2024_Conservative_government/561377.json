        "additional_details": "For a long time now people who abuse and neglect animals have been given very light sentences and fines . Animals have the right to be loved and cared for properly thats what they truely deserve every day . The judgements given in courts are far to lenient for the crime people have committed against animal . This growing problem of animal abuse and cruelty seriously needs addressing and sentences given more strongly for the crime . A minimum sentence of 2 year to maximum of 5 years with no release until the FULL sentence has been served . Stop this abuse and cruelty to animals NOW and save their lives . Animals need to live a quality life they deserve",
