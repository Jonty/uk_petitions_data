        "additional_details": "We, as students taking IGCSE exams in the UK, would appreciate it if they were cancelled just like the GCSE exams, because of the simple reason that students taking any type of exam regardless have had the exact same journey of such trials and tribulations throughout the past year. It would only be fair if both were cancelled following the government\u2019s choice of just GCSEs, as, again, doing the IGCSE exams does not mean we would\u2019ve had any better environment to foster these grades, remembering we are all plagued with the same pandemic.",
        "background": "To cancel the IGCSE exams for students originally sitting it in the United Kingdom due to the inconsistency between the gap of GCSE exam and IGCSE exam students, to make it a fair playing ground this year.",
