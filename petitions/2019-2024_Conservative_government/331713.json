        "additional_details": "It is fundamental to our freedom as human beings to decide for ourselves how we dress, medicate, eat, move, sleep, speak...exist. The recent rulings which make wearing face masks mandatory trespass on this freedom. The face mask is for some people an emblem of caution, protection and kindness. For others it is an emblem or fear, alienation and weakness. To me it bears striking resemblance to a gag. Whatever your view, the choice of whether to wear one or not, should be your own.",
        "background": "Reverse the decision to make face masks mandatory on public transport and inside shops. Abstain from any similar legislation. Wearing face masks should be voluntary, not mandatory, like all personal health decisions.",
