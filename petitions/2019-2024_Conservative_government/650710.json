Dogs are family and most these dogs and owner have done nothing wrong. Human rights dictates that people have a right to a life without discrimination. Owners are being discriminated for owning a dog that looks a certain way and has done nothing wrong that is their family. No one should be forced to destroy them or lose their home or children.",

I would like to see the government ensure that current owner rights are not violated with the ban and that they have no repercussions like this after exemption",
