        "additional_details": "In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been announced that all A-Level and GCSE exams are cancelled. A similar approach should be taken towards university exams instead of students taking online assessments. Online assessments fail to recognise less privileged students and assumes everyone has a stable home and access to reliable technology. It also fails to recognise that currently most students mental health have been negatively impacted during this stressful time for us all.",
        "background": "The government should allow all university students to progress into the next year of their degree without taking online assessments as they will not be an accurate reflection of any students competence. A 2:1 or first should be awarded.",
