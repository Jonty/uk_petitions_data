Many EV owners with home charging start with at least this range.\r\n\r\nThe current guidance for the RCF needs to be changed. It is currently very unambitious.\r\n\r\nAlso, consider the following suggestions. \r\n\r\nCharging stations should have \u201csmart\u201d chargers that can share unused capacity between chargers\r\n\r\nCharging stations should use batteries.  \r\nNational Grid should contribute towards the cost of this.",
