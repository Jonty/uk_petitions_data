Added to Covid and Brexit, these people cannot afford to bear the brunt of this extra tax. This is a disgraceful given the huge pay increases the MPs have been receiving in recent years.",
        "background": "This goes against a pledge Boris Johnson made in the 2019 election, meaning there is no democratic mandate for the increase. Instead the government should tax large corporations like Amazon that currently don\u2019t pay anything.",
