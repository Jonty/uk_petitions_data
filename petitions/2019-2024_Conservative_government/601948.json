        "action": "Stop the Government revoking the British citizenship from British subjects",
        "additional_details": "This bill as is against all morals of this country, it goes against everything the democracy stands for as this is a subtle example of ethnic minority segregation, and racism against people of non British ethnic backgrounds because you are revoking someone of their rights as a British citizen because of their ethnicity. We, as a democratic society need to make a change and not allow the British government to remove British citizenship of an individual without their awareness in advance.",
        "background": "Clause 9 of the bill -  \u201cNotice of decision to deprive a person of citizenship\u201d, now exempts the Government from giving notice to an individual if they deem you are a national security threat. With this bill, the government can deem you a threat and revoke your citizenship without your knowledge.",
