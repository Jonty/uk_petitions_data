        "additional_details": "I am 64 and asthmatic. I have just been vaccinated but my 63 year old sister, my daughter and niece all have reasonably well controlled asthma but can (and have) become very unwell when exposed to viruses and other infections. Until a few days ago, they had been expecting to be vaccinated very soon. Now, a decision has been made to move them to the back of the queue with anyone else who has no underlying health conditions. This should not be accepted to me or the Government.",
        "background": "Moderate well controlled asthma has been demoted out of group 6 in the covid-19 vaccination programme. As an asthmatic, I can confirm that well controlled asthma can very quickly become severe when exposed to illness, even a simple cold can result in a respiratory infection and other complications.",
