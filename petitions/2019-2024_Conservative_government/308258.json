        "additional_details": "Due to the Coronavirus breakout, university students (like myself) are missing out getting the full experience. We have to do lectures at home and we don\u2019t have any exams/coursework (Year 1 students). I believe this will impact mtself and other students negatively as we are not able to interact properly and learn as much as we would within actual face-to-face lectures. The outbreak has is truly awful but I believe paying \u00a39,250 for a few months of face-to-face lectures is honestly unfair.",
        "background": "I believe current university students should have a discount on our tuition fee for the 2020 academic year. Due to the Covid 19 outbreak we are unable to go to face-to-face lectures. This will impact our learning negatively and I believe paying \u00a39,250 for a few months of proper studying is unfair.",
