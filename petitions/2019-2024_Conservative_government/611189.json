Decisions about whether to use these rates or use different rates are a matter for individual employers, not the UK Government or Parliament. If employers reimburse employees at a higher rate than the Government's approved Mileage Allowance Payments, they have to report this to HMRC.\r\n\r\nFind out more about Mileage Allowance Payments here: https://www.gov.uk/expenses-and-benefits-business-travel-mileage/rules-for-tax\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nIncrease the HMRC Mileage Rate from 45p/mile to 60p/mile: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/600966\r\n\r\nIncrease the tax-free approved Mileage Allowance Payment rate and review yearly: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/601286"
