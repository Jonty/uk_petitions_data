We have had the best times of our life in the best place in the world. \r\nDeeply upset after watching Simon Reeves\u2019 documentary, the only positive was the Cornish population coming together. Yet, the Government seem to be ignoring the worsening plight. \r\nCornwall needs immediate action from the Government.",

The approximate \u00a315billion should be shared amongst councils, with a policy on how it is wisely spent for those permanently resided, charities, work infrastructure, fisheries, farmers, homeless, housing, etc\u2014all with transparency.",
