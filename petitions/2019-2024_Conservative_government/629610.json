At COP26, the government was warned by representatives of developing countries that the mine would not be welcome, complaining \"the UK's rhetoric loses credibility when a coalmine is approved.\"\r\n\r\nWe also believe that the planning approval does not adequately address the environmental concerns: downstream greenhouse gas emissions caused by burning the coal were not part of the final planning verdict.",
