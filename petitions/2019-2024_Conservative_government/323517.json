        "action": "Make wearing face coverings law on public transport",
        "additional_details": "Face masks offer an important tool in the management of community transmission of Covid-19. Supporting evidence comes from analysis of: (1) the incidence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission; (2) the role of respiratory droplets in transmission, (3) studies of the use of homemade and surgical masks to reduce droplet spread. Our analysis suggests that their use could reduce transmission if widely used where physical distancing is not possible or predictable, such as public transport.",
        "background": "We want it to be a legal requirement to wear a protective surgical or homemade face mask where keeping a 2 metre distance is impossible, such as on public transport. This is crucial in preventing a second wave of the virus, protecting the NHS and getting people back to work to kickstart the economy.",
