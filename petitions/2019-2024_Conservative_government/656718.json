        "action": "Allow on-call emergency responders in the UK Green lights on vehicles.",
        "additional_details": "Typically on-call doctors have previously utilised green flashing lights to warn members of the public of their intent to progress in a legal but timely fashion. These lights can provide a vital courteous message of intent to other road users. Response times for on-call emergency responders double too\r\noften just by potentially being stuck behind a slower driver or traffic who have no idea of the importance of the driver's intent to progress behind them.",
        "background": "The Government should amend legislation to allow retained emergency services such as On-Call firefighters, Coastguard, etc to use green flashing lights to progress and aid response (like with doctors). This is not to exempt drivers from breach of any road rules but to aid drivers through congestion.",
