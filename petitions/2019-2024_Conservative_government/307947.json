        "action": "Protect the NHS by allowing supermarkets to open Normal Hours on Sundays",
        "additional_details": "Currently, supermarkets are only able to open 6 hours on Sunday. This leaves a large part of the day when no food or other essential hygiene items are available to buy from these large stores. Pharmacies, petrol stations and small shops are exempt from opening restrictions, but they may become overwhelmed by the volume of people trying to use them, and run out of stock. We cannot let this happen. We must use all the resources at our disposal to keep the supplies flowing and beat the virus.",
        "background": "In the current situation, we need the NHS and other critical workers to be able to access key supplies when they have spare time. The coronavirus doesn't have weekends and neither do the people fighting it. This means allowing all supermarkets to remain fully open on Sundays.",
