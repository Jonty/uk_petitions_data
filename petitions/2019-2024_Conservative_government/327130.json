        "action": "Nazi salutes in public to be illegal, and Nazi chants treated as 'hate speech'.",
        "additional_details": "Making these salutes are gestures of racism and with Nazi racial and allegiance chants  are extremely offensive to the Jewish and 'BAME' community and are an affront to the wider UK population, and to families whose relatives at great cost died for this country fighting the Nazis. These salutes and chants are becoming common with far-right groups at demonstrations as seen in Whitehall today. Nazi racist chants should be treated as 'hate speech'.",
        "background": "To pass law against Nazi salutes being permitted in a public place, possibly as a Regulation under the Public Order Act 1936, and for Nazi chants to be classed the same as racial chants and thereby treated as 'hate speech'.",
