        "additional_details": "Several business across the Country started making untaxed profits by adding service charges to the final bill. These charges are not presented in line with the Consumer Act and are a way to avoid paying taxes to HMRC. In fact, these are added after VAT and taxes are calculated. These charges allow businesses to make 10-15% untaxed extra profits at the expenses of customers who are presented with a mandatory fee to pay prior to the service being received.",
        "background": "The Parliament must forbid businesses to add untaxed service charges to customers\u2019 bills. Businesses must be forced to offer clear and transparent prices so that customers know how much they are expected to pay before ordering.",
