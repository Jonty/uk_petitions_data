        "additional_details": "A child dies every 10 minutes in Yemen & 24 million people are affected by famine. If 24 million people were affected by famine in the UK, we would expect international aid, so why are we not giving to a country in severe need of it? Do their lives not matter as much as people living in more developed countries? I want the government to intervene or even help in any way possible as CHILDREN are dying at a unreasonable rate. Covid-19 will wipe this country off the map unless we do something now.",
