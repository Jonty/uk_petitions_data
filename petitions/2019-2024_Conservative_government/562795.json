        "additional_details": "Most of us will be looking forward to an early night on Christmas Eve, to wake up bright for the next day to spend all morning opening presents and looking forward to Christmas dinner but I know many patients won\u2019t be able to make it home for Christmas. Social isolation is something many terminal patients experience daily and at Christmas the isolation is especially keenly felt, and those who have young children who just want to see them open their presents for one very last time.",
        "background": "Christmas only comes once a year and patients are unable to see their relatives. This means one will miss their grandchild\u2019s first Christmas or simply miss holding a hand of a loved one by the fire. Being alone at Christmas is one thing but being in hospital alone is another. Let\u2019s change this.",
