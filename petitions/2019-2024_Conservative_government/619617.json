        "additional_details": "I wish the government to do this to ease the financial burden of many claimants that will get overlooked by the 'joint claim loophole' as many people on joint claims feel as they are being penalised time and time again for being in a relationship. \r\n\r\nThe cost of living is high for everyone right now if your single or as a couple, but the cost of living payment needs to be distributed fairly for it to have any sort of impact. Couples bills can be twice as high than a single person so you can't expect a couple to receive the same amount as a singular person and cover the costs.",
        "background": "To raise the cost of living payment for joint claimants from \u00a3650 per couple to \u00a31300 per couple (\u00a3650 per person). This is only fair as a single claimant is entitled to \u00a3650, whereas couples will only get \u00a3650 between them.",
