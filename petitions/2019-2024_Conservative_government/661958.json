        "action": "Renationalise England's water industry.",
        "additional_details": "Since the water industry has been privatised it has run up debts of \u00a354bn and paid out dividends of \u00a365.9bn while failing to invest sufficiently in infrastructure. Much of the privatised water industry is now owned by foreign investment companies, private equity and businesses based in tax havens. Parliament is not legally obliged to compensate shareholders but previous nationalisations have been achieved by swapping shares for government bonds. Nationalisation will increase accountability.",
        "background": "I want Parliament to take back control of our water companies by renationalisation to prevent them further polluting our rivers and seas by prioritising profit maximization for the benefit of their share holders' dividends and executives' pay over all other considerations.",
