        "action": "Allow the hospitality sector to continue indoor dining whilst in Covid tier 3",
        "additional_details": "The current tier 3 government restrictions are crippling the hospitality industry and it can no longer be sustained. \r\n\r\nIn some areas of the UK, hospitality has only been allowed to open in some capacity for less than 50% of the time since March.\r\n\r\nTheres no hard evidence to prove that a restaurant is a higher infection risk than a supermarket, nail salon, hairdressers, gym or mall, however these establishments are able to open within tier 3 and the hospitality sector are being unfairly penalised",
        "background": "We are petitioning to allow all hospitality establishments including restaurants, pubs & cafes to serve food indoors & outdoors to single household tables within a Covid secure environment, whilst in tier 3.\r\n\r\nWe are not encouraging household mixing and therefore there is minimal infection risk.",
