        "additional_details": "Grouse moors cover over 6 million acres of land in the UK. Intensive management has a massive negative effect on the natural world, disrupting peat bogs which lock up carbon (or emit carbon when drained), deforestation, and killing raptors through cruel methods. They have failed in self regulation.\r\n\r\nIntroducing a license for England and Wales would force good standards. If these standards not met, the vast amounts of land can be repurposed for rewilding, to meet the 2050 Net Zero target.",
        "background": "Implement limited grouse moor licenses, with a zero tolerance license loss for heather burning and predator persecution. \r\n\r\nIn areas with many grouse moors or where nature needs more aid, do not issue licenses and repurpose the land for rewilding through the RSPB, Wildlife Trusts, and other parties",
