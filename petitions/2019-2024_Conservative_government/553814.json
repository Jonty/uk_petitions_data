Football is the world's most popular sport, yet monopolistic companies charge hundreds of pounds to allow football fans to watch all the games of the club you love and follow. At least while fans cannot enter stadiums because of the pandemic, please make all high level football in the UK free to watch.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nFootball fans",
