        "additional_details": "An example l pay for Electricity 29.26p per kilowatt but my standing charge per day is 55.60p which is an extra \u00a317.24p twice as much, my Gas is 07.44p and 29.11 in standing charges an extra \u00a39.24 per month almost four times as much, together an extra \u00a326.48 per month or \u00a3317.12 per year. These charges both unfair and extortionate if you go abroad a lot of countries don't have standing charges and you only pay for what you use which is a fairer way, we ask the government to look into this soon.",
        "background": "For far to long Energy Companies have been getting away of charging extortionate Energy Standing charges which have been putting households into fuel poverty we ask the government to discuss ways of getting this unfair charge scrapped as the charges are up to four times higher than the Energy used.",
