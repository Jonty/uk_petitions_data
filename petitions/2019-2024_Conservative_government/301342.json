        "additional_details": "Remains should be collected direct from hospitals and ashes delivered to the family after the cremation.  Bereaved should not be obliged to use this service and can use commercial funeral services if they would prefer, but any cost will need to be borne entirely by the bereaved.  There should be no cash transfer nor any other cash grant if the government provided free service is not used.",
        "background": "it cannot be that our politicians will allow any Coronavirus bereaved to be subject to the grotesque, unregulated, profiteering fees charged by our Funeral Service industry safely to dispose of the infected remains of family members who are killed by the Coronavirus.",
