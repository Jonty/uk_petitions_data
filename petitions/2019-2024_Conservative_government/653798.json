I see one on Facebook the other day looking for a home and only 1-2 years old. If not rehomed she will more than likely be euthanized. Why don't we concentrate on the important issues in this Country, like scrutinizing a member of parliaments expenses for every dog euthanized through this ban. It's not the dog it's the owners 100%. I own a XL bully type dog and he's the best ever.",
