        "additional_details": "This deal only benefits rich clubs in the Premier League. They want to deny the little clubs their big payday while going on meaningless pre-season tours to sell more shirts. It's even more absurd that the big clubs will participate in a bloated Champions League and play even more games making even more money yet they want to deny smaller clubs the chance to have their big payday.\r\n.",
        "background": "The FA has decided to scrap replays from the 1st round of the FA Cup, a controversial decision that only benefits the rich clubs and doesn't help the footballing community as a whole. For a small part-time club lower down the football pyramid even a 1st round replay could set them up for years.",
