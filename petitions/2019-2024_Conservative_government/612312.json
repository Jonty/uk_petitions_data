        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to make this mandatory to prevent women from being persecuted in workplaces and education settings, due to having to have time off from the debilitating symptoms in which these conditions cause. Women\u2019s health should be a mandatory unit in Medicine and Health sciences so Drs are more equipped when it comes to dealing with women\u2019s health. Many women are left for years in agony due to Drs not being aware of these conditions and the symptoms in which they cause.",
        "background": "Due to a lack of awareness around women\u2019s health, I feel it would be good to make women\u2019s health a mandatory unit when studying medicine at uni. To also make it mandatory for managers in workplaces and staff members in schools to be educated on women\u2019s health conditions.",
