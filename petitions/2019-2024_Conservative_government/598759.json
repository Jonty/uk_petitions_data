        "action": "Reduce curriculum load for GCSE English owing to online learning during COVID 19",
        "additional_details": "Even without Covid-19, the amount of pressure students face taking such heavy English assessments is astronomical. Children have not had a normal school year since 2020 and that still continues today, that\u2019s almost over 2 years of their education that has been disrupted. Furthermore, teachers are then tasked with trying to bridge the gaps in such a short space of time, to prepare students for their GCSES (this isn\u2019t fair!). Consequently, both teachers and students need a lighter assessment load.",
        "background": "The GCSE English literature and language courses are extremely heavy and last year exam boards reduced the assessments to accommodate for the disruption of learning during COVID-19. We are still in a pandemic and thus, the exam boards and the curriculum should continue to be reduced this year too.",
