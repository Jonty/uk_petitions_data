        "additional_details": "A third of the UK bee population is thought to have vanished in a decade, yet up to three-quarters of crop species are pollinated by bees.\r\nThis means that bees are not only essential for the flowers and plants you see around you, but also for the crops as well. Bees help the farmers and nature, the more they are killed and disappear, the more both farmers and the nature around us will be harmed.",
        "background": "Ban permanently now and future the use of all bee-killing pesticides in the UK, so they can never be used to hurt our bee population ever again.\r\nWe need to protect our UK bees, not kill them. Help them and not harm them.",
