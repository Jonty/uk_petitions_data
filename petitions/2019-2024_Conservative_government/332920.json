        "action": "Ban single use plastic bags across the country, including smaller retailers.",
        "additional_details": "To support the English people to transition to reusing bags they must be banned. The millions raised from plastic bags sales shows that people are still accessing single use plastic bags in vast amounts. We must transition to NO single use bags in the country, and use the sales from 'bags for life' instead. The risk to the environment is too great, the impact of micro plastics entering the food chain is vast, and cannot be ignored.",
        "background": "To impose a ban across the next 12 months to ban single-use plastic bags. Thin gauge bags cause damage to the environment. The ban imposed in 2015 has caused a reduction, but the charge is not enough. Currently, smaller retailers do not charge.",
