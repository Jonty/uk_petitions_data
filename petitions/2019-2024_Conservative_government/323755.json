Insurance is a legal requirement and insurance companies are using this legal requirement to profit off of the vulnerable. Insurance companies should have capped quotes and be regulated to stop them refusing to pay out! We pay our premiums by law why should they be able to avoid paying out? Prices always on the increase and no claims bonuses appear to account for nothing",

To stop taking advantage of drivers and avoiding paying out genuine claims when we have paid ridiculous premiums! Insurance should be tiered and fair and not a profit making exercise",
