We have published the following related petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nExtend the suspension of the Universal Credit Minimum Income Floor: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/552461\r\n\r\nWe could also accept a petition calling on the Government to create a new system of business grants and educational support, but it would need to be clear what support you wanted to be provided, and to whom."
