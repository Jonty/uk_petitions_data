Coercing businesses that prevent people from unrestrictive travel is a complete violation of one\u2019s Humanitarian Rights, and airlines must not be allowed to exploit this.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it potentially violates any religious or cultural beliefs, which may not permit such substances from being injected into the body.",
        "background": "Airlines are insinuating and advertising that in order to travel with them, COVID vaccinations will be mandatory and should be proved.\r\n\r\nIt has already been agreed in parliament that mandatory COVID vaccinations will NOT be instigated, and airlines must not be allowed to prevent travel for this.",
