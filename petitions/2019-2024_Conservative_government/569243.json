        "action": "Stop Ofquals \"mini exams\" deciding 2021 exam results, instead of teacher grades",
        "additional_details": "Instead teachers should be allowed to base grades on previous mocks and tests. Students have had the most stressful learning experience in recent history, severely affecting the mental health of many students, making them prepare for \"mini exams\" amid being out of class for so long would be completely unfair. Results day should be pushed forward and students who are unhappy with their TAGs with private candidates should be able to take optional exams in the summer in time for university in 2021.",
        "background": "Exams were cancelled due to the \"unfair\" nature of testing the 2021 cohort, given over half a year of in class teaching moved online, using any kind of national \"mini exam\" would further create disparity in learning between more deprived and affluent areas. Failing to provide an equal playing field.",
