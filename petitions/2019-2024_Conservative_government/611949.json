I could buy the same car with this if I could travel 150 miles, but no guarantees that it was near the condition ours was in and wouldn't end up costing us a fortune in repairs. To buy a car that was the same as the one we had (which was 3 years old at purchase, 50k miles, \u00a37.5k) would now cost \u00a313500. Whichever way this is looked at, we will be losing out significantly, and this isn't right when in a no fault accident.",

You car might only be worth 3 grand, but when it's your car and you know there are no faults with it, that car can't be replaced.
