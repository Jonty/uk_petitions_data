        "action": "Allow parents/carers to stay with COVID19 pediatric patients in hospital.",
        "additional_details": "Parents of sick children nurse them closely and parents would not be isolating themselves from their sick children at home, so they would already have been exposed to the virus. Allowing a parent into hospital quarantine with their child, and then on release asking them to isolate at home for two weeks would surely be sufficient, given that relatively few children are severely affected by COVID19. To continue with the current policy is to inflict serious emotional harm on children and parents.",
        "background": "Change the NHS visitation policy so at least one parent/carer is allowed to stay with a child who is hospitalised with COVID19. No child should have to suffer and potentially die alone without the comfort of a loved one. No parent/carer should have to endure the emotional trauma of that separation.",
