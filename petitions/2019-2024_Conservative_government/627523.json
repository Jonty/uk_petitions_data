There is no reason to have fireworks that bang now that they have made them silent. They are also the same price as those that are loud. Meaning that there is no reason to not buy them.",
        "background": "The UK is a country of animal lovers and many animals that are scared of the sound of fireworks. The UK being a multi cultural country there are many celebrations that people use fireworks. \r\nThe sale of quiet fireworks cost the same price as those that make the loud bangs.
