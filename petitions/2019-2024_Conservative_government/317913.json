It is a win-win strategy, allowing management/possibly domestic elimination of the virus until a vaccine is available. It is broadly the South Korean/Singaporean approach, with demonstrated effectiveness.\r\n\r\nOther approaches require continued lockdowns, with huge economic and social disruption, and cost many more lives\r\n\r\nThese approaches have been shown to be effective and are supported by large numbers of experts and researchers.",
