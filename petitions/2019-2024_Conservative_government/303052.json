        "additional_details": "We need to ensure everyone has access to basic supplies and medicines.  Many people with allergies are finding they can't get the food supplies they can safely have. Many people with children, can't get child safe medicines. We need to ensure there's enough for everyone, rather than some people hoarding piles of goods while others go without.\r\n\r\nRationing should be introduced immediately as an emergency measure.",
