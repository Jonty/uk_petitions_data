        "additional_details": "For more than half a century, following World War 2, Jamaicans were called upon to fill the gaps in the labour force and were told that they were British citizens under the commenwealth. For several years, the Home Office has destroyed the records of the Windrush Generation and have implemented mass deportations of people who have lived and contributed to this country for decades. It's time that the government stops treating Carribeans as expendable.",
        "background": "The government needs to halt all deportation flights to Jamaica of people who have lived in this country for decades and have started families here.",
