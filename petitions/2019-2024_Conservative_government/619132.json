        "additional_details": "47% of the price of fuel is tax/duty. So at \u00a31.90 a litre, 90p is tax! Due to the increase in the price of fuel itself, the amount of OUR money going to the Government has increased too; massively! This is hurting people and killing businesses. Cut fuel duty by 50% as a temporary measure. And apply legal rules to ensure forecourts pass this cut on to customers.",
