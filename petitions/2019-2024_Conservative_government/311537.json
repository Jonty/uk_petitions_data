        "additional_details": "The extension should be given special consideration in light of COVID-19. The virus has had a multifold impact on the economy, studies and career prospects. The IMF chief declared that the world has entered a recession as bad or worse than the '08 financial crisis. It is unfair to expect students to secure a job in such a small time frame in a damaged economy and after having lost all opportunities for career progression over summer. An extension would allow us more time to seek opportunities.",
        "background": "Extend post-study T4 visa for international students graduating in 2020 due to the impact that COVID-19 has on the economy and ill-effects on the job market. Job opportunities are bound to shrink and students have lost opportunities for career progression with termination of internships and jobs.",
