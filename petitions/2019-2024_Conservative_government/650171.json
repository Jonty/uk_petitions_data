        "additional_details": "It\u2019s very simple. We are already having tonnes and tonnes of stress and anxiety being put on our backs about these exams, this is due to the ALL of the exam boards raising grade boundaries (making it much more DIFFICULT to achieve a pass) especially since a lot of us are being forced to revise 10/11 GCSE subjects. Taking away formular sheets will further complicate things and add a lot of unnecessary stress, especially for those who are just about scraping a grade 4 pass. We all want this to change",
