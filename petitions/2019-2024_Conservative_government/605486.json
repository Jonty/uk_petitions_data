        "additional_details": "We would like the government to find out if there is price fixing on the services the Vet's supply, ie, between Vets and drug company's, and is the Veterinary Council involved with what costs vet's charge. It forces the populace to have expensive pet insurance (the cheaper ones are not that good) just in case one has to take their pet to a Vet for even the simplest problem",
        "background": "To debate whether vets are over charging on items such as drugs and prescriptions, ie, my Vet charged me \u00a380 for 30 arthritis pills. When we asked for the prescription to get them else where, he then charged me \u00a340 just for the prescription. My dog will need these pills for the rest of his life.",
