These areas are low population, rural communities, which of course will not meet this ridiculous criteria as most of it is farmland.\r\n\r\nLivelihoods, homes, businesses and the mental health of those going through the terrible ordeal are at risk.  Please show your support by signing and show government that this decision must to be reversed.",

On the 6th January 24 there was a glimmer of hope, as the government announced help for those affected. We were then given the crushing news that the help does not include East Yorkshire!",
