        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to consider to have a fairer approach to who is eligible for the nurse training grant, and make everyone who is studying a nursing course, international, EU students included (even without being in the country for 5 years) eligible for it. \r\nWe are all nursing students, all facing the same situation, and in need of the same support, we are all contributing for the health system in this country, we will all exercise the profession we choose with our hearts, and be part of the system. It\u2019s more than fair that we all get the same support, regardless of the place in the world we come from.",
        "background": "The student nurse grant (annually \u00a35000) should be paid to all student nurses, not just British citizens, or people living in the UK for more than 5 years. We are all doing the same course regardless the place in the world we come from.",
