        "additional_details": "If pubs can open, why not choirs? Benefits to mental health, the community and spiritually wellbeing of singing in churches, choral societies etc should balance concerns about transmission of Coronavirus. \r\nTesting could willingly be done by choir members, and both vaccinations have taken place for many.\r\nEven if some of the choir has to join in online, it works much better if a big group is singing in situ.\r\nMany professionals rely on this work with amateurs, and it's demoralising for all of us.",
        "background": "Under current rules, amateur choirs can only rehearse inside in groups of 6, unlike professionals who are allowed 30. Surely we could also be allowed to rehearse in groups of 30, now so many are vaccinated and LF tests are freely available. Testing/spacing rules could be enforced by our directors.",
