        "additional_details": "To amend CAZ to rush hour only, make the zone smaller and more realistic so as not to destroy the retail area - broadmead. \r\nIt will make people who\u2019ve older cars depend on an unreliable over priced public transport system. \r\nThe council could subsidise public transport with the monies earn\u2019t from the CAZ scheme and realistically enable people to travel for free or heavily discounted.",
        "background": "Make the zone more realistic, it was sold as only being the centre of Bristol. It\u2019s too big to include temple way, old market, hotwells  and broadmead.",
