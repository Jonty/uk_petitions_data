        "action": "Pay student Midwives working on the frontline during the Covid-19 outbreak.",
        "additional_details": "There are numerous Student Midwives in the North West of England in hospitals such as Arrowe Park and the Royal Liverpool hospital who are not being provided with protective equipment putting them at risk of contagion. They are being forced to work as a fully fledged midwife without any pay or leniency on assignments. Those with children being forced to work also do not currently qualify for children to be kept in school. The Gov should look into this in order to keep these departments going.",
        "background": "Provide support to Student Midwives being forced to work as regular members of staff without the vital protective precautions as regular hospital staff, expected to conduct increased duties during the Covid-19 pandemic. Without these students many of these overlooked departments would be overrun.",
