        "additional_details": "Across 315,000+ miles of roadways, almost half of our total native wildflower and flora species exist. Inconsiderate maintenance regimes are harming our native wildflowers due to cutting too often & leaving behind those cuttings and cutting at the wrong time harming annual wildflowers, eg.  forgetting how nature can help us with Yellow Rattle.\r\n\r\nBy affording verges protection nationally, requirements would be placed on local authorities and contractors to maintain for wildflowers & biodiversity.",
        "background": "We request a cross-party agreement & legal statute affording special protection to all of our roadsides verges - urban & rural - so that the management regimes of verges better enhance biodiversity and protect native wildflowers. Also, to make it a legal requirement to collect cuttings after mowing",
