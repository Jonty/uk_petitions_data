        "action": "Abolish the TV license, Remove the funding from the BBC.",
        "additional_details": "The BBC is now out of date with the times, BBC News is no longer nonbiased. There is a substantial shift away from standard terrestrial television and radio to online streaming and DAB radio. A large proportion of their revenue now comes from their commercial operations. This would provide a saving to those who struggle to pay for the TV License, and benefit those that rarely follow the BBC anymore. The UK is no longer 1960's circumstance, we are now in 2020 and the BBC must align with the times",
        "background": "Remove the TV License from the BBC, It no longer operates as aligned to its charter. This is blatantly obvious when looking at BBC news.",
