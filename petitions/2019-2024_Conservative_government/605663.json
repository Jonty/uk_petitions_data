        "additional_details": "Iron \"fortification\" is already added to all white flours milled in the UK, including the products that flour is added to and we also fortify most cereals with iron. People with Haemochromatosis need to have a diet low in iron and be given choices about their intake of iron. A blanket ban on unfortified flour (UK and imported) will take those choices away. Haemochromatosis means you may have a lifetime of blood being drawn off and, if not caught in time it may lead to organ failure.",
        "background": "Haemochromatosis  has been diagnosed in 5,000 people in the UK but 250,000+ don't know they have it. 1 in 8 are carriers of this genetic disorder. This disease means that iron is stored in the organs and can result in liver, heart, pancreas failure + other health issues. Adding Iron to foods is bad.",
