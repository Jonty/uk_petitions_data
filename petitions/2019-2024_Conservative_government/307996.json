        "additional_details": "We are currently facing a global pandemic and we need to do everything we can to help one another and overcome such hard times. If UK shops are charging more than double for essentials such as bread and milk, there is no chance that our communities will be able to survive. It is important we all stick together to not only help our economy but also help our citizens. \r\nThe Government needs to introduce a new legislation to protect the UK public from being 'ripped off'.",
        "background": "There has been a massive price increase in many UK shops for essential items. This is making it difficult for people to cope and we want this to stop. We want the Government to introduce a new legislation to make it illegal and stop this price hike which is putting a great strain on every day life.",
