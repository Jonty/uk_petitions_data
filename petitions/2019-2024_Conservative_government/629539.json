There have been so many cases where people have not even been allowed to leave to visit a dying family member, go to funerals, weddings, visit their children, etc without risk of their application being withdrawn and having to start the process all over again or be deported. I cannot see any logical reasons for denying travel for valid reasons. It needs to change.",
