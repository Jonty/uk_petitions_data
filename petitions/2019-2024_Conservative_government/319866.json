        "action": "To allow angling for sport in the uk during lockdown",
        "additional_details": "Angling is a important past time for millions of people in the UK and is very solitary. The majority of anglers use the sport as a way to relax and get away from other members of the public. There is no risk of people contracting COVID-19 through angling as it\u2019s a solo sport, that is outside, in a well ventilated area. If someone can still go into a shop to buy one item e.g. an apple and potentially come into contact with 100+ people why shouldn\u2019t one be able to sit round a lake on their own.",
        "background": "I want the government to allow angling for sport during lockdown effective immediately as it\u2019s a solo sport and is beneficial for physical and mental health. Many members of the public rely on this to help deal with health problems and PTSD.",
