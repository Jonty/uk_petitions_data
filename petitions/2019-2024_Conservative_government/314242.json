        "additional_details": "I believe it is an insult to those foreign NHS WORKERS who are as important to our struggling NHS as our own uk nationals. This is reminiscent of what happened to the Gurkhas but on a much larger scale. It gives out a message that we will use them only when we need them. The UK government should match the commitment that these foreign heroes are demonstrating day in day out. Act Now before we lose them and end up with an ineffective NHS when this current Crisis ends.",
        "background": "It has been muted that foreign NHS workers who are valiantly supporting our current Pandemic may have their Visas extended for 12 months beyond October 2020 .  I want the government to offer them British Citizenship as a reward for their heroic work.",
