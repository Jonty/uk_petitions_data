        "additional_details": "The current trend of ruining statues and demand to change the historical facts and ruin the works of art only leads to anarchy and chaos.\r\nStop the streets, buildings, organizations being renamed. Protect the British history and culture.\r\nWe do not want the graffiti to replace the works of art! \r\nStatues, building names and road signs are not celebrating acts of slavery or racism. They are honouring the investment in Britain that people have made including investing in cities and towns that make them great today.\r\nThe Great Britain has helped the peoples around the world investing billions of pounds and providing humanitarian aid. Surely it has atoned in many folds for the mistakes made in the past.",
