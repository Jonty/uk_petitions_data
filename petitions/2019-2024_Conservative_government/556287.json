        "additional_details": "Plastic pollution is becoming a big problem (by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the oceans). Water fountains in public are common in other European countries - so why aren\u2019t they here? It is a free way for people to save the environment. Placing just one water fountain in a public space could save our Earth and stop polluting our seas. There isn\u2019t a Planet B so we need to do all we can to stop this plastic problem.",
        "background": "Putting water fountains in public spaces will mean that people buy less single use plastic bottles. Plastic is destroying our Earth, clogging our oceans and killing our wildlife. Water fountains will let you refill your bottle without polluting the oceans.",
