        "additional_details": "The current law prevents us from bringing our loved ones with us while we work tirelessly for the betterment of others' lives. This policy is not just unfair; it's counterproductive. Studies show that employees who feel secure in their personal lives perform better at work (source: Harvard Business Review). We urge the UK government to reconsider its stance on this issue and allow social workers on healthcare visas to bring their dependents with them.",
        "background": "I am one of many social workers who have come to the UK on a healthcare visa, ready and willing to serve the people of this nation. However, our ability to fully commit ourselves is hindered by a heart-wrenching reality - we are unable to bring our dependents with us.",
