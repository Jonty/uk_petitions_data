        "additional_details": "Numerous scientific fields; biology, endocrinology, physiology, genetics, neuroscience, and more, confirmed that sex and gender exist as a spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe gender spectrum is an understanding that gender is not binary, but rather a spectrum of biological, mental and emotional traits. The gender binary is a belief that gender is composed of 2 distinct genders.\r\n\r\nThis is not scientifically or medically correct. Gender can\u2019t be binary, because it's a personal identity and is socially constructed.",
