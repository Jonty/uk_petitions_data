Working from home is not as effective as working in a classroom with teachers on hand, a majority of people will see their grades slack. This could be prevented by treating exam students as a priority. Also, children aged 4,5 and 6 will struggle to social distance, especially at break and lunchtimes.But, older students have an understanding and are able to go home straight after lessons, meaning less oppurtunity to spread the virus.",
