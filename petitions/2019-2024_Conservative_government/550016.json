        "additional_details": "Customers of the DVSA, a Government monopoly, have been ignored and neglected and the 5 month hiatus when no tests were available has not been used to produce a useable, coherent solution to the inevitable problems that were always going to happen. A woefully incapable system has now been provided for the thousands of customers who want tests.  This is pathetic and we want something proper done quickly. Furthermore, theory test expiry dates need to be extended because of this situation.",
        "background": "The system booking driving tests is an utter disgrace. A queuing system which runs into the tens of thousands for no tests to be available when access is achieved. A website that crashes demoting queuers to the back of the queue and drivers with postponed tests from March still not with a test date.",
