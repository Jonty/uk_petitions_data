MPs need to play a more effective role in articulating the concerns of their constituents. The right to recall a sitting MP will enable a modicum of democracy to be re-injected into British politics",
        "background": "Parliament has consistently failed to respond to demands for a more proportional voting system. This has led to skewed election results and artifical majorities. The current Tory 80 seat majority is an impediment to effective oversight of parliament at a time of dramatic change.",
