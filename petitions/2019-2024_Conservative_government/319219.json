        "additional_details": "Pubs are at the heart of many communities in fact their status as social gathering places is exactly why they have been closed in order to prevent people grouping together. It is probable that, under Government guidance, pubs will be amongst the last businesses to reopen and therefore hit hardest. After lockdown people may be bursting to get to their local but without support many local pubs will have vanished. Government needs to fund and secure the future of the UK pub industry and pub society",
        "background": "Public houses are in forced close down. Many breweries still charge for rent from their publicans. A way must be found to compensate publicans for this expense whilst they are unable to earn from their businesses. Without compensation many publicans will be ruined and unable to reopen in future.",
