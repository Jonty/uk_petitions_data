        "additional_details": "Having only been to schools for his own education and for the odd photo opportunity, Gavin Williamson, in his infinite wisdom, has decided to impose masks on the nation's children. Alongside the draconian muzzling of kids, pupils will have biweekly COVID tests which will undoubtedly snuff out any transmission in schools. Once liberty-loving Johnson is now forcing the nation's children to wear masks whilst in school. This is outrageous and must be stopped immediately before it even starts!",
        "background": "In the latest COVID commandments set out by HM Government, the Prime Minister ordered that ALL secondary school and college students MUST wear masks during lessons. We believe that this is to the determent of pupils mental and physical health.",
