The Treasury has said the economic effect will be \u201csignificant\u201d just when we need the economy to recover. It will hurt companies the hardest that have suffered most recently like leisure and hospitality. Businesses will have to pay regardless of whether they are profitable, increasing their costs and pushing up the prices they charge, making inflation even worse.",
