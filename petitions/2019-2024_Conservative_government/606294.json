        "additional_details": "Having a pay increase would massively help with morale and it would help with working efficiencies within the motor trade. We save alot of lives each year finding dangerous faults on customers Vehicles. We keep the country moving.\r\n\r\nIt would also give young adults more of an incentive to apply for an apprenticeship as a Mechanic/Technician when they leave school.",
        "background": "I want Mechanics/Technicians to have a pay increase it should be the same pay as other skilled trades. \r\n\r\nIt takes alot of knowledge and skill to be a Mechanic/Technician especially how vehicles are getting more technical. I find it a very under valued trade.",
