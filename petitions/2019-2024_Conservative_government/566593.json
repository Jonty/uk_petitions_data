        "additional_details": "Due to being unable to book driving tests under Covid-19 restrictions, some learners have had to pay for more top-up lessons over an extended period of time despite already driving competently. This especially affects students travelling between cities for university and driving lessons, spending yet more money in the process due to rescheduling of practical tests. It also means that people who would by now be able to travel in a car, risk exposure to covid through the use of public transport.",
