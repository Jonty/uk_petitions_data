        "additional_details": "They are self employed and are already suffering the greatest damage to earnings amid this crisis. Work is minimal as people are encouraged to follow self-isolation procedures. Drivers are out all day with no jobs and still have to pay fines. If statutory pay does not apply to self-employed drivers, the least that can be done is to suspend charges.",
        "background": "Amid the current COVID crisis, self employed workers suffer the most as no statutory pay is in place, including PCO and chauffeur drivers. They have to pay Congestion Charge and ULEZ daily. I urge for a suspension of these charges as work is scarce and paying these charges is unfair at this time.",
