        "additional_details": "We feel that it is wrong that a prime minister with such a short tenure in office should be entitled to the privilege of the PDCA scheme. This feels like Liz Truss is being rewarded for the damage that she has done to our economy and reputation on the world stage. We need to act now to stop the exiting prime minister and any other future holders of the position who resign within 12 months from being able to claim PDCA.",
        "background": "Liz Truss is eligible to claim up to \u00a3115,000 per year from the PDCA scheme. We want to see a minimum time in office clause added to the scheme so that she would no longer be entitled to claim the allowance.",
