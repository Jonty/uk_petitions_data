They are losing out on education and socialising with their friends and a routine which is good for them.\r\nParents wish to do their bit but teaching is a specialist occupation which needs to be carried out continuously in a child's life. Parents also have other duties such as running theme, working and so on.\r\nThis petition is to get teachers back into the classroom and doing the job they want to do, safely.",
