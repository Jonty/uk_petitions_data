        "additional_details": "The NHS is the \"Jewel in the Crown\". Every person from the cleaner to the surgeon is just as important. Their jobs are hard. They risk their lives in the face of infection. They give. They all give without discrimination. All of us will meet them some time. Please give the NHS a \"National NHS Day\".  Just one day, once a year, from all that would contribute, just give it to the NHS every year without fail, forever.\r\n\r\nThere are 365 days in a year. Please, just give 1 of those days to the NHS as a society and as a Nation together. We as a Nation could devote 1 day, either as individuals or businesses to either making ourselves healthier, making others healthier, fundraising for the NHS, volunteering in the NHS for 24 hours or many more ideas. \r\n\r\nMake one day a year \"National NHS Day\".",
        "background": "Given the outpouring of public support for the NHS during these times, there is no way their service to the country, our society, individuals can be forgotten. We need to consider and celebrate our NHS through \"National NHS Day\".",
