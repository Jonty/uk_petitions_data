        "additional_details": "Grenfell was a travesty which no-one is denying but this form is putting the property market for flats and peoples lives to a standstill. The work required on the buildings is going to take several years due to money and the lack of certified surveyors willing and able to carry out the work. People in this category are being punished and our lives are now being forced on hold for many years. We need a resolution quickly in order to allow people to move forward with their lives.",
        "background": "Overhaul and review the EWS1 form to make it possible for homeowners to sell, buy, staircase and remortgage. The EWS1 is having a catastrophic impact on people\u2019s lives mentally and physically. This is creating a huge housing problem effecting hundreds of thousands of households across the entire UK.",
