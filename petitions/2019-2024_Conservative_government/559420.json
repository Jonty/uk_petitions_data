Charities are working tirelessly to save lives of animals, wild and pets...whilst the fireworks are taking them. People get injured, putting the NHS under further strain and veterans face the terror of revisiting their experiences...all so some fireworks can be displayed. They are explosives, they are dangerous. We need to act on this and follow suit to Australia.",
