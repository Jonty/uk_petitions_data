        "additional_details": "I really want the government or parliament to consider this because we have all been through such a tough time with this pandemic missing most of our year 12 year and loosing more year 13 time. We haven\u2019t had a lot of clarity and working from home is hard on us all. I speak for myself and others when I say we haven\u2019t had enough time, things have been changed and changed again. Our previous exams were cancelled due to the pandemic earlier on, so please can this be debated.",
        "background": "Please cancel 2021 Vocational exams, we have not had enough time to properly revise with confusion over whether are exams were going ahead. We haven\u2019t had enough guidance to our exams. It\u2019s not fair for us to sit the exam if it\u2019s not safe enough to do so in the summer, or be in school.",
