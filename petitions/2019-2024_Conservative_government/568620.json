Only the government has the power to resolve the issue at hand And potentially save jobs in the process.",
        "background": "We want all CBT's to be temporarily halted, as you're aware we are unable to take our CBT during the restrictions, and some of us rely on this for work. So until all restrictions are relieved, make it legal to ride a motorcycle up to a capacity of 125cc without a valid CBT.",
