Having now left the EU - where are the millions of pounds promised to support the NHS? Our key workers have been selfless and brave throughout the Coronavirus epidemic, all risking and some loosing their lives ,in order to look after us. The very least we can do is provide them with free meals, available at their hospitals when they are at work for nourishment, comfort and a momentary respite. It is crucial for our nurses and doctors to be able to work to their best ability. It is a major and embarrassing flaw in the system, one which needs to be changed - immediately.",
