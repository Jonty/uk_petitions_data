If I want a parent on there it can only be the person that gave birth to me who has in no way been a parent to me and should NOT have the right to be on there. It\u2019s bad enough I have her on my birth certificate and can\u2019t change it. What kind of sham rule is that?!",

We're not sure who you'd like this rule to be included to.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do, such as allowing anyone to be listed as a parent on the marriage certificate, regardless of formal relationship.
