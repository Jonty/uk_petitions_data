        "action": "Make university tuition fees tax-deductible",
        "additional_details": "Students go to uni to gain the necessary skills and training/re-training to pursue work in their chosen field. This is no different from a company director deducting training-related expenses from their tax bill. Countries like Germany allow the tax deduction of tuition fees, and go even further to include other expenses (e.g. transport, accommodation, textbooks). Many young people decide against uni, due to high tuition fees. This proposal helps incentivise them to gain the skills the UK needs.",
        "background": "Introduce legislation that makes university tuition fees tax-deductible. This should include the ability to carry a loss forward to when a student ultimately joins the workforce (i.e. if a student's earnings during their university studies are less than their total tuition fees incurred).",
