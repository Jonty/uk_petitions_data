        "additional_details": "I think this would reduce the covid cases and deaths massively especially with this new strand. We'd rather experience a much harsher lockdown now, than be told different but still experience one in the future. The mass covid testing will determine who needs to isolate and stay inside to reduce the spread.",
        "background": "Use school buildings for mass testing for students, staff, parents and the local public. Introduce a harsher lockdown than the one introduced in March. Students may enter the school in case of exams. Also, get police on the streets arresting and fining people breaching isolation.",
