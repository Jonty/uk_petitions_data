        "additional_details": "Millions of people are choosing between heating and eating, whilst MPs claim expenses for second homes etc, they are completely out of touch with reality as they get their costs reimbursed. Stopping expenses will save the tax payer millions of pounds each year, which can be better spent towards the cost of living crisis. MPs are on a reasonable wage so therefore can cover costs of their own bills like the rest of the population have to do",
