        "additional_details": "I would like to ask the UK to stop arming Saudi with weapons.  So many innocent people are killed every day because of bombings and shoot outs. It\u2019s very hard to get food and medicine to help people because the ports have been blown up. Please, please sign this petition. They need us and we have neglected them.",
        "background": "For the past 5 years there has been a Civil War happening in Yemen. It is the largest humanitarian crisis we have ever saw and millions of people aren\u2019t even aware of what\u2019s happening there. They are on the brink of going extinct. A child dies every 10 minutes in Yemen.",
