        "additional_details": "The New Year\u2019s honours are a fabulous tradition and there are many people who are amazing, the top of their fields, great charity workers and have put their necks in the public domain for the betterment of the UK. But this year, a clear simple message is needed to make sure that only those who are selflessly putting their fellow citizens first, even at the risk of their lives, should be honoured.",
        "background": "This year, 2020, we should let those key workers who are risking their lives, often for very little pay, know how much we appreciate them and ALL new year's honours should go to them and NONE should go to politicians, sports people, entertainers or business people.",
