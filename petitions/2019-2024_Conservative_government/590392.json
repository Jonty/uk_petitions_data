        "additional_details": "The current year 10's & year 12's commenced their GCSE/A-Level foundational year during a worldwide pandemic. Their education has been disrupted by 3 national lockdowns, local tiers and for most, regular periods of isolation. Their learning pathway has been disrupted at best and online provision has been delivered unequally and disproportionately. In addition, a survey by Young Minds showed 67% of young people believed the pandemic will have a long term negative effect on their mental health.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to cancel the national A-Level & GCSE academic examinations for 2022 and allocate grades using similar methods that were used this year and in 2020.",
