        "additional_details": "Remdesivir has been administered to terminal COVID-19 patients in the U.S. and Japan. Those patients reportedly made remarkable recoveries. Clinical testing is ongoing, but the time it takes to complete the trials means that the drug is unlikely to be approved in time to stem the current COVID-19 outbreak. \r\nAdministering  remdesivir and other antiviral drugs to severely ill patients could substantially reduce the number of deaths in Britain from the Coronavirus, if government acts now.",
        "background": "Allow severely ill COVID-19 patients to elect to be treated with remdesivir and potentially other antiviral medicines that appear to be effective against COVID-19 even though clinical trials are not yet complete. Patients shall have informed consent.",
