        "action": "Regulate the cost of car insurance for young drivers.",
        "additional_details": "Parliament or the Government should look at either a cap on car insurance or a policy, like Australia, where the car is insured and not the driver. \r\nInsurance companies are making it far too expensive for young drivers and are mainly pushing low-income, working families towards insurance fraud through 'fronting'. This is not right and there is no need for insurance companies to have raised their prices by an average of 58% since last January.",
        "background": "With the new BBC News article giving worrying details on how young drivers are driving uninsured or fraudulently, regulation on the cost of car insurance is surely a more adequate solution than convicting ordinary, working people of insurance fraud.",
