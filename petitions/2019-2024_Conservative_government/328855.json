        "action": "Tanning Salons should be specifically identified as 'non-contact' Beauty Salons.",
        "additional_details": "Tanning Salons are entirely non-contact by the nature of the business. Enhanced ventilation systems are already in place. Tanning on sunbeds takes place within an enclosed room, and these sunbeds/rooms are each individually ventilated. Replenishment with entirely clean air is much more frequent than in most other types of businesses. Tanning Salons are a very popular activity that presents a uniquely Covid-Safe leisure pursuit, without adding any additional risk. This is a legislative anomaly.",
        "background": "Tanning Salons are asked by councils to close their businesses during the current Covid outbreak, simply as a result of them being unfairly classed as 'within' the Beauty Salons grouping of businesses. Tanning Salons should be correctly re-classed within this group, as non-contact and Covid-Safe.",
