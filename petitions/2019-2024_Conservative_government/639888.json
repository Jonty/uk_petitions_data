        "additional_details": "People were told that leaving the EU would mean vastly more money for the NHS, lower immigration, and a stronger economy.  Not one of these promises has been delivered, and even senior Brexiteers are now quoted as saying that Brexit has been a failure. \r\n\r\nIt is time for Parliament to properly debate the present will of the British people and approach the EU about re-joining.",
        "background": "23 June 2023 will be seven years since the UK voted to leave the EU, but all polls show the majority of British people now regret leaving the EU.  \r\n\r\nThe evidence is overwhelming that no plan can match re-establishing the UK's membership of the EU in terms of the economic and political benefits.",
