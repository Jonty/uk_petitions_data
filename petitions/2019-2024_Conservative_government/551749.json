        "action": "Introduce mandatory sustainability indicators on food and product packaging",
        "additional_details": "Unless we act fast and educate the general public in an accessible and digestible way, we're going to run out of time and see the collapse of the natural living world. Such a small change to how food and consumer products are presented could have a dramatic, positive impact to consumer behaviour. \r\n\r\nNot only would the additional indicators hugely benefit our environment, they'd be likely to have positive economic impacts due to local UK products being favourable over unsustainable import goods.",
        "background": "Due to increased pressures regarding biodiversity decline and loss of natural habitats, the government should pass law that supermarkets and product manufacturers display how sustainable their products are on the packaging. This could be in the form of an additional traffic light style guide.",
