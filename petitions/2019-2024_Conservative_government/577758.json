How are people supposed to survive until then especially since most of us used the previous grant to pay our taxes.\r\n\r\nFrom the information gathered most of self-employed need that money as soon as possible as March has already started and there has been no prospect of income since November.\r\n\r\nThis process needs to be sped up like the previous applications. \r\n\r\nIn November we obtained our payment by the end of the month.",
