        "additional_details": "The flight due to take off from the UK to Rwanda with failed asylum seekers on June 14, 2022, was cancelled due to an intervention by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). All relevant UK courts approved the deportation of the asylum seekers, but the ECHR ruled that the flight be cancelled. The ECHR threatens the UK's democratic processes, sovereignty as a nation, and in this specific instance, the ability to implement domestic policy. The UK needs to withdraw from the ECHR immediately.",
        "background": "The UK government should withdraw from the European Court of Human Rights with immediate effect. The United Kingdom should not grant jurisdiction to a European court that can interfere with its domestic policies, such as the Rwanda asylum plan.",
