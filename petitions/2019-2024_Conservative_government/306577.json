        "action": "Stop landlords charging for accommodation that students can no longer use.",
        "additional_details": "Due to the evolving situation regarding Covid-19, students have been instructed by universities to base themselves at home. Students will not be able to use their student accommodation but will still have to pay for the final block of fees. Why should students pay for something that they can't use? The proposed action will prevent students from building up unnecessary debt and will allow students to stand in good stead for the financially trying times to come in light of the pandemic.",
        "background": "We would like the government to introduce measures to stop landlords and universities from charging students for accommodation that they can no longer use due to the current pandemic.",
