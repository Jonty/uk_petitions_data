Student might have cheated and no action might have taken place. Class exams most student have not revised for it and therefore I strongly believe that GCSEs should have exams to give every child a fair and real grade.",

However I managed to get an Grade 8 in the real GCSE meaning that some kids don\u2019t take it seriously until the last 2 months. No one knew I was going to get an 8.",
