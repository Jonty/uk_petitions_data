I have a 2.5 year old and an almost 5 month old who both need to be warm and be entertained. My husband works and I am on maternity leave, we have since used almost double what we would have used before the pandemic. It should not matter that we are a working class family, and do not require any benefits from the government... the only people benefitting from this pandemic is the Energy suppliers!",
