        "additional_details": "Most people throughout the United Kingdom receive numerous calls from criminals trying to either extract money directly from them or extract personal data that can be sold to other criminals. The prevalent method of operating this scam involves using a fake caller identification number. Blocking this number has little effect, because the criminals just fake a new number. In these circumstances the Telephone Preference Service is no help as the criminals are often not UK based and neither are they registered companies",
        "background": "Make it an offence to facilitate the use of false caller identification numbers. Mobile phone companies, landline providers and internet service providers all allow criminals to use fake caller identification numbers.",
