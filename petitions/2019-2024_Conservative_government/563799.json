        "additional_details": "Rugby union still has a reputation for creating barriers and inequality in the game. In the world today, we have seen what inequality and a lack of diversity is doing in sport and within communities. By allowing children of any background and community to be given a fairer pathway to become a professional player, it will not only make the sport more popular and open to all, but allow another vocation and further career opportunities to the public. It will also remove the stigma around the game",
        "background": "Increasing the vocation of rugby in all public schooling and creating an easier pathway to becoming professional without the need to be private schooled. Driving a more successful way of integrating children into the game to reducing exclusivity and creating a more diverse community in rugby union.",
