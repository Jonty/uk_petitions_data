        "additional_details": "It is unfair on smaller football clubs because they dream of playing a big club but do not make a lot of money if they draw them at home. They are not allowed to switch grounds so they can gain a bigger attendance. Replays give smaller clubs the opportunity to play the likes of Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal on their home grounds in front of massive crowds. Removing the chance of a replay removed some of the magic of the FA Cup.",
