        "action": "Re-Review and properly debate New Clause 4 and 17 as a part of the Trade Bill",
        "additional_details": "We the public deserve the right to fair representation in parliament at all stages including in trade deals.  By voting down new clause 4 we are removing the right to democracy in this country in favour of autocracy as essentially any government in power can do what they like without the scrutiny of the opposition. Not to mention voting no to clause 17 is an affront to all the hard work that the Front Line care workers have done during this pandemic",
        "background": "By voting down both New Clause 4 and 17 respectively, parliament have not only not protected the NHS from any talks during the Trade Bill (Clause 17) but have also ensured that any trade deal agreed does not get scrutinised by any parliamentary vote moving forward (Clause 4)",
