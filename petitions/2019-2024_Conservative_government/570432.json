        "additional_details": "Due to these high costs, people can not afford to train so I ask for the government to offer some kind of funding towards this training. Prices are similar to University prices, but they get funding? Why can't we?\r\n\r\nI'd like to see the government take action now, before there is not enough supply. \r\n\r\nThe government can offer this in a way similar to educational loans.  \r\n\r\nYou give us loans and that loan does not have to be paid back until the student has successfully found  a job in the cockpit.",
        "background": "Over the next decade, tens of thousands of pilots are going to be needed due to the growing passengers numbers each year. There is a lack of pilots and it's got to the point where demand is higher than supply. This is due to the high costs involved. About \u00a380,000.",
