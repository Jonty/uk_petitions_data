        "additional_details": "Racially motivated hate crimes towards ESEA people have risen by 300% since 2020. State institutions have inaccurately underestimated how detrimental this has been to our communities.\r\n\r\nThis has come at the cost of our safety, our sanity, and our lives. The lack of support in place to help ESEA victims during this dangerous time this unacceptable. We will not keep calm and carry on as if we are not hurt or as if we are not dying.\r\n\r\nIt is time to listen to survivors before more lives are lost.",
        "background": "The government must work with specialist grassroots organisations to create a cohesive plan for the protection of East and Southeast Asians in the UK. Effective solutions must be identified and implemented to tackle the rise in hate-crimes towards people of Asian ethnicity.",
