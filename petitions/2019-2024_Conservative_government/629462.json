        "action": "Legalise the production and recreational use of cannabis",
        "additional_details": "This is a topic that is on the minds of over 2.5 million cannabis users in the UK. Currently cannabis is illegally grown and distributed using vulnerable teens through a non regulated network. Hundreds of millions is spent on policing of products but with very little impact. It's time for the British government to join the rest of the western world such as the US, Canada and Germany and legalise the drug for the benefit of its population and economy.",
        "background": "Review the current policy on the use and production of cannabis products. Create over 10,000 jobs, raise hundreds of millions in tax to help finance the debt raised during the COVID 19 pandemic and give individuals the right of choice on how to medicate themselves.",
