Year 12s are struggling as it is having missed GCSES and now with first years at college the least you can do is provide us with something we will remember for the rest of our lives!! It\u2019s very unfair that we have been the only year to loose out on a prom and have no say in the matter.",

Hundreds of pounds spent on arrangements and outfits to just be thrown out the window! Majority not being able to get a refund or return anything which is simply not right.",
