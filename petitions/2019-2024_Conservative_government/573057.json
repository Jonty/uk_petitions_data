        "additional_details": "There are poor countries across the world who have no hope of being able to afford to buy Covid vaccines. By giving them the vaccines we can help to reduce global health poverty that the WHO has highlighted. Also by giving the vaccine to the country rather than money to buy the vaccine will ensure the money is spent in the way intended rather than being \"wasted\" on other things and hence reduce corruption. It would also support British businesses.",
