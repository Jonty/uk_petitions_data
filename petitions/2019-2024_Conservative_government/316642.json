        "additional_details": "Those helping most have been the least acknowledged and often most poorly paid members of our society. Their sacrifices in carrying on in the face of clear personal danger both to themselves and their families must not go unacknowledged. Once the danger has passed it would be too easy to put these efforts to the back of our national mind. We must not do so. The creation of a bank holiday in celebration of there courage and efforts would be a proper acknowledgement of all of them.",
        "background": "There are too many individual heroes, many  of whom have suffered themselves, to make  individual awards whether to nurses, doctors, cleaners care workers, shop workers, delivery drivers, police and fire services etc. A bank holiday in recognition of their efforts is a worthy tribute.",
