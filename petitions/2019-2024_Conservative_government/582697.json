        "additional_details": "I drive with a black box as I am a young driver I respect the speed limit. However, because 20mph is not the norm for most drivers; most young drivers get harassed, damage to their vehicles, etc. on the road. 25mph is the limit that I have found that other drivers can accept without pressuring me to go faster. This makes it safer for young drivers as other drivers will not dangerously overtake almost causing an accident.",
