            "details": "The government recognises concerns linked to anonymity online, which can sometimes be exploited by bad actors seeking to engage in harmful activity. However, restricting all users\u2019 right to anonymity, by introducing compulsory user verification for social media, could disproportionately impact users who rely on anonymity to protect their identity. These users include young people exploring their gender or sexual identity, whistleblowers, journalists\u2019 sources and victims of abuse. Introducing a new legal requirement, whereby only verified users can access social media, would force these users to disclose their identity and increase a risk of harm to their personal safety. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, users without ID, or users who are reliant on ID from family members, would experience a serious restriction of their online experience, freedom of expression and rights. Research from the Electoral Commission suggests that there are 3.5 million people in the UK who do not currently have access to a valid photo ID. \r\n\r\nThe online safety regulatory framework will have significant measures in place to tackle illegal and legal but harmful anonymous abuse. Services which host user-generated content or allow people to talk to others online will need to remove and limit the spread of illegal content, including criminal anonymous abuse. Major platforms will also need to set out clearly what legal anonymous content is acceptable on their platform and stick to it. The government will set out priority categories of legal but harmful material in secondary legislation. \r\n\r\nUsers will also be better able to report harmful content, and expect to receive an appropriate response from the company. This may include, for example, the removal of harmful content, or sanctions against offending users. Compliance with the online safety framework will be enforced by Ofcom, who will have a suite of powers to use against companies who fail to fulfil the duty of care. These include fines on companies - of up to \u00a318m or 10% of annual global turnover - and business disruption measures. The Online Safety Bill, which will give effect to the regulatory framework outlined in the full government response, will be ready this year.\r\n\r\nProtecting children is at the heart of our plans to transform the online experience for people in the UK and the strongest protections in this framework will be for children. All companies in scope will be required to assess whether children are likely to access their services, and if so, provide additional protections for them. They will be required to assess the nature and level of risk of their service specifically for children, identify and implement proportionate mitigations to protect children, and monitor these for effectiveness. We expect companies to use age assurance or age verification technologies to prevent children from accessing services which pose the highest risk of harm and to provide children with an age appropriate experience when using their service.\r\n\r\nThe police already have a range of legal powers to identify individuals who attempt to use anonymity to escape sanctions for online harms, where the activity is illegal. The government is also working with law enforcement to review whether the current powers are sufficient to tackle illegal anonymous abuse online. The outcome of that work will inform the government\u2019s future position in relation to illegal anonymous online abuse. \r\n\r\nThe Government has also asked the Law Commission to review existing legislation on abusive and harmful communications. The Law Commission has consulted on proposed reforms and a final report is expected in the summer. We will carefully consider using the online harms legislation to bring the Law Commission\u2019s final recommendations into law, where it is necessary and appropriate to do so.\r\n\r\nAnonymity underpins people\u2019s fundamental right to express themselves and access information online in a liberal democracy. Introducing a new legal requirement for user verification on social media would unfairly restrict this right and force vulnerable users to disclose their identity. The Online Safety legislation will address harmful anonymised activities online and introduce robust measures to improve the safety of all users online.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.

                "body": "Being anonymous online does not give anyone the right to abuse others. The Government\u2019s online harms legislation will address harmful online abuse, including when the perpetrator is anonymous.\nWe are taking steps through the online harms regulatory framework to address abuse and other harmful behaviour online, whether committed anonymously or not.\nIn December 2020, we published the full government response to the Online Harms White Paper consultation, which sets out new expectations on companies to keep their users safe online. Social media, websites, apps and other services which host user-generated content or allow people to talk to others online will need to remove and limit the spread of illegal abuse on their services, including illegal anonymous abuse and other illegal harmful content, such as terrorist material or child sexual abuse imagery.\nMajor platforms will also need to set out clearly what legal content is acceptable on their platform and stick to it. This will include stating whether they will tolerate abuse that doesn\u2019t meet a criminal threshold, whether anonymous or not.\nThe framework will deliver a higher level of protection for children online, with companies needing to protect children from inappropriate content and harmful activity. Companies will need to prove children are not accessing their service, or they will need to conduct a child safety risk assessment and provide safety measures for child users. These include protecting children from inappropriate and harmful content like pornography, and abusive behaviours behaviour such as trolling and pile-on abuse.\nCompanies will also have a duty to ensure they have effective and accessible reporting and redress mechanisms. These will need to allow users to report abuse, including anonymous abuse. Appropriate responses from the company might include removal of harmful content, sanctions against offending users, or changing processes and policies to better protect users. Users will also be able to report concerns to the regulator as part of its research and horizon-scanning activity.\nCompliance with the online harms framework will be enforced by Ofcom, who will have a suite of powers to use against companies who fail to fulfil the duty of care. These include fines on companies - of up to \u00a318m or 10% of annual global turnover - and business disruption measures. The Online Safety Bill, which will give effect to the regulatory framework outlined in the full government response, will be ready this year.\nWe are also considering the criminal law and its ability to deal with harmful communications online. The Government has asked the Law Commission to review existing legislation on abusive and harmful communications, including anonymous abuse. The Law Commission has consulted on proposed reforms and a final report is expected in the summer. We will carefully consider using the online harms legislation to bring the Law Commission\u2019s final recommendations into law, where it is necessary and appropriate to do so.\nThe police already have a range of legal powers to identify individuals who attempt to use anonymity to escape sanctions for online abuse, where the activity is illegal. Police reporting shows that in 2017/18, 96% of attempts by public authorities to identify the anonymous user of a social media account, email address or telephone, resulted in successful identification of the suspect of their investigation. The Investigatory Powers Act allows police to acquire communications data such as an email address and location of the device from which illegal anonymous abuse is sent and use it as evidence in court. The government is working with law enforcement to review whether the current powers are sufficient to tackle illegal anonymous abuse online. The outcome of that work will inform the government\u2019s future position in relation to illegal anonymous online abuse.\nIt is important to recognise the benefits of anonymity, as well as the challenges. Anonymity underpins people's fundamental right to express themselves and access information online in a liberal democracy. This is particularly important for those who sadly have reason to fear the consequences of speaking freely, such as young people exploring their gender or sexual identity, whistleblowers, journalists' sources, victims of abuse or modern slavery and political dissidents. A blanket ban on anonymity would wash away these important benefits and would be unlikely to stop online abuse.\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport\nThis response was given on 24 March 2021. The Petitions Committee then requested a revised response, that more directly addressed the request of the petition.\n",

This is the first stage of a Bill's passage through the House of Commons and takes place without debate. The Bill now has to go through other stages in Parliament before it becomes law. \nThe Bill aims to protect the safety of internet users. It proposes that social media companies and other platforms should be legally required to tackle illegal and harmful content and behaviour online. This includes online abuse.\nTo help address anonymous abuse, the Bill will require the largest social media platforms to give their users the option to verify their online identity and to block interactions with unverified users.\nRead the Government's press release:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-first-online-safety-laws-introduced-in-parliament\nTo coincide with the Bill's introduction, the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Nadine Dorries MP gave a written statement to the House of Commons.\nRead the Minister's statement:\nhttps://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2022-03-17/hcws691\nAbout the Bill\nThe Bill introduces new legal rules, which will apply to online platforms that allow users to post content or interact with each other. It will require platforms to remove illegal material and protect children from encountering harmful content. \nThe largest platforms, including the most popular social media websites, will also have to say whether they will remove or limit access to some types of content that is legal but harmful to adults. The Government will set out what types of content this will involve once the Bill has become law. It's likely that this will include online abuse.  \nOfcom will act as a new online safety regulator and will be able to fine these platforms if they do not meet their new obligations - for example, if they fail to remove abusive content where they have promised to do so.\nThe Bill also introduces new requirements on platforms to protect users\u2019 freedom of expression, and to give users the ability to appeal if content they have posted is removed without good reason.\nRead a factsheet about the Bill:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-bill-supporting-documents/online-safety-bill-factsheet\nPetitions Committee Chair response to Online Safety Bill\nThe Bill's introduction follows the publication in February of the Petitions Committee\u2019s report into Tackling Online Abuse. The Committee called on the Government to strengthen protections for social media users against online abuse.\nThe Chair of the Committee, Catherine McKinnell MP, has welcomed the Bill's publication but pointed to areas where it could still go further, in line with the Committee's recommendations in its report.\nRead the response from the Committee Chair:\nhttps://committees.parliament.uk/committee/326/petitions-committee/news/164923/chair-responds-to-publication-of-the-governments-online-safety-bill/\nNext steps\nA date for the Bill's Second Reading - a debate on the general principles of the Bill - will be announced in due course.\nYou can keep up to date with the Bill's progress and read a copy of the Bill here:\nhttps://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3137\nYou can find out more about how a Bill becomes law here:\nhttps://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/passage-bill/\n",
