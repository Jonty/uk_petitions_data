This, safeguard, could then prevent future harm from occurring.\r\n \r\nWe believe this could help stop many a criminal act from occurring, initially, rather than dealing with the consequences of such after the fact, as is, currently, the norm.",

Any person, convicted twice for violence or fraud should be added to the Prevention of Future Harm Register.",
