The most prevalent Covid symptoms are changing, so to identify infected persons accurately the advice to test needs to be guided by the most up to date and accurate symptom information available. The Government should ensure this is done by eg HAS UK (was Public Health England) as the guidance for testing is/has not been updated. Ref: Prof. Tim Spector of ZOE & Guys Hospital.",

NHS & Public are not updated of need to test if they have the current most prevalent symptoms which can be severely undermining control of viral spread",
