        "additional_details": "Children are the future. They are pure & innocent, and deserve nothing but love, happiness and a safe space. These evil predators rob them of this as such a young age, for some that is all they know. More often than not, children who are abused at a young age then go on to become sexual predators themselves, this is avoidable if we try all we can. Hundreds of thousands is spent each year, protecting predators as evil as this, giving them new lives, including new identities & homes. We need change.",
        "background": "There needs to be harsher sentencing and consequences for sexual predators, including pedophiles, rapists, etc. Firstly, to deter people from acting on their thoughts and seek help instead. Secondly, to ensure those who offend will not reoffend again.",
