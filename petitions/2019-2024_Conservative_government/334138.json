        "additional_details": "ADHD is a very misunderstood condition which is usually thought of by people and teachers as a disorder characterised by a boy who is loud, unable to sit still and behaves badly. Whilst this certainly can be indicative of ADHD this stereotype is negatively affecting those whose ADHD manifests in different ways, especially girls. Not being diagnosed or getting diagnosed late can lead to mental health problems, failing at school or work, substance abuse, and low self esteem amongst other issues.",
        "background": "Ensure teachers and other relevant people in education are made aware of and given information about ADHD in all its different manifestations (including how it can appear differently in girls), so that children with ADHD can be diagnosed and guided towards relevant support following diagnosis.",
