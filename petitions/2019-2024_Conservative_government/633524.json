        "additional_details": "It is well known and documented that we need to reduce our carbon footprint. However, going down the route of electric in the UK needs reassessed. \r\nThe current arguments for electric do not take into account the manufacturing, transporting, building, maintaining and disposing of infrastructure, equipment and battery disposal. \r\nThis is without beginning to consider the potential harm from the increased high voltage network that will be required to carry the electricity - medical research confirms",
        "background": "Electric is not the panacea - it relies on the earth\u2019s finite resources (e.g. lithium) and seriously impacts on the environment. Please stop, reassess and support the research and development into solutions that are not reliant on earth\u2019s finite resources & so negatively impactful on UK environment",
