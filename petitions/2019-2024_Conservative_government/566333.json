        "additional_details": "London is our capital city, a world city, & generates a large percentage of the UK\u2019s income. But the current administration appears to act in it\u2019s own interests before that of London. It spends vast amounts on PR & is intent on pushing radical policies rather than what benefits Londoners, whilst presiding over policies that damage the city, such as raising the congestion change & bringing TFL to the point of requiring numerous government bailouts. \r\n\r\nThe UK does not want its capital\u2019s monuments & statues removed nor its street names changed. We need an individual in charge that values London, its history, & will promote this great city.",
        "background": "Abolish the London Assembly & replace it with a Minister for London appointed by the Prime Minister. Consideration should also be given to returning London\u2019s boundaries to their pre 1963 positions & current outer London boroughs being returned to their respective counties.",
