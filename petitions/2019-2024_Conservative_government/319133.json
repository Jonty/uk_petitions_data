People these days are a lot more aware and do a lot more research. Due to this we know what is in these vaccines. If we decide we do not want to have someone inject ourselves and our children then we should most cerrainly have the right to decline. Not to mention, with regards to covid 19, these vaccines are being rushed. Civil unrest would be the outcome.",
        "background": "Please please please look at the overwhelming evidence thats out there as to what is being put into these vaccines. Parents should always have to right to decide what vaccines their child/children do or do not have. Nobody should EVER be forced by governments to have any medical treatment.",
