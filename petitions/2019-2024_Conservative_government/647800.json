        "action": "Do not change the NHS constitution to discriminate against trans patients",
        "additional_details": "There have been no complaints about trans or non-binary patients on men's or women's wards in NHS hospitals. Barclay is attempting to solve a problem which does not exist, instead of solving the multitude of issues which SHOULD be addressed in the NHS.\r\nSign this petition to tell the government to focus on issues which ACTUALLY exist in the NHS, such as staff pay and resolving industrial action, lack of funding and resources. This change will not address any of these pressing issues at all.",
        "background": "Steve Barclay plans to update the NHS constitution to ban trans and non-binary patients from wards appropriate to their gender identity, i.e. a trans patient identifying and presenting as male, would be treated on a female only ward. This would be a needless violation of trans rights in the UK.",
