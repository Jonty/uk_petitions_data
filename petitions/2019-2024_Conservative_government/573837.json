        "additional_details": "Houses are being broken into by armed people to take pedigree dog, puppies etc, assaults are now common in daylight  to take a pet from the owner, given that a pedigree dog is now worth more than drug dealing it has spread all over the country, the current classification no longer supports the level of violence and pet theft should now be placed in the higher classification  and the courts should take into account the level of violence and the mental and physical results of the offence",
        "background": "Theft of pets has rocketed as the price of animals has gone over the \u00a31200 mark for just an ordinary animal, and over \u00a33/4000 for more specialised  animals, gumtree and other papers accept adverts from anyone and a large majority of stolen dogs are sold on there which should also be illegal",
