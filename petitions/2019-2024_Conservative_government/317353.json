        "additional_details": "The government should do this because it will likely be harder to find employment after this crisis is over I want to make sure that those who did not take their exams, due to actions beyond their control, are not unfairly negatively impacted in their application for a job. e.g. an employer may hire a student who received 3 As at A-level in 2021 instead of a student who was awarded the grades in 2020 simply because the student who received the grade in 2020 did not take the exam. This is not fair",
        "background": "The government should update the equality act or separately legislate to protect students who were due to take their exams in 2020 (A-levels or GCSEs) so that it would be illegal to value their awarded grades differently to that of students who did sit their exams before or after 2020.",
