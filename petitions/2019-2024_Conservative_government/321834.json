        "additional_details": "The foreigner HCWs suffer a lot as they have extra expenses compared to local born citizens, e.g.  they have to travel to their respective countries at least once a year, buying or renting houses and house hold items all from scratch etc etc. They make lots of sacrifices while working in NHS as is evident during current pandemic. The ILR fee is beyond the affordability of HCWs. In recognition of their selfless service to UK public,  ILR fee should be scrapped completely.",
        "background": "Health care workers (HCW) who come from other countries have to pay ILR fee of \u00a32389 per head so for example a HCW has a spouse + 3 kids as dependants, the ILR fee will be \u00a311945 + extras, which is more than 3 to 5 months take home salary. In view of their services free ILR should be given to them.",
