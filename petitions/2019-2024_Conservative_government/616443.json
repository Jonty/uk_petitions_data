        "additional_details": "Mental health is becoming increasingly important and exams cause such stress that children and young adults become depressed, anxious. Teacher assessed grades were successful in the year of COVID-19 yet the government reverted back to exams, despite the backlash. Exams are unfair for those who have mental health conditions, those with poor living conditions and those who just \u201chave a bad day\u201d and their future plans are ruined. The concept is outdated and must change",
        "background": "Scrap the concept of exams and replace all of them with teacher assessed grades to reduce unfair advantages or disadvantages relating to mental health, class or unprepared for life changes.",
