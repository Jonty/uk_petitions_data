The current death benefit of \u00a3100,000 is not enough to compensate for such a loss. Increasing it to \u00a3200,000 would provide more financial security and acknowledge the sacrifice of those who serve our country. It's time for the government to step up and show support for our military families.",

I think that these families have suffered an unbearable loss, and the least that the Government should do is provide them with some financial stability.",
