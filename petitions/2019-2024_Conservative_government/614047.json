        "additional_details": "Channel 4 is an incredibly powerful force for good. It doesn't always get things right but, on the whole, it has had exactly the impact on this country it was created to achieve: Giving minorities a creative voice. Privatising it would damage its ability to take the creative risks it needs to in order to continue to represent diversity in the UK. It is one of the UK's great cultural assets.",
        "background": "The Government must immediately withdraw its plans to privatise Channel 4. It must remain a state-funded media organisation for the benefit of the UK's wider cultural output.",
