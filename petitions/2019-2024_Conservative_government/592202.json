        "additional_details": "Public toilets are disproportionately used by women. Pregnant women, menstruating women, women with young children and women who have given birth are the primary users of public toilets. \r\n\r\nMen do no use public toilets as often, as it is much easier for them to urinate out in public (like in a bush), without having to pay the fees to access public toilets. The practice of expecting the public to pay for toilets is inherently sexist and profits off women's natural body functions.",
        "background": "I am calling for councils across the country to eliminate the current payment required to access public toilets, by funding it themselves.",
