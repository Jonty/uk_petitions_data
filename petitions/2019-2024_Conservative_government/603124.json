We don\u2019t think it is enough that an offender goes on the sex offenders register and still gets to walk the streets, as they are still a danger to society and at any point might re offend. People that commit these offences should be removed from society as they are a danger and when they are on the register people have no idea who to be aware of, making it hard for people to protect themselves, or their children.",
