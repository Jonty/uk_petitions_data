        "additional_details": "Menstruation needs to be considered as different to sick leave for obvious reasons. Even in the most well-meaning of businesses, an extended sick leave, or regular sick leave can lead to inferior treatment on teams, and in some cases disciplinary action. In addition, not everyone feels comfortable detailing the reason for their absences. Ensuring a right to paid menstrual leave should help those employees feel more confident to take leave due to any adverse symptoms.",
        "background": "Introduce a law that requires companies to offer paid menstrual leave to their employees. This should be a minimum of a couple paid days off a month, so as not to have to work through potentially agonising conditions, and not to face having to give specifics to their manager/HR.",
