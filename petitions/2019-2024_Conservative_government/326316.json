        "additional_details": "In our current political and social climate it is clear that it is inappropriate to continue to ignore the abhorrent views of an individual who is celebrated by one of London\u2019s most famous landmark\u2019s, Trafalgar Square. Nelson was a racist and white supremacist who fought against the abolition of the slave trade in the 19th century, instead encouraging slavery and its atrocities to benefit himself and his associates. We should discuss this history in a more appropriate setting, not celebrate it.",
        "background": "Remove the statue of racist and white supremacist Horatio Nelson from Nelson\u2019s Column in Trafalgar Square, instead displaying it in context elsewhere. The statue should be replaced by a plaque that explains its removal on the grounds of its glorification of a racist.",
