        "additional_details": "The government need to completely axe and shelve any such proposal as this is not a free society and discrimination of any kind is completely unacceptable. The actual data does not reflect the need to create such a radical and authoritarian social credit based system and flies in the face of everything this country stands for and the freedoms many of our family members died for. If the government and Boris have any sense then they will stop this tyranny before it gets off the ground.",
        "background": "The Prime Minister has stated that in September 2021 the government plans to make double jab passports mandatory in order to go to nightclubs and other events. This will create a two tier society and will actively discriminate against people either for their personal choices or medical conditions.",
