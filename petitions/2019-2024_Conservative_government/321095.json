Home education packs have been provided but this does not advance a child's education and understanding of the world and subjects. When they go back to school in the future they could be in a situation where they will be catching up on the year 5 curriculum and being taught the year 6 curriculum as well. This is unfair on the teaching staff, children and parents. A precedent has been created this year in regards to tests.",
