Houses, kennels  and cars are being broken into and pets are being stolen. We need stricter tougher measures put in place regarding pet ownership.  People need to know if they buy online or from someone on the street, they are making it easier for thieves to sell these dogs they have stolen. Let's make it harder to buy a pet. Make pet theft a fruitless endeavor",

Certification of origin needs to be provided on purchase and checked by Vet and Insurance companies on registration of a new pet. Owners should be heavily fined if they cant prove this with possible removal of the pet if stolen.",
