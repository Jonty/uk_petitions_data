        "additional_details": "Pfizer\u2019s recommends its Covid19 vaccine is given as 2 doses 21-35 days apart. Although partial protection from the vaccine appears to begin as early as 12 days, Pfizer stresses that 2 doses are required to provide the maximum protection. Pfizer\u2019s study\u2009 was designed to evaluate the vaccine\u2019s safety and efficacy following a two-dose schedule, 21 days apart. No other dosing schedules have been evaluated. There is no data to demonstrate that protection after 1 dose is sustained after 21 days.",
        "background": "We want the U.K. Government & NHS England to vaccinate frontline workers and vulnerable people with an evidence based dosing regime as per Pfizer\u2019s vaccine schedule.\r\nWe want 94% protection from the Pfizer vaccine not 52% from one dose and an aspiration that half protection may better than none.",
