        "additional_details": "We face an epidemic of loneliness. Disconnected communities already cost the UK economy \u00a332 billion every year (Eden Project 2019).  Half a million older people already live in 'self isolation' (Age UK 2016). \r\n\r\nSocial distancing strategies - whilst necessary - will only worsen these trends. \r\n\r\nBetter connected communities are better able to recover from shocks, such as flooding or a virus outbreak. With climate breakdown these kind of shocks will become more common.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to invest at least 1% of the \u00a312bn Coronavirus budget package - \u00a3120 million - in measures to address the ongoing impacts of social distancing strategies in the aftermath of current emergency. \r\n\r\nThis is needed to fund investment in vital community spaces and services.",
