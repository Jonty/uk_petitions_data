        "action": "Adjust the school system so students can choose when they come into school.",
        "additional_details": "It would greatly improve students willingness to come to school and would likely create a better atmosphere, as a lot of students don't sleep very well, an extra hour in bed is just what they need. They would miss lessons, but schools could create a way around that by putting lessons like Physical Education and Drama into the first 2 lessons of the day, meaning students don't miss viable periods like Maths and English.",
        "background": "Adjusting the school system so it fits to this would increase students mental capacity and the issues they face with school. It would be a must they have to come into school (Unless ill) but up until 10am they have the option to enter whenever they deem necessary to themselves.",
