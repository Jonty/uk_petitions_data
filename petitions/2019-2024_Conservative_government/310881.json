        "additional_details": "During COVID-19 all non-essential works have been halted, people are required to stay home. The benefit of this is negated by the companies who are still forcing their tradesmen to attend work at busy building sites, some threatening workers with the risk of loss of employment for failure to attend work\r\nThis is continuing to put families at risk, trades people are using public transport, are unable to abide by 2 metre distancing precautions on site and are then coming home, allowing the spread.",
        "background": "Put a stop to all construction/building sites being allowed to continue to operate. Close down sites for a specific duration to halt the spread and the risk that this is continuing to pose to families and to the tradesmen and women being put in harm's way\r\nCompanies forcing work should be sanctioned",
