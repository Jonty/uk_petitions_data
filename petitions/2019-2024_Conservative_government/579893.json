        "additional_details": "Protest occurs when all other means of accountability and questioning fail; when institutions fail the public in such a way that protest is requires. It has been utilised in ways which have allowed for the society we live in today. It allows for the progression of society when the decisions of government or institutions fail or threaten us. It is a very, very basic human right and should not be restricted.",
        "background": "The anti-protest bill would be a massive violation of basic human rights. The right to protest, basic freedom of speech, freedom to dissent would be at threat. Without this, the public lack a fundamental element of holding the government and its decision accountable, expressing their opinion.",
