        "additional_details": "Fireworks are set off in gardens for about a two week period around the 5th of November.  This is extremely distressing for anyone who has pets or for veterans who suffer from PTSD.  If the use of fireworks is limited to specific nights only then people can make necessary preparations in order to mitigate the effects, however random fireworks over a two week period makes this impossible and impractical.  There are thousands of people in the UK who are affected by this issue.",
        "background": "In countries such as Germany, the Netherlands the use of fireworks by the public is restricted to specific dates and times.  This should be the case in the UK with public use restricted to the 5th November and 31st December only",
