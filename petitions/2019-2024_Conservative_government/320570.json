        "action": "Allow children to re-sit this academic year in school",
        "additional_details": "Ongoing Health & Safety issues mean there is little chance of schools returning to normality before September, which will mean pupil school absence could be almost 6 months.  Children are then supposed to enter the next academic year with huge gaps in their knowledge. This will be a disaster for many children but especially for those currently in their pre-exam year. 'Catch-up' is not an adequate policy to address this loss.  Children need the opportunity to re-sit this academic year in school.",
        "background": "We want school policy to change, in view of the huge disruption during this academic year, to allow children to re-sit this academic year. This is especially important for vulnerable children, those with EHCPs or those sitting major exams next year.",
