By ignoring the reality of British history and colonialism between the 15th and 20th centuries, the current history curriculum completely masks the problematic domination of people, knowledge and their land that occurred by the British, allowing systemic racism to be maintained through white privilege and ignorance.",
        "background": "The Government needs to make studying colonialism and the horrors of the British Empire a compulsory part of the history curriculum, both in primary school Key Stages 1 and 2, and in Key Stage 3 in order to give students an accurate representation of British history.",
