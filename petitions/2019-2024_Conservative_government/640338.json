        "action": "Adequate menstrual education in schools and period products in public restrooms",
        "additional_details": "Many students feel embarrassed about periods and asking for period products in school, as this issue is often not widely talked about. By providing mandatory education in schools, it would help to reduce the stigma surrounding this matter. Many public organisations also do not offer period products in restrooms. This is a form of inequality and discrimination as men and women should both have access to the sanitary products that they need, whether it be toilet paper or period products.",
        "background": "All schools should ensure students receive an adequate education surrounding periods and period poverty. Public organisations should also provide menstrual products in restrooms.",
