I was unable to take time off after the birth to assist her, as I would not have been paid for it. \r\n\r\nMany mothers and birthing partners are - and will be - in the same position as we were, and in an increasingly diverse and accepting world I feel we should be open to the fact that not all birthing partners are the spouse/partner for a number of possible factors.",

Including:\r\n\r\nTime off to attend antenatal appointmens; the right to ask for flexible work; paid leave for the duration of the birth and up to a week after.",
