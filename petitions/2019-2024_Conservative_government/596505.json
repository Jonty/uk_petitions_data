Your petition calls for an 8% rate of National Insurance across the board, but it's not clear if you want this to apply to people who earn under \u00a3184.01 a week, who currently pay no National Insurance, as this would mean that some people on lower incomes would pay more National Insurance than they do now.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nLimit National Insurance increases to high earners: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/596280"
