        "additional_details": "So many families have been split up for the last two years, so much missed time (personally, the birth of my child, now one, that my family still havw not met) and now we see travel to amber countries more doable for those double vaccinated by the NHS, but there are thousands of British citizens living abroad who are desperate to return home and are unable to quarantine but have had the same vaccinations offered by the NHS. We need the same vaccinated travel rules for all UK citizens.",
