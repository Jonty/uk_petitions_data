        "additional_details": "With the KCC (kent county council) it only covers the half price of the bus fare for people who live in Kent. People who live elsewhere need to pay extra for the bus since they don\u2019t live in the catchment area to buy this half priced card. I would like the Government or Parliament to do something about this because it should be equal for all children and their parents shouldn\u2019t have to pay extra for living in a different area. Things are difficult enough for parents, this cost makes it worse.",
        "background": "I would like for the GoCoach child bus prices to be lowered because \u00a33 for a child outside of Kent is ridiculous. You should not be paying to go to school when in London it\u2019s free. \u00a330 a week, \u00a3120 a month, \u00a31200 a school year. \u00a38,400 for the whole of secondary (including 6th form) is unreasonable.",
