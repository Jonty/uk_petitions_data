        "additional_details": "Gig economy workers cannot survive on benefits. The income wether full time or part time is crucial for survival and to prevent poverty, homelessness and hopelessness. Norway\u2019s solution-  If a person can prove their income on zero hours for the past 3 years, a payment of 80% is made to prevent complete loss of income. We need the UK to step up if this is to continue for months. Benefits offered so far will not cover mortgages and bills, for those who work hard to receive a decent income.",
        "background": "During the coronavirus crisis, Norway are paying their gig economy workers 80% of their monthly income of the past 3 years, after 17days of loss of income.  We in the gig economy need similar temporary income protection measures from the U.K. government to ensure we can survive this crisis.",
