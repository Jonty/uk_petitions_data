        "additional_details": "The definition of adultery within the 1973 Act is \u2018Voluntary sexual intercourse between a man and a woman who are not married to each other but one of whom is married to someone else\u2019. It follows therefore that adultery can only be grounds for divorce where there has been sexual intercourse between two people of the opposite sex, sexual intimacy between two people of the same sex is not \u201cadultery\u201d for the purposes of obtaining a divorce if one of those people is in a same sex marriage.",
        "background": "The Matrimonial Causes Act was made nearly fifty years ago during a time when perceptions on same sex marriages were very different. As such, only opposite sex marriages can use \u2018adultery\u2019 as a grounds for divorce. Change the definition of \u2018adultery\u2019 within the act to encompass same sex marriages.",
