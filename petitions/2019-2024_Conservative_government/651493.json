        "action": "Ban balloon releases, that harm and kill wildlife, and take decades to degrade.",
        "additional_details": "Balloon releases are commonly used for celebrations and commemorations. Unfortunately many of these end up in the sea, where dolphins, whales, turtles and seabirds are killed due to mistaking them as food or ingesting at the same time as they feed. On the land they pose a danger to livestock, with many animals injured or killed. They also persist in the environment for decades. Even though many balloons are technically biodegradable, the risk to animals from these is barely diminished.",
        "background": "Consider banning balloon releases. Dolphins, whales, turtles and seabirds are frequently killed, as are livestock and other animals. The balloons take decades to degrade, even current biodegradable balloons take years to break down and pose a significant risk to animals.",
