        "action": "Reverse the decision to charge EU and EEA students full tuition fees.",
        "additional_details": "A significant number of students are not in a financial position to potentially spend \u00a320,000 a year in tuition fees. This could cause many working families, who positively contribute to the governments budget to leave the UK to support their child\u2019s education. Moreover, the speed in which this decision is to be implemented does not provide sufficient time to allow families to forward plan how to finance this expense and whether they would still like their children to study at a UK university.",
        "background": "As a secondary school teacher in Brent, I see first-hand that this decision, including not making student finance available for EU and EEA students will be denying many of our students the opportunity to study at university.",
