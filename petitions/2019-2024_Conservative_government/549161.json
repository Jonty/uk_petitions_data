        "additional_details": "Every other year group has had a undisturbed GCSE/A-Level and the students who will do them in 2021 will have had 6 months plus of key content missed out on which leave us at a massive disadvantage then fellow students and affect our future massively. Some students won\u2019t be able to catch up as they may have learning difficulties and is unfair on those students. I believe to make it fair for us all is to remove the exams held in 2021.",
        "background": "We want the government to quite frankly remove GCSE\u2019s and A-Levels for students who will take them in 2021 as lack of content and time away from school of which key content will have been missed resulting us a disadvantage then other year groups",
