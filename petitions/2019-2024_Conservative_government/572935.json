They cannot even safely let their dog in their own back garden unattended. There is clearly no deterrent to these thieves and it appears they are becoming more brazen and extreme in their tactics and attacks. Britain is supposed to be a civilised country, not one that people are becoming afraid to walk the public highways in daylight.",
