        "additional_details": "I have not been able to move back into my halls of residence due to COVID 19, local lockdown and flatmates becoming ill with corona. I do not want to move back due to a risk of becoming ill and isolating in a small room which is detrimental to my mental health. Due to this, I have already been charged \u00a31400 for a room I haven\u2019t stepped foot in. This debt will increase to \u00a37k by the time I am finished with this year and I will have to pay every penny back in future for a service I did not use.",
        "background": "Use their power to encourage private landlords and university accommodation companies to refund students who have not been able to move in due to COVID 19. Rather than expecting these bodies to offer a refund themselves, as this will not happen.",
