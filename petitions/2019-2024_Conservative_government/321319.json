        "additional_details": "The covid-19 pandemic has proven to us all the value of key workers, millions of whom are non-British. These are the same people we have clapped for every Thursday. Should this harsh immigration bill be passed, not only would our government not have thanked them for their heroic work, they would not have learned from it. This country needs lower-skilled workers as much as any others. Who knows what other crisis might occur in the future? We must learn from this one.",
        "background": "Reconsider how strict this new system will be when millions of our key workers are migrants who never would have made it into the UK under the proposed criteria.",
