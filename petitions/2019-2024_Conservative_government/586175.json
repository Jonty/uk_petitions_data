        "additional_details": "Considering the huge amount of Israeli government expenditure on subsidizing settlement expansion and industry, their over-inflated military budget, it is not difficult to see how bond issuance aids the\r\noccupation. These organizations provide mortgages and building projects for settlements, support authorities and businesses directly promoting apartheid in Palestine.\r\nGovernment should inform customers of these services in the UK of their associations to allow them their explicit right to boycott",

Fulfill your legal obligations to this by not assisting their maintenance: ban business with Israeli settlements, fine and sanction these organizations",
