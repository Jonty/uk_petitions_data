        "additional_details": "The government has relaxed restrictions across the board, but weddings are lagging far behind, despite being worth \u00a310 billion a year to the UK economy (hitched.co.uk).\r\nWhy should weddings to be limited to 30 guests regardless of size of venue, when pubs/restaurants can define their own capacity based on the 1m+ rule? If health were really the driving factor, surely the guidance would be consistent - but as it stands, 1000s could enter stadiums, before 50 friends & family can attend a wedding.",
        "background": "We ask that the UK government bring guidance around weddings in line with the hospitality industry. Venues should be allowed to host ceremonies and receptions for as many guests as can safely attend, given the 1m+ rule, with no restrictions on the serving of food and drink.",
