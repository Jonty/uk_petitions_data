        "additional_details": "It is becoming more apparent that more and more kids are being diagnosed with such conditions, yet we are not educating our kids about it. All that happens is you struggle to get an ehcp, or a place in an additional needs school. Where we could educate more kids, so they are more understanding. If this us taught at an early age it could preventt bullying, and also social disturbances when kids are older. Our world is forever changing and the education side has not caught up.",
        "background": "I want the national school curriculum to be changed and for students of all ages to be taught about asd/adhd/ocd/odd and all other related additional needs. To be taught about how why and when their are differences and how to help and interact, and for additional needs kids to understand themselves",
