        "additional_details": "It is well known in the family court that bundles produced by the solicitor of the represented party, where the other party is a litigant in person, can be prepared in such a way as to not give a fair representation of the case. Paperwork is missing, evidence is not legible and the index is not agreed. Even though this fact is highlighted to the judge, the judge will often permit these bundles and the hearing goes ahead. This results in wrong, biased and mis-informed decisions being made.",
        "background": "Make law that both parties must sign a legal document before the hearing saying that they agree with the bundle.\r\nMake law that if hearing is adjourned due to bundle abuse, then costs of next hearing given to party that committed the abuse.",
