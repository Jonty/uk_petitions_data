        "additional_details": "Try forming an answer to a question whilst shouting out random words and your body jerks sudden random movements.  Tics can literally be anything. They can cause much disruption that it can be virtually impossible to put pen to paper\r\nSeizures, absent seizures can cause a type of brain fog that lingers making the thought process slow. They can be left feeling confused. People can suffer clusters throughout the exam and zone out for much of it.  None of the measures in place are adequate or fair.",
        "background": "Unfortunately, there is very little consideration for people who suffer these conditions when it comes to exams. The standard procedures put in place do very little to help.  Extra time, supervised breaks, a scribe, private rooms are of no help. Allow these people to be coursework based only.",
