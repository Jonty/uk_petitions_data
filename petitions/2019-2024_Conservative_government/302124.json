        "additional_details": "The Spread of coronavirus is of obvious concern. The habit of spitting is now prolific amongst the population. The containment of the spread of disease is of national importance.\r\nTherefore the habit of spitting should be stamped out.\r\nSportsmen and most notably professional footballers can be seen spitting all the time during the televised coverage of matches and . events. The managers even do it!\r\nI would like the government in partnership with the major sporting associations to ban/fine and restrict broadcast (maybe with a time delay as for swearing) of anyone who spits.\r\nIt is no wonder footballers in particular are now falling foul of the coronavirus.\r\nMy wife works in a primary school and spitting is now a major problem with the children emulating what they see happening on TV.",
        "background": "I want the Government to carry out a national campaign to ban and fine anyone who spits freely in the street or when exercising.",
