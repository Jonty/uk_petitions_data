        "action": "Launch a Government-backed insurance scheme to support UK festivals in 2021.",
        "additional_details": "The vast majority of UK festivals will vanish for good if they are unable to run for a second year. This would be a devastating loss for the British people, and for our culture. This situation can be avoided if you take action now.\r\nInsurance support has already been extended to other industries, for example with the Film and TV Production Restart Scheme. The German and Austrian governments have launched funds to cover event cancellation. The UK Festival Industry deserves this level of support.",
        "background": "British festival organisers have clearly stated that a lack of appropriate insurance is their biggest barrier to running in 2021. \r\nThe insurance market is not currently offering Covid-19 cover, therefore the government must provide indemnity for the UK festival sector as a matter of urgency.",
