        "additional_details": "Even though the Government have removed advice & guidance in relation to COVID-status certification since April 1st, NHS Digital & other public bodies continue to recruit based on future use of the domestic COVID-Pass. \r\n\r\nThis is not in line with 'Living with COVID' as set out by the Government. There has been an already overwhelming response against the use of Covid certification in Britain. The Government are not being clear about their retention of these public health surveillance measures.",
        "background": "We want the Government to completely abolish the domestic NHS COVID-Pass from the NHS app. It is no longer right or proportionate to retain these measures considering the majority of COVID restrictions are removed. Britain has a highly vaccinated population displaying antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.",
