        "additional_details": "Using a two-week timetabling system, pupils in Year 10 and above could feel much more prepared to sit their external exams in the coming years, whether it is this year or next year. Being a Year 12 pupil myself, I believe I would not benefit from being taught the majority of the first year of my A-levels online and having to catch up in the classroom next year. An ideal two-week system involves Years 11 and 13 coming in three days a week on week A and two on week B, swapping with Years 10 and 12.",
        "background": "For many secondary school pupils, COVID-19 has had a profound effect on their education, especially those taking exams this academic year and those starting their GCSE or A-level syllabus this year. The Government should introduce a system allowing all four exam years into school on different days.",
