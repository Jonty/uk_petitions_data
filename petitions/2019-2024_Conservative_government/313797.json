        "action": "End the excessive overreach of the Coronavirus response",
        "additional_details": "The original guidelines - keeping a 6-foot distance from others and regular hand washing - were being followed by the vast majority of the population. It's the case that some people were ignoring them but, and crucially here, they were a tiny part of the overall picture, and to penalise the vast majority for the relatively insignificant consequences of those minority actions is excessive. Please reformat the COVID19 response with the original guidelines only and an otherwise return to normality.",
        "background": "The excessive overreach of the Coronavirus lockdown has resulted effectively in closing the country for business, something that will have long-term consequences. It has also put draconian and legally-enforceable restrictions on the simple movement of people outside their places of residence.",
