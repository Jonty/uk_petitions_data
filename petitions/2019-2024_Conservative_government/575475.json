        "additional_details": "I\u2019ve suffered with asthma since the age of 8, Im now 30. And in the last 24 hours I\u2019ve just found out I am no longer a priority for a COVID vaccine. It wont be long before we [Asthma sufferers] are expected to return to the work place with no vaccine to offer additional protection. If we are a priority for a seasonal flu jab why are we no longer a priority for a vaccine against this deadly respiratory disease? Please help us from becoming the next top COVID Statistic and sign this petition.",
        "background": "I urge the UK Government to reconsider the priority for Asthma Sufferers to receive a Covid Vaccine to prevent unnecessary deaths or long term side effects such as \u201clong COVID\u201d for a large proportion of the population.",
