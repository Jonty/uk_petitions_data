        "action": "Stop issuing school fines to BOTH parents if parents are legally separated",
        "additional_details": "Many families experience absent parents, Domestic Violence & other complicated matters which prohibit communication between two separated parents. There are often Court Orders in place prohibiting communication from taking place.\r\n\r\nIt is unreasonable for a Local Authority to impose a Fixed Penalty Notice to two parents following an authorised absence from school.\r\n\r\nHeadteachers should not be allowed to instruct councils to fine BOTH parents when only one is responsible for the period of absence.",
        "background": "UK law currently allows Fixed Penalty Notices to be issued to both parents following an unauthorised absence, despite parents being estranged.\r\n\r\nThe law needs to be changed to protect the parent not responsible for an absence when it was beyond their control and often knowledge.",
