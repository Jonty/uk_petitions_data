We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nWe understand you're concerned the use of tests to help determine teacher-awarded grades may put students under additional pressure, but we're not sure what you want the Government to do about this. The decision on whether to use tests and the role they will play in informing teacher-awarded grades is an operational matter for individual schools.\r\n\r\nYou might like to sign the following petition:\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t allow the use of externally-set exams for 2021 grades\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/569280"
