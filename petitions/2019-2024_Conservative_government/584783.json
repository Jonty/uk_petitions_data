        "additional_details": "We believe by allowing the use of PLEV's such as electric scooters to be used on city bikes lane's and cycle routes will massively reduce the city's carbon footprint, the private hire schemes are all well and good but many people can't afford to hire them and do not cover the whole city, and as more private hire firms are winning contracts, we believe that this will end up with many being left in a dangerous manner like the ebikes discarded around all over the place.",
        "background": "We would like our Government and Parliament to reconsider the current legislation regarding the use of PLEV's ie: electric scooters on the city's bike lanes and cycling routes.",
