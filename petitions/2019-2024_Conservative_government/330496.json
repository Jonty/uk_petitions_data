        "additional_details": "It is so unfair. Some children have had issues such as grief or hospitalisation that may have affected their achievement. This means that their mock exam grades, classwork may not be at their same level. We were told we would be graded 'fairly' but what about the schools that don't inflate grades? There are also cases which universities will need more students, so why are you reducing grades when children need entry requirements? What about those who will just scrape a pass only to be reduced?",
        "background": "Stop reducing the GCSE and A-level results for 2020 qualifiers.\r\n\r\nIt is unfair that the government and exam boards want to reduce the grades of the 2020 GCSE and A-level students. We need our future education. We need our grades to be FAIR. But that has been taken away from us.",
