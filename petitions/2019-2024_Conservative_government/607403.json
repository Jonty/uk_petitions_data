        "additional_details": "Funding for disabled people in work has been drastically cut in recent years.  This means that they could be left with out support or have to wait longer.  Access To Work helps to provide funding which disabled people can use to pay for support, however on many occasions payments are missed and just topped up in one large amount.  Amounts should be paid on a regular basis and not just in one large amount. Claims should also take less time to process.",
