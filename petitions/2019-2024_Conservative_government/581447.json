        "additional_details": "Kenny MacAskill was elected Member of Parliament for East Lothian as the Scottish National Party's candidate in the 2019 General Election. Mr MacAskill won the seat for East Lothian under the SNP's party name, winning a total of 21,156 Scottish votes. As of the 27/03/21, Kenny MacAskill has switched political parties and is now the MP for East Lothian representing Alba Party views. The votes won in 2019 were not for the new Alba Party and he now does not represent his constituents. \r\n\r\nThis is not just a problem for East Lothian, it has wider ramifications for our precious Democracy.",
        "background": "What needs to be done:\r\nKenny MacAskill should resign as MP for East Lothian and a bi-election should be called.\r\nNew legislation should be put in place to stop elected officials changing party while in office.",
