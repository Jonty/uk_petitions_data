        "action": "Stop automatic removal of flooring from social housing for \"new\" council tenants",
        "additional_details": "Each year, thousands of tons of flooring are stripped from social housing when an old tenant leaves & a new tenant moves in. This doubtless costs new social housing tenants (often subject to financial difficulties by the nature of their need for social housing) thousands of pounds to insert new flooring and often leads to unnecessary debt + cost that would be better spent elsewhere. It would also be better for the environment by removing waste & helping insulate homes against cold.",
        "background": "Legislate a change to existing council / social housing policies so that the existing flooring / furnishing (eg carpets, linoleum, laminate floor etc) does not need to be ripped out by the old tenant / the council when a new tenant moves in, unless certain criteria is met (eg pets, 5+ yo furniture)",
