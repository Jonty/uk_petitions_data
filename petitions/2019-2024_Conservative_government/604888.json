Our baby cried night and day, for hours on end and whenever we reached out for medial help we was made to feel silly. One dr even told us \u2018unfortunately it\u2019s all part of being a parent, babies do cry\u2019.\r\nOur son was hospitalised before we was taken seriously and the battle didn\u2019t end there. \r\nI know of numerous families who have struggled to obtain help too. This needs to end.",
