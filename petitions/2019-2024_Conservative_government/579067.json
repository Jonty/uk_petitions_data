        "action": "Make it mandatory for all UK schools to teach pupils self defence.",
        "additional_details": "Children are much more vulnerable to assault than adults, and consequentially should be taught the skills to better defend themselves should the situation arise. These skills can also be transferred into adulthood, and may reduce instances of assault among adults. With 24% of 18-24 year olds claiming to have been sexually abused during childhood (NSPCC, 2014), it is clear that we must provide the country's children with the tools to help defend themselves.",
        "background": "The UK government should make lessons on self defence mandatory in all UK schools, for all pupils over the age of eight. Lessons should be physically engaging, and be tailored towards the pupils' age. Pupils should receive an annual refresh.",
