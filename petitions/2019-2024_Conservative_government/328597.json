        "additional_details": "In Yemen, 24 million people require urgent humanitarian assitance. Saudi Arabia has been accused of using the threat of starvation as 'an instrument of war.' \r\n\r\nThis is a UK issue: we have close bilateral relations with Saudi Arabia - the country that is leading military action against Yemen and is, according to the UN, responsible for the majority of civilian deaths. The UK must use its influence with Saudi Arabia to press them to adhere to the current ceasefire and ongoing peace talks.",
        "background": "Immediately cancel all arms export licenses and transfer of weapons which might be used in Yemen to commit serious violations of international humanitarian law.\r\nEnd all military assistance the UK is giving to Saudi Arabia and other coalition partners.",
