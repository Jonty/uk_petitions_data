        "additional_details": "During lockdown, students were put at a disadvantage for learning, mainly due to a lack in a classroom atmosphere which leads to students being less motivated to do classwork at home. Additionally, students would be more distracted in home environments as there aren't any guarantees of no distractions during the lesson.\r\nThis puts students at a particular disadvantage for their GCSE exams as there will have been content which they have missed out on. Lowering grade boundaries would be fair.",
