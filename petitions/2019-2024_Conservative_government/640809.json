        "additional_details": "With new houses being built across the UK, we're wasting valuable roof space. This could be adding to the national grid during the day when most people are at work. If the panels, cabling and meters etc were put in at construction stage, it would look neater, be easier and integrate better. As prices improve, battery systems could be added to the requirement or even increased size of panels. If housebuilders were buying in bulk, it would drive down costs and wouldn't add much to the house price.",
        "background": "The scheme must include a specific 'bedroom vs Kw', eg 2 bedroom = 3kw setup, 3 bedroom = 4kw, 4 bed = 5kw etc. As costs come down Battery systems could also be implemented.",
