The UK government claim to support that and the UK government denounced the US's decision to overturn Roe vs Wade so why then put women's rights at risk with this removal of key words in the Statement on freedom of religion or belief and gender equality. I don't want women's rights to be rolled back here. Also the UK government changed the wording after other countries had signed.",
