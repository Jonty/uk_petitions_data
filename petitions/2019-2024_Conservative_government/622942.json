        "additional_details": "Parents can find it extremely hard to get jobs that work around their children. Unless the job role is in a school (and even then the start times can be too early therefore not doable) there\u2019s nothing really suitable for parents to fit around school hours. If more businesses offered a 9:30/10am - 2:30pm/3pm mon - fri job shift then it would open up so many opportunities for parents who haven\u2019t got the luxury of having family who can mind their children.",
        "background": "I want it to be made compulsory that bigger businesses have to offer some job roles that have a shift time pattern that starts and ends between 9:30am and 3pm Monday to Friday. Not many businesses offer this and it would open up so many opportunities for parents to be able to work.",
