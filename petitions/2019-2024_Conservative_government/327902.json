The disrespect that is shown towards them is completely unethical and things have to change. Regressive action should not be allowed to further marginalise trans people in society.\r\nFor more info see: https://www.stonewall.org.uk/gender-recognition-act-gra-take-action-trans-equality\r\nOr PinkNews's (pinknews.co.uk) article dated 15th June 2020 on the matter.",

They should be respected and allowed to have their dignity instead of being repressed. Trans people are still people and they deserve to be treated as such.",
