The chances of someone under 40 getting seriously unwell from Covid is very small. Having a vaccine does not stop you getting Covid or stop transmission. If you are healthy and under 40, do you really need a vaccination? How about doing a kind act? Instead, do not take up your vaccination invitation. Donate your shot and save a vulnerable life. Make a difference.",
