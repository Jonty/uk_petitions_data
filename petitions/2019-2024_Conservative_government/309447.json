        "additional_details": "Firstly I think the 4 day weekend would be psychologically and emotionally beneficial to all those who have had to isolate themselves from friends and family, providing them with the opportunity to  reconnect. Also frontline staff would be celebrated for their contribution. Secondly all those businesses such as pubs and restaurants that have suffered economically would receive a boon from all the custom. Finally as a Government that seeks national unity, what better than a celebration for all?",
        "background": "Once the restrictions are lifted and it is safe to do so; I think it would be hugely beneficial to the country if a 4 day weekend was introduced as a national celebration once the threat of the virus has receded.",
