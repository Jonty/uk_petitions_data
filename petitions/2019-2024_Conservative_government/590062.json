        "additional_details": "Advisory advertising against driving a motor vehicle under the influence of any substance has been prevalent on television and radio as long as I can remember. \r\nWhile people may not set out with the intention to harm others, they cannot argue that they are more than aware of the potential consequences of taking charge of a motor vehicle under the influence. \r\nA long prison sentence is perhaps inappropriate but they should never again be entitled to the privilege of a driving licence.",
        "background": "I would like the minimum sentence guidelines to carry a lifetime driving ban for anyone who causes death or serious injury as a direct result of driving a motor vehicle under the influence of drink or drugs.",
