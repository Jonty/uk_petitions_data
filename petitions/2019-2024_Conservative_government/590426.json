        "action": "Remove pre-departure test requirements from countries with lower infection rates",
        "additional_details": "This would allow families to reconnect & people to take a well earned break without the hassle, cost & risks of testing positive abroad whilst providing a much needed boost for the travel industry. \r\n\r\nRemoving the pre-departure test requirement for double vaccinated travellers would reciprocate entry requirements of many popular EU destinations.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s difficult to understand why pre-departure testing was not required before the vaccines but now it is despite 60% of UK adults are fully vaccinated.",
        "background": "Entry from countries with lower infection rates than the UK should be exempt from pre-departure testing for double vaccinated travellers. \r\n\r\nThis would still ensure safe travel, recognise the success of vaccines, increase vaccine uptake & increase traveller confidence (boosting the economy).",
