        "additional_details": "It would be a better representative democracy if people could choose a no confidence vote until a candidate was acceptable, this is evidenced by UK Election Statistics: 1918-2019: A Century of Elections (2020), as of 2019, 32.7% of the UK did not vote in the general election, and over 100,000 ballots were spoilt. A no confidence vote would also be a better alternative to those that currently vote only because they do not wish for a running party leader to be given the premiership.",
        "background": "To give the people of the UK the option that no candidate on the electoral ballot is representing their convictions. A no confidence vote should extend to by-elections, local elections, and referendums.",
