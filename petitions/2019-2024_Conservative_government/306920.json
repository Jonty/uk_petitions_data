People can\u2019t earn a wage as premisises are shut and customers aren\u2019t letting us work due to being scared. Please support the 6 million of us that need the government to help as they are with the employed.  The government can take an average from people\u2019s tax returns to asses how much they should be paid. The trades keep Britain going. Help the trades keep going.",
