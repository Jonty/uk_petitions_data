This is not a true reflection of the situation & my husband is one of them. \r\n\r\nHe works 4 days a week with his employer post chemo for lymphoma. He'll see a loss of circa \u00a3300 a week as a result of this decision & others are in the same boat.\r\n\r\nThe Gov. is offering Grant's for furloughed workers. More should be done for the workers in the 1.5 million category.",
