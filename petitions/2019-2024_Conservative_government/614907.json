        "action": "Stop Kuwait's persecution and displacement of the Bidoon to the UK",
        "additional_details": "Thousands of the Bidoon people from Kuwait have sought and will be seeking asylum in the UK because Britain's ex protectorate continues denying them the right to nationality and abode in their homeland. The Bidoon's plight emerged under the sight of Britain's administration on Kuwait (e.g. Sir Richard Beaumont) who in 1960 expressed concerns about the \"inherent danger\" of Kuwait's restrictive Nationality Law but did nothing to stop it from creating a stateless people in their homeland.",
        "background": "The Government must urgently press on Kuwait to stop persecuting and displacing the stateless Bidoon to the United Kingdom. Kuwait is a very rich State, has the resources to allevate the Bidoon's plight, and must by no means keep passing the buck to the UK instead.",
