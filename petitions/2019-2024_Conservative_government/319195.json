        "action": "Drop the annual dogs on beaches ban due to covid-19",
        "additional_details": "The government is responsible for this ban and should consider that banning dogs on beaches may cause overcrowding elsewhere for example fields and parks that are still open to the public. As more people are exercising during lockdown we require more space to carry this out, including dog walks. Essentially dogs require a walk everyday especially larger dogs and for many people the closest area may well be a beach. The ban will encourage people to be out of the house for longer during lockdown.",
        "background": "The dogs on beaches ban should be dropped in 2020 due to covid-19. The ban is in place under the public space act to encourage holiday makers, sunbathers and family's ect. However this year no persons should be partaking in the latter, therefore the ban is irrelevant.",
