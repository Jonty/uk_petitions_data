        "action": "Exempt children under 12 from the Rule of Six in line with the devolved nations",
        "additional_details": "The Rule of Six currently prejudices families with children as it limits who they can see.  While there is the separate two households rule, this still limits families from being able to reunite causing them to have to choose between which family members their children can see. This is especially so for people from larger families.  If children are allowed to mix widely in schools with other children, they should be exempt from the Rule of Six to allow them to finally properly see their family.",
        "background": "As in the devolved nations, children under 12 should be exempt from the Rule of Six.  These children cannot be left alone or excluded from gatherings but the government has acknowledged their transmission risk is low therefore they should be exempt to allow them to benefit from seeing more family.",
