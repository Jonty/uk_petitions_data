        "action": "Start shariah compliant mortgages through high street banks.",
        "additional_details": "If high street banks offered shariah compliant mortgages, more Muslims would look to purchase a property to climb onto the housing ladder. This would solve the issues of people living in crowded or unsatisfactory conditions. Many are paying hundreds of pounds every month to rent. They could instead invest this money in their own home.",
        "background": "Many Muslims can\u2019t climb the housing ladder as banks offer interest based mortgages. In Islam paying/receiving interest is forbidden. People have to live with family or rent and find they\u2019re living in poor conditions. Few Islamic banks offer this service but need a large deposit many can\u2019t afford.",
