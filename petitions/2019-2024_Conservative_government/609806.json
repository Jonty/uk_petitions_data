        "additional_details": "While the UK Government has announced some visa concessions for Ukrainian citizens already in the UK and has temporarily waived application fees for those eligible under the Family Migration route, it has stopped accepting visa applications from Ukrainian citizens stuck in the country. Without a valid visa, Ukrainians will be barred from travelling to the UK. We must meet our duty to offer shelter to those fleeing war and must not allow the cost to be shouldered by countries less able to do so.",
        "background": "The Home Office must immediately waive all visa requirements for Ukrainians wishing to enter or remain in the UK. There is currently no legal route for Ukrainians fleeing war to seek safety in the UK. The Government should take this action to show unequivocal support for Ukrainian citizens.",
