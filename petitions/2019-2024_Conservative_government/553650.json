        "additional_details": "Coronavirus is beginning to threaten institutions as more and more students fall ill and are not in a condition to study. Although remote learning has proven to work, it is not as fulfilling as going into University every day and being able to work with lecturers and peers. It is evident that the experience provided in 2020/21 is not the same as years prior, so it should be the same with tuition fees.",
        "background": "Compensate student's reduced learning time by amending fees and for the ones who need it most, reimburse. Attending University in 2020/21 with the pandemic means 1 hour face to face interaction and last year on average students had 8.",
