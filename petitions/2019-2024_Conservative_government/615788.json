        "action": "Ban the advertisement of high cost debt - 15 percent plus base rate",
        "additional_details": "Through advertising, banks associate debt with happy outcomes. They use terms such as 'affordable finance', 'simple monthly payments' and suggest it is about 'control'.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn reality, debt is a loss of control and causes financial instability. It can lead to poverty, homelessness and family breakdown.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs a young man, I spent 12 years fighting banks in court to keep our family home - I don\u2019t want others to experience that pain.\r\n\r\nParliament should prevent the promotion of high interest debt.",
        "background": "We call on Parliament to pass a bill which blanket bans the media and physical advertising of high cost debt (incl. but not limited to loans, credit cards, store cards, buy now pay later schemes). Predatory financial companies see the cost of living crisis as an opportunity to sell unnecessary debt",
