        "additional_details": "Its 2021 and yet places still enforce gender stereotypes. Sexism, transphobia and homophobia are prevalent within the education system. Not allowing children to be themselves makes them unhappy and they will likely carry gender stereotypes into their lives later on. Boys can wear skirts, make up and have long hair and girls can wear trousers, have short hair etc. Its not a matter of uniformity but of discrimination.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, intersex, nonbinary and gnc people deserve the right to Express themselves freely within school.",
        "background": "Ban schools having the right to discriminate against students due to their gender. This is inclusive of uniform policies, hair styles and make up.",
