All others should be ordered to do the same. The proposed max interest rate on other borrowing should be backdated to March 1.",

Banks should be ordered to cancel interest rates on overdrafts and the maximum interest charged on any loan, debt or card should be limited to 1.0 per cent with immediate effect.",
