Future generations will look back in disbelief and wonder how we allowed the Palestinian suffering to continue for so long. A human tragedy unfolding right infront of our eyes. \r\nHistory has taught us to speak up and one cannot advocate for racial equality and condemn other injustices, yet choose to ignore this. We cannot pick and choose whose human rights matter more.",
