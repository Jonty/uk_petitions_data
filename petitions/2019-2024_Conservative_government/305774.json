        "action": "Pay health care students basic living wage when on placement.",
        "additional_details": "Student nurses, midwives and paramedics work on the front line for months on end alongside trained nurses, HCA's and others. Although we are supernumerary and don't carry out the same duties as nurses alone, we are a crucial part of the team, helping to care for patients with personal care, supporting them and their families emotionally while having our own health and financial implications. The country needs nurses, but no one wants to prove a free service to the NHS while risking their health.",
        "background": "I strongly believe student nurses, midwives and paramedics should be paid atleast a basic living wage while on placement working 37.5 hours a week. Due to the recent pandemic, this further increases the risk and stress we are put under that could affect our health and families. Enough is enough.",
