Showmen have the right to be treated equally, and the government should make an equal provision and not create a situation that such provision is withheld from them.\r\nThis doesn't mean that the state has to grant all a right to gain their living by work which they choose or accept, but if it does grant that right to some, it must not withhold it from others in a similar situation.",
        "background": "We believe that fairgrounds and circuses have not been supported by the government or given an equal opportunity to operate during 2020. Showmen are part of the Great British culture and should be recognised for the role they provide to families that visit their fairs and circuses annually.",
