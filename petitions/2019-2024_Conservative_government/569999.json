In difference with other key workers (but not taking away any importance from them) we've always been there since day 0 and will continue there until the end of this and beyond. Reviewing this we are very potential spreaders, think this, each colleague in a supermarket may deal with between 200-300 persons per day, facemask and social distancing isn't enough to keep us safe and working.",
