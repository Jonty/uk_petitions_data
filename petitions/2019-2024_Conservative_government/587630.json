        "additional_details": "2nd homes are making some villages and towns lose their soul and pricing out locals for housing. The Pandemic has rapidly changed people's habits, many more are buying 2nd homes. When people move to an area permanently they contribute through the work they do and their spending in the local economy. 2nd homes for individuals are empty a lot of the year, not beneficial. Also houses being bought for airbnbs take custom away from the local hotels, hospitality and locals are priced out of housing.",
        "background": "Legislation to limit the % of homes sold as second homes eg 1% (once 2nd home proportion in that village/town > eg 10%) and to end tax breaks for airbnb (furnished rentals) making them pay full rates of income tax. +2nd homes to pay double council tax and double stamp duty (buying + selling).",
