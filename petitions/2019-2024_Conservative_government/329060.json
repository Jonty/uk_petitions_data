        "additional_details": "The government launched a compensation scheme in April 2019 with an estimated budget of \u00a3200-\u00a3570 million, at 28th May only 60 victims (out of 1275 applications) had received payments totalling \u00a3362,997. Many waiting for payments are in very difficult financial situations. The difficulty in making a claim and the slowness in processing claims is not acceptable. \r\nThe Home Office is also putting obstacles in the way for people claiming compensation.",
        "background": "WE DEMAND:\r\n\r\n\u2022 all of the Windrush generation victimised by the government are paid a basic redress payment of \u00a330,000 now. Claims for additional losses can then be made on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\n\u2022 the policies that caused this scandal are reversed by the Home Secretary, Priti Patel.",
