Tried to get a quote for an early 2010s 1.3 litre Toyota that was known for being reliable and running well while doing good mileage. The lowest quote I received was for 9 thousand pounds which was almost 4 times as expensive as the car itself. This was inclusive of the fact that I had chose the cheapest cover and added both my parents as second drivers with over 25 years of driving experience each",
        "background": "We want the government to force insurance companies to give better and more reasonable quotes to younger and newly qualifying drivers, especially in places with worse reputation",
