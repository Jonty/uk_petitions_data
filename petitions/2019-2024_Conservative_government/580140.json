        "additional_details": "Legal deterrent sprays do not disable an attacker. They resemble the look of pepper spray as a preventative measure, and contain scents/dyes that aid in identifying the attacker after an offence has taken place. Rape alarms rely on there being someone else within earshot who can stop an attack.\r\n\r\nPepper spray on the other hand temporarily disables an attacker. It provides victims with a way to defend themselves and can potentially create an opportunity to escape.",
        "background": "Citizen possession of pepper spray is an offence under Section 5(1)(b) of the Firearms Act 1968. This petition asks for the legalisation of the possession and purchase of pepper spray for the purpose of self defence.",
