        "additional_details": "In lieu of what has recently happened with the European Super League disaster, I believe it is now time to revamp how the ownership in football works. Us as fans are at the very heart of football and without us it would cease to exist. \r\n\r\nYet we're powerless to monumental changes within our clubs. \r\n\r\nThere has been no better time to challenge this with football fans in spite of rivalries, united in a stand against the franchise-centric owners of our elite football clubs.",
        "background": "To introduce legislation that would use the philosophy that the Bundesliga's 50+1 Fan Ownership model uses.\r\n\r\nThis would allow us as fans to have a say in the clubs we dedicate our support too each week.\r\n\r\nWe would no longer feel powerless to decisions that challenge lifelong allegiances.",
