        "action": "Petition To Lower Legal Driving Age To 16 Nationwide",
        "additional_details": "Engine Displacement: Restrict vehicles driven by 16-year-olds to a maximum engine displacement of 1.6 litre. Smaller engines are generally less powerful and can help prevent excessive speed and risky driving behaviours.Young drivers should also have vehicles restricted to 130mph and less than 150bhp as it is easier to manoeuvre and less of a risk as it is a higher risk of fatality for a young driver to be operating a high power car. 16 Year Old Drivers should only be insured with telematics.",
        "background": "I am writing to express my strong support for lowering the legal driving age in the United Kingdom to 16 years old. This change would have numerous benefits for young drivers as a whole. I urge the government to consider this proposal but also consider strict regulations as shown below:",
