It's too easy for people to drop it, but maybe community service, or make it part of benefits system you have to do a week's litter pick.",
        "background": "It seems its too easy for people to just throw cans or food wrappers from cars, despite bins being made available, people have a mindset that its \"not my problem\" and that \"someone else will pick up\" perhaps a better car registration identity, or marking items with peoples details.",
