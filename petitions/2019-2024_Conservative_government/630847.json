        "additional_details": "Theft of cars by stealing car keys is on the rise in our area.  This is commonly done by breaking into houses and stealing the keys - often when victims are at home asleep.  This is an awful crime and leaves people traumatised and feeling unsafe knowing their home has been broken into - whether the car is taken or not.  Biometric or enhanced security is available on most electronic locks and phones now so why not on the second highest purchase for most people after their home?",
        "background": "Having being a victim of a break in for the purpose of stealing car keys we would like the government to enforce extra security on cars to prevent this type of car theft.  Including biometric security could be one way to do this as this is a common technology now in smartphones.",
