        "additional_details": "As is implied in the name, a \u2018Tuition Fee\u2019 is paid to our university to cover the cost of our tuition. Student debt has long been a crippling problem and it seems morally wrongful that we have to pay for full tuition when we will be absent and using pre-created Learning Packs. Without underestimating the time lecturers must have to put into \u2018Learning Pack\u2019 creation, we will eventually be left footing the massive bill of a full tuition experience when this is far from what we will receive.",
        "background": "I believe the Tuition Fee for the Third semester of 2019/2020 should be reduced as Covid-19 has meant we are unable to attend university. Scheduled to be paid at around the start of May, we will be absent for most if not all of the final semester so being asked to pay the full fee for it is unjust.",
