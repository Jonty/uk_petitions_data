        "additional_details": "Due to the new \u201crule of 6\u201d guidance/law, large families are suffering because they are now isolated from friends and family. If younger children have been excluded from this guidance in Scotland and Wales, then why not also in England? Excluding younger children from the restrictions would allow larger families to meet with friends and family, and so would greatly benefit their mental health and well-being and that of their loved ones too.",
        "background": "Change rule of 6 guidance in the UK to disregard children aged 12 and under as this is putting severe strain on larger families who are now isolated from their community.",
