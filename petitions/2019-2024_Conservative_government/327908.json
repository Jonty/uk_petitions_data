        "additional_details": "It is vital for the health & well-being of these key workers. Being unable to use this fund to pay staff up to 13th May has left thousands of carers & nurses that held care homes together throughout the peak of the covid crisis to survive on ssp. This is a fund that cannot be accessed for the workers that needed it the most whilst working through an extremely frightening time. Many staff have had to use holiday pay to survive whilst being off with covid related illnesses.",
        "background": "Guidelines in the infection control fund  for care homes state it cannot be used for costs before 13th May. However this means carers & nurses have relied on ssp only whilst fighting covid at it's peak in March & April. Please enable these key, frontline workers to access full pay for this period.",
