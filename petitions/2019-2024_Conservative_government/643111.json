(most time goes by in Christmas plus new year celebration)\r\nHere we proposing balancing of those holidays in such a way that both holidays can be best enjoyable ( including Travel which doesn't need to be bound to summer months and/or European countries)",
        "background": "A. Reduce Summer Holidays from 6 weeks to 3.5/4 Weeks\r\nB. Increase Winder Holidays from 2 weeks to 3.5/4 Weeks\r\nC. If Possible, Choose start date Region wise so whole country doesn't start/finish holidays on same day\r\nParenting has greatly evolved through many generations so why not school Holidays?",
