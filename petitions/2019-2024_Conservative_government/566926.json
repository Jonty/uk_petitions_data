        "additional_details": "Due to lockdown, all students will not get their appropriate grades. During homeschooling, work given through emails has not helped year 11 as it was sheets based on new topics that have not been explained. Not much help was provided and When pupils ask for help, teachers are failing to respond. Therefore pupils should be given their predicted grades to show their abilities that could have been shown if schools educated us better in the months we were unable to attend school.",
        "background": "The class of 2020 had a month from school and given predicted grades,whereas the class of 2021 has months of learning lost.Many have been isolating and we have had firebreak lockdowns so couldn't attend school and meaning that grades have fallen more and many of pupils mental health have dropped.",
