        "additional_details": "Our public representatives must abide by the standards of laws they are seeking to make.  \r\n\r\nRegulations prohibiting sex offenders standing for council positions should be extended to MPs. This omission protects those convicted of sexual offences (98% male) from meaningful consequences to their actions, shifting the focus to protecting the (mainly female) victims.\r\n\r\nAny serving MP convicted of sexual offences would be immediately ineligible to hold that position, triggering a By Election.",
        "background": "There are no laws stopping sex offenders becoming MPs.\r\nBankrupt candidates CAN NOT stand, however, sex offender candidates CAN! Accountability of sexual violence is more urgent than financial barring. UK Rape is effectively de-criminalised with only 1.5% of reported rapes resulting in conviction.",
