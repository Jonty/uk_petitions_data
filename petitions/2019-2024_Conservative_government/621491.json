        "additional_details": "Although it is illegal to drive in the middle lane every school holiday people come out in their droves and sit in the middle lane. There is a law already in place however it is not being policed at all and I think it may boil down to lack of training when it comes to driving on the motorway. Introducing a test so that people with NO prior experience of driving on a motorway have to learn before using it seems to be a sensible solution.",
