        "additional_details": "The UK is a parliamentary democracy & MPs are representatives of all constituents, not merely delegates of those they agree with. It\u2019s apparent more MPs of all parties are choosing only to engage with select people online - blocking views or questions they don't want to hear, and turning their official online accounts into echo chambers. Abusive behaviour should always be excluded, but MP's surgeries do not discriminate according to conversation or question \u2013 nor should their online channels.",
        "background": "MPs who use social media channels (Twitter, FB, etc.) in an official political or governmntal capacity should not be able to block users - selectively or arbitrarily - based on opinions, views or questions they find objectionable or inconvenient.",
