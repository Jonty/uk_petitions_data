        "additional_details": "If the general public were aware of the implications of the action proposed under the Internal Market Bill, they would not sanction it.  The government knows this well enough.  The government are public servants, the representatives of the people.  So, represent us - give us food, medication, materials with which to take our country forward, not starve us of resources.",
        "background": "Desist from any immoral or illegal action which will endanger the Good Friday Agreement. Unless and until this is done, the UK will be committing an act of extreme self-harm - we are not self-sufficient in food or medicine, and such an immoral act will preclude us from any deal with the EU and US.",
