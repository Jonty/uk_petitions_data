        "additional_details": "The Sunday Times called the Lin. Gospels 'The book that made Britain', St. Cuthbert's Gospel is equally amazing, beautiful, and old. They ultimately should be appreciated by all the peoples of Britain, however to be fully appreciated they should be returned to the North East, from which they were historically stolen during the 1500s. Scotland, and all the peoples of Scotland, received the Stone of Scone back in 1996, 700 years after its theft in 1296. This is the only way to heal our Isles.",
        "background": "We want the British Library to, not just temporarily, but fully return the Lindisfarne Gospels & St. Cuthbert Gospel to an institution in the North East of England, and wish for Parliament or Gov to facilitate this happening.",
