        "action": "Make it illegal to breed, import, sell or provide dogs for vivisection.",
        "additional_details": "Dogs are \"specially protected\" when being experimented upon; however, they are not protected from having tubes stuck into their bodies while toxic chemicals are pumped into them to measure the effects on their various internal organs. The vast majority of dogs used in this way, both worldwide and in British laboratories, are beagles and breeding them for toxicity tests is very lucrative. One company alone breeds 2,000 beagle pups a year and distributes them throughout the UK. It must stop.",
        "background": "There is evidence that results of animal testing are unreliable for humans and opponents want an inquiry by independent experts. Some say it is simply cruel. The Great Apes have been exempted since 1986. We think dogs should also be exempted and should not be bred especially for this purpose.",
