Find out more about this here: https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-credits\r\n\r\nWe have also published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nIncrease Carer's Allowance to equal 35 hours at the National Living Wage: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/599102\r\n\r\nIf there are specific changes you want the Government to make to the rights or entitlements of unpaid workers, you could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
