        "additional_details": "In 2016, by very small majority, the UK voted to 'leave the EU'.  The EU has existed since 1993 and the UK had a previous relationship with the EEC that does not fall under our EU membership.  Other non-EU nations enjoy similar relationships now without membership so 'leave the EU' cannot mean to completely end our pre-existing agreements with the EU states.  To do so has been predicted to be economically disastrous, so we must not take that unmandated step. We should aim for an EEC level deal.",
        "background": "The 2016 ref ballot did not refer to leaving Single Market or Customs Union.  We were part of these or their equivalent prior to EU membership so leaving them should not be part of any post Leave arrangement.  UK Gov has no mandate to spoil relationship with EU or destroy our economy in a bad deal",
