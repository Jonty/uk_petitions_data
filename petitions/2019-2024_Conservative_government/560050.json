        "additional_details": "I have been robbed/approached by people with intention to rob me at a bus stop multiple times now. On Saturday the 7th of November , my phone was stolen from me (at a bus stop )and I was coerced to pay \u00a3250 to the person robbing me in return for my phone. I strongly believe that if Cameras were in place at certain bus stops - we would see a decrease in events like this. I am sure there are many people in London who have been in similar situations as me. So please sign this petition to encourage change",
