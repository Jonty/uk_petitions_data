Help us fight appropriately, so each & every individual can be versed in what to look out for and know how best to respond. There's so much confusion created by misinformation & if symptoms were displayed fully, it could not only prevent transmission, prevent Long-Covid but ultimately save lives. This needs to include reinfection risks & symptom information of new #B1351 variant.",

In order to limit transmission & to keep eachother safe, we need a thorough breakdown of symptoms to be displayed on NHS sites & all professional bodies. To be forewarned is forearmed.",
