        "additional_details": "The visa fees have already been increased, making the process of moving to the UK cost over \u00a310,000 over five years. Legal migrants are already contributing to the NHS through the taxes we all pay, yet they are also required to pay an additional \u00a33,000+ as an NHS surcharge.\r\n\r\nThese draconian changes not only affect families that are planning to move to the UK, but also affect working people who have been living here for years and need to renew their visas. \r\n\r\nPlease reconsider.",
        "background": "Doubling the family visa requirement, from \u00a318,600 to \u00a338,700 will tear families apart, forcing parents to separate and grow their children overseas as single parents. These families have already worked very hard to pay into the system that is currently punishing them for choosing to live in the UK.",
