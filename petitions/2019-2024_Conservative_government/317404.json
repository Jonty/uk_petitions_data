        "action": "Encourage UK supermarkets to use less plastic in their packaging.",
        "additional_details": "We would like you to do this as packaging has been found to be one of the main sources of sea pollution. A truckload of plastic is released into the ocean every minute and supermarkets produce approximately 800,000 tons every year. It is estimated that over 100 million marine animals are killed each year by plastic waste. Help us change this devastating number.",
        "background": "We would like the government to promote a limitation of plastic and an elimination of non-recyclable plastic in UK supermarkets\u2019 packaging. Supermarkets have many products unnecessarily wrapped in plastic. The proposed change would reduce plastic pollution in our oceans.",
