        "additional_details": "As someone who\u2019s struggled with anorexia in the past, counting calories is a slippery slope. 91% of diets fail, so instead of perceiving this as the change we need, would it not be better to target healthy eating rather than embedding the idea that calories are the be all and end all of food? \r\n\r\nOne big step in my recovery was deleting calorie counting apps. I know this is the same for many others. Please don\u2019t ruin our hard work by throwing numbers at us that we\u2019ve tried so hard to avoid.",
        "background": "It was outlined in the Queen\u2019s Speech that, in order to tackle obesity, restaurants, cafes and pubs with 250 employees or more will have to include calorie counts on their menus. While seemingly logical, it can be extremely damaging to someone who is suffering or recovering from an eating disorder.",
