        "action": "Bring forward British Summertime to February 28th 2021",
        "additional_details": "Transferring an hour of daylight from the morning to the evening will make better use of this free commodity.  After such an horrendous year bringing forward the clock change to the end of February will enable us to make better use of daylight. This will also help boost the hard hit tourism and hospitality industries.  More light in the evenings could also reduce energy bills and help towards reducing the UK carbon footprint.\r\n\r\nIf this proposal is implemented it could also confirm the viability of permanent British Summer Time.",
        "background": "To raise the morale of the UK bringing forward British Summer Time would give us more light in the evenings.  It would encourage more of the population into outside spaces. This would also help those with mental health issues reducing the length of the longer dark evenings.",
