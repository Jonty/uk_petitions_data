        "action": "Abolish Unpaid Internships in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Working unpaid just to receive experience encourages the wealth gap in this country. Those who\u2019s parents can facilitate rent payment, bills, food, travel expenses can afford to work for free thus putting them ahead on the career ladder, above those of equal talent who have worked equally hard, who simply cannot survive working for FREE. This needs to change. In a first world country such as this paying minimum wage for interns should be a normality and a right. We implore you to act on this.",
        "background": "Majority of job opportunities require experience in a similar field, sometimes of 2 years+. Most often UNPAID. This severely halts those who can\u2019t afford to work unpaid just obtain experience to even apply for their chosen career. Increasing opportunities for the wealthy who already have it better.",
