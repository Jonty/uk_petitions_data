        "additional_details": "Some industries can recover very quickly from the Lock down. Other industries such as events and theater will take longer to recover. It would be catastrophic for these industries and companies if they are taken off of Furlough without a ample amount of time to recover. This is one example, there are many more industries that are endangered due to the lock down.",
        "background": "Right now the Furlough scheme is a blanket policy that affects all workers without considering what industry they work in. I believe that the Furlough scheme should be staggered for industries that will take longer to recover.",
