The coronavirus vaccination has not been mandatory for parliament members, or other sectors and this will have a huge impact on the health care industry-  an already understaffed, low paid and under qualified industry. The proposal suggests vaccination helps keeps vulnerable people safe, but doesn\u2019t include visitors and the public. Continuing with this will leave the vulnerable neglected of their needs, not protecting them.",
