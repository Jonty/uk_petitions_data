In reality, a care worker with 2 children would pay at least \u00a3900 just for Covid testing when visiting their family in Europe. This is a lot of money,considering many care workers make \u00a38.72 /8.91 per hour. This does not include financial loss due to quarantine or travel expenses.\r\nIt is vital for people's mental health to see their loved ones in person.",
