        "additional_details": "Children are frequently given extra tuition, adding to an already demanding curriculum. They are told that these tests will dictate their whole future. They are put under a great deal of stress.\r\n\r\nThe government\u2019s own Education Committee noted that the \u201chigh stakes system can lead to a narrowing of the curriculum and 'teaching to the test', as well as affecting teacher and pupil wellbeing.\u201d The committee called for major changes to the way the SATs results are reported.",
        "background": "Year 6 SATs should be scrapped or completely overhauled to cut the link to league tables.\r\n\r\nSchools are ranked based on Year 6 SATs results. This puts pressure on schools, teachers, and pupils. It is harming our children's mental health and the system must be fundamentally changed to stop that.",
