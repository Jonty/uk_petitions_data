        "additional_details": "Establishing a day to honour these unsung heroes will inspire religious leaders to continue to do good works. \r\n\r\nIt will encourage communities to think of ways to appreciate the work that religious leaders do all year and it will only lead to more good works in our local communities.\r\n\r\nWe see this impact in other countries like the United States, where they have an annual day established to appreciate religious leaders.",
        "background": "As a religious leader with friends who are also religious leaders, the coronavirus pandemic has amplified and opened my eyes to the great work that religious leaders do in our society. \r\n\r\nReligious leaders continue to stand by communities through pastoral care and champion various local projects.",
