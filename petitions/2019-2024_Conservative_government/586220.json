        "additional_details": "I have noticed recently that there is not national holiday for Eid, despite Muslims making up 5% of the UK population. This does not directly affect me, however I have had to watch many of my peers come into school on what is arguably the most important day of the year for them. This is an issue that needs to be addressed, particularly with people having 2 weeks off of school for Christmas. Should different religions not be considered equally in 2021?",
        "background": "It has become apparent to me recently that Muslim individuals do not get any time off of school or work to celebrate Eid. This is something that seems entirely unethical and needs to change. Religious celebrations should be considered equally important in 2021.",
