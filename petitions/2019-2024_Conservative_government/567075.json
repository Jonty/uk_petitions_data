        "additional_details": "It is unfair to expect the same work standard let alone the same tuition fees for such a disruptive year. How can you expext us to pay \u00a39,250 a year for online videos. University students have been neglected and blame has been shifted on to them throughout this pandemic, not to mention the effects on their mental health. We are now asking you to reduce the tuition fees until online teaching ends.",
        "background": "With the new lockdown being announced it means for most university students teaching will now be/ continue to be online. The Government should give all university students a reduction in tuition fees as online teaching is not worth \u00a39,250 a year.",
