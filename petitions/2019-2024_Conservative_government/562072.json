        "additional_details": "I believe the government should give people the chance because it is not everyone\u2019s fault that they couldn\u2019t take there driving lessons or tests during lockdown, during the year 2020 and possibly 2021. Leading people\u2019s money go to waste and time which is unfair. It would be greatful for those people whose theory tests were/are expiring in the years 2020/21 as this has been a very hard year, giving a lot of negative impact to people\u2019s lives that we have no control of.",
