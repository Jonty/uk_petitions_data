        "additional_details": "It is absolutely disgusting that the government and DVLA think it's acceptable to charge owners of vehicles, that are valued at or more than \u00a340,000 from new; an extra \u00a3360 per year more than everyone else on the road to tax their vehicles. What right do you have to charge them more? Newer cars are more fuel efficient and much less harmful to the planet then older cars so why are we being penalised for working hard and owning a nice car? Utterly Despicable.",
        "background": "Cancel and completely abolish the extra yearly road tax charges to owners of vehicles, who's buck price from new is \u00a340,000 or more.",
