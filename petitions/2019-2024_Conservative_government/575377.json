        "additional_details": "On 15/2/21 the Government stated that people whose asthma is under control will not be prioritised for the Covid vaccine. \r\nThis policy applies regardless of a person qualifying for the annual flu vaccination and being at higher risk of catching Covid-19 and \"long-Covid\".\r\nEven with mild conditions, Asthmatics remain at higher risk of catching Covid-19 than non-asthmatics. They should therefore be prioritised for the vaccine.",
        "background": "As supported by Asthma UK, the government should consider that Asthmatic's with moderate to mild conditions are still prioritised for the Covid-19 vaccination before people with no underlying health conditions.",
