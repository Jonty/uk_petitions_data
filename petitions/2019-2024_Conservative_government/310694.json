Be they wagon drivers, emergency services, grocery store employees, post workers, utility employees: without them everything stops.\r\nTheir jobs should be placed into a sector where they are classed as Key Occupations and there should be a series of extra benefits to these positions. An increased minimum wage, for example. Discounted road and council tax. Job protection. A thought-out range of benefits to keep these people working.",
