        "additional_details": "A typical diesel powered delivery van has a payload of 1750 kgs, where as the same van with an electric powertrain has a payload of circa 600 kgs. These big vans will easily be overloaded by drivers creating road risks\r\n\r\nThis change would allow the industry 2 years to upgrade for sites that chose to do so and would not create a burden on the already stretched HGV testing availability, whilst maintaining work for garages currently catering for class 7 vehicles",
        "background": "Class 7 testing should be increased from 3500 kgs to 5000 kgs as electric vans are heavier. The 5000 kg limit is common in EU countries and easily catered for by existing network of Class 7 mot bays.",
