        "additional_details": "Allowing banks such as Lloyds to tie up such a large number of houses fundamentally harms the UK public by dramatically increasing demand on housing, as well as undermining the government Lifetime ISA scheme which was set out to empower people to buy their own homes despite soaring property prices.\r\n\r\nInaction here by the UK government will further empower banks to monopolise the public's ability to try to own their own homes, and must be prevented in the interest of the people.",
        "background": "The UK government should step in to limit the ability of the banks to act as a housing provider.\r\n\r\nLloyds Bank recently announced a plan to purchase 50,000 homes to become one of, if not the, largest landlord in the country, ultimately choking the limited supply of houses available to the public.",
