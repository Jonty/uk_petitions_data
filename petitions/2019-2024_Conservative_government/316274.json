        "additional_details": "Millions of us are losing huge chunks of our income during Coronavirus lockdown, and many people are losing their jobs entirely. The government support package simply isn't enough to keep families going. Universal Credit amount of \u00a394 a week is not enough to pay rent and bills. The temporary payments offered exclude millions of people - if you're recently self-employed, if you've been on maternity leave, on a zero-hours contract or lost your job...\r\n\r\nSo many of us are falling through the cracks.",
        "background": "The government urgently needs to provide an emergency, universal basic income: a straightforward monthly payment that supports us with basic essentials. No complicated criteria or massive delays. Spain has already agreed to introduce universal basic income - now it's time for the UK to step up.",
