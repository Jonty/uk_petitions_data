For a democratic society to trust the governors and law makers of their land, we have to have a fair, just and transparent system for all. No person should be above the law and no police officer should use their political bias to protect a governmental minister from prosecution in the face of evidenced criminal activity.",

If a breach has taken place, Boris Johnson and the organisers must be prosecuted or all other Covid related convictions should be overturned by parliamentary decree now.",
