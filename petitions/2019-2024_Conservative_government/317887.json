        "additional_details": "The exercise showed the NHS was unprepared for future pandemic. Additionally, UK Government chose to ignore advice from WHO regarding timely testing of NHS & healthcare workers, & UK population, downgraded PPE due to shortages caused by its failure to stockpile/replenish stocks, failed to utilise all existing UK channels of PPE manufacturing and distribution. The 'just in time' channels for NHS delivery failed. Government action was far too late, subsequently costing tens of thousands of lives!",
        "background": "The UK government had 4 years and 3 months notice of the need to stockpile PPE equipment & ventilators in order to ensure the NHS/Healthcare services would be prepared for the next pandemic. It ignored both a 2015 report from its independent advisers and the conclusions of a 2016 pandemic exercise.",
