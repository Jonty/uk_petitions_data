Addiction should be treated as a mental health issue and more funding and support from the government is required to create a better future for addicts and their loved ones alongside preventing young people from becoming addicts in the future.",
        "background": "Educate the public to stop the damaging stigma of addicts being criminals and instead treat addiction as a mental health issue. This can be done by improving education on addiction in schools and to the general public as well as decriminalising possession and using that funding for rehabilitation.",
