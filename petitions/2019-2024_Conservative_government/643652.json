        "additional_details": "BSL prevents rescues from rehoming dogs believed to be of type,  despite them making suitable pets in the right home. These dogs are condemned to death. Adding more breeds only causes more stress to vets and rescues involved with euthanising the dogs and brings heartbreak to still more owners. \r\n\r\nIf dog attacks are to be prevented DDA must be reformed and effective legislation put in its place. No more breeds should be added to flawed legislation that clearly does not achieve its original aim.",
        "background": "The DDA will fail to protect the public from dog attacks until it tackles the real problem of unscrupulous breeders selling to bad owners who train their dogs to be aggressive and intimidating. Adding more dogs to BSL will result in more non-aggressive, friendly dogs being seized on looks alone.",
