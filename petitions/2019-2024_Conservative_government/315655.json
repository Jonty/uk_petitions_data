        "additional_details": "After seeing millions of people Clap for Carers on Thursday evenings, it struck me that there is a powerful movement in the country to do more for our NHS and Social Care workers. Also, at a recent press conference, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was asked what the level of \"recognition\" would be for all carers, after the Pandemic crisis is over. Rather than an public gesture of appreciation, let's award decent levels of pay for the people that care for us most and enshrine this sentiment in law",
