        "additional_details": "The removal of murals depicting cartoon characters from the walls of the Kent Intake Unit for unaccompanied children is an affront to decency in all respects.  The removal of welcoming pictures can only make the process of arriving in a foreign country without one's family a harsher experience.  I would like a message to be sent to this government and to Robert Jenrick in particular that Britain is a welcoming country, and that it is sensitive to the needs fo minors.",
        "background": "The government should order the immediate re-establishment of colourful murals depicting cartoon characters on the walls of all centres for Unaccompanied Children asylum seekers.  It should ensure that any environment for children is tailored to the tastes and needs of children.",
