        "action": "Change the legal definition of rape as stated by the 2003 Sexual Offences Act",
        "additional_details": "The current rape definition completely disregards the enormity of the psychological and physical trauma endured by the victim, of any form of penetration other than that of a penis. The definition of rape in the UK is, therefore, worryingly inappropriate and misguided. It quite simply does not offer anything approaching a suitable level of protection or justice for the victim, or an adequate deterrent for the perpetrator.",
        "background": "The law makes a differentiation between rape and assault by penetration.It implies that only penetration with a penis is considered rape, when penetration of another person's vagina/anus/mouth by an object or a part of the body is not considered rape. Revise the definition to include the latter",
