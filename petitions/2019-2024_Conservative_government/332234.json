        "additional_details": "I feel like a lot of the times people with hidden disabilities struggle more in life, not only because they're not understood by those who are around them, but by those who are strangers to them make things ten times more uncomfortable, for the person struggling to explain themselves, we always are not seen in parliament to be a problem, but now during a 'pandemic crisis' this must change. \r\nI for one have autism 'ASD' I have sensory issues, someone with asthma has breathing issues ect.",
        "background": "I want to make an official exception card for those who can not wear face masks, we want it official for our use and for the purpose of the public recognizing the issue, and to make shopping less anxious for those who have a hidden disability and a different card for those with- physical disability.",
