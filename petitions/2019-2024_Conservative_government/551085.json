        "additional_details": "This is not a view on wider government policy. We understand the need to control the spread of Covid, and also the challenges to the police of enforcing the previous rules. \r\n\r\nFortunately the BBC (1 Sep) reported that children:\r\n- are extremely unlikely to die or become seriously unwell from Covid\r\n- appear to be less likely to catch/spread Covid than adults\r\n\r\nThis new rule was not voted on in parliament: your signature will allow for our MPs to begin to properly scrutinise the impacts of this law.",
        "background": "The 'rule of six' means that many families with younger children won't be able to see friends or family for support. This will have a detrimental impact on their mental health and the well-being of their families. \r\n\r\nThis would bring England closer into line with the law in Scotland and Wales.",
