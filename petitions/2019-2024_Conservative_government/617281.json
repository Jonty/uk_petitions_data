        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson, lies so much he convinces himself he\u2019s telling the truth. \r\n\r\nDespite what he says, he did knowingly lie at the dispatch box which means he did know he mislead parliament and must go.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s not trusted by more than half of the country according to various polls. \r\n\r\nThe Great British Public can not wait another 2 & 1/2 years to get this man out of office and country can\u2019t afford to keep him in power either.",
        "background": "Get rid of Boris Johnson he is a liability to our country and a laughing stock on the world stage with the exception of President Zelenskiy who thinks Mr Johnson is wonderful but that\u2019s just because he doesn\u2019t know our Prime Minister like we do.",
