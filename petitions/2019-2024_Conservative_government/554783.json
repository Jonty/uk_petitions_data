He Claims to be trying to keep the country safe yet remains to keep open schools/colleges/ gyms but closing other establishments such as restaurants/pubs and wants families separated again. Schools and colleges have a high rate of people there in one place but won\u2019t allow you to see anymore than 6 people within your home or public place. This is my eyes makes no sense. This why I believe we need a new prime minister.",
