        "additional_details": "There is currently a shortage of hand sanitiser; everyone now wants to buy it because of Covid-19.\r\nClearly more people now realise the importance of cleansing their hands more often.\r\nIf hand sanitiser dispensers were provided in all public places - restaurants, cafes, shops, pubs, sporting events etc., people would get used to using them which could vastly reduce the transmission of all types of disease in future. This could save the NHS a great deal of money, and avoid many lost working hours.",
        "background": "From the stories emerging during the Coronavirus outbreak, it seems that many people do not wash their hands when they should, and this leads to the spread of diseases.\r\nWall mounted hand sanitiser dispensers should be located in all public places, and people should be encouraged to use them.",
