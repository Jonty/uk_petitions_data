        "additional_details": "We are extremely worried about the rapid increase in Covid19 and the mutation of the virus.  It is unknown yet if the mutations will be resistant to vaccines and the potential for further catastrophic effects on our population and NHS.  We must stop virus mutations from other parts of the world getting into the UK.  Much stricter control measures and enforcement need to be implemented.",
        "background": "We want Government to protect the citizens of UK and our NHS services from further Covid19 transmission and virus mutations such as the South African variant by closing our borders both in and out of the country to international travel and to insist on negative Covid19 test before any entry to UK.",
