        "additional_details": "There has been no public consultation for this & the local MP has and will not disclose any data from the survey. To destroy such a beautiful piece of culture and beauty of our region would be catastrophic. The Victorian viaducts, the wildlife, the sanctuary it gives people of all ages for walking, cycling, horse riding, running. Days with families spent & enjoyed. The famous Red Kite walk, deer that amble around freely, we need the government to step in and review something that isn't needed.",
        "background": "There have been plans released to convert the Derwent Walk spanning across Gateshead and Durham back into a railway line, we want this stopped in its tracks! There has been a \u00a365k grant from Durham City Council for a feasibility study.",
