        "additional_details": "Certain individuals are unable to take the COVID-19 vaccination due to an array of different reasons, be it related to health, religion or cultural beliefs. By imposing restrictions on the day-to-day freedoms of individuals, the government would intentionally create a divided, two-class society. Those that are unvaccinated should understand the health risks of declining or delaying their vaccine, however it is discriminatory to limit these individuals\u2019 freedoms.",
        "background": "It is discriminatory to restrict the freedoms of individuals that do no wish to or are unable to take the COVID-19 vaccine. This petition calls for the government to oppose any restrictions which are dependent on the vaccination status of an individual.",
