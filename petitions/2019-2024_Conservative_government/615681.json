        "additional_details": "Other significant financial loans are not linked to RPI - they are all linked to CPI. In 2013, RPI also lost its status as a National Statistic (Office for National Statistics, https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/shortcomingsoftheretailpricesindexasameasureofinflation/2018-03-08) yet still remains the rate for interest rates on student loans.",
        "background": "For all student loans introduced from 2012, they have been linked to RPI and not CPI, unlike any other financial loan. This leaves young people with a huge financial burden as interest rates on incredibly large loans can fluctuate drastically e.g. they are going up to 12% this autumn",
