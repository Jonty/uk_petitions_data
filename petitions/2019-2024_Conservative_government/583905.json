        "additional_details": "The government values education for every British child. It is unfathomable that there should be children who can\u2019t afford the costs of an exam this summer due to the hiked up prices. After a difficult financial year with children home for months, the examination boards are taking advantage and extorting money from parents in a very ugly manner. It is our children\u2019s teachers who have really born the brunt of this difficult situation with lots more marking, assessing and grading each student.",
        "background": "This Spring 2021, it is quite clear that no exams have been set, no exams are going to be taken and consequently barely any costs to the examination boards. Not only is there no discount to the parents but many of the boards have actually RAISED THEIR PRICES!!\r\nWe want this extortion to be stopped.",
