There will be a lower risk of harm and vulnerability to young people and adults , doing this will not only save an individual but also save the hearts of many family members of devastation and distress.",
        "background": "Create a supportive structured plan that actually happens. If people present themselves as suicidal at a place of safety this should not be invalidated and should be placed in a safe environment. More training and funding to recruiting of appropriately accredited staff and more money and awareness.",
