        "action": "Stop the deportation of asylum seekers to Rwanda.",
        "additional_details": "Rwanda does not have a clean record when it comes to human rights abuses, which the government even denounced last year, so it is clearly an inappropriate place for people who may be escaping similar abuses to be sent. Furthermore, it will be considerably more expensive than simply allowing refugees to stay in the UK. Yes, there is a real problem with smuggler gangs exploiting vulnerable people that needs to be tackled, but this is not an effective or ethical solution to the problem.",
        "background": "To end the agreement the UK government has with the Rwandan government that would cause thousands of asylum seekers to be deported to Rwanda upon reaching the UK and claiming asylum.",
