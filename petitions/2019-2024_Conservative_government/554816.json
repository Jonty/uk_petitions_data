        "action": "Government should legislate towards the use of mute, silent or quiet fireworks.",
        "additional_details": "Current legislation allows for public use of fireworks 16 hours a day, every day.  The Petitions Committee inquiry in 2019 concluded that it would not be appropriate for the Government to ban the public use of fireworks.  The government should look at alternatives. Collecchio, Italy have successfully moved towards Fireworks that are marketed as mute, silent or quiet fireworks.  I petition the government to legislate towards the use of mute, silent or quiet fireworks to protect the vulnerable.",
        "background": "The drawbacks of fireworks is the noise they generate can scare pets, wildlife and the vulnerable causing distress, disorientation and anxiety.  The panic by the noise of fireworks has been observed among birds and wildlife, often with tragic consequences.",
