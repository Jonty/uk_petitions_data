        "additional_details": "I am looking to buy my first car and I am finding it difficult looking for a car which is only a few years old as most of them come with automation which I don't even want which is pushing up the price  pointlessly for me. These features include driver assistance, lane assistant as they make the car more expensive. About 10 years ago you easily find a new car with zero autonomy meaning the car would be very cheap compared to brand new car prices.",
        "background": "I am calling for the government to make the law which requires car manufacturers to build brand new cars with zero autonomy as this would give the opportunity for cars buyers to save money when buying a car if they do not want to by a car with autonomy.",
