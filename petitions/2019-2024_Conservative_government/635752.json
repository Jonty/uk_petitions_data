        "additional_details": "Making companies such as Sky and BT give up the matches they do not show (especially lower league matches, League 1 and 2), it will boost the revenue for so many clubs, clubs that area really struggling. We have seen the massive rise in Women's football, this is thanks to free viewing, if sport is free, people will watch it, and it will only benefit both the clubs and the people. We need to make sport free on TV.",
        "background": "The BBC have lost their grip on sports rights on TV, most football, cricket, rugby, and Formula One events are now locked behind a paywall. This is not fair. Showing sport free on TV will get a massive audience and can motivate generations to come, it can also bridge the gap of  income inequality.",
