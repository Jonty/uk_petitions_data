        "additional_details": "This is so the amount infected will drop and the death rate would decrease. Too many infections occur in schools. They are one of the main causes for cases in the UK. If you are doing a national lockdown then close schools too because if you don\u2019t close them then the lockdown will just not work.",
        "background": "Closing schools down for one month will help stop the spread of the new covid variant that is spreading in the south of England. \r\nMoving online and only keeping schools open for the vulnerable children will be the way forward in stopping the virus from taking over the country.",
