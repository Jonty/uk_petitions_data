        "additional_details": "There are so many different plastics about that it\u2019s hard to tell what each one is. It\u2019s ok to say #GotToBeABottle but if all plastics were recycled, the volume of plastic being discarded of would decrease and the plastic can then be sorted into types. For example, the Happy Meal toys from McDonald\u2019s cannot be recycled and they sell approx 3.5million Happy Meals per day. That\u2019s a lot of waste plastic alone.",
        "background": "Councils such as Greater Manchester are running a #GotToBeABottle campaign for what can be recycled. All plastics should be acceptable as the Local Authority should be responsible for sorting/recycling dependent on plastic type such as PETE/HDPE/PVC/LDPE/PP/PS/OTHER.",
