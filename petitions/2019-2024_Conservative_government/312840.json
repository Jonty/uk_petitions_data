        "additional_details": "Extend the theory test certificates by a few months so a driving test can be rebooked. My driving test was due to be taken in june and cancelled due to covid-19 but my theory test runs out in july so im unable to get another driving test booked in before this time.  This is extremely unfair for everyone that has paid & passed there theory and ready to take a driving test and paid for one. We want a extension on our theory tests.",
        "background": "Due to Covid-19 a lot of theory test certificates are expiring before we have had the chance to take our driving test. We want these certificates extended so we can rebook our driving tests once covid-19 is over.",
