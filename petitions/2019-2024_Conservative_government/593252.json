        "action": "Introduce an opt out of NHS for individuals who would prefer a private service.",
        "additional_details": "Throughout the pandemic the NHS has created an immense backlog of untreated patients on record breaking waiting lists. GPs are still refusing to see patients and many are forced to pay privately while still funding the NHS who are not providing a service. For staff to demand large pay rises while every other industry suffers, is also insulting to the British public. The NHS has proven it is no longer fit for purpose and the public should not be forced to fund a failed system.",
        "background": "Allow individuals who would rather pay for superior, private healthcare to pay a reduced rate of National Insurance contributions or income tax with the option to opt out of NHS care.",
