        "action": "Abolish the legal defence of Reasonable Chastisement in England",
        "additional_details": "How we treat our children influences how they will treat others. If we are violent and don\u2019t respect their boundaries and rights we cannot expect them to behave any differently. Being hit and hurt by people who are meant to love and protect you is a terrible thing to experience and there is, quite simply, no justification for it. Our Government must abolish this barbaric and inhumane legal defence, now.",
        "background": "The legal defence of Reasonable Chastisement permits parents and guardians and those acting in loco parentis to punish children. This has been proven to be detrimental to human wellbeing and is, additionally, a breach of children\u2019s human rights under international law (The UNCRC).",
