        "additional_details": "The devolved parliaments are costly and irrelevant. They are detrimental to the efficient governance of the United Kingdom and are being abused by grievance politicians. The devolved parliaments provide a platform for those who seek to break up the United Kingdom rather than look after the best interests of their constituents. To prevent further constitutional instability, damage to the fabric of society and our damage to our economy we insist that the devolved parliaments are abolished now.",
        "background": "We request a UK wide referendum that provides the option to abolish the devolved parliaments thus restoring full governmental control to Westminster.",
