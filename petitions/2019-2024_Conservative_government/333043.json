        "action": "Abandon the proposed plans to include calories labels on all restaurant menus",
        "additional_details": "When people have an eating disorder this may express itself in the form of obsessive calorie counting. When in recovery, those with an eating disorder would not want to go out to eat, which is meant to be relaxing and enjoyable, and be faced with a list of calories. This could be very triggering and harmful, stunting their recovery. The government shouldn't guilt trip people into not eating certain foods, and should instead seek out a better alternative to their ill-thought out plan.",
        "background": "We want to ensure that the government abandon all plans to add calorie labelling to the food on offer at restaurants. When proposing plans such as the afforementioned the government cease to take into consideration the implications of such a law on those with eating disorders.",
