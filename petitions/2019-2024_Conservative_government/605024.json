        "additional_details": "Fireworks are a fantastic source of enjoyment for people but there is absolutely no need for them to be noisy.\r\nThe noise has a detremtal effect on animals, domestic and wild, nationally and worldwide.\r\n\r\nI have two dogs, a cat and several horses and they are all effected by the noise. \r\n\r\nBees abandon their hives, birds die due to stress, fish and other wild animals ingest firework debris. Domestic animals have panic attacks. \r\nHumans have PTSD.\r\n\r\nNo kind of display is worth the above negatives.",
        "background": "Parliament/government need to ban the production/sale and use of noisy fireworks and only allow silent fireworks to be produced/sold and used. \r\n\r\nNoisy fireworks have some many more negative effects than positive. Wild and domestic animals are terribly effected by the noise.",
