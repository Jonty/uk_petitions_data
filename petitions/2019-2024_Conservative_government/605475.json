When these horrific crimes happen, if the victim is lucky enough to survive they are left traumatised and sometimes left feeling like they wished that they hadn\u2019t survived. By using pepper spray to distract the attacker this should help increase the chances of the victim being able to escape their attackers grip, in turn giving them a chance to flea to a safe place or to find help.",
