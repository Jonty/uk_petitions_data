        "additional_details": "As many students are not entitled to any benefits, the only option is to work and students do just that, Since we are going through the epidemic we now have no jobs and no income which means our homes will most likely be took away from us as we just don\u2019t have the funds available to pay our rents. We cannot claim benefits as we are full time students. Although the government have done a fantastic job in setting out plans that help our society, unfortunately students seem to have been forgotten.",
        "background": "I would like the government to help students who live alone and are not entitled to any benefits. I want to government to give those students help in the form of housing benefit and/or other benefits that would help keep the homes in which they live safe.",
