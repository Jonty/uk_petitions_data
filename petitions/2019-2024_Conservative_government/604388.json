        "additional_details": "We want the government to ask the universities to conduct all January exams and presentations online, and minimise the In-person interactions as a precaution to keep the students and staff safe with rising COVID-19 case numbers.\r\n\r\nThe universities in Central London are dealing with outbreaks in student residencies and classrooms, but they don\u2019t pay attention and continues to take exams in campus which results is rise of covid-19 cases. The students are in academic stress.",
        "background": "We want our January exams to be shifted online as many students are catching covid on campus. Some students are abroad for Christmas holiday and can\u2019t return due to travel ban. The university sticks to ask the students to apply for Mitigating Circumstances which gives academic pressure.",
