        "additional_details": "Pass it as a law or introduce it as a part of the curriculum in secondary education to ALL pupils. They should have to learn about consent and the statistics of assault also how to keep themselves safe. It should be a part of the education scheme and taught to pupils in senior school so they can understand it clearly. It will also help deter many people from doing things like this and hopefully stop them from thinking it is acceptable.",
        "background": "It should be taught in seniors schools and clearly laid out what consent is. It should also be offered help and support easily for those who have been through similar things. It should also offer self defence to students for these situations",
