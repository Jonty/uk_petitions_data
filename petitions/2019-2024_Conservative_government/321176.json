        "action": "Abolish the Immigration Health Surcharge for NHS workers",
        "additional_details": "The charge for foreign NHS workers is a perverse deterrent to the staff we desperately need to sustain the NHS. Against the backdrop of the Covid 19 pandemic, which has seen disproportionate impact on BAME and foreign born NHS workers this grave injustice has been thrown into stark relief. \r\n\r\nThe founding principle of the NHS is provision of universal healthcare free at the point of need.The Immigration Health Surcharge must therefore be scrapped beginning with NHS workers and their dependents.",
        "background": "Foreign NHS workers are an asset to their communities, not a burden. While providing invaluable contribution to the NHS it is unacceptable that they must pay \u00a3624 annually for themselves and their family to access the very service to which they dedicate their working lives. The IHS must be scrapped.",
