        "additional_details": "Car drivers are fined if they do not adhere to the Highway Code, which is the law, however the same law is not applied to cyclists, yet they are part of the Highway Code. With the huge amount of cycle lanes in the country, it is now time cyclists stick to their lanes and adhere to the Highway Code. I would like to see cyclists fined should they cycle on the pavement (for adults) or cycling through red traffic lights.",
        "background": "For the Government to implement a cycling test where cyclists must do at least a theory test in accordance to the Highway Code and for cyclists to be fined should they do not adhere to the Highway Code, for example, adult cyclists cycling on the pavement.",
