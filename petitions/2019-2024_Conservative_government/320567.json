        "additional_details": "At the moment, the Chief Dental Officer and CQC have stopped dentists in the UK from seeing any patients in person. This is regardless of Government guidance exempting dental practices from lock-down closure. Dentists are prevented from treating the increasing numbers of patients phoning them in pain. The Urgent Dental Centres have a very limited remit which means most patients cannot be seen despite their pain and discomfort.  Let dentists see these patients and help at least a million people.",
        "background": "Allow patients to see their dentist for urgent treatment without delay. Dentists are health care professionals with huge expertise in cross infection control. Dental pain is currently suffered by a million people of all ages unable to access care due to directives issued without scientific evidence.",
