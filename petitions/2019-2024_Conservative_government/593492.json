        "additional_details": "There are lots of people, and especially students, that were either vaccinated with their first dose in the UK and their second one in their home country, or were fully vaccinated abroad. However, at the moment, those who have been vaccinated in the EU with a vaccine that has also been approved by the MHRA cannot enjoy the quarantine free travels, as those who have been vaccinated under the UK vaccination programme. This has to change as vaccines administered in the UK and the EU are the same.",
        "background": "The UK Government should recognise the EU Digital COVID Certificate as an equal 'COVID Passport' to the NHS COVID Pass, since the MHRA and the EMA have approved the same vaccines, which, most of the times, were produced in the same production plant.",
