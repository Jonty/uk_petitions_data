        "action": "Ban the insecticide fipronil from all UK pet flea & tick products",
        "additional_details": "Fipronil is an insecticide that was banned by the EU for agricultural purposes in 2017. It is still a common ingredient in pet flea treatments, but is highly toxic to fish. Fipronil enters our waterways through household drains from washing our pets, their bedding and our hands. It was found in 99% of rivers studied and breaks down into a product 3 to 6 times more toxic. One dog can kill an entire pond of fish when treated with fipronil. It needs to be removed from our environment and homes.",
        "background": "The Government needs to ban the insecticide fipronil from all pet flea and tick products in the UK to protect the fish in our rivers. The UK's wildlife is already vulnerable and this toxic chemical is damaging our aquatic life, despite only being found in flea products.",
