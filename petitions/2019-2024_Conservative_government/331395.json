        "additional_details": "The extension of the ULEZ charging zone will not only have a devastating effect on low income households, but will also affect the lives of hundreds/ thousands of workers that require their vehicle within the zone. The charge of \u00a312.50 a day will cause a huge dent in many peoples incomes and is altogether extremely inconvenient, especially to those who will not have enough to upgrade their vehicle to a ULEZ complying vehicle.I am calling for ULEZ to be revoked and to prevent this negative impact",
        "background": "To scrap the scheme scheduled for October 2021 to extend the current ULEZ charging zone to the North and South Circular Road in London and to maintain the current zone as it is.",
