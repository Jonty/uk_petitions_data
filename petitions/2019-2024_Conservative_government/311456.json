Even if they are not able to open, they can still work on administration, marketing, finances, etc, whereas, should a Company Director furlough themselves they are not allowed to do anything, including work on their finances, apply for loans, etc. It cannot be in the interest of the economy for businesses to have to close completely. Both groups should be treated the same.",
