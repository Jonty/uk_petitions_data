        "additional_details": "Procedures contravene the UK government\u2019s mission on the oPt, and British-Palestinian relations are frustrated by restrictions on movement. British nationals have reported an increase in detentions, harassment and interrogations at border control/entry points. Restrictions are damaging Palestinian development and economic growth, impacting trade, education, culture and familial relations. No restrictions apply when visiting Israelis, including those living in illegal settlements inside the oPt.",
        "background": "Protect the rights, privacy and safety of UK citizens by formally making representation to the Israeli government to abandon new entry procedures. The procedures are discriminatory, invasive and punitive as they only target people visiting Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories (oPt)",
