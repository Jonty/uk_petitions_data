        "additional_details": "We want the Governments help so that people in these areas of Essex can live and get around comfortably. \u00a35 a day for a bus during a cost of living crisis is extortionate, especially when both the elderly and young rely on buses as their main mode of transport as the central line does not run to North Weald. Children have already missed so much school because of Covid and adults are starting to return to work but the buses are so unreliable that we cannot count on them.",
        "background": "We want help with improving the public transport in North Weald, Epping and Ongar and with ensuring the buses are more frequent, on time and cheaper. The buses should be penalised for being late and not showing up. Refunds should be provided for circumstances where the bus has not shown up.",
