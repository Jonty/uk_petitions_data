There are television and radio adverts at every turn and while I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t be possible to ban adverts altogether - there is certainly no reason at all that these adverts could not be decreased to assist addicts in their recovery.",
        "background": "Gambling addiction is more recognised today than it ever has been.  Its crippling vice on peoples lives not only affects the addict but also their family and friends. \r\nAn alcoholic can avoid places that serve alcohol whereas compulsive gamblers can\u2019t even escape the temptations in their own homes.",
