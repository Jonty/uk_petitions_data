        "action": "Do not lift the cap on the UK's nuclear stockpile.",
        "additional_details": "Increasing the number of nuclear weapons in the UK's arsenal serves little purpose, and is a waste of money in a time of particularly high national debt.\r\n\r\nRegardless of your opinion on nuclear weapons and their usage, it cannot be said that the current number does not constitute a credible deterrent. To increase weapon numbers simply promotes an arms race mentality that forces rivals to make countermeasures, which make the changes pointless anyway.",
        "background": "It has been announced the UK government intends to remove a cap on the number of nuclear weapons the UK may hold in its arsenal. The stated aim is to increase the number of nuclear weapons the UK has. This petiton requests the government retain the cap and not increase the number of weapons held.",
