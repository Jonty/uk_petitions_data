        "additional_details": "Our jobs involve very close contact with children who may be infected. We can unwittingly take it home and spread it to our families. Schools and other educational settings have been allowed to close and we feel we need the same protection.\r\nWe understand that key worker and vulnerable children still need to be cared for and would be happy to provide this care but feel that by minimising the amount of children we are in contact with we have less chance of becoming infected and spreading Covid.",
        "background": "Following the government announcement on the 4th of January we as early years practitioners have been ignored. We are at risk along with our families by being forced to stay open while schools close. We want to be treated the same as schools and only open for key workers and vulnerable children.",
