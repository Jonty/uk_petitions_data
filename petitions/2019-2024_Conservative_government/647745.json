        "additional_details": "I want the government to step in & step up. Higher punishment for those who shout sexual comments to females when they don\u2019t want it. Many females have said they won\u2019t walk home alone. They get a family member meet them so they feel safe. How can this be the case. Females must feel safe to walk home no matter what there wearing. Society needs to understand females needs to feel SAFE! Stricter laws can help provent this from happening. I feel the government should be doing more to protect girls.",
        "background": "Introduce a stricter law system that protects females from sexual harassment I.e whistling unwanted sexual comments from cars etc. females feel so unsafe walking home or to work because the harassment they face. Young/old females in this  Society shouldn\u2019t feel unsafe. It needs to change!",
