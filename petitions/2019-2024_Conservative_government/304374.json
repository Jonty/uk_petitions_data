        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson has shown everyone that he is not up to the task as Prime Minister during one of the most difficult and turbulent times this country has ever faced. \r\n\r\nHe needs to be removed from office and replaced with a leader who can demonstrate a true sense of care, as well as implementing a strategy that serves the safety and well-being of this country - especially as the UK should have an advantage with time, information and resources, all of which the government has disregarded entirely.",
        "background": "The Covid-19 pandemic has truly exposed the incompetence of Boris Johnson and his cabinet. \r\n\r\nWhilst other countries are taking measures to protect their citizens, he has shown no leadership nor inspired any notion that the protection of the British public is his highest priority.",
