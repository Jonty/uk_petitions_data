        "additional_details": "It is unfair that hard working people choose to work extra hours to provide for their families, going above and beyond despite for many years pay rises not matching the cost of inflation. I believe it\u2019s fair that if someone chooses to earn extra money, almost half of it isn\u2019t taken from them in tax and national insurance.  Ultimately the government wouldn\u2019t receive this money if people did not choose to work these extra hours, which is time away from their families.",
        "background": "Working people have at least 32% of their salary deducted in income tax and national insurance if they earn about \u00a312500 per year. This is a substantial amount of money taken away from people who work.",
