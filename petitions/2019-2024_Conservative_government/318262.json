This is only right and proper.\r\n\r\nOur doctors, nurses and carers are now frontline soldiers in the war against COVID, dying at a faster rate than our military casualties in Afghanistan. Still more will have permanent lung damage, etc.\r\n\r\nBut their families get no compensation whatsoever, and some are left both bereaved and destitute. \r\n\r\nThis injustice cannot stand. Compensation for ALL our fallen heroes.",

It is the least we can do.",
