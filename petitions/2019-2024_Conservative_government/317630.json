        "additional_details": "It is unreasonable to expect schools in the current situation to deliver less than what is detailed in SEN children\u2019s EHCPs and assume it to work successfully. Many children have had risk assessments completed stating they are to be cared for at home, yet single-parent families are still expected to continue working, without childcare for these children. I implore the government to state that employers must give the option of furlough to parents of SEN children, who cannot attend school.",

Instead of forcing unrealistic expectations on schools, please permit parents of SEN children to be furloughed under mitigating circumstances.",
