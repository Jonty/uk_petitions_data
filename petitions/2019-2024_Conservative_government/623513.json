        "action": "Impose a windfall tax on excess energy company profits",
        "additional_details": "The excess profits made by energy companies are so large that they have been quoted as saying that they don't know what to do with them. They have also stated that a windfall tax would not affect their investment plans. Not imposing a windfall tax means a higher tax burden for the general population for years to come. Imposing a windfall tax would not be an impediment to growth, as has already been stated.",
        "background": "Many energy companies are making enormous profits from the current high price of gas, oil, and electricity. The UK should follow the example of the EU and impose a windfall tax on these companies to provide additional finance for the NHS, social care, people in poverty, etc.",
