        "additional_details": "This will help protect people from energy poverty, this will help the most vulnerable. Those who are unemployed, retired, on low incomes and anyone else who is struggling to pay these extreme price rises. \r\nIf the government continues to not address this issue, people will have no choice but to stop paying their energy bills, also known as a bill strike.\r\n3000 people die each year as a result of energy poverty, we will not accept anymore deaths.",
        "background": "Lower the energy price cap to 4%, in line with France. There is no need to raise energy prices by 54% when energy companies have made record profits! Help the public not to choose between eating and heating, instead of giving more money to those who don't need it.",
