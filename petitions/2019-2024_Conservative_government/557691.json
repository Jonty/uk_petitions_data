Also you may have covid-19 and not show any symptoms which means you can infect people on the way to school in school and on the way back home. and also at home. Each school has hundreds of pupils so this means it can be easily spread and this results in higher cases and more people at risk.",
        "background": "Me and Thousands of other people want schools and colleges to close because there is a high rise of covid-19 cases. Announcing a lockdown should mean that everything closes such as schools and colleges. Schools and colleges should close as we sit next to each other long enough for covid to transmit.",
