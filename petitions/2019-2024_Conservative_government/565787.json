        "additional_details": "Vocational students have received a lot of disruptions due to COVID-19 and are under a lot of pressure and stress which makes it unfair for exams to go ahead without even a delay like the GCSE/ A Levels in the Summer. Many students have received little on-site teaching due to self isolation and all of us have found it difficult to learn properly with remote lessons.",
        "background": "Cancel exams due to be taken by BTEC students in January, allowing teachers to give us predicted grades and scheduling resits for those that aren't satisfied with their grade.",
