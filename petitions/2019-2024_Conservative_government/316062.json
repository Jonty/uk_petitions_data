        "additional_details": "Putting a \u2018freeze\u2019 on expiration dates would be a huge gesture and would show a lot of good will during this current crisis. \r\n\r\nOr, if the government argue that all driving theory tests cannot be extended due to legal reasons, then all those who still had a driving theory certificate valid before the test ban should be allowed to resit the test for free. As making someone pay again needlessly is no more than profiteering and these are truly unfair and exceptional circumstances.",
        "background": "Due to the Coronavirus outbreak driving tests, understandably have been cancelled for up to 3 months. As theory tests last for 2 years, those who have already passed are at risk or paying to re-take when they already had their tests planned. The government should extend all tests by the same period.",
