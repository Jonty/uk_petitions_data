        "additional_details": "The reason I want the government to ban all homework is because the schools are always on about mental health and talk about this talk about that when homework completely destroys our mental health makes us tired six to seven hours after school work when we are supposed to be relaxing and it just stress as out to the point where a lot of people shut down and then as a result get a detention for not actually being able to do it.",
        "background": "I want to ban all homework. We already have to do 6-7 hours of work at school and we are supposed to relax when we get home, but no the schools just want to make our lives miserable. And all the schools are on about mental health when doing homework actually just destroys our mental health.",
