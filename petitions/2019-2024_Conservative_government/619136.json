        "additional_details": "Women now and in the future should be able to make informed choices about whether they wish to continue their pregnancies. \r\nThe law as it currently stands could be interpreted differently in the future and there could in theory be more restrictive practices than exist today. \r\nThere are many grounds on which a woman may choose to not proceed with a pregnancy and these should not have to be justified. \r\nAbortion should be available; as early as possible and as late as necessary.",
        "background": "The Abortion Act 1967 permits abortion only on four grounds. \r\nWhilst in practice termination tends to be freely available as a choice, the law does not reflect this. \r\nI propose an amendment to the law so that prior to 24 weeks of gestation abortion is a right, with no specified grounds required.",
