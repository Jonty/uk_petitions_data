        "additional_details": "This effects peoples lives working the LGBT+ community everyday. People kill themselves. Hate themselves. Over things like this and it should be made very clear that it is wrong. And not just a few words on BBC news, saying it\u2019s wrong but a true statement of making it illegal.",
        "background": "gay conversion therapy is still very much ongoing in the uk and I feel it should be illegal. Someone within the lgbt+ community cannot be \u2018cured\u2019 or \u2018rid of sin\u2019 and this is a huge huge problem. It has no place in our society and I want to protect My community.",
