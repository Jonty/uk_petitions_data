        "additional_details": "You are opening opportunities for those days we hold dear to have no value thus, be disrupted by protest. Given how quickly you have in the past put in place legislation that suits, it is time to put in place legislation to stop protests in the future on those days that mean the most to us British citizens, such as Christmas Day, Shrove Tuesday, Ash Wednesday, Easter Sunday, Easter Monday, St George's Day, St Andrews's Day, St David's Day, St Patrick's Day, Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday.",

We respectfully ask that in future you do not allow marches of any nature to go ahead on the dates that are important to British citizens.",
