Most staff on these contracts will work more hours (overtime) in peak times to offset.\r\nThis law has been sneaked in by government and will sink businesses. \r\nProtect your jobs and sign this otherwise more company\u2019s will go under.",

It applies in a very specific context where an employer has a legal right to send an employee home without pay (a \u2018lay off clause\u2019). \r\n\r\nZero-hours workers do not have a right to guaranteed pay. This is because: a. they are usually not \u2018employees\u2019 (i.e. they do not work under a contract of employment); and b. they do not have any minimum guaranteed hours so it is not possible for them to have a \u2018workless day\u2019. \r\n\r\nIt is therefore not clear what else you would like the Government to do.
