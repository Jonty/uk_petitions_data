        "additional_details": "The British Government has a long tradition of ennobling Business men  that then lay off their workers, or Family or Friends but often fail to honour those that the British Public love and respect for their actions. Nigel Benn and Chris Eubanks have served as an inspiration to generations of the British public for their courage, determination in the Ring and conduct out of the ring.  It is felt that being Black and Working Class their example is overlooked by the Establishment.",
        "background": "For the British Government to show recognition to two legends of British Boxing who not only had stellar boxing careers, but also showed compassion and integrity to Michael Watson & Gerald McCallen honourable contestants that paid the ultimate price in the Ring.",
