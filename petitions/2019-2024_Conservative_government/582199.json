        "additional_details": "Every single weekend there are hundreds of cars and motorbikes parking, speeding, revving engines, doing illegal uturns, driving on the pavement, on Chelsea Bridge.\r\n\r\nThere is a huge amount of noise and air pollution caused from the cars and even some cars blowing fire from their cars. There is massive disruption to quality of life and sleep to neighbouring residents, and this behaviour places danger to other drivers, and pedestrians from the speed racers and illegal u turns on the bridge.",
        "background": "1. Introduce speed cameras on Chelsea bridge \r\n2. Red line on both sides of bridge to restrict parking at all times\r\n3. Impose fines for motorbikes and cars revving and parking on the Chelsea bridge and on the pavement.\r\n4. Cameras to detect and fine illegal uturns on Chelsea bridge",
