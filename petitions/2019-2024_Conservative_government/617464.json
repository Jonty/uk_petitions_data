        "additional_details": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe spent 6 years in prison thanks to Johnson\u2019s inaccurate commons statement. The abandonment of our allies in Afghanistan to face almost certain death is a constant source of shame. Whilst \u201cPartgate\u201d was in full swing, families we\u2019re prevented form comforting their loved ones. The list goes on. \r\nThe prospect of this country going to war with such a commander-in-chief doesn\u2019t bare thinking about. We need a leader with honesty, humility and integrity; we need a statesman, not a clown.",
        "background": "After three years of exceptionally poor leadership, enough is enough. The decision on whether Mr Johnson remains our Prime Minister should be determined by the people of the United Kingdom in a General Election if that\u2019s what it takes. David Davis said it best; \u2018in the name of God, go!\u2019",
