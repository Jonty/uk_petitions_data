        "additional_details": "The abuse is relentless,  and ongoing, and despite having evidence the police and council dismiss the suffering caused and hope it will simply go away, leaving victims traumatised with no one to turn to.\r\n\r\nOften the police and council take the side of the perpetrators and gaslight the victim into thinking they are the problem, which is unacceptable.  This indifference has to stop\r\n\r\nThis has got to stop, and you can make a difference and save lives by signing this petition, and making a change NOW.",
        "background": "Throughout United Kingdom, victims of neighbours from hell, are being failed by a system that is supposed to protect them. \r\n\r\nPerpetrators are allowed to get away with harassment, with intent to cause fear, alarm & distress, antisocial behaviour, intimidation, racist abuse, hate crime & bullying.",
