It's too easy for them to hide behind new secret accounts. \r\n\r\nHaving Photo I.D. verification stops the hiding, in turn will help towards stopping the hateful messages people receive over social media, not just footballers and not just racial abuse. It's all forms and it needs to stop immediately.",
