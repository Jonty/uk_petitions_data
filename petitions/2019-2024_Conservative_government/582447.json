These Covid tests are \u00a399pp. How can these charges be applied ? Surely there should be free ? Covid testing for people wanting to go abroad It's so unfair on the less fortunate families who save so hard to try get a holiday abroad . There are so many free testing facilities out there why can these not be used ? Please consider this petition into working away around this thankyou .",
