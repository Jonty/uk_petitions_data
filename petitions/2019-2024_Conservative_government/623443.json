        "additional_details": "The goverment should REVERSE this rediculous, and totally unfair, policy. Instead\r\na substantial first-amount-used should be charged at a LOWER rate and anything above that a higher rate. This would favour, and help, the poorest people in society and encourage EVERYONE to cut down their usage which has now become more important than ever before.  \r\nThis action s necessary both to help poor people with these previously unheard of new high prices and to preserve the environment.",
        "background": "These charges are so unfair to people on low incomes and favour the more well-off. The more you struggle to cut down your usage the higher the proportion of your bill that is charged at the higher rate.",
