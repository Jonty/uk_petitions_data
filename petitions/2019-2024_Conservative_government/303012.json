It's important that everyone is able to access all of the items they need yet many retailers have not been quick to act responsibly or attempt to restore calm. Therefore, I believe the government needs to step in temporarily to take action.",
        "background": "Shelves in shops are being stripped by panic buyers making it near impossible for most to buy even the most basic of items. As most retailers are not acting responsibly, they should be enforced to take action to limit the number of any 1 item customers can purchase to no more than 2.",
