All the mayor is doing is making up for the money he loss during lockdown and looking for any which way to skim money from tax payers with nonsense about global warming we have had global warming since I was a toddler",
        "background": "For all London borough councils to scrap LTNs with immediate effect seeing as we have given cyclists and TFL buses the lanes to keep them safe and buses to run as scheduled",
