        "additional_details": "I want Parliament to do it because I find that in my school we have talks about Addiction and First Aid but not about how to use money and the difficult terms around it. Because of this, I'm scared of when finishing school I will not know how to handle my money properly and make poor choices. This is why I think it should be compulsory to make learning about money (taxes, investments, different types of cards - e.g debit and credit, bills) compulsory in schools.",
        "background": "I would like Parliament to add compulsory presentations or talks in schools about how to manage your money responsibly. For example, how to make intelligent investments, how to pay your taxes or the difference between debit and credit cards",
