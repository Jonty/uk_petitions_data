With testing we could ensure that only those who pose a genuine infection risk need to self isolate, and those who are not in contact with covid-19 can return to work faster.",
        "background": "Provide testing for covid-19 for NHS staff, community care workers, social workers etc to ensure that the NHS and social care services are not understaffed due to to unnecessary self isolation. If we can confirm it's not covid-19 they can return to the frontline faster.",
