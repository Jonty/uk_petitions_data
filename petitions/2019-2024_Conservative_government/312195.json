Many people cannot travel next year because of existing plans or simply they are suffering a current financial loss due to loosing employment or are on a reduced income and getting a refund would help them in this crisis.",
        "background": "Because of the current Covid-19 crisis many people are struggling to get a response from travel companies and many customers are being fobbed off with web pages going offline or refund sections have been removed making it impossible to even apply for a refund.",
