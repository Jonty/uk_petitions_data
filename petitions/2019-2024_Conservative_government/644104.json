        "action": "Introduce licensing for pet owners, that also forces them to get training",
        "additional_details": "This could potentially be a vital scheme to crack down on illegal breeding and irresponsible dog ownerships. Currently the only one suffering with regards to the current laws surrounding dogs are large dog breeds or breeds that seem to be intimidating. In reality, small dogs are just as capable of killing a baby, as a large dog an adult. ALL dogs must be treated the same and ALL owners need to be vetted and take training classes before getting a dog. Help us get rid of irresponsible dog owners.",
        "background": "Introduce a licensing scheme for dog owners. Make it mandatory to complete training classes before being able to get a dog and mandatory for dogs to be taken to dog trainers for the first 1-2 years. Fine owners for not registering their dogs to a vet and completing health checks once a year.",
