This should not be the case. ALL NHS staff do such a fantastic job caring for us nationwide, many times putting their own lives at risk just to help us. Amid the current Covid-19 pandemic, the need for the NHS has never been more publicised, and I think now is the perfect time for the public to get behind this petition.",
