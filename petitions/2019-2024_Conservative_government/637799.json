        "additional_details": "Havering must leave the GLA and rejoin Essex as a county borough because of the following reasons: \r\n\r\n- Restore local control, autonomy and access to county-level services. \r\n- Tax rates in Essex are lower, making it more affordable for residents to live there.\r\n- Havering would be able to preserve its unique culture and history\r\n- It would be better equipped to address local issues. \r\n\r\nOverall, leaving the GLA would greatly benefit residents and improve the quality of life in Havering.",
        "background": "Ever since Havering was made part of Greater London in 1965, we have greatly lost our local authority and freedom. Being a part of Greater London has caused Havering to deal with London-wide laws and restrictions, like the ULEZ, which don't conform to our beliefs and needs.",
