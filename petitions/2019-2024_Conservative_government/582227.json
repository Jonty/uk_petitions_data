        "additional_details": "Many of my friends spent their final year of University under lockdown and didn't have access to the resources that they are paying for and didn't get the quality of education that warrants \u00a39000. Under normal circumstances, this year would be not be able to repeated. But that is the issue, the fact that this has not been a normal year for most people. We want to be able to at repeat our final year fully funded and no detriment on our end degree. We lose out on succeeding to greatest capacity and our employers lose out on valuable people.",
        "background": "With most of the vital resources being kept away from most students, they will be left with a massively reduced capability to succeed and this is a wasted investment. They should be able to retake the year fully funded regardless of their student finance situation.",
