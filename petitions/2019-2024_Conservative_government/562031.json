According to IUCN's Red List, 36% of chameleons are threatened with extinction, with the main reason being habitat loss, followed by poaching for the global pet trade. We feel that regulations should be introduced to hopefully reduce chameleons dying prematurely in captivity, as the way it is now could be unsustainable for wild chameleon populations in the future.",
