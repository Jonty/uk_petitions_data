Experiments on such dogs, & other animals, are today widely reported to be entirely failing the search for human treatments & cures: https://www.scarlettbeagle.org/science-campaign Current science from many fields proves conclusively that animal-based research & testing is not viable. This science hearing will support the Animal Welfare Act to protect laboratory dogs, all lab animals, & human patients.",
        "background": "The Govt. commits the Animal Welfare Act offence of 'unnecessary suffering' by sanctioning horrific experiments on dogs & other animals. The Govt. needs to mandate a public scientific hearing on animal testing, judged by independent experts from the relevant science fields, to stop this offence.",
