This comes at a time when house prices are already increasing faster than is possible to keep up with, and when a NI tax rise is going to hit working graduates for even more.\r\n\r\nThis will stifle social mobility further, and create further discontent in young voters. It is a punishment for not coming from wealth and it is discriminatory against those less well off.\r\n\r\nEducation is vital. Encourage it. Don't discourage it.",
