        "additional_details": "While COVID-19 is prevalent in the UK life can never return to normal. Restrictions are relaxed when infections fall and reimposed when they inevitably rise. This will never end. There is another option: a short, strict lockdown, and quarantine on all international travel. If there is a full-blown second wave this winter, another long lockdown will be needed anyway. But with serious effort *now*, elimination could be achieved within months. If Vietnam and New Zealand can do this, why can't we?",
        "background": "The UK should make a serious effort to effectively eliminate COVID-19. This has been achieved by many other countries. It requires stricter restrictions than are currently in place, but these would be temporary, rather than indefinite. Life within the UK could then return to pre-pandemic conditions.",
