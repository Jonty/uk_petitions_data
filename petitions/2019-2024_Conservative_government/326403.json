        "action": "Repay & redistribute the money paid by UK taxpayers to 'compensate' slave owners",
        "additional_details": "When slavery was abolished the Government agreed to pay the slave owners a sum of \u00a320M (= to \u00a3300BN today) for \u201closs of property\u201d. This was only paid off in 2015 & British taxpayers have contributed to this payment. Including individuals that are descendants of slaves.\r\nI am asking the government to repay this money, instead of onus to have been on taxpayers. NO ONE should have to have to buy their freedom, especially when Black UK citizens are still facing systemic discrimination every day.",
        "background": "We want the Government to repay the money paid by the UK taxpayers. This \u00a3330bn should be redistributed among the black communities across the UK. In turn helping to close the gap on racial disparity, to help create equal opportunities and be an important symbolic gesture for the Black community.",
