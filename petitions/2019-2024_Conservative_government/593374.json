        "additional_details": "Vaccinating under-18s is particularly important now with the increased prevalence of the Delta variant among younger people (https://bit.ly/ic_study) and the widespread destruction of unused vaccines (https://bit.ly/vax_waste).\r\nCovid has already been incredibly disruptive to the education of millions. As a 16 year old who has just taken GCSEs, I have seen this disruption first-hand. It is vital to the future of young people and the country that this disruption is minimised as much as possible.",
        "background": "All children 12 and older, for whom the use of the Pfizer vaccine has been approved, should be offered the vaccine before schools reopen in September.",
