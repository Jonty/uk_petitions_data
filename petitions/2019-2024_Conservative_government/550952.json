        "additional_details": "The mums of the group have met weekly since social distancing has allowed, to support each other and help develop the babies social skills. \r\nWithout this group, each member would have been without a huge support network and no contact to others going through the same thing. \r\nThe dads of the group could theoretically go to the pub, however the mums cannot meet due to them exclusively breastfeeding. We believe this is discriminating against breastfeeding mothers. Please help us change this rule.",

This will be taken away.",
