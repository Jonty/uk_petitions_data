        "additional_details": "Other countries, such as South Korea who were rapid in their response, now only face declining numbers and a minimal death toll. As the 5th richest country in the world, the UK must now follow example of other nations, and invest fully in a rapid programme to create wide spread testing facilities available to all citizens, free of charge. The Government declined medical support from the EU, saying it was fully capable of dealing with the crisis independently, now is the time to show it.",
        "background": "The W.H.O gave clear instructions for nations to begin social distancing measures and wide spread testing immediately. However, due to indecisive action, the UK now faces a death toll of over 2,000 and rising, with only 135 people fully recovered. For our Health and Safety testing must be made free.",
