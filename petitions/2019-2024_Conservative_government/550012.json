        "additional_details": "It is many peoples belief that the DVSA is unable to make slots available for everyone, private businesses should be allowed to do driving tests for car and motorcycles and HGV's etc, by paying the standard fee's by the government and a separate booking fee for the company, this would allow people to take their test sooner if not classed as a critical worker and optimise away the DVSA which has become extremely slow and non-optimal.",
        "background": "Privately owned businesses should be allowed to issue licenses to clients like the DVSA can do, with approved examiners.\r\n\r\nAdditionally we should also be able to book directly with the local council for the driving test. instead of the .gov DVSA website which can't take the load of 300,000 people",
