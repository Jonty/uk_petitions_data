The public have a right to see the evidence for themselves, in order to have confidence in the democratic process, and to end the speculation regarding government links with Russia.\r\n\r\nThe government is making the reconvening of the ISC a precondition for publication of the report, but is delaying the reconvening of the ISC. The report must be released regardless and must be published in full and unredacted.",

The length of time since submission without release of the report is unprecedented. It must be published in full without further delay, regardless of whether the ISC reconvenes.",
