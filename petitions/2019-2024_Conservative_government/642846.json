        "additional_details": "It is getting ridiculous, there are times when cars or motor cycles would be reving like they are in the fast and the furious at 11pm at night. I mean it would benefit the government tremendously, any car which revs their vehicle above a certain noise limit can be slapped with a fine. Anti social behaviour would also decrease as well especially when there are people who liked to show off. There was an incident recently (next door app) where people couldn't leave the shops because of people reving.",
        "background": "To include noise cameras above certain noise levels. Sound so loud from motor cycles or vehicles which are cosmetic rather then driving. Noise which can scare a child or an adult with epilepsy issues or sensitivity",
