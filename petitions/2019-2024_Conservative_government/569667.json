        "additional_details": "Students haven't had face to face classes since march 2020. They are not receiving the education they are going into debt for. Many are paying rent on properties they don't need or can't use. They should be allowed to repeat this year without it going on their student debt. This is meant to be setting them up for a future career but they cannot possibly learn what they should when they haven't set eyes on a tutor or even set foot inside a uni building this year.",
        "background": "Give the students another year of finance for uni fees and maintenance but without adding it to their debt. They need to repeat this year and it isn't fair they are having all this debt but not getting what they are paying for.",
