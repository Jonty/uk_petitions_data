It also eases anxiety and creates a safer educational setting if students continue to test twice a week. Free tests are an easy measure and they benefit everyone.",
        "background": "The government is planning to scrap free tests as of April 1st, this is a terrible idea. They should keep providing free LFTs to the public.",
