        "action": "Relax the UK DOMESTIC DRIVING regulation for supermarket delivery drivers",
        "additional_details": "Currently home shopping drivers can\u2019t drive 18:00-22:00 And then the next day drive 08:00 to 18:00 due to the regulation. Relaxing will allow us to plan in more drivers and accommodate the vulnerability of customers who can\u2019t  visit supermarkets. A maximum of 11 hours of shift time in a rolling 24 hour period current Is preventing supermarkets more flexibility to fill driving vacancies",
        "background": "We struggle to get driving shifts covered for home shopping service due to the domestic driving regulations. Relaxing this while the COVID-19 pandemic is in full swing will aid supermarkets to deliver more supplies to at risk customers",
