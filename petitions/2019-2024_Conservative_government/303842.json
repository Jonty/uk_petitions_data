        "additional_details": "The PM has advised the public to avoid these venues, but not made it an official closure under government powers.  This means that these businesses/individuals would either have to lose money opening to a lack of consumers, or close under circumstances that would forfeit an insurance claim.  Officially closing them means they can claim on the insurance, giving them a lifeline to continue at this difficult time.  Without these claims, the whole industry will suffer a crippling blow.",
        "background": "Officially enforce the closure all pubs, clubs, and other hospitality venues during the COVID-19 crisis, rather than purely just advise it, so that these venues can officially claim the insurance that can be necessary for them to survive this situation.",
