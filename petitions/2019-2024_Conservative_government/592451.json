        "additional_details": "This bill would give ICS\u2019s a statutory basis replacing CCG\u2019s thus controlling planning and decision making on our NHS. Private providers would be allowed to participate on Integrated Care Boards. This would be disastrous for the NHS meaning that private companies could influence decisions in our NHS. Just 1 of 10 seats on ICS boards will be reserved for GP\u2019s a stark contrast to CCGs. This bill must be withdrawn to stop private companies taking advantage, protecting our NHS once and for all.",
        "background": "I am calling on the government to withdraw the Health and Social Care Bill 2021, and to recognise the dangerous consequences of the Health and Social Care Bill 2021.",
