        "action": "Ban the use of the term 'Underage Woman' in news coverage of paedophilia cases",
        "additional_details": "The term \u2018Underage Woman\u2019 is paradoxical, as a person under the age of legal consent is legally a child. By continuing to call children \u2018Underage Women\u2019, news outlets do not do enough to hold the perpetrators accountable, whist also insinuating that the victim is a willing participant in their abuse. Once the media is forced to change its language when reporting these issues, society will also be influenced by this change.",
        "background": "By banning the term \u2018Underage Woman\u2019 when referring to cases of paedophilia, this petition seeks to directly counter one of the subtle ways in which victim-blaming occurs in society. The media can and should be held accountable for their choice of language when covering instances of paedophilia",
