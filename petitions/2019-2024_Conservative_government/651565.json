        "additional_details": "The Rwanda plan is an attack on the principle of refugee protection in the UK. The Government must uphold its legal and moral responsibility to people in need of protection. We also urge the Government to end and refrain from any other deals to send people to third countries or have their asylum claims processed offshore. We call on the Government to protect the universal right to seek asylum, and uphold everyone\u2019s human rights regardless of where they are from or how they came to this country.",
        "background": "The Government\u2019s plans to ship people seeking asylum to Rwanda were always cruel and immoral. Now that the Supreme Court has found the scheme to be unlawful, the Government must immediately abandon the deal and any other similar plans",
