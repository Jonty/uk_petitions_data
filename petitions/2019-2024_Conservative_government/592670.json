        "additional_details": "This is a clear example of segregation and coercive behaviour against those who do not wish to be vaccinated. People are afraid of being vaccinated due to the unknown long term effects of such a vaccine. Some people, such as those with autoimmune diseases, are not good candidates for the vaccine and yet these would still be discriminated against. Being vaccinated should be a choice. Being a responsible adult and ensuring you are tested before entering such venues is a clearly better option.",
        "background": "The government has stated they will be enforcing a condition of entry to clubs and large scale events from September 2021 onwards. The condition is that people must be double vaccinated to enter such places.",
