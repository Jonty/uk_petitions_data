The fate of these petitions was determined before being debated; and some have not even been debated:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/550344\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/552911\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/300336\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/561730\r\n\r\nWhen the Government response rejects the ask of a petition before it is debated, this corrodes the nation\u2019s democratic process. We need to restore the trust of millions.",
        "background": "Currently many petitions are effectively rejected by the Government before they can be debated in Parliament. The Government should not respond in writing to petitions when they receive 10,000 signatures, so that they do not receive a response unless and until they are debated.",
