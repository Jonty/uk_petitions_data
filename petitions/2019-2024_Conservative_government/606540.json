        "additional_details": "Many rescues have the same requirement as blue cross for those looking to adopt hamsters. Such as Savic spelos, savic geneva, crittertrail, ferplast combi 1 and many other cages which all under 80cm wide and 50cm deep. Hamsters which are put in small cages can get stressed out and start bar biting. If those cages are not sold any more companies will hopefully come out with better cages which will be big enough for a hamster to live happily in. Please save our hamsters.",
        "background": "Blue cross is a rescue which rehomes hamsters and in order to adopt a hamster from them they have a miniumim size hamster cage requirement of 80cm wide by 50cm deep. It should be made illegal to sell hamsters cages below 80cm wide by 50cm deep.",
