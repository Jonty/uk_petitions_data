They have had to subjugate their own safety and their responsibility to their families in order to serve the common good. Their service demands a selfless commitment to those that need their help and at far greater a risk than they might have imagined when embarking on their career.",
        "background": "Recognise formally the contribution that National Health Workers have made during the Covid -19 virus in the form of a medal which would be worn on formal occasions. This would follow the same rationale that Armed Forces personnel are recognised after serving in a conflict zone.",
