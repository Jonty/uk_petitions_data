        "additional_details": "Therefore, we propose teacher assessed grades taking into consideration our predicted grades for A level and GCSE students. Due to tough times, people have struggled to fully commit to their education and impact of mental health, stress, the lack of equipment and home conditions has not helped contribute to the situation. Many of us feel we have been majorly disadvantaged for our examinations and will struggle to get the grades we really believe we are capable of. Think of our future, do right!",
        "background": "Us students feel as though we have been in a predicament that has left many of us stressed, demoralised and worried for our future. We would like to come forward about the potential cancellation of 2021 exams as we feel we would be severely disadvantaged due to the loss of 6 months worth of content.",
