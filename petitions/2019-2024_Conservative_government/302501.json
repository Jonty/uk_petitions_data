        "additional_details": "Stopping community testing will mean that only hospitalised figures are published - this will cause a very high mortality % and create panic amongst the population.  We cannot guage risk and infection areas and consequently plan and adapt strategy if we do not know what we are dealing with.  People  need information, they will search for it - either provide them with the correct info or they will arm themselves with the misinformation that is readily available.",
        "background": "increase the availability of community testing so that figures will represent the infection rate and death rate more effectively. Anyone with a fever over 38 should have access to a test.  Keeping the information from the public will create doubt in government strategy",
