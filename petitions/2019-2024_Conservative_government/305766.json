        "additional_details": "The UK is going to lose many businesses over the next few months, with many thousands of people being made redundant. As it stands currently, insurance policies don't cover those businesses that are suffering from a lack of income, because the pandemic COVID-19 isn't on a list of Notifiable Diseases. Insurance companies are going to be hit very heavily during this troubling time, but this is exactly why we all pay the premiums year after year. We need COVID-19 adding to this list now.",
        "background": "Make the Government add COVID-19 to the Notifiable diseases list, so companies can claim on their business insurance for loss of earnings. This isn't about big business, this will help protect every Bar, Restaurant, Hotel, Corner Shop, Printer, Builder, Plumber, Delivery Company etc.",
