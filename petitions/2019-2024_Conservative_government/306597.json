Including the self-employed that submitted a self-assessment return on or before the January deadline. \r\n\r\nSmall business and the self-employed have been doing their bit to keep the country going. Now it is time for the Government to support them in return.",

This leaves thousands of small businesses that work from home, due to high rents, vulnerable with no help being offered by any other means.",
