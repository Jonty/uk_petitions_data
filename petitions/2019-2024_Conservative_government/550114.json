These criminals are aware that eventually they will be let out and do not fear prison as they should. Victims are frustrated and angry Thry should be the criminal justice systems main priority, not the criminals human rights. Our whole policy on this matter needs reform.",
        "background": "The country is currently in an epidemic of violent crime. I believe that society as a whole is frustrated with current sentencing guidelines for violent crimes and these need to be increased dramatically.",
