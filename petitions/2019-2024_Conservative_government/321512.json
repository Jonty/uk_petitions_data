        "action": "Extend the grant for the self employed to match the current Furlough Scheme.",
        "additional_details": "Many people who are self employed are unable to go back to work at the end of May. Particularly people in the arts such as Actors, Singers, Stage Crew, Sound Engineers, Theatre workers, Events companies, Comedians, Musicians and many more. Outside of the arts, there are also many self-employed who either can not go back to work or feel it is not safe to do so. The Government needs to take fair and decisive action as soon as possible and extend the grant to all self-employed.",
        "background": "The government has extended the Furlough Scheme until October, yet millions of self-employed will only receive help until the end of May. The government needs to match the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) to the Furlough Scheme so that everyone has a fair chance of financial survival.",
