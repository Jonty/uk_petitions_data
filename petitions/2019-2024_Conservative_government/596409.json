        "additional_details": "I believe banks in the UK should legally have to investigate missing parcels or claimed fraud BEFORE awarding a consumer there money back. \r\nIt's ruining small businesses in the UK that people are able to call there bank say \"I didn't get my stuff\" and get refunded instantly with no investigation, meanwhile businesses like mine are charged for this in additional fees AND the full amount is taken away from us investigations then take MONTHS and even with proof of delivery banks side with the buyer.",
        "background": "Over recent months it has been made easier for consumers to SCAM small businesses by calling the bank saying they didn't receive items even if a small business has evidence of delivery the bank refunds the customer prior to investigations which is wrong.",
