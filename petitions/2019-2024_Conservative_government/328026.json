Most airlines/travel companies/ travel agents are struggling the most due borders being closed. This will take a long time to go back to before coronavirus hit the UK. A lot of us are struggling to either find temp/perm work as all our experience is in the travel industry. A lot of us are uncertain of our futures, whether we are being made redundant or even going through major mental health issues. The world is slowly going back to \u201cnormal\u201d but for now we don\u2019t no when the travel industry will be back to pre-COVID. Please sign to see if the government can help change this for us all!",
