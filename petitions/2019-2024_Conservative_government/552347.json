        "additional_details": "The end of term could be home-based to reduce loss of school time.\r\n\r\nThese plans may not help everyone, but they would allow (subject to prevalent conditions and expert agreement) a significant number of children, parents and grandparents to meet in relative safety over Christmas.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the quarantine and holiday periods will introduce a break in the transmission of covid, meaning that levels will be lower when children return to school and people return to work after the holiday period.",
        "background": "Term should end on or before 9th Dec. so that related families are able to quarantine for a least 14 days before Christmas.\r\n\r\nThis would allow individual bubbles to safely join together for Christmas as there would be a high level of certainty that the bubbles were covid-free before they merge.",
