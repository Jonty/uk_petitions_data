        "action": "Scrapped the plans for a staggered return to universities after Christmas",
        "additional_details": "This plan is extremely detrimental and unworkable for a number of reasons. Firstly, it ignores the fact that students need access to library and other facilities to be able to succeed in their studies, particularly finalists and postgraduate students. Secondly, a significant number of students do not have sufficient working spaces at home to undertake seminars and lectures, especially with a number of students have parents working from home at the moment. \r\n\r\nThis plans also forgets that students are paying extortionate amounts both in rent and tuition fees to access their university's facilities. On the event that the government does not reverse on these plans, students will inevitably refuse to pay for their accommodation and this puts our universities into a terrible financial position.",
        "background": "The government should scrapped the plans to have a staggered arrival back to university until February and instead allow the universities to use the testing capacities they now have available to them to bring students back after the break.",
