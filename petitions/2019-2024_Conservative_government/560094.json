        "additional_details": "Banning the sell/use of fireworks will allow more animals to live free from worry and stress over multiple nights a year. 'hope' the baby zebra died from stress from fireworks and wasn't even 1 year of age. People with PTSD will suffer. They start too early and go on to late. They should only be available for bonfire night and New year's eve, AND NOT to the public.",
        "background": "Ban the sell and use of fireworks to the public as too many wildlife/animals/people are either loosing their life from stress or it's causing more harm than good. Only make them available on bonfire night/new year's eve to places hosting an event.",
