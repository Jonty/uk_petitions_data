        "additional_details": "There are only 14% smokers in the UK, why do 100% of outdoor spaces accommodate them and not the rest of us! Especially since it is killing us and killing the environment. Non-smokers should be able to eat or sit outside without damaging their health. Lockdown has shone a light on this because we cannot be inside, but even when we can, we should be able to enjoy the outdoors too. Ideally I'd like smoking banned from the streets too, but for now I'd settle for restaurants and bars.",
        "background": "It's disgusting and appalling that non-smokers have to eat while having smoke blown on them. This is so wrong that children are breathing in second hand smoke while having lunch. We've known for decades that smoking causes cancer and kills.",
