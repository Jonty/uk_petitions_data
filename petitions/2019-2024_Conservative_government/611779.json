        "additional_details": "To get a fairer return on people choosing to install home renewables and battery systems. We don\u2019t want the feed in tariff prices back but a fair price that is reviewed like the energy cap. Take for instance the price for nuclear is around 9p per kWh at Hinckley. A fairer price would encourage people to invest in home renewables and reduce the overall carbon footprint of households.",
        "background": "We have a pricing cap on the cost of gas/electricity, why do we not have a minimum price set by the government for electricity generated by solar panels or other home renewables. It\u2019s not fair we are getting paid a paltry 2p or 3.5p per kWh when the energy companies will be selling it for 20p to 30p",
