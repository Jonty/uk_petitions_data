        "additional_details": "Where intensive agriculture has decimated biodiversity across the countryside hedgerows remain as last refuges for many species of plant, fungi and invertebrate. That could easily be lost forever should these linear mini woodlands be lost or fail to function as they have done for centuries.\r\nIn circumstances where hedgerows have to be removed, especially ancient hedgerows, these corridors should be reconnected by hedge planting around the development site.",
        "background": "Hedgerows are vital wildlife habitats corridors often connecting some of our most important ancient woodlands and wood pastures. For wildlife to maintain migratory routes and their daily foraging territories essential to life we believe they need the same protection as the afore mentioned habitats",
