Having studied online for almost 2 years and with young people facing mental health issues, the most government can do is have action plan to vaccinate 3rd year university students so a normal graduation can commence as normal.",
        "background": "I would like the government to prioritise young people of this generation who have faced increasing challenges during their studies for the longest. The least we deserve is to celebrate the day we\u2019ve been dreaming of our entire lives. It would be justifiable to prioritise vaccinating.",
