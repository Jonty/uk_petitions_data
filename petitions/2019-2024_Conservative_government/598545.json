A voluntary commitment approach is not going to achieve enough\r\n3.  The external pressure will lead to many innovations and ultimately help businesses\r\n4.  Helps ensure the UK meets its own climate commitments (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-to-go-further-and-faster-to-tackle-climate-change)\r\n5.  Would be a world first, demonstrates climate leadership and is good for the UK brand",

The CCC's responsibilities include the monitoring of \"progress in reducing emissions and achieving carbon budgets and targets\". You can find out more about the CCC here: https://www.theccc.org.uk/.\r\n\r\nIf there are specific changes to the CCC's powers and responsibilities that you'd like to see being made, you could start a petition about that. \r\n\r\nYou might like to sign these petitions which call for related actions:\r\n\r\n'Change the zero carbon emission goals to 2025 instead of 2050': https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/594359\r\n\r\n'Decarbonise UK energy by funding locally-owned renewable micro-grids': https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/594570"
