        "action": "Force Boris Johnson to put UK into lockdown to minimise spread of Coronavirus.",
        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson has gone against advice from the WHO to take action against the spread of COVID-19 now, before cases become even more uncontrollable.\r\nWe should look at China, Italy and Spain's responses to this virus, to avoid overwhelming our NHS even further due to increased spread. \r\nOnly testing hospitalisations will skew figures and lull our nation into a false sense of security. We are calling on the UK Government to act on behalf of the elderly and vulnerable, and put their lives first.",
        "background": "We want Boris Johnson to put the UK into lockdown over the rapid spread of COVID-19. The current measures are not extreme enough to impact the virus significantly, and as a country we face a similar situation to China, Italy and Spain in a matter of weeks and days if we do not act now.",
