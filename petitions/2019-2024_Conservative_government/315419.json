        "additional_details": "prisoners are now suffering. They are in extreme high- risk conditions with no medical support. The justice system is contradicting as is moves them further from rehabilitation. There are people in there for very minimal crimes yet their right to life is being put at stake. There needs to be fast reform because this will have irreversible repercussions to the contrary. By releasing low- risk prisoners, more prisoners can be accommodated and less prisoners will be prone to illness.",
        "background": "People behind bars are living in inhuman conditions. Their human rights are being violated in every aspect. They can only have one shower a week; they\u2019re locked up in confined spaces for weeks at a time; They\u2019ve been mixed with other positive tested inmates; there is an extreme lack of staff.",
