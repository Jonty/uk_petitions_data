Age discrimination is already illegal.

The NHS has stated that people who are 70 or older are at moderate risk, and clinically vulnerable: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/people-at-higher-risk-from-coronavirus/whos-at-higher-risk-from-coronavirus/\r\n\r\nThe Government\u2019s advice on social distancing advises people who are clinically vulnerable to stay at home as much as possible, but there are no regulations or laws that apply to 70 year olds differently to other age groups."
