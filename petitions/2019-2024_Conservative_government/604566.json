        "additional_details": "Many families are being forced into the position where they must fund private dental care for themselves and their children or risk having no dentist available locally to provide NHS treatment. \r\n\r\nMany children will be negatively impacted by the lack of NHS availability and a whole generation of children risk poor dental health because a private route is not financially an option.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to increase funding for NHS dentistry to ensure all children have access to local NHS dental care. \r\n\r\nContracts for NHS dental care should be available to children regardless of whether it is an NHS or private dentist so that no child is denied access to local dental care",
