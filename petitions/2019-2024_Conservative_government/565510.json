        "additional_details": "People who are completely capable of passing their driving tests, and/or who have already booked but have had these constantly rescheduled, have been unable to do so due to test centres being closed and the subsequently having a very long back log making booking a test almost impossible. As such, people are delaying their tests further, or having to pay for another theory test due to circumstances out of their control. An extension of at least 6 months should be provided.",
        "background": "In a similar way that the government have agreed to an extension of MOT tests due to the national lockdown, we believe an extension should be provided to those who have recently passed theory tests but have been unable to complete a practical driving  test due to all national/local lockdowns",
