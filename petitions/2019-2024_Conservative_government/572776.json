There are children and adults that need help but are being ignored or fobbed off. The individual do not receive the help they need or require amd nor do the families receive the support. Mental Health teams need to act faster and need to listen more to the families. We are going through a global pandemic so it is worse now than ever.",
        "background": "I feel like mental health teams are letting families down. There are so many people with mental health and when they try seeking help they get pushed away by being told they're OK or they will be given an appointment 6 weeks down the line but they need help there and then.",
