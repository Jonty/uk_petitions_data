        "additional_details": "School is turning kids into robots and for 6 hours every day, 5 times a week. They think school is a competition, competing with each other to get the highest grade. THAT'S JUST ..... WRONG. I stay up most of the night trying to do my homework but instead, I could be spending time with family. Children who lack confidence shouldn't be forces to say something in front of the class. They made schools for the clever kids and made some schools for the not so clever kids. In some schools, you have to do a test to see how intelligent you are and if you fail you cant go. Imagine all those kids who find out that they cant go to the school they want. UGH School is not a million bricks, but the thousand hearts who carry more dreams than the night sky has stars. Remember that.",
        "background": "I want to change the way they teach children. Doing a test won't predict our future. It won't help us in LIFE. Our school system is completely outdated. We need to encourage more freedom and creativity among children.",
