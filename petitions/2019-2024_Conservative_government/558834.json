        "additional_details": "The benefits of grassroots sport is well documented. Children have suffered enough due to Covid-19 and should not have to have this positive part of their lives taken from them again. \r\n\r\nThe decision to stop grassroots football will have a detrimental effect on many children's lives. This decision is contradictory to so much of the advice relating to young people and should be overturned as soon as possible.",
        "background": "Following Sir Patrick Vallance's comments that he has not seen any evidence of Covid-19 transmissions due to grassroots football, we ask that the government overturn their decision to suspend it during lockdown.",
