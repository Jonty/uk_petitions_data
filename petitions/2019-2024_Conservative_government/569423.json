        "additional_details": "I am able to see first hand how this government is choosing covid treatment over cancer treatment. Both my mother and grandfather were diagnosed with cancer in December. My mum has luckily managed to have an operation in the north of England in the first week of January. However my grandad was told 1 day before his operation in the midlands that his op had been cancelled due to covid-19 and doesn\u2019t know when it will be re-scheduled. Leaving the risk of cancer spreading further into his body.",
        "background": "The people signed into this petition would like the government to tell all NHS cancer services to continue during the covid-19 pandemic and to not cancel much needed operations. Provide additional funding or means to continue this service. The long term affects of no cancer treatment is bigger!",
