        "additional_details": "There is no option of \u2018Non-binary\u2019 on legal forms, ignoring members of the population. This requires the government to pass a law that publicly recognises \u2018Non-binary\u2019 as a part of the GRP under the Gender Recognition Act, a.k.a a legal and valid gender identity option. By recognising Non-binary as a valid gender identity, it would aid in the protection of Non-binary individuals against transphobic hate crimes, and would ease Gender Dysphoria experienced by Non-binary people.",
        "background": "although this petition was made previously there has been no change and the UK government basically just said no. this is not acceptable and we will keep asking. Have non binary be included as an option under the GRP / GRC . As well as having \u2018Non-binary\u2019 be seen as a valid transgender identity.",
