        "additional_details": "Allow the primary schools to re-open again so that parents can focus on their job and secure their financial situation in the current uncertainty, while at the same time contribute to the economy.\r\nChildren would also stop from suffering massively as they do not get a decent access to education in lockdown because of lack of space, IT equipment or wifi connection. \r\nRe-opening primary schools would alleviate the massive burden put on the most vulnerable families in a crisis that affects all of us.",
        "background": "Keeping primary schools closed puts undue pressure on parents to look after their dependable children all the time.\r\nThis takes time energy resources that distract these parents from doing their jobs. This results in anxiety and stress where parents struggle to keep a minimum level of work activity.",
