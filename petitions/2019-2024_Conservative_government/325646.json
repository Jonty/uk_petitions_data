        "additional_details": "I am a current year 10 student and I am aware that in year 10 you learn the core elements of GCSE subjects. We are missing a third of year 10 so we are already disadvantaged, prior to commencing year 11. Also in year 11 the majority of our education is revision. As for year 12, they are also missing a huge chunk of vital learning and are also disadvantaged. We are all very concerned on how we can achieve our full potential and reach our ambitions when there is no teaching taking place. So making us sit these exams would be completely unfair.",
        "background": "Year 10 and 12 students are missing a third of valuable learning in school. Therefore I think it would be extremely unfair for us students to sit these exams next year with no proper teaching or learning taking place.",
