Furthermore it is in breach with Article 3 of the same Human Rights Act as it is degrading the British Citizen. By forcing us to wear a mask, we are being debased (reduced to a lower quality being). This degrading causes us a loss of self-respect. It humiliates and demeans the status of our people - stop passive torture!",
