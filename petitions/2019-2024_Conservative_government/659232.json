        "action": "Ensure HMRC maintains telephone helplines for Self Assessment, VAT and PAYE",
        "additional_details": "HMRC telephone waiting times are increasing, more people are being drawn into tax with tax thresholds frozen, HMRC supposedly wants people to file tax returns early, yet closes the helpline that should be there to help them. The HMRC Charter is a legal requirement under the Finance Act 2009 and says \"We\u2019ll provide services that are designed around what you need to do, and are accessible, easy and quick to use, minimising the cost to you.\" The government needs to ensure HMRC does this.",
        "background": "The Government should ensure that HMRC makes telephone access to help and support for taxpayers available throughout the year. Too many people cannot deal with their queries online and should not have to wait until half the tax year has passed.",
