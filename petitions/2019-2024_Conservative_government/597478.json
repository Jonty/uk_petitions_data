        "additional_details": "We would like the government to reconsider the implementation of COC at this point in time, and to focus on retaining safe staffing levels in maternity services. Not only would this ensure our women are being provided care which is firstly safe, it will reduce the burnout and pressures which are being felt by maternity services. Furthermore, it will reduce the negativity which is currently overwhelming midwives and students across the country.",
        "background": "Maternity services are suffering major staff shortages, and Continuity of Carer (COC) is a major contributor to these shortages. We want the government to listen to our midwives, and our women in what we want out of our maternity services. What we want is to facilitate SAFE care first and foremost.",
