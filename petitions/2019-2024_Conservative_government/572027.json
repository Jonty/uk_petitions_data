        "action": "Reintroduce the original lockdown restrictions in essential retail.",
        "additional_details": "In the first lockdown it was easier to maintain the two metre distance in supermarkets, but the increase in capacity has meant that during the weekends social distancing is almost impossible. We are now at a point where there are even more cases and deaths than there were during the first lockdown, yet double the number of people are permitted into shops at once. This needs to return to the original restrictions to protect staff and customers alike.",
        "background": "Reintroduce the original lockdown restrictions in essential retail, whilst maintaining the enforcement of wearing masks. This means reducing the maximum capacity of customers in supermarkets and other forms of essential retail back to the capacity during the original lockdown.",
