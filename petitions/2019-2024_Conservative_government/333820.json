        "action": "Reschedule psilocybin to reduce unnecessary barriers to mental health research.",
        "additional_details": "The Government must urgently commission the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) to review whether psilocybin should be rescheduled under the 2001 Regulations and if so, into which schedule it fits, and any mitigating actions to prevent risks of misuse/diversion. The Government must act quickly on these recommendations. Moving psilocybin out of Schedule 1 will reduce barriers to investigating it as a breakthrough mental health treatment, addressing the UK\u2019s mental health crisis.",
        "background": "Move psilocybin to Schedule 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001, on a research-only basis, to reduce the unnecessary regulatory barriers to legitimate medical and experimental research, which slow the development of new and vital treatments for mental health conditions in the UK.",
