        "additional_details": "Due to COVID-19, NHS staff and keyworkers have been required to work during the global pandemic which has not been easy for them, they have been working so hard and they have had no choice but to work compared to other workers, who are either working from home or were or currently still on furlough. In addition, without the NHS doctors, staff, nurses and keyworkers, we would have not got through this global pandemic which is still happening now, without them.",
        "background": "All NHS staff that includes nurses, doctors and keyworkers should have an increase in their pay, as they deserve more pay than what they currently receive with all of them working through this challenging global pandemic, help kept the UK going through COVID-19 and still are currently doing so.",
