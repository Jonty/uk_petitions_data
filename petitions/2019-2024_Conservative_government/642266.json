        "action": "Remove the time of travel restrictions on disabled bus passes throughout the UK",
        "additional_details": "The government need to be committed to supporting individuals who live with disabilities. This will stop further discrimination and promote people back in work as it will ease the financal pressure.  As public transport is costly and much less direct than using personally owned vehicles. Those with a bus pass have qualified as a direct result of being unable to hold any form of driving license, due to medical conditions set by the DVLA - a government run organisation.",
        "background": "To stop local councils putting in time restrictions on when disability bus passes can be used. The main consensus is 9:30am. There are many individuals who live with a disability and work in the week and have to use public transport because of being unable to qualify for a driving license.",
