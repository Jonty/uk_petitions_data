The imposition of ULEZ expansion against the wishes of Outer London residents, the detrimental effect on the financial and mental health of a significant number of residents even though only negligable improvement in air quality is anticipated, demonstrates that the current GLA is too large and undemocratic and the Mayor too out of touch, in the interests of true local democracy not local dictatorship it must be broken up.",
