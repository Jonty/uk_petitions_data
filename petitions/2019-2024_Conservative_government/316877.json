Residential tenants are being protected by a moratorium on evictions. There is capacity for support. \r\n\r\nThe political persuasions of students aside, please would the Government exercise compassion for the less vocal?\r\n\r\nMy sincere thanks for giving consideration to this campaign.",

Many low-income students are of course effectively deprived of the opportunity to service their debts.",
