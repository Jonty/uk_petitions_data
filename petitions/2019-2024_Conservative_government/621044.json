However, people don't have to stop and report an accident and due to this, many cats are just left to die at the side of the roads. Only if a kind hearted person stops and takes the poor animal to a vets are owners made aware of their beloved pets fate. This isn't right and should be changed. Pet cats are just as loved as pet dogs and should be treated equally.",
