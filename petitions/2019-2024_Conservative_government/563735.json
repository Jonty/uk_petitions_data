        "additional_details": "This information is of public interest, besides the fact that it would allow for non-political institutions and scientists to independently peer-review the methods used by the alleged scientists of SAGE. This should be the basis for any kind of scientific argument and it is essential to ensure that the measures in place are justified by solid evidence. Furthermore, this is the main action that can be taken to fight the alleged misinformation on the internet that some MPs keep mentioning.",
