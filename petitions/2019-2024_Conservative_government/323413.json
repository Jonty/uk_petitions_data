They deserve to have an annual pay increase that at least gives them a real terms increase. In addition, they have shown their true value in comparison to some MPs. They should at least be given an increase equal to those MPs.",
        "background": "For the remaining term of this Parliament, NHS and Social Care workers should receive an annual pay increase that is greater than the annual inflation rate and equal to or greater than the annual percentage increase given to MPs.",
