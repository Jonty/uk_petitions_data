        "action": "Introduce solidarity tax to pay for Covid debts",
        "additional_details": "The Government should consider a solidarity tax. Germany covered the two trillion Euros for reunification like this. The Government proposes to cover the Covid debt of \u00a3380b by various income taxes, reduction in foreign aid, lowering of council services, public sector pay freezes, etc. This is a depressing \"death of a thousand cuts\". A phased, means-tested solidarity tax is a single, clear tax that will allow recovery in 10 years, yet allow the nation to continue to invest, build and grow.",
        "background": "In times of immense difficulty, such as after wars, the concept of a solidarity tax (or recovery tax, or suchlike) is sometimes introduced. This is essentially a small increment on taxes (such as income, capital gains, etc.) that is already paid, in order to provide for the recovery.",
