        "action": "Do not give consent to the Rampion2 windfarm extension off the coast of Sussex",
        "additional_details": "We believe the proposal to install up to 116 wind turbines in Sussex Bay stretching from Worthing to Selsey will blight the entire horizon along this area of outstanding natural beauty. The turbines will be as tall as 325m, 2.35 times the height of Rampion1 turbines, and higher than any hill in West Sussex. Sited only 8 miles from the shoreline, this proposal will be much nearer land than most offshore windfarms and will impact hard on local communities, the environment and the economy.",
        "background": "Energy companies should be encouraged to invest in windfarms out of sight of land such as the North Sea, enabling connection with the existing offshore grid network and keeping the impact to a minimum. Here stronger and more consistent winds should result in higher efficiencies than in the Channel.",
