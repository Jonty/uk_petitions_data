        "additional_details": "It's time to invest in our healthcare system, ensuring every patient receives the standard of care they deserve.The current state of Northwich Park Hospital is unacceptable. Its tired and outdated facilities not only fail to meet basic standards of cleanliness but also undermine the morale of both patients and staff. A total upgrade is not just a luxury; it's a fundamental requirement for restoring dignity to healthcare in Brent and Harrow.",
        "background": "Upgrading the facilities at Northwich Park Hospital is not just a necessity, it's an imperative. Serving communities as vital as Brent and Harrow demands infrastructure that matches the scale of their needs.",
