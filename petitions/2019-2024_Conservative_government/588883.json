Your petition calls for 52 weeks of leave for new fathers, but refers to this as being \"negotiable\". Employees are already able to seek additional leave from employers, and employers can offer paternity leave beyond the statutory minimum. Fathers may also be able to take time off under Share Parental Leave: https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
