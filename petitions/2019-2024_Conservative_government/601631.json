These feel-good feelings are contagious, encouraging even kinder. When taught in schools it has the ability to reduce bullying.",
        "background": "Due to increase in cyber-bullying, I propose the government adds teaching Kindness as part of the school curriculum. Being kind has many physical, mental and emotional health benefits.\r\n\r\nIn recent study it revealed almost two thirds of British 16\u201324-year-olds (64%) have engaged in cyber-bullying.",
