Schools had to close to protect staff, children, families and slow the spread of the virus. Why do early years remain open and do not have access to lateral tests to insure the safety of everyone?\r\nI believe it is paramount to ensure the safety of Early Years settings.\r\nI would like to ask the government to proceed closing all Early Years settings to protect all and slow the spread of the virus.",
