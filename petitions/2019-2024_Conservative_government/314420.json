        "additional_details": "UAL has stated they will assess previous units to come to a \u201cfair\u201d decision for a final grade but prior units leading up to the final major project are marked on a pass/fail. Colleges prompted students to prepare for the final major project, so we did not do more than required for our previous units.We will be marked on work that is not reflective of our ability. This needs to be altered to match A levels, as it seems more consideration has been given to those and we have been left to wonder.",
        "background": "We need parliament to review UAL\u2019s grading for this academic year to ensure fair grading. A lot of students have prepared all year for our final major project, performing poorly on other subjects to ensure enough time to find out we have to update all units within a month which is very unrealistic.",
