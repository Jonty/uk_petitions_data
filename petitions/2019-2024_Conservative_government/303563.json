        "additional_details": "In such unprecedented situation if the days in self-isolation/ being hospitalised  are being counted as sick days it will leave a huge impact financially. No one should be punished for doing the right thing for a situation they have no control of. The current SSP is insufficient for the people to survive for a week as the cost of living has increased. Specially in the present situation people might be unable to work for weeks if impacted. Either increased SSP or normal pay should be considered.",
        "background": "The government should increase weekly SSP pay for those affected by COVID19. Alternatively, it should consider them as normal working days and instruct employers to give the normal pay if employees are affected or in self isolation.",
