        "additional_details": "The case has been consistently made that aquatic & physical indoor activity is both safe & a lifeline for many people in such uncertain times & that leisure centres should therefore be considered an essential service.\r\nThere are fewer options available to exercise outdoors through the cold winter months than there were during the first, summer, lockdown.\r\nResearch published by ukactive shows there had been only 78 confirmed cases among >22 million visits between 25 July and 13 September.",
        "background": "Allow swimming pools, leisure centres & gyms to remain open in spite of the most recent lockdown announcement (31.10.20) on the basis that these are well managed environments where the risk of transmission is low & a 2nd period of closure will push many facilities into permanent closure.",
