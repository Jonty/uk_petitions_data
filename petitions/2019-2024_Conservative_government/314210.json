        "additional_details": "3rd year student nurses were scrapped of the NHS bursary, and any financial support. Meaning, we have had to take loans out to fund our degree; all while still having to work, look after our families, attend placements, complete academic work and any other responsibilities. We are now being asked by the Government to risk the safety of ourselves and our families to relieve the pressures of the NHS during this time. We want to help, its what we do. But we ask for some help in return.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to consider wiping all 3rd year student nurses student finance debt. During the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of 3rd year students have selflessly agreed to join the front line of the NHS. We feel we have given everything we have got and had nothing in return.",
