        "additional_details": "We want to ensure young people are properly taught about the importance of keeping healthy. In the 2020, we saw the Government make PSHE (Physical, Social and Health Education) mandatory curriculum material across schools in the UK. Despite this welcomed step, this legislation left it up to schools to develop curriculum based on their chosen topics. This weak legislation means there is little ensuring proper teaching of Physical Health Education in schools - so feel this change is necessary!",
        "background": "We want the Government and Department for Education (DfE) to standardize the teaching of 'Diet and Nutrition' across all levels of Education, by releasing \u2018Subject Content Requirements\u2019 (as done for GCSE and A-Level Qualification Courses) for the mandated standards of teaching healthy food and diet.",

This is different to the national curriculum, which sets out the content that schools are required to teach.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
