        "additional_details": "As a carer it's your responsibility to assist with daily tasks which include taking the person with a disability to appointments, shopping and general transport to give them independence. A lot of carers are unable to be in full-time work due to caring responsibilities so they struggle to find money for driving which would greatly help them with their caring duties and enable them to do a better job at it in a more timely and cost efficient manner as opposed to constantly paying for transport.",
        "background": "Have funding to help carers pay for driving lessons so they can fulfil their caring duties.\r\n\r\nFunding is accessible for people with disabilities to get help with driving lesson costs but none is available for carers. Some people with disabilities are unable to drive and rely on carers for transport",
