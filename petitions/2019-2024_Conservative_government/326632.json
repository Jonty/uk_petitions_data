        "action": "Make LGBTQ+/BAME history (and relevant sex education) compulsory in UK schools",
        "additional_details": "As a second generation immigrant and member of the LGBTQ+ community (albeit white and straight presenting), I have seen a distinct lack of education in regards to these two groups in the British education system. Friends of mine have countless stories of homophobia, transphobia and racism directed towards them. Equality can only be brought about through education.\r\nChildren deserve to see people like themselves in their history lessons rather than yet another rich, white king,",
        "background": "Include mention of LGBTQ+ figures in history such as Martha P. Johnson, Harvey Milk or George Cecil Ives, and the inclusion of gay people in sex education.\r\nFurthermore, include in depth education on how the UK became as diverse as it is such as Windrush or the influx of Indian refugees from Uganda.",
