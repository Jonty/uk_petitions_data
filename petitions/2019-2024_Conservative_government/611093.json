Alarmingly the country has lost significant momentum in this huge public health opportunity and there is a genuine fear that we will miss the nation\u2019s 2034 smoking free target.",
        "background": "We are calling on the UK Government to impose an outright ban on smoking and develop a public health strategy for vaping. We are now calling for a radical approach by the UK Government to ban smoking completely and develop a strategy for vaping that will transform the health of the nation.",
