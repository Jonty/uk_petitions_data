        "additional_details": "By introducing a new scheme it will ensure that everyone has a chance at becoming a home owner. Buying a house is a difficult experience as it is, and first time buyers can just about afford the average house price. By allowing a certain percentage of houses to be purchased by first time buyers it will give them an opportunity to start on the property ladder and invest in their future. First time buyers should have a more supportive scheme to help them on the market.",
        "background": "With more and more investors purchasing houses to then resell or rent out, this is giving first time buyers minimal chances to buy houses they can afford and preventing their chances of getting on the property ladder. A new scheme should be introduced to make it a fair system.",

You can find out more about these schemes here: https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/help-to-buy-homebuy-and-other-housing-schemes\r\n\r\nIf you want the Government to create a new scheme or make current schemes more generous you could start a new petition requesting this, but would need to be clear exactly what changes you want the Government to make to current support."
