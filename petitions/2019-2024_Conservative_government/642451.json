As more pubs are either tied, or free houses sign contracts that limit their selection to beer provided by large centralised suppliers, often increasing prices by 200-300%, small independent breweries have found that their local market has been unfairly restricted. This would also allow people to support small local businesses/employers and reduce carbon footprints. Support local !",
