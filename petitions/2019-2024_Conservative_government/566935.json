        "additional_details": "Thousands of students online have expressed how neglected they have felt since lockdown one in March 2020. Government guidelines have been consistently unclear as to where university students stand, and students have not been receiving the quality of learning promised before enrolling at their universities. Combined with support in place (or lack thereof, as vocalised by many) a degree today isn\u2019t worth \u00a39250, as standard, under normal circumstances - and these are not normal circumstances.",
        "background": "Reimburse all students affected by the impact of Covid-19, namely lockdown procedures that have prohibited the quality of learning expected from a \u00a39250 annual investment.",
