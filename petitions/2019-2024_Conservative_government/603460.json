        "action": "No Mandatory Covid Passport in England.",
        "additional_details": "An individuals medical history is a private matter between themselves and their doctor. This passport will remove all forms of medical privacy. The passport will ultimately have an adverse effect on the most marginalised people of the country, will lead to a paper carrying society and lead to even further forms of state control over individuals e.g. ID cards, mandatory vaccines, fines and imprisonment. We only need to look at Europe and Australia to see its a slippery slope to authoritarianism.",
        "background": "We rebuke the introduction of a mandatory Covid passport for the people of England. These passports have been proven not to stop the spread of Covid, they will be used to restrict peoples freedoms and are a way to coherse people into giving up their bodily autonomy.",
