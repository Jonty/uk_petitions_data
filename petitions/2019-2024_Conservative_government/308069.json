        "additional_details": "Without our government setting out a mandatory holiday on rents & utilities for high street retailers many will be forced to close it's stores & go out of business altogether. Utility companies & property owners will continue charge retailers when they have no money coming into their businesses & this is a situation that could go on for months, forcing many to close. Unless our government takes action now we could loose the very high street we have been struggling to save since last recession.",
        "background": "To give all high street retailers a rent and utilities holiday during the Covid-19 pandemic. This would help save our high streets from collapse during this uncertain time and help secure thousands of jobs in this sector.",
