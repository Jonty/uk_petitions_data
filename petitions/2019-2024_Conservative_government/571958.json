        "additional_details": "The Lockdowns have had serious negative effects on this country and our society, the powers granted to the government by the government under the Coronavirus Act have been sweeping and absolute and without recourse.\r\nWe wish for a referendum to decide if this should be allowed to continue, or indeed if this type of sweeping rescinding of rights of ordinary people should ever be permitted at all.\r\nA return to normal will be expected should the government lose in the referendum.",
        "background": "We the undersigned want the government to implement a binding referendum to allow or dispel ALL powers of the current & future lockdowns & the Coronavirus Act.\r\nThe binding agreement should not allow for any other Lockdown except without express consent of the people.",
