So if the UK Government was to relax the current restrictions on the prescribing Medicinal Cannabis by GP's, it could be  properly regulated.",

We therefore can't accept petitions calling for certain medicines to be prescribed to people with particular conditions, as this is not something the Government or Parliament are responsible for."
