        "action": "Abolish all tuition fees for hero nurses, implement a bursary and a pay rise.",
        "additional_details": "Currently student nurses are being asked to care for CoVid-19 patients, for free, and paying for the privilege through tuition fees. The disastrous decision to remove the nursing bursary has led to a decrease of a third in numbers applying to nursing, and now we are seeing some of the implications of this as the government scrambles to bring nurses back from retirement and students to the front line. We need to encourage more nurses to train and show our gratitude to them financially.",
        "background": "Abolish all tuition fees for nurses, including those in training. Implement nursing bursaries which cover living expenses so that no student nurse struggles financially while they are doing such important and irreplacable work. Without nurses, no NHS. These heroes need a pay rise.",
