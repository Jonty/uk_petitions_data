To add financial burden to maintain this service during a viral pandemic, where over the 75\u2019s are in the highest risk group, in a civilised society is unacceptable.",
        "background": "We call upon Government to maintain free TV licences for over 75\u2019s whilst they are being advised to self isolate against Coronavirus. Forcing extra financial pressure on this at risk group is unacceptable. TV is not only a companion for those self isolating, but a vital source of news & information.",
