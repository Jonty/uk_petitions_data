Without a proven way of minimising health risks to the UK population, efforts to help the economy may fail. The Channel 4 programme \"The Country that Beat the Virus..\", broadcast on 13 May 2020, demonstrated the effectiveness of mass testing and tracing in South Korea. Well organised and resourced mass testing and tracing in the UK should protect the health of the population and facilitate a strong economic recovery.",

The mass testing and tracing carried out in South Korea has demonstrated its likely effectiveness. The level of C-19 deaths in South Korea has only been in the hundreds.",
