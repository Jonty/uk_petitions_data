        "action": "Allow for 2020 A-Level students to appeal against Centre Assessed Grades",
        "additional_details": "I am writing this petition for more clarity to those affected by the announcement today. Initially there was a system in place which would have had a valid mock grade used for students who felt the algorithm affected them, and this also helped students downgraded by their centre. I am calling for more clarity on the appeals process for students who were not moderated but feel their Centre Assessed Grade does not correlate with mock results or previous teacher predictions.",
        "background": "Due to schools not wanting to be investigated/moderated, many students would have been underestimated by teachers in Centre Assessed Grades and missed their chance at top universities. This petition aims for a solution for students whose Centre Assessed Grades were lower than their mock results.",
