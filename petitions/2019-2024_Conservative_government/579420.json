        "additional_details": "Sexually harassing people of any gender should have no place anywhere, the UK is one of the most developed nations in the world but how can that be the case when countless women here feel unsafe leaving their homes?\r\n\r\nAccording to a YouGov questionnaire: 97% of women aged 18-24 said they had been sexually harassed, 80% of women of all ages said they\u2019d been sexually harassed in a public space. \r\n\r\nCountries such as France and Belgium have already successfully criminalised this, why haven\u2019t we?",
        "background": "People all over the UK (particularly women and girls) feel unsafe due to the high levels of sexual harassment in public spaces.\r\n\r\nThe need for women to take precautions against sexual harassment every time they set foot in public is dystopian, it\u2019s outrageous that public sexual harassment is legal.",
