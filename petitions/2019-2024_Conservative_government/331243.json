Some hospitals will charge NHS workers \u00a377 A DAY to park there! This isn't right. Get the Conservatives out and put a party in charge who actually cares about people. Allow an online vote so that we can do it from home and stop the spread of COVID.",
        "background": "The Conservatives have made the UK into a shambles. They have no idea what they're doing with Brexit, they allowed COVID-19 into the country, they have caused 44,000 deaths, they have stood there clapping the NHS, while at the same time, cutting their salaries and making them pay for parking.",
