I have lived in Runcorn for most of my life, and have worked there since 2008. I now travel from St. Helens and this has a real impact on my quality of life due to the unwarranted additional costs I incur each month.",
        "background": "The Government should fund free travel on the Mersey Gateway for people who commute to work in Runcorn or Widnes. People coming to work in these towns are already directly contributing to the area by working there and spending money in shops etc, and to be charged \u00a32.00+ per crossing is too much.",
