        "additional_details": "1. Generally many pupils wear school uniform more than once and due to Covid this is very unsafe.\r\n2. School uniform can be expensive for families from poorer backgrounds\r\n3. Pupils would be more comfortable and feel more free wearing their own clothes rather than school uniform.\r\n4. Some schools don\u2019t offer summer wear, it can be too hot, students can lose concentration.\r\n5. School uniform is boring when you wear it 5 days a week.",
