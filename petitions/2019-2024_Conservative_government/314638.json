        "additional_details": "As we are about to face the height of the pandemic in the UK us on the frontline are scared to work. Currently even if the patient is Covid19+ we only have a surgical mask -most are expired- a flimsy sleeveless apron & glasses. Without increased PPE its a lose-lose situation for everyone. We will inevitably contract the virus further passing it on to loved ones becoming yet another statistic. As a result we will not be able to work reducing staff on the front line treating & caring for patients.",
        "background": "Please reassess the minimal standard of PPE for those, in particular the ambulance service, who are on the front line. We have less protection than those who are working in the sterile, controlled environment of the hospital. Surgical masks do not protect us, at best we need FFP3s and level D tyvek.",
