        "additional_details": "Simply..it will save lives. 1 in 6 young people in the UK experience a mental health issue. This is an appalling statistic which will affect the future of our country, and its effects in society will be revealed in the near future if there is lack of action. There is no medicine or quick fix remedy to mental illness, therefore it\u2019s necessary the government invests in long term programs to support those facing mental challenges. The country requires more social infrastructure. It\u2019s time for action.",
        "background": "The UK Gov needs to implement more schemes which support those who have poor and declining mental health. CAHMS is underfunded and a plethora of young people are unhappy with the service it provides. Different therapies, improved psychiatric wards etc would help to tackle the mental health epidemic.",
