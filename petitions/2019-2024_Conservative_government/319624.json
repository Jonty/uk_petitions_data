        "additional_details": "Inevitably many people will find themselves struggling after the crisis. Banks with their risk-adverse behavior, will not support many people during the hardship that will come. More extraordinary measures are necessary. It will be a great help to overcome the challenges ahead if more liquidity is provided directly to people and backed by the government. Loans of up to 25% the previous declared salary to PAYE individuals will help the nation bounce back quicker and return to full employment",
        "background": "The lock down measures have affected many people who were perfectly solvent before the crisis. Similarly to the measures to support business with loans up to 25% of turnover backed by the government, it will also be great for the economy if individuals could borrow up to 25% of last year salary",
