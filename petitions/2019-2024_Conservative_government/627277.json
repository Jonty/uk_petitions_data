        "additional_details": "If a Prime minister is sacked or resigns before a full term then their pension should be based on their last ministerial job it is time that the tax payers stopped having to pay for failure at the highest level, for years the government has kept the state pension well below our European neighbours whilst benefitting from golden handshakes this should start with the latest failed Prime ministers who have failed the country whilst pensioners have to scrimp and save to pay their bills time to stop.",
        "background": "At the moment the Prime minister's are coming and going like hot cakes in a space of less than a year but they are entitled to a large Prime miniteral pension for life of over a \u00a3100,000 this makes a mockery of the pension system and many hard working personnel have to strive for a state pension.",
