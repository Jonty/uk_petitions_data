        "additional_details": "Roughly 1 in 6 people over the age of 75 and 1 in 3 people over the age of 80 have dementia or memory deterioration.\r\n\r\nSymptoms include memory loss, confusion and problems with hearing, speech and understanding (Alzheimer's Society, 2019). We cannot allow this sector of our most vulnerable peoples to be subject to fines and/or prosecution for not having the correct TV License.\r\n\r\nI am not personally affected by this ruling but understand its implications on our most vulnerable. This cannot stand.",
        "background": "People aged 75 and above should not be required to pay for or face prosecution for not being covered by a TV Licence in this day and age. The over 75s constitute less than 8% of the UK population, must we force them to dig into their savings and pensions for one of life's lessening pleasures?",
