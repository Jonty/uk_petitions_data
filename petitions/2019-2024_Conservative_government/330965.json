        "additional_details": "In an article published by the BBC, it states that the UK has licensed \u00a35.3bn worth of arms to Saudi Arabia since 2015. As a result of this, The UN has verified the deaths of at least 7,700 civilians and said 60% of these were due to bombing raids by the Saudi-led coalition. \r\nIn Yemen, an estimated 14 million men, women and children are now at risk of starvation.\r\n\r\nBy selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, the UK is actively contributing to the conflict that is destroying Yemen and it needs to end.",
        "background": "Just days ago, the UK government made the decision to resume the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia despite concerns that they could be used on innocent civilians in Yemen, a country that is now facing the biggest humanitarian crisis since World War 2.",
