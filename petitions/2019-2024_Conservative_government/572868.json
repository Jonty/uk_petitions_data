        "additional_details": "Currently buyers and sellers in the property chain can pull out of the sale up to the point of contract exchange, this can often be weeks into the process. Which often this leaves people scrambling to find another buyer or having to pull out of the sale altogether. Having some form of tie when agreeing property sales would prevent this from happening, causing less stress and anxiety when dealing with a property sale/purchase. Unless there is extreme circumstances this should not be possible.",
        "background": "Mirror the Scottish standard for house buying and introduce a process similar to a conclusion of missives, to house purchases in England to prevent buyers/sellers pulling out of a sale before the exchange of contracts has taken place, without any penalties.",
