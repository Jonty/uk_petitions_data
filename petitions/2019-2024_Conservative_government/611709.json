        "additional_details": "With the increased cost of living already posing a significant strain on employees and the fact that this business mileage rate has not been increased since the 2011/2102 tax year, I feel that this would be a welcome relief to the hard workers of this country. This mileage allowance ultimately covers all maintenance and fuel as well as well as the significant reduction in value of personal transportation which is being used to boost the economy and ensure critical services are kept running.",
        "background": "Due to the fact we are fast approaching 200p per litre of diesel, I personally feel that the 45p business mileage rate should be increased to at least 60p a mile in order to reflect inflation.",
