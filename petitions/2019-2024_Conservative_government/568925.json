        "action": "Ban the use of neonicotinoids which are a serious danger to Bees",
        "additional_details": "We have lost a third of our bee population in the last decade and insects populations have dramatically fallen. Evidence suggests the pesticides harm bee brain development, weaken immune systems and can leave bees unable to fly.  The EU thus passed a law preventing the use of them. \r\n\r\nPost Brexit, the government is already rolling back environmental protections that will allow even further harm to our already damaged and fragile ecosystem.",
        "background": "Post-Brexit the government has given permission for the use of Neonicotioids, currently banned in the EU, to beet farmers. We would like the government to commit to upholding AT LEAST all environmental protections covered by EU law and to reverse their position, and ban the use of neonicotinoids.",
