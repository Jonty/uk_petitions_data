        "additional_details": "It saddens me to the core that nothing of any impact is being done by the UK government to stop this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. People are stuck surrounded by an imminent threat of attack from all directions, with no commercial flights available to leave. It is a very scary situation.\r\n\r\nIf approved this would allow family members of British citizens to reach safety, and reach their family, by granting them access to the UK from Poland or any other country they are able to flee to.",
        "background": "This is a petition to help all those Ukrainian people in the UK, (who are either now British citizens or UK residents, and whom will have worked hard and brought value to the country), to get the British government to grant an emergency VISA allowing their family to enter the UK.",
