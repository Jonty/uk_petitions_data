Once it receives over 100,000 signatures, the Petitions Committee considers whether to schedule it for debate.\r\n\r\nThe Petitions Committee consists of eleven MPs from different political parties and it sits within the House of the Commons. You can see the membership of the Committee here: https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/326/petitions-committee/membership/\r\n\r\nNone of the MPs in the Committee are ministers within the Government.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition that asks for a rule change so that, once a petition reaches over 100,000 signatures, it's debated within at least 90 days.
