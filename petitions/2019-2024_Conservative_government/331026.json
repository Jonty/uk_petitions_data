        "action": "Allow Mortgage interest deductible @ 100% for the financial year 2020-2021.",
        "additional_details": "It is not satisfactory for the government to allow tenants a three month holiday in not paying their rent and not allow evictions to take place before 3 months of non payment. If a mortgage interest holiday is requested to the mortgage lender, the interest on the mortgage is raked up. This policy was introduced as part of the Covid-19 pandemic, and therefore as a direct result of this pandemic, I don;t think it is unreasonable for the government to allow 100% mortgage interest to be deducted for 2020-2021 tax year.",
        "background": "The government has reduced the amount of Mortgage interest deductible over the last few years from 100% to 0%. This petition is for the government to consider allowing 100% Mortgage interest to be deducted for the financial year 2020-2021.",
