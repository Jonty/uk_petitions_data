        "additional_details": "I had COVID-19 in January and received a phone call from the NHS recently. They explained that the plasma in my blood could save lives and help fight the virus. I asked wether being gay was still an issue. Their response was \u201cI\u2019m sorry but we won\u2019t be able to continue this process. We hope that in the near future that regulations will be changed so that sexual orientation isn\u2019t an issue.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s 2021 and I\u2019d like to think I live in one of the most forward thinking countries in the world. So why is my blood \u201cthat apparently has the potential to save lives\u201d not good enough in comparison to a heterosexuals blood? It\u2019s disgusting even if we weren\u2019t in the middle of a global pandemic.",
        "background": "I think that in 2021 there should be no space discrimination based on sexuality. The rules and regulations regarding blood donation should be changed. So many lives are not being saved due to this prejudice.",
