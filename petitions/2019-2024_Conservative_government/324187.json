        "additional_details": "According to the Institute for Public Policy Research, this bill would make 69% of our current EU workforce ineligible for a visa, including 66% of the people currently working in our health and social care sector. This pandemic has highlighted how deeply we rely upon, and must value, migrant workers, especially those we label as low-skilled. In the words of MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy, this bill is \"a slap in the face to those many key workers... who have been our backbone throughout this pandemic\".",
        "background": "I urge the government to rethink this bill, which replaces free movement with a salary threshold of \u00a325,600, in favour of a fair policy which does not retrospectively strip people of their rights, or at the very least to extend the list of shortage occupations to include care workers.",
