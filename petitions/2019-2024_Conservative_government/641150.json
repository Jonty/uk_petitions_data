        "additional_details": "The hike of 65% in IHS fees along with a hike of 15-20% in visa fees makes most sponsored jobs except the very high paying ones economically unsustainable.\r\n\r\nFor a family of four settling in the UK after 5 years, the total visa fees and IHS would amount to approximately \u00a333,000. This exorbitant sum places an extreme strain on families who are seeking to contribute positively to the UK society and economy.",
        "background": "Please rollback or reduce the quantum of the exorbitant hike in the Health Surcharge (IHS) for skilled worker visas and students. The increase, from \u00a3624 to \u00a31035 per year for workers and from \u00a3470 to \u00a3776 per year for students, places an overwhelming financial burden on individuals & families",
