        "action": "Ensure student nurses are paid during placement",
        "additional_details": "Student nurses are put under a great deal of stress during placement as they have to figure out travel arrangements/costs and some also have to figure out childcare arrangements. All this whilst also ensuring they complete documents for uni. They have their own patients to care for once in 2nd year and by the end act as registered nurses so it is unfair for them to be working for free. The hours and lack of sleep don't allow for part time jobs and bills are increasing, which adds onto the stress",
        "background": "To allow student nurses to be paid for placement, even if it's minimum wage, as the 5k bursary isn't sufficient. It doesn't cover all travel, uniform and childcare costs, and doesn't take non-financial factors into account e.g. working same hours and jobs as RNs, under same/worse conditions for free",
