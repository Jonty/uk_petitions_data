        "additional_details": "The two above measures are extreme and they are reflective of the extreme health crisis this country is facing. Lockdown appears inevitable and will have significant financial impact. If action is not taken, people risk being made homeless. Bad for health & lockdown.\r\n\r\nWhile Universal Credit is being made available for those unable to work due to the lockdown, it is unrealistic to expect this to cover most people's rent and cannot be used to cover mortgage payments. Further action is required.",
        "background": "The Government should ask banks and other lenders to to freeze mortgage payments by default for the duration of any coronavirus lockdown. Furthermore, notice given to evict a tenant for rent arrears incurred as a consequence of coronavirus should be treated as unreasonable by default.",
