        "additional_details": "Asylum seekers traveling to the UK via what the government terms \u201cunnecessary and dangerous routes\u201d could be fitted with GPS tagging systems. \r\n\r\nSome asylum seekers could also be subject to curfews and exclusions from certain locations with the potential for detention and prosecution. \r\n\r\nThis punitive approach has the real potential to cause exponential suffering to those already fleeing war, persecution, famine, discrimination and poverty. \r\n\r\nThe plans should be prohibited immediately.",
        "background": "The UK governments plans to electronically surveillance and monitor asylum seekers crossing the English Channel should be prohibited immediately and permanently. The government should seek alternative means to support the welfare and safety of asylum seekers crossing the English Channel to the UK.",
