These animals do not deserve to be culled at the expense of human intrusion. Animals in zoos have provided both education and entertainment for years - it should not be considered acceptable to dispose of them as and when convenient. Science has proved that many of these species are sentient beings; it would be unjust and inhumane to dismiss exploring alternatives to euthanasia.",
