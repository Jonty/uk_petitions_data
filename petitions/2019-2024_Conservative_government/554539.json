        "additional_details": "The hair & beauty industry is known for already having strict health and safety policies, this has now been enhanced with the new COVID-19 guidelines, even before the guidelines hands were washed and tools sterilised constantly.\r\nFor some people, staff at salons are the only people they may speak to that day! Hairdressers & beauty therapists are not just making people look better on the outside but feel better inside too, helping people to be calm & cope better at this extremely stressful time.",
        "background": "Around 95% of recent salon reviews are stating how Covid compliment salons are.
