        "action": "Cancel GCSE/A levels in 2022, replace them with coursework + teacher assessments",
        "additional_details": "Many students across the UK have expressed that they feel that their current learning circumstances have had huge negative and long term impacts on their learning. Paying attention to online lessons has proven difficult for many and the transition from online to in school has been hard, impacted by the physical and mental health issues provoked by the pandemic. It would also be unfair to A level students to expect them to succeed in exams after not getting to experience them at GCSE.",
        "background": "GCSE and A level students' grades should be calculated using coursework, school work and their teachers' judgement or predicted grades. It is unfair to expect students who have received impaired teaching online or even in school to perform as well as they would had there not been a pandemic.",
