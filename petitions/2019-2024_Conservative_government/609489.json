        "background": "This country claims to have very high animal welfare standards. This is not enough. Try telling this to a pig in a gas chamber! Yet, we still put animals into gas chambers, mutilate and abuse them, poison them and experiment on them. Animals matter almost as much, if not just as much, as humans do.",
