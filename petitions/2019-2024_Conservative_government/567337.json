        "additional_details": "Neither young children nor carers at pre-schools can effectively socially distance or wear masks. There is much face to face and hands on contact (changing nappies etc). Staff and their families are being placed at an unacceptable risk. Families of children attending are at risk. Pre-schools are not in a position to make this decision for themselves they must follow Government guidelines or lose funding / be unable to pay staff.",
        "background": "If schools are closed to prevent the spread of Covid, pre-schools must also be closed. Pre-schools are less safe than schools. The scientist on BBC breakfast today January 5th clearly stated that pre-schools are not a safe environment. The decision to keep them open is political only.",
