        "additional_details": "My daughter is 14 and recently been diagnosed with coeliac disease. It is a struggle finding foods which are suitable for her to eat which do not contain gluten and although supermarkets are starting to provide more choice in this area, I find that fast food chains are behind the times with very little or no choice. My daughter wants to be able to eat out when she goes out with friends and it is frustrating for her that there is so little choice despite 1 in 100 people having coeliac disease.",
        "background": "Make fast food chains and restaurants provide gluten free meals so that people with conditions such as coeliac disease have the opportunity to eat from there and don't feel discriminated against on the basis that they have an hidden illness making them unable to eat foods containing gluten.",
