When child maintenance is paid it can make a significant difference to the lives of families.\r\n\r\nWith 100,000 children in the UK having only one parent that provides for them, and over a third of children covered by collect and pay cases not receiving a penny of what they are legally entitled to, more efficient laws need to be put in place to ensure children get what is legally owed to them via the CMS.",

Yet with over 40,000 parents not paying child maintenance  and half a billion owed in maintenance arrears, the current system that is designed to protect children is failing them.\r\n\r\nSomething needs to be done to change this.",

You can find out what actions the CMS can take here:\r\nhttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7774/\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to make non-payment of child maintenance a criminal offence, with custodial penalties for offenders, if that's what you want to happen. If you want the Government to make any other changes to how parents apply for child maintenance, or requirements to pay child maintenance, you'd need to be clear what changes you want.\r\n\r\nWe only reject petitions that don\u2019t meet the petition standards."
