        "additional_details": "Petrol and diesel prices have risen approximately 35 to 40% over the last 6 months and are at their highest levels for 5 years. These prices are also increasing at a continuous rate weekly which is significantly affecting motorists financially, especially those that need to use their cars to commute to work.\r\nA temporary reduction in duty would be welcomed until prices have stabilised and then the Govt can bring the duty back to normal levels. Electric cars aren't affordable to all motorists yet.",
        "background": "A temporary reduction in fuel duty on petrol and diesel sales until oil and/or fuel prices stabilise or drop.",
