        "action": "Do not neglect climate change efforts during coronavirus economic recession",
        "additional_details": "Coronvirus is rightly attracting the world governments' full attention and the world's economy must be protected. But when this is over, we must be extremely careful to continue to invest in carbon neutral/carbon negative initiatives and NOT lock in fossil fuel investments as a knee-jerk reaction to fixing the economy after the epidemic. We must think long term - decarbonization is just as vital as before to protect our Earth and our children. Please sign to support.",
        "background": "Coronavirus is affecting hundreds of thousands globally and causing many personal tragedies. It also looks likely to cause a global financial recession. But global decarbonization efforts MUST continue with the same, and more, intensity as before. Please do not reduce climate change investment!",
