        "additional_details": "For years, the education system has never accurately articulated the UK\u2019s involvement in the slave trade. Africans were used as a commodity for colonialism while being treated inhumanly. Today we learn that Black British tax payers contributed to clearing the debt used to free their ancestors from slavery almost 200 years later. Now is the time for Britain to think seriously about reparations for slavery and this is a start.",
        "background": "I would like the government to reimburse Black British tax payers for their portion of taxes used to pay off the debt which the UK incurred to compensate slave owners by granting free education up to an undergraduate degree for past, current and future students.",
