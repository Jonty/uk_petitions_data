Stafford hospital is pretty much closed for most incidents (as they couldn\u2019t cope) so all are referred to university Stoke hospital and they cannot cope now. Doctors are struggling, dentists as well! There is nothing to do as most of the high street has closed down. What are these men going to do throughout the day, limited funds, cannot get a job and very small accommodation. The site was for 556 students so how are the managing to squeeze in 700 people and also only having 12 people to look/support them?!?!",
