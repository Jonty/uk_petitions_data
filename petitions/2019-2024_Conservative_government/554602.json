        "additional_details": "Many students across the UK have lost employment due to the COVID-19 Crisis. Although students receive a student loan for many that is not enough and many struggle to get by, which is why many students get jobs while at University; so far to the extent that 21% of students have two jobs while studying and 36% have one (theboar.org, 2019). However, students are currently unable to claim Universal credit unless they fit very specific criteria making them not eligible for this kickstart scheme.",
