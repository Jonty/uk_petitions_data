It is a choice for employers who they furlough.\r\n\r\nFines for committing offences by breaking the Government's rules on social distancing are imposed by the police. You could start a new petition calling for the Government to increase the penalties for breaking these rules, including by making the penalty 80% of the offender's income if that is what you would like to see happen.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following similar petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nTougher penalties for not following the Covid 19 rules: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/314400\r\n\r\nIncrease fines for breaking Covid-19 regulations to \u00a31000 for first offense: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/320026\r\n\r\nMake Covid19 Non Compliance Fines min \u00a310,000 & use to fund NHS/Key Worker PPE: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/315520"
