        "additional_details": "Few people realise that Britain is home to temperate rainforest, a globally rare and important habitat. The rainforests are astonishingly beautiful, and they are wildlife- and carbon-rich habitats, home to many rare and unique species of lichens, mosses, fungi, birds, insects and mammals. Despite their significance, Britain\u2019s temperate rainforests now only remain in fragmented pockets, but there is considerable potential for the habitat to expand across the country.",
        "background": "The Government should protect and restore Britain\u2019s lost temperate rainforests by implementing a \u2018Great British Rainforests Strategy\u2019. This must include a high-level commitment to restoration alongside sufficient funding and protection measures.",
