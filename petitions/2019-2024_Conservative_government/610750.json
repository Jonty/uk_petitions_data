        "additional_details": "An example of how companies can take advantage of employees, is by virtually splitting the job into two roles, one self employed role and one employee role. Then charge more in fees for the self employed role than they payout for the employee role. At the gym I am employed at they charge \u00a3200 more in rent than what they pay, meaning employees never keep the pay they earned from work done. This makes it difficult for individuals to sustain their employee role and their self employed business.",
        "background": "Implement stricter rules for employers within the gym and leisure industry to provide staff more stability and rights. Company\u2019s within the fitness industry currently put in place work models that make it extremely difficult for employees to make a sustainable income.",
