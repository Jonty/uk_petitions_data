It's just a matter of time.\r\n\r\nA line of bollards to stop drivers pushing in on motorway junctions would be a simple idea, the cost would not be huge but the lives saved could be many. Or a barrier to stop any drivers from being stupid and stopping traffic on a moving lane because they are too lazy to join the queue.\r\n\r\nParliament needs to act now!",

There will be a terrible accident if something isn't done, just one distracted driver.\r\n\r\nParliament needs to force National Highways to put in place measures to stop this from happening.",
