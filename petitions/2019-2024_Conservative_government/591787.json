        "action": "Create a register for know racists.",
        "additional_details": "I believe that racism should be treated as a criminal offence and people who discriminate based on the colour of a person's skin should face up to the damage this causes. As a primary school teacher, mother and law abiding citizen I feel it is our duty to stamp put racism. People would think twice before abusing social media or using racial slurs in any form or shape if they were to be held accountable and tracked and traced. We have a right to know if we work with, live next to or share a community with people who openly use race as a way to discriminate or segregate.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to consider creating a register whereby known racists or people who use racial slurs (in person or on social media) are added to. Thus allowing the general public to be given the same rights, as they are when assessing known sexual predators, before moving into an area.",
