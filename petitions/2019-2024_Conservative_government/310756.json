        "additional_details": "So many clubs have put money into this season to survive or push for promotion, many fans have travelled miles, many sponsors have ploughed money into clubs and many fines & registrations have been collected by the leagues in question and have no desire to comment about reimbursement to the relevant clubs. Step 2 and above into EFL and Premier League are still suspended with the view of continuing until games are finalised. Why punish non league & grass roots football with such a rash decision?",
        "background": "Get the Football Association to reconsider their decision to expunge National Step 3 and below of the Mens game and Tiers 3 and below of the Womens game. Especially until they have made decision about how the leagues above finalise their seasons.",
