        "additional_details": "The government's decision fail to acknowledge and appreciate the contributions of bank staff, many of whom were previously substantive staff. Denying them the non-consolidated lump sum payment feels like a betrayal of their loyalty and dedication. This raises concerns about fairness in the pay rise allocation. I respectfully urge the government to reconsider and ensure that the pay rise is fair and inclusive, recognizing the contributions of bank staff who have served as substantive staff.",
        "background": "We are disheartened regarding the decision made by the NHS England about the lump sum payment for the year 2022/2023. Bank staff who worked as substantive staff within the NHS but resigned and continued as bank staff before March 31, 2023, are denied this well-deserved payment in England.",
