        "additional_details": "There's been a growing gap with home schooling and the Gov has addressed some of the Key Issues but 1 main issue that seems to be over looked is the Educational Content that parents keep getting told about during briefings and parliament speeches, however many can't afford a TV Licence so can not access this so called free content as its NOT FREE it cost \u00a3154 to have access to this content.",
        "background": "We want TV LICENCE to be abolished Because many parents don't watch Live TV or have access to BBC due to the TV Licence Fee it is in some cases either the Fee or Feed their Children, This should not happen all children should have access to this KEY and VITAL educational support.",
