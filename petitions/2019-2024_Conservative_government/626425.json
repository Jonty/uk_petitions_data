        "additional_details": "Some venues around the country charge visiting artists a commission fee, sometimes as much as 30%, for selling tour merchandise when they play at these venues. Many smaller bands survive on the sale of these items and I believe it is wholly unfair and immoral to rob artists of this revenue. Bands don't take a share of bar takings so why should the venue take a share of merchandise?",
        "background": "Bands, especially smaller and upcoming bands, create their merchandise wholly independently and sell as a very important revenue stream. It is totally unfair for venues to charge them a commission.",
