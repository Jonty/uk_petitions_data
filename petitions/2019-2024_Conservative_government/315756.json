Many putting their lives on the line, making sacrifices and upholding work ethics.\r\nImplementing a higher-skilled status and accompanying financial reward, not only adds value to the HCA' but it raises the institute's view of them and professional standards, thus encouraging more people to work within this much-needed sector, and filling the many vacancies currently unfulfilled.",
        "background": "Healthcare workers help to support many parts of crucial healthcare institutions and charitable organisations, yet treat them as unskilled workers, with no financial recognition or reward for the work they do. We want the Government to implement a higher-skilled status and call to review pay scales.",
