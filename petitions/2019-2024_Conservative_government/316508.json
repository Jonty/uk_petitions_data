        "additional_details": "Not only has Captain Tom Moore generated a huge amount of much needed funding in to our healthcare system at this critical time in our country\u2019s history, but he also served heroically on the frontline during our last great struggle as a nation. His war service in the Far East alone deserves tremendous recognition, but his recent charitable actions for the NHS cement this petition as a much needed honour for this man in our current crisis.",
