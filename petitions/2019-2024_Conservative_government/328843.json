        "additional_details": "How can you say yes to hairdressers but not beauticians? We all operate under the same umbrella. There are too many people operating illegally as it is, you are now encouraging people to go and find these back street operators, who may not be as Covid secure. Please please please reconsider and allow us that are struggling to feed our families, to start earning a living again.",
        "background": "As a home based beauty salon owner, i would like to be allowed to reopen on the 4th July. I have ensured that my salon is as Covid secure as it can be. As i am self employed, I'm not earning a penny and didn't qualify for all the help offered by the government. Its unfair to keep us closed.",
