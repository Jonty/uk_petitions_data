        "action": "End the blood-donor discrimination against Gay and Bisexual Men.",
        "additional_details": "Gay & Bisexual men are blocked from giving much needed blood due to outdated reasoning stemming from the AIDS epidemic nearly 40 years ago. \r\nEpidemiology and Virology has developed extensively since, and there is little reason to deny equal rights to these people - especially in the light of the Covid-19 Pandemic. The need for plasma is urgent and Gay & Bisexual Men's blood is being refused, even though it could help save lives. It is time for this to stop.",
        "background": "Under current laws, Gay & Bisexual Men must abstain from sex for 3 months before being able to give blood - even those in monogamous long-term relationships. Straight Men and Women, however, enjoy no such restrictions. It is time this outmoded discrimination was brought to an end.",
