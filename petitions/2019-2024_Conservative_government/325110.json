        "additional_details": "The Atlantic Slave Trade was one of the most influential events in the UK\u2019s history for over 300 years, resulting in global demographic changes, the subjugation/death of millions of people, and immense financial gain for the UK. \r\n\r\nBeyond the historic context, this topic is relevant to today\u2019s world to enlighten students about its ongoing legacy, such as issues pertaining to race in the UK, appreciation of Black history, acknowledgment of racial prejudices, and ongoing political repercussions",
        "background": "The national history curriculum should be amended to legislate that schools cover the Transatlantic Slave Trade and its legacy within Key Stages 1-3 (rather than just an optional topic). Given its significance on Britain\u2019s history and present, it should have greater prominence in the curriculum",
