        "additional_details": "Staff are using makeshift hazmat suits, some are being given expired masks to wear, others have no protective measures and are using plastic bags over their heads to protect themselves. This is unacceptable. The correct respiratory masks are largely unavailable. There is a huge shortage on protective measures such as gloves and wipes. Our NHS is already overstretched. If we do not act now, we will force front line workers into falling sick to Covid \u2013 19, which will cost even more lives.",
        "background": "Thousands of GPs and hospital staff are not being provided with the kit they need to protect themselves or their patients in the fight against Covid \u2013 19. Measures must be enforced to provide Personal Protective Equipment to all front line NHS staff. Their lives are NOT dispensable.",
