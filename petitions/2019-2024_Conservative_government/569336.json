        "action": "Make amendments to the new BS AU 145e standard allowing 3D/4D plates",
        "additional_details": "The BS AU standard should be amended to either allow the manufacturing to continue but have stricter rules on the them (such as coloured backgrounds) or the government could introduce a verification process for manufacturers to ensure that the restrictions were adhered to. I personally can not think of any good reason as to why these should be abolished, if anything they are a lot clearer and easier to read and in no way do they interfere with ANPR cameras.",
        "background": "The new BS AU standard that will be coming into effect from the 1st September 2021, will mean that 3D and 4D plates will no longer be legal to go on cars. This will affect many small and local businesses that manufacture these, not to mention the economic conditions that are currently at play.",
