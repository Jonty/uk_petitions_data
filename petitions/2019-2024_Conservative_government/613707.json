        "additional_details": "Most importantly, students need their phone if they run out of money on their school food account and they need to top up their account by using their phone or they have to call their guardian to ask them to do it. At the moment you can\u2019t do this in most secondary schools, meaning students are left hungry all day. It is scientifically proven that, if your not hungry you can learn more. The government has moved into a new period, and it\u2019s time for schools to do the same.",
        "background": "Make Phone Zones Mandatory in all Secondary Schools in the UK. Over 60 percent of jobs in the future will have some sort of modern technology like phones. Also, if you want to check your family\u2019s or friends mental or physical health through the day, you need to phone or text them.",
