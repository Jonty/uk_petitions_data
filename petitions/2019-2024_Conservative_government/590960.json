        "additional_details": "Students have been forgotten about this whole pandemic. They have been the ones to lose their jobs and savings. They haven\u2019t been given financial compensation for their loss of education and lack of quality education that they pay for. Therefore universities should not be allowed to continue this blended learning approach from September. If concerts, sports games and festivals can go ahead, students can go back to lecture halls.",
        "background": "The government forced universities to stop face to face teaching for students. Now it should be forcing them to take students back full time for face to face teaching which means lectures and seminars.",
