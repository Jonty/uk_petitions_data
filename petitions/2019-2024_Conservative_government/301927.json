The WHO praised South Korea\u2019s approach as the correct one during a pandemic. It will be impossible to reduce an exponential increase in cases, and therefore, the overwhelm of health care services, if mild and asymptomatic cases continue to spread the disease in our communities. Test now and test widely to prevent unnecessary fatalities.",
