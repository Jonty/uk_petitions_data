        "additional_details": "The current advice is for pregnant women to avoid social contact. Some pregnant women will also fall into other vulnerable categories (asthma, diabetes for example): making them even more vulnerable. Yet hospitals are still having visiting hours and increasing the risk. As an asthmatic mother, about to give birth, after loosing 2 babies previously, this is a huge concern. My family have waited 4 years to meet our baby, and are willing to wait a few more months to avoid spreading this virus.",
        "background": "To avoid the further spend of COVID-19 to vulnerable patients, visiting hours to maternity wards should be ceased immediately. Allowing the general public into these wards each day is creating a further risk. Instead consider \u201cdigital visiting hours\u201d where women can use phones for contact  instead.",
