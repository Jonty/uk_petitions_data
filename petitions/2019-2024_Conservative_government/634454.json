Any person carrying a weapon should be treated as having intent to use it. \"Defence\" is no excuse. They should be facing penalties similar to that of manslaughter. Eg. up to 6 years confinement, or more. Non custodial sentences are inadequate.",

Your petition says this offence should include the element of intent, but then goes on say that any person carrying a weapon should be treated as having intent to use it. This would imply that you don't want proof of intent to be required.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, if what you want is for the penalties for possession of an offensive weapon to be increased, we could accept a petition requesting that.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nIntroduce tougher sentences for knife crime: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/633328"
