        "additional_details": "Self employed workers have children and family\u2019s to support, mortgages or rent to pay for and everything else that employees have to pay for.  Direct or indirect effects of coronavirus will reduce earnings and cause severe hardship to family\u2019s and the current measures of approximately \u00a394 per week will not help.  We still pay tax and we are still valuable members of the economy.  We deserve more help to in order to survive and provide for our families",
        "background": "Self employed workers will suffer as a result of the coronavirus, just as much as workers in employment on PAYE.  The government should make payments based on the previous years submitted tax returns.\r\nThis would reduced the loss and suffering and provide equal help to the self employed workers.",
