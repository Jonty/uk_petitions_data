        "additional_details": "University students have been some of the most affected people during the pandemic. We are at what many people agree to be the most difficult and important stage of life, and we have had so many opportunities taken away from us due to COVID-19. As attending University has simply become a matter of watching lectures on a screen, I feel we should only pay what students at an online University pay, meaning lowering the fees from \u00a39,250 per annum to \u00a36,336 per annum.",
        "background": "I want University tuition fees to be lowered to match the prices of the Open University for the days that students have not been able to go to campus and attend lectures in person.",
