        "additional_details": "Well, due to the current circumstances England have faced 3 lockdowns! That has had a HUGE impact on education. During these lockdowns, teachers have expected all students to quickly adapt to new ways of learning by doing it all online via google classroom, zoom, online calls etc. However many students have struggled with this, not having a teacher to help or that the teachers are setting far too much! Year 10s will be under far too much pressure to continue with GCSE's being completed normally.",
        "background": "I want to urge the Government to give out predicted grades to current Year 10's as their GCSE result. Year 11's have had lots of thought but i think year 10's need a bit more consideration. Year 10 students are going to struggle terribly when they return to school.",
