The NHS is going to struggle even more because of COVID-19, meanwhile Branson is asking for money from the government for his airline. He has money, he has other businesses and he owns an island, he has the capital to fund his own company and should be forced to do so. \r\nTax payers who live and work in this country do not want to line a billionaire\u2019s pockets whilst we struggle!",
        "background": "The government should not be allowed to give tax payer money to any company or subsidiary that has sued government institutions for tax payer money. \r\nVirgin Atlantic should be left to fail and Branson should fund it with his own money, like normal people do every day when they lose out on business.",
