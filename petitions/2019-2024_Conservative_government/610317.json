We would all like the members of parliament to stop ignoring us and come together and give a proper pay rise so that we can all live properly and be able to provide for our families in the way that we need to with a more realistic pay rise as the hard workers are the nhs and not the government who ignore appeals like this and still get a \u00a32,200 pay rise in 2022",
        "background": "For years the NHS has been made a mockery by the government, in 2020 they was clapping for the NHS instead of giving them a proper pay rise. There was a 2% pay rise which as seen by some members of NHS staff is seen as an insult. It\u2019s time to give the NHS and key workers the pay rise they deserve",
