        "additional_details": "During the Israel-Palestine War, the most innocent, the children, have suffered greatly. Many of these young lives are now orphans, and there are concerns about child trafficking. We need swift action. We as British Citizens believe that every child has the inherent right to grow up in a stable, secure, and nurturing environment, regardless of their place of birth. This is crucial to ensure the safe and secure transition of these children from the war zone to the UK.",
        "background": "Initiate a diplomatic dialogue with the Israeli  government to address the safe passage and adoption procedures for children orphaned by the war. We are urging the UK government to take a proactive step in facilitating the safe adoption of orphaned children affected by the Israel-Palestine war.",
