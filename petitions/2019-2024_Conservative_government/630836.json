        "additional_details": "I'm not the only one who has witnessed the horrible exclusion and mistreatment of our deaf community. Currently, only 151,000 people in the UK use BSL (not necessarily as a main language) and 87,000 of those are deaf. However, there are 10-11 million people in our country who suffer from loss of hearing, really showing that BSL is not taught merely as much as it should be. British Sign Language was recently made an official language, yet it's not taught or respected at all. Do something.",
        "background": "Our Government must listen to our worries, and our needs. This is why the Conservative Party must ensure that BSL is taught in UK schools, spreading awareness of our deaf community's language. Learning BSL can be a huge step in supporting our deaf community, so it needs to be acted up on.",
