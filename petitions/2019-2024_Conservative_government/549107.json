This means protecting existing urban nature and increasing the volume of greenery in the areas where it is most needed (with pocket parks, street trees and biophilic architecture). \r\n\r\nCOVID-19 has both awakened the nation\u2019s appreciation for green spaces and exposed its stark disparities in access to them.

But this is not currently the case. 2.7M UK residents live over half a mile from a green space, with low-income and BAME communities most likely to suffer a deficit of local greenery.",
