Losing a 4 day back holiday, and not being able to share it with loved ones, family and friends is extremely upsetting. \r\nHaving an additional long weekend to look forward to once it is safe to do so, would be a way of rewarding the NHS, essential workers, and everyone for staying strong and vigilant through these worrying times.",
