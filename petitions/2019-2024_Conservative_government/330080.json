        "additional_details": "So that the Good Morning Britain viewers can hear what the elected cabinet ministers have to say on important issues impacting them. They should not pick and choose who they want to be interviewed by. This control of the media prevents impartiality and does not enable the Government to be held to account and tested on the decisions they make. There are no more daily briefings yet Coronavirus related decisions are being made and the cross section of questions from the public are not being asked.",
        "background": "To allow cabinet ministers to be interviewed by Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid on Good Morning Britain. Currently, cabinet ministers have boycotted giving interviews to them on Good Morning Britain.",
