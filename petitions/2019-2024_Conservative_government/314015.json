Save on police time and resources. \r\nThis can happen very quickly, as we have seen in Canada and States in the US.\r\n\r\nMike Barton, Chief of Durham Police has said \"The people who think cannabis should be prohibited have secured the high ground on their moral position. But if it is a plant which is freely available, and a third of people have decided they want to take it, the prohibition argument has lost its efficacy.\" ... \"Who said in a democracy we cant discuss things\"",
