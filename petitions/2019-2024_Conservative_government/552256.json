        "additional_details": "Alone, this government has attempted to deal with Covid-19 in a way that has excluded vast swathes of the voting public. We are ALL going through this, whichever side of the party line, and all have a responsibility in helping to make the UK stronger, safer and better prepared. What seems obvious of late is a lack of commitment to positive collaborative action. There are great minds across all parties, who's voices and ideas can help us break through this deadlock. Please work together, for us.",
        "background": "It is clear that progress is not being made in terms of forming positive solutions towards tackling the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic. The divided party-politicisation of decisions is creating more barriers and more delays. We need diverse and focused minds working together to fight this virus.",
