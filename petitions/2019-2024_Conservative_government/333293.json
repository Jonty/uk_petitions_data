        "additional_details": "I am very concerned about how this measure will affect those struggling with or vulnerable to disordered eating behaviour, and I am doubtful it will have a positive long term affect on rates of obesity.\r\n\r\nThough calorie manipulation may help some people lose weight, in general it is mentally and physically harmful to shape one\u2019s food intake with numbers, regardless of current health status. We should instead focus on general nutritional and health education in schools and the wider community.",
        "background": "Instead of introducing new and potentially harmful weight loss measures, the Government should: focus on educating the public about healthy, balanced eating instead of promoting dieting and unhealthy behaviours which will be hugely damaging for those struggling or in recovery from an eating disorder",
