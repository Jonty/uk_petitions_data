        "additional_details": "Politicians are supposed to represent the people. We are already paying their wages and their extortionate expenses. Most of us will struggle to pay our own energy costs this winter so why should we be expected to pay theirs as well? They are fast becoming a luxury we can't afford.",
        "background": "MPs should not be allowed to claim energy costs on expenses as the soaring price of energy is a result of poor decision making and short term thinking by successive governments who have left us dependant on other countries for our energy. Why should they be rewarded for their ineptitude?",
