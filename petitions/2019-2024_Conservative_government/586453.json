HCC roadwork approval system is also in question with a large amount of spontaneous road/bridge closures with little or no warning at all causing yet more congestion. A typical 20/30min journey in and around the city is currently taking on average around 1-2hrs (depending on time of day)\r\nWe would like government to intervene and steer HCC to reassess",

Also to reassess the large amount of approved road works which is forcing road closures again making unnecessary congestion.",
