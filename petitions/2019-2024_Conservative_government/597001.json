        "additional_details": "I would like you to change the system on how 16 year olds are classed in a hospital. I want you to enable medical professionals to deter who can go on the children\u2019s ward or not and not class this solely on age. A 15 year old suffering with mental health can be seen on a children\u2019s ward but one day after there 16th birthday there is no place in a hospital for them. Not every 16 year old will need to go onto a Psychiatric ward but will need a ward to feel safe and secure. They are still children",
        "background": "I would like you to see 16 year olds as children when in hospital and not as an adult. A 15 year old is seen as a child but if treatment falls between that of being 15 to 16 they are then seen as an adult and the services change. Most 16 years olds are still school children.",
