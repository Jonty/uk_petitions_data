        "action": "Implement regulations for food manufacturers to test own products for oxalates",
        "additional_details": "By requiring food manufacturers to test for oxalate levels, consumers will be able to make informed decisions about the foods they eat and take steps to manage their oxalate intake. It will also encourage food manufacturers to reduce the levels of oxalates in their products, making them safer for consumers.",
        "background": "Oxalates are naturally occurring in many foods, and high levels of oxalates in the diet can lead to the formation of kidney stones, a condition that affects one in ten people at some point in their lives. These stones can cause severe pain and lead to long-term kidney damage if left untreated.",
