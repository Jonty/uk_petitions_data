        "additional_details": "We see no reason to discriminate against UK residents and citizens who received their vaccination abroad. Vaccines approved by the UK medicine regulator offer the same benefits regardless of where they have been administrated. \r\n\r\nIn the light of those rules, the only way to become fully vaccinated would be to take further doses of vaccines which health risks are not yet known. It would further waste vaccines that could be used on, yet to be vaccinated, people.",
        "background": "We wish the Government to rectify the guidance on quarantine-free travel to resume on 19 July for fully vaccinated passengers returning from amber list countries by accepting foreign vaccination certificates. Any internationally recognised certificate, should be accepted as proof of vaccination",
