I think that maybe give a restriction on 5 yrs no government funds to new comers, and a visa of 12 months to find a genuine job if you can prove that you are in a genuine relationship and your partner has a place for you to stay. There\u2019s so many hoops and obstacles, it\u2019s very difficult for us in genuine loving long distance relationships who just want to be together.",

Not everyone has the funds straight up and I think we deserve a chance.",
