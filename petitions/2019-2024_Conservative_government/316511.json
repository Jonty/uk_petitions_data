Despite being 99 years old, Tom has physically challenged himself to raise money for others by walking 100 laps of his garden, despite suffering with hip problems and requiring a frame to walk. In this dark time, Tom has shown himself to be a true hero by raising funds to support those frontline staff who themselves are true heroes, in the proud tradition of HM Forces.",
