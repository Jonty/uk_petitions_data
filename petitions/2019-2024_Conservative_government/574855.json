        "additional_details": "The restrictions imposed will affect not only students, but all with lower incomes that are required to travel. Currently, my parents are struggling financially, and I work a mininal wage job to support myself, which is not enough to cover the costs of flights, vaccines and accomodation.\r\nQuarantines are essential to keep the UK safe however, forcing people to pay such an absurd high price is not acceptable, and it is a breach of freedom of movement, to those impaired by financial conditions.",
        "background": "The UK government has to review this policy, that despite being recent, it has already affected many travellers with lower incomes. Emigrants and UK natives struggling financially should not have to bear the costs of a government plan.",
