        "additional_details": "A third of the UK bee population is thought to have vanished in a decade, yet up to three-quarters of crop species are pollinated by bees, studies show. \r\n\r\nA 2017 study of oilseed rape sites in the UK, Germany & Hungary found a link between higher levels of neonicotinoid residues & lower bee reproduction, with fewer queens in bumblebee hives & fewer egg cells in solitary bee nests.\r\n\r\nMore info at https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bees-kill-pesticide-insect-sugar-neonic-b1784693.html",
        "background": "In January 2021 Environment secretary George Eustice agreed to allow use of pesticide containing neonicotinoid thiamethoxam to treat sugar beet seed in an effort to protect the crop from a virus. Yet these pesticides harm bee brain development, weaken immune systems and can leave bees unable to fly.",
