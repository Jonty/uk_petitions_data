        "additional_details": "No PPE is required to be worn by staff in the Early Years sector due to the age and stage of the children. There is no social distancing between carers and children, as it is impossible to provide intimate care routines and for us to operate. Parents hand babies to staff. \r\n\r\nStaff are highly vulnerable as the majority use public transport and many live in multi household environments. Providing vaccination to these front line workers will protect them our children, parents and families.",
        "background": "Place all nursery staff nationwide on the Priority Vaccination List as preschool nurseries are required to remain open, during the national Lockdown. All nurseries open in Hotspot Covid-19 areas must be placed at the top of the Priority Vaccination List just as carers are in the elderly care sector.",
