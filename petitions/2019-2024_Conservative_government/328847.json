        "additional_details": "The government need to reopen Gyms and Leisure centres to boost the well being of gym goers, the economy and protect jobs. If pubs can reopen on 4th July where social distancing will be hard to control then so should gyms and leisure centres. Fellow gym goers would agree that it's very rare you train less than 1 meter apart and free weight training you train atleast 2m apart for safety reasons.",
        "background": "Tuesday 23rd June Boris Johnson announced that pubs can reopen on 4th July but not gyms and leisure centres. It's far easier to control social distancing in gyms amongst sober people than it is in pubs amongst intoxicated people. Under normal circumstances nobody trains in a gym less than 1m apart.",
