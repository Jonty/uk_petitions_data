It is impossible to know how many will lose jobs in the short term.\r\n\r\nEventually the industry will need to recover and return to 'normal'. The lower tax rate will benefit not just the small business owners but the staff they employ and the consumer.",

There will be losses of jobs and income and ultimately small businesses will close.\r\n\r\nFor businesses to endure the crisis a reduction in the VAT will allow the redistribution of business revenue into staff wages, rent, and lower sale prices",
