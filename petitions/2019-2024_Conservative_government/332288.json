        "additional_details": "Throughout this pandemic, nurses have been fighting to save the lives of others which has often resulted in them losing their own lives. Nurses have sacrificed time with their children and families moving away to fight on the front line. They have stood up a fought when the rest of the world stood still. To deprive them of a pay rise after this is disgusting. All other public sector jobs will receive pay rises yet nurses have been left off that list. This is an insult to the profession.",
