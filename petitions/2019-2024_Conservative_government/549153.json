        "additional_details": "During the lock-down phase of the pandemic, many students were forced into the \"virtual learning\" environment suddenly and without warning. This  confuses learning, damps motivation and deteriorates mental health. With this set of hyperinflated CAGs being  administered to Year 13s, with many deferrals happening to the 2021, it leaves the class of 2021 in a very difficult spot- as the value of the grade has gone down, spots will be more competitive due to referrals and international applicants.",
        "background": "More adjustments should be made for the summer 2021 A-level examinations, allowing for disadvantaged students taking their exams in 2021, to fare a much better chance of achieving their university of choice.",
