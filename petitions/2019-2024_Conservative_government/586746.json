        "additional_details": "If passed, the new Mayor should be directly elected and possess all the powers of Mayors of other devolved regions, such as Greater Manchester and Greater London.\r\n\r\nHolding this referendum would demonstrate the Government\u2019s commitment to one of the most under-invested in part of the country, as well as helping to preserving unity within the United Kingdom. It would show that the Government is serious about devolution and giving power back to people. This could help this region to define its own path to become a regional powerhouse.",
        "background": "The Government should facilitate a referendum for the people of Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Avon on creating a Mayor for the region. The Mayor would not be responsible for those areas already governed by the Mayor of the West of England. ",
