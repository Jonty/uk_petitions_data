        "additional_details": "A significant number of MPs are shielding, because of their age or underlying health conditions, or their constituencies are long distances from Westminster. Therefore the current system is profoundly undemocratic, because it prevents those MPs from doing their job, which is to represent their constituents in the Commons, whether by speaking, asking questions or voting.",
        "background": "I want the Government to work with Parliamentary authorities to restore  and develop further the hybrid system - some MPs present in the chamber and others participating via the internet, and electronic voting. Within a few short weeks, this was starting to work well in these very difficult times.",
