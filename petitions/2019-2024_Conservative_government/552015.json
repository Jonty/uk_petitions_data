        "action": "Lower tuition fees because of covid",
        "additional_details": "It is understandable that in this current climate many things have had to change, but students should not have to pay full prices when they are missing out on so much. Universities that are charging the full amount are not doing so in good interest and cannot say that the experiences that they are providing are anywhere near as good as before. Whilst this is not their fault they can make the gestures of acknowledging their courses are not up to previous standards and reducing costs.",
        "background": "We want the government to make it mandatory for universities to lower the tuition fees. No matter what, online teaching will never live up to the standard of face to face teaching and the experience that students are getting currently is very poor. It is unfair for students to have to day full fees.",
