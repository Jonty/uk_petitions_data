        "action": "Change dog breeding legislation to protect animals and punish criminals",
        "additional_details": "The government has banned American XL Bullys based on recent attacks. These dogs did not choose to be born or choose to violent. The people who are breeding these dogs for huge cash sums, often without a licence, and in breach of animal welfare standards should be the ones facing consequences. We need to make it harder for people to breed animals. Dogs should be bred purely to maintain the breed standard and keep the breed alive, considering health, characteristics and temperament.",
        "background": "Address organised crime and disgusting processes involved in the mass breeding of dogs for money. Limit how many litters a single dog can be responsible for. Enforce that all breeders (including stud only) have a licence. Stricter criminal charges should be introduced for those who do not comply.",
