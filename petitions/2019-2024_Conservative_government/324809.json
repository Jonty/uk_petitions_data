        "additional_details": "Consuming hormone-fed foods increases the risk of health issues, hormonal imbalance and cancer. These items are marketed at a cheap price and this targets lower socioeconomic groups and contributes to the vulnerabilities of health in low-income households. These products threaten business for British small and sustainable farms. This method of farming causes cows, chickens and pigs to grow unnaturally fast to speed production, threatening animal welfare and climate change.",
        "background": "Stop the importation of food produced to lower US welfare standards. Hormone-fed beef and chlorinated chickens should not be sold in UK grocery markets. These products\u2019 pending accessibility will harm public health and UK farming due to competition of low prices.",
