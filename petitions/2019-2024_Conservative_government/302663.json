        "additional_details": "As an independent country with its own fiat currency and central bank, the UK government is not constrained in the creation of new money for fiscal stimulus in times of national emergency \u2013 such as the \u00a3500+billion to the banks during the global financial crisis.\r\n\r\nA fund of \u00a3200 billion will provide \u00a33,000 for every adult in the UK and \u00a31,500 for every child. This should be reviewed and renewed every six months until the crisis is under control and will help provide a basic standard of living.",
        "background": "The public need to prepare properly for the outbreak. Millions of citizens have no liquidity or access to cash and will be unable to navigate through the coming weeks. This creates the potential for looting, rioting and anarchy - which will only exacerbate the outbreak.",
