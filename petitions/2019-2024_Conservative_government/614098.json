        "additional_details": "Shelter beds for homeless people have dropped by a fifth under the conservatives as the taxes rise year after year. We should put this money to better use to benefit those who need it. Hypothermia kills an estimated 700 people experiencing, or at risk of homelessness each year in the UK. On our way to school we see an unhealthy amount of homeless people in desperate need of help and support. We can not sit by and continue to see on a daily basis peoples lives being overlooked on the street.",
        "background": "We want the government to take accountability for the housing crisis & homelessness in the UK. We suggest that the government should take money from taxes to fund accessible FREE shelters and reduce the money spent on unnecessary projects.",
