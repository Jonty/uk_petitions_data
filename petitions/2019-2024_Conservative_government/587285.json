        "action": "Urgently increase retention of experienced general medical practitioners (GPs).",
        "additional_details": "GP retention rates are incapable of meeting current & future patient demand. This country has less than 1 GP per 2000 patients; comparable countries have 7 GPs per 2000 patients. Greatly increased pressures on GPs & rapidly worsening GP/patient ratios should be addressed urgently. Without well-resourced GPs, the burden increases on A&E units, minor surgery & hospital outpatient clinics, and the mental & physical health of the population suffers, with consequent damage to the economy and society.",
        "background": "Urgently revise government strategy to substantially increase GP/patient ratio, introduce effective measures to protect GP mental health, increase GP retention rates & ensure fulltime equivalent GP numbers increase substantially & sustainably to meet current & future demands placed on primary care.",
