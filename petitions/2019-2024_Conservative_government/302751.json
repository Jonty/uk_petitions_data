        "additional_details": "This situation is the most urgent of our times. The science of the virus is still in its infancy. No one can yet know what figure would need to reached for herd immunity to become effective but it is likely to be at least 60% of the population ieratico least 35 million people. The proportion of people at a conservative estimate predicted to die if they catch the virus is 1-2%, ie 350,000 to 700,000 people. This thought is outrageous and terrifying. It must be rejected immediately.",
        "background": "Rethink the disastrous policy of encouraging the development of \u2018herd immunity\u2019 in response to Coronavirus. It is both ill-considered and entirely out of line with the policies of numerous other countries. Instead emphasise a policy of social distancing and the development of a vaccine.",
