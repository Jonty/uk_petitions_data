        "action": "A-level results to be awarded in July to allow enough time to prepare for resits",
        "additional_details": "Students have a lot of anxiety over the waiting time. The level of revision required for an exam, particularly for people who need to achieve A* and A grades, is much longer than will be allowed for if the results day is in August. This is particularly true for people who were not expecting to need to resit and then miss their university offer. Some universities such as Cambridge are allowing deferred entry to anyone who meets their offer through these exams so adequate preparation is vital.",
        "background": "It was originally stated that A-levels would be awarded in July for reduced stress on those who may wish to resit in Autumn. This made good sense and there was no clear reason for the change to August 13. This would help students with anxieties around the issue of having enough preparation time.",
