Online ticketing systems have been successfully orchestrating timed entries before the crisis, carefully controlling visitor numbers further.\r\n\r\nWhile schools are closed, museums and galleries are a much-needed addition to parental home-schooling efforts.\r\n\r\nWearing facemasks inside could be obligatory. If many are opened people can walk or cycle to visit, rather than using public transport.",
        "background": "Social distancing is critical for protecting the NHS. \r\n\r\nBut when the country takes first steps towards normality let's open museums and galleries who have ample practice at social distancing visitors from exhibits to find education, reflection, and inspiration beyond the daily one-hour walk.",
