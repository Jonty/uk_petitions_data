        "action": "Make all feminine sanitary products free of charge in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "The price of feminine products in the uk is extortionate and the monetisation of a process that is beyond human control is beyond unacceptable . Those who can\u2019t afford these products are left to suffer through their periods. Homeless women are relying on publicly donated products that may not suit their personal needs and the annual costs of menstruation can prove too much for some families. The fact that we live in a society in which women can\u2019t afford to have periods is impermissible.",
        "background": "We would like the government or parliament to pass a bill making female sanitary products free in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
