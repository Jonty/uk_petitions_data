It caused mass panic at the pumps and led to shortages due to the unusual levels of demand. The knock on effect being that many key workers may be left unable to go about their essential work.",
        "background": "There should be an inquiry into the recent reporting of the petrol crisis - if news outlets are found to have misled the public on the availability of fuel or caused panic as a result of their reporting then they need to be held accountable in some way.",
