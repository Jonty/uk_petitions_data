It's wrong, it's profiteering, and we believe it causes unnecessary suffering to the mum.\r\n\r\nKittens for instance are being sold for approx \u00a3200-\u00a3300 each! This needs to end!",

Pets are not machines and it's not fair to keep allowing them to get pregnant to sell their babies for huge profits. There should be a legalised rate a pet should be sold for, to stop profiteering.",
