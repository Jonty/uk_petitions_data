        "additional_details": "This could also:\r\n- Make it easier for parents to find reliable options of child care to allow them to work\r\n- Give children year-round access to a stable environment where teachers can better safeguard them\r\n- Give children things to do throughout the year, reducing risk of destructive behaviours and boredom\r\n- Ease pressure on services by reducing the numbers of staff taking time off to care for their children at any one time",
        "background": "The Government should help to provide children with stability by allowing schools to open for more than 38 weeks a year while reducing the number of days per week. This could allow children more time with family, help to safeguard them from negative environments, and reduce stress for parents. ",
