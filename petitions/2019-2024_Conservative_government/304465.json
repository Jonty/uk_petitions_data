If this were to happen it is unlikely people would continue to buy lottery tickets and it is likely there would therefore be no proceeds to distribute.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about coronavirus and how you can protect yourself and others here:\r\n\r\nNHS website:\u00a0https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/\r\nUK Government website:\u00a0https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus\r\n\r\nYou can read NHS tips to help if you are worried about coronavirus here: https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/coronavirus-covid-19-anxiety-tips"
