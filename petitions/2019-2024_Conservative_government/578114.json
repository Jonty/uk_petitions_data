        "additional_details": "By allowing Company Directors to submit individual sources of dividend payments (historic and ongoing), the Chancellor will have the information he requires to be able to calculate and provide additional financial support (backdated and ongoing) to single Directors of Limited Companies. This will go some way to levelling-up on the financial aid which so many others have and continue to benefit from.",
        "background": "The Government's financial aid during the Covid pandemic excludes millions of people. The Chancellor said on television (04-03-21) with Martin Lewis that there's no way to differentiate dividend payments and that's why he cannot provide extra financial aid to single Directors of Limited Companies.",
