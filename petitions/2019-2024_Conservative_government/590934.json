        "additional_details": "MANY think the level of vaccination in the population is not yet high enough to take such a high risk with public health. \r\nThe chief medical & scientific officers have both indicated that much is unknown about the Covid delta variation and this includes whether the vaccines protect against long Covid.\r\nIf we have the choice how many of us will will be prepared to continue going to restaurants, using public transport etc?\r\nA scientifically informed vaccination level should be reached before easing.",
        "background": "Nearly ALL Covid-19 restrictions could be lifted on 19th July 2021 with estimated Covid cases over 100,000 a day soon.\r\nWorkers in transport, shops, entertainment etc. will then have to work unprotected, and many others will fear to go out. Hardly 'Freedom Day', yet we are NOT locked down now.",
