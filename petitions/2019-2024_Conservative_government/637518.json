        "additional_details": "The UK should be as advanced as countries like the US, Canada and Australia, which don't charge citizens for a TV license. The fact that there is an option to pay for a black and white TV license shows that this is an archaic and unnecessary charge. No one has a black and white TV. This isn't the 1950s. Media companies are highly profitable and do not need to charge citizens annually to watch the news etc. It is unacceptable.",
        "background": "Cancel TV license fee. Most who have TV already pay for SKY/cable/channels through their service provider. Why is there an additional arbitrary charge? TV license charge is extremely outdated and needs to be cancelled.",
