        "action": "Ensure fuel retailers are fair when changing fuel prices due to crude oil price",
        "additional_details": "It takes 2-4 weeks to convert crude oil to fuel at pumps.  But fuel retailers raise prices within hours of an oil price increase and can wait weeks to reduce them after oil prices fall.  We\u2019re in a terrible energy crisis.  A free-market economy shouldn\u2019t be an excuse for profiteering from the economic misery of people and firms.  Price increases should be applied only when fuel produced from more expensive oil reaches the forecourt.  And the same criteria used for price increases and decreases.",
        "background": "Ensure fuel retailers use the same criteria in fuel price increases/decreases, e.g. if fuel goes up 3p after 3 days of $5 increase in wholesale oil prices, then when the oil price falls by $5 fuel prices should decrease by at least 3p after 3 days. And prices should increase after fuel reaches pumps",
