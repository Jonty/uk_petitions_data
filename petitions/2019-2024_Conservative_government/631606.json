        "additional_details": "It\u2019s important. A child being taught about it and not being taught about it can be the difference between an individual growing up knowing who they are and understanding it or growing up to be really confused and struggling to accept it. Taking it out of the curriculum is disgusting. It\u2019s unfair how a partition has been made to get rid of it but not to keep it? You\u2019re getting one side of the story and one side of opinions. It\u2019s extremely important to a lot of people too.",
        "background": "As a member of the LGBT community, I struggled to embrace it when I was younger because I wasn\u2019t taught about it and what it meant. In this day and age I think it\u2019s so important for children to learn and understand it.",
