        "action": "Make working from home mandatory for teachers who are 28 weeks pregnant or above",
        "additional_details": "The government needs to look at the situation in schools holistically and protect all employees, not just some. Schools weren\u2019t obliged to let pregnant teachers (28 weeks and above) work from home, but since the decision to make masks optional in schools is put into practice from Monday the 17th of may so should be the decision to let pregnant teachers 28 weeks and above to work from home on full pay in order to protect their health and that of their babies.",
        "background": "Pregnant teachers 28 weeks and above are considered critically vulnerable and being in a profession where they see hundreds of students, as of the 17th of may without a mask, every week, puts them at a much higher risk. Working from home needs to be mandatory, not optional.",
