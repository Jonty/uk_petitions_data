        "action": "To provide urgent aid and support for the recent ecological crisis in Mauritius",
        "additional_details": "An ecological catastrophe is imminent with coral reefs, wildlife and beaches at high risk as well as the livelihoods of the tourism and fishing dependent locals. Mauritius is a commonwealth country with strong UK trade relations. With a proportionately sizeable Mauritian diaspora community living in the UK and British expat community in Mauritius and more urgently, the environmental crisis on hand, it is in the public interest to provide aid and support as a priority and a matter of urgency.",
        "background": "The Mauritian Prime Minister requested urgent international aid after a ship carrying nearly 4000 tonnes of oil began leaking in the ocean. With 1000 tonnes of oil leaked and over 2500 tonnes still onboard, the situation is dire and the government are strained and under-equipped to contain it.",
