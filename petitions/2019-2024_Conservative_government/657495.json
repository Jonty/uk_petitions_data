It can be traumatic for some people if it is their first time or suffer with anxiety. Female reproductive health is not taken seriously in this country and things need to change. Mild sedation is offered for procedures like colonoscopy and gastroscopy both of which I have had and they were nowhere as near as painful as having a coil inserted into my uterus.
