Some faith groups also can't bury or cremate their loved ones as quickly as they wish. Some bereaved families cannot attend funerals during the week due inability to take time off by employers! Sign this petition to help this issue getting debated in parliament to remove any social injustice that has came to light more in the Corona virus pandemic",
