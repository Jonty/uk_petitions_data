        "action": "Discount children under 12 in the six person limit allowed to meet socially",
        "additional_details": "This will allow larger families to still be able to interact with close family and friends, and give children the opportunity to interact socially with children in other households. \r\nThe benefits for mental health will be significant, and will allow two full households to meet at any one time, providing the number of people over the age of 12 does not exceed six. \r\nScience has shown that the risks of spreading the virus is lower in children under 12.",
        "background": "The new Coronavirus limits on meeting people socially in England mean that families are limited in how many people can meet. For example, a family of five can only meet one grandparent at a time. This petition is to request Government to discount any children under 12, as is the case in Scotland.",
