        "additional_details": "Project Gigabit aims to provide full fibre broadband to 85% of UK properties by end 2025 at a \u00a35 billion cost, but much is being spent in high population areas with good broadband already. The USO is also no help to many of the 15% of UK homes & businesses left out.\r\n\r\nAlternative solutions are low-cost & installable anywhere immediately. EG using 4G to level up all digitally excluded UK premises with life-changing better broadband would only cost \u00a3300 per property - just 3% of that \u00a35bn spend.",
        "background": "Having good broadband is vital but fibre cannot reach everyone. This is a major issue - Ofcom says there are over 500k properties that still can't get decent broadband (min 10 Mbps) via landline. \r\n\r\nFunding must be provided to bring alternative broadband solutions to areas where needs are greatest.",
