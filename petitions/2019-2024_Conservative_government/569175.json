        "additional_details": "Food webs are at higher risk of contamination than has been previously recognised, with long-lasting toxicity. \r\n\r\nThe knock-on effect that this pesticide will have on wildlife will be detrimental, not only affecting insect pollinators, but birds, aquatic inverts and mammals. \r\n\r\nWe rely on pollinating insects for 3/4 of our crop species, surely the government should be prioritising and promoting conservation at a time where half of the world's insects have disappeared it seems like a strange decision to make.",
        "background": "The UK government has approved insect-killing pesticide Thiamethoxam. We were promised that Brexit would not compromise our environmental standards and they have already gone back on their word. They should urgently reverse their plans to roll out Thiamethoxam - it was banned for a reason.",
