        "additional_details": "The 2010 Child Poverty Act was established pledging to end child poverty by 2020. According to the Government\u2019s Social Mobility Commission, child poverty rates are predicted to rise to 5.2 million by 2022. CPAG note that the 2016 Welfare Reform and Work Act abolished the 2010 Child Poverty Act. Since then, there has not been a specific Child Poverty Policy similar in aim as the 2010 Child Poverty Act. If we want to do something about the rising rate of child poverty in the UK, we must act now.",
        "background": "We want the government to create and implement a specific Child Poverty Policy that has clear aims to eradicate child poverty in the UK. 4.3 million children are living in poverty in the UK, equating to 31% of all children in the UK.",
