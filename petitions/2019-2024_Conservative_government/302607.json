        "additional_details": "A pay rise percentage wise in line with our local mps is a fair request considering how hard these people work and the sacrifices they make for our communities well being.\r\n\r\nAfter this Covid 19 saga settles down the government should immediately set in plans to reward these selfless people with a pay rise and also better working contracts.",
        "background": "It has been far to long since our nurses have been granted a decent pay rise in regards to all other employment sectors.\r\nThey are the hardest working employees in the public sector and their pay should reflect this.\r\nThey are putting their lives on hold to help us all fight this terrible virus.",
