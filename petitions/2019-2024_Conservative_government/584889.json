Due to this Type One Diabetes and Type Two are often confused. \r\n\r\nThe differences between the two conditions are not well known publicly resulting in uncomfortable and unwelcome conversations. Type One Diabetics should not be compared to Type Two therefore I believe the name of the condition should be changed.",
