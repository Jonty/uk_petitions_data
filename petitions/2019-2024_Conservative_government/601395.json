And was told we would recognize a 2mins silence to remember. \r\nI find it shameful that for all these people sacrificed for us, they get 2 minutes. \r\nThe least they deserve is a day, so we can have street parties, tie yellow ribbons round our trees and make the most fabulous poppy displays possible. \r\nBecause that really is, the very least, that these hero's deserve.",
