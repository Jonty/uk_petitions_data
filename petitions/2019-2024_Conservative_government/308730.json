        "additional_details": "During this awful situation we are in, unless there is an announced clause that an average wage calculation from the last 3 months or 12 weeks will be 80% paid, then it will cause a huge financial strain on those who usually rely on overtime during their employment. If not implemented it is leaving those unable to pay for essential services that they depend on (food, gas, electric, etc.). If not acted upon the result could be detrimental to those with mental and or physical health ailments.",
        "background": "Ensure a 3 month or 12 week previous average wage is calculated and then 80% of that average pay is paid according to whenever the employee is usally paid for those on part time or 0 hour contracts, due to the majority heavily relying on that regular pay for it to be livable. Please act upon this.",
