        "additional_details": "I want the Government to reward key workers & recognise the physical & emotional toll this is having on many people who have to put on a brave face & continue working at great risk to themselves & their families. Many key workers are some of the lowest paid & yet on the front line & deserve financial recognition - NHS staff, refuse collectors, shop workers, front line postal workers, teachers, police etc. I suggest making all earnings during this time tax exempt as a way of saying thank you.",
        "background": "While much of UK can self isolate or work from home, NHS & key workers daily have to put themselves and their lives at risk, something they never expected to have to do. In recognition I would like to see them receive extra pay & suggest therefore all wages earned during the pandemic are tax exempt.",
