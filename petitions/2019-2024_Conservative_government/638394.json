        "additional_details": "Age discrimination is rife throughout society and despite years of representations from over 60s campaign group Silver Voices, no specific project is planned by EHRC to change this situation. For example, older people complain regularly about blatant and unchecked discrimination in the banking, insurance and travel sectors. And ageist and patronising language is used in much of the media about us, without reproach. Attempts to get the EHRC to address our concerns have been dismissed out of hand",
        "background": "The Equalities and Human Rights Commission has no current projects specifically about discrimination against older people, unlike other protected groups. We have been at the bottom of the EHRC's priority list for years and we want the Government to discuss this glaring omission with them",
