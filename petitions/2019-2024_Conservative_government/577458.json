        "action": "Bring an end to horse slaughter in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The absence of Government intervention in horse welfare is reflected in equine crises. Over-breeding is a major cause of the problems. The government needs to address this by limiting the number of foals born annually, ensuring responsibility for lifetime care and, promote best practice standards on those who breed horses. Government regulation must address the racing and sport horse industries, specific breed societies plus focus on inexperienced individuals lacking horse management resources.",
        "background": "Unregulated horse and pony breeding has led to an excessive and disproportionate number of equines in the UK. The result of this is the slaughter of thousands of horses each year. Government regulation on breeding numbers would lead to measured and accountable horse management in the UK.",
