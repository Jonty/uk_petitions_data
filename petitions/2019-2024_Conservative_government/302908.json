I have made this petition for us the people to declare to HM Government that we want robust action by way of banning all international travel, technically called quarantine. Otherwise we are all going to get this disease and as the PM has declared there will be many deaths. We all have loved ones and to lose them prematurely when it can be prevented is wholly and fundamentally disgusting.",
