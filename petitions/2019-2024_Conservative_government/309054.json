        "additional_details": "Risking their own & family members' health. Working without PPE equipment, arriving at empty supermarkets, working long hours & subjected to poor conditions. A pat on the back, fairy lights in windows, recognition & applause is nice but they should be compensated. Bankers get bonuses for failure & tax bills written off for huge corporations but many key workers are low paid, go to food banks or live from pay day to pay day. Compensate them without the media demonising them for asking for better.",
        "background": "Key workers, especially front line NHS staff, that have made huge sacrifices to save lives & keep the country going should receive meaningful financial bonuses after Covid-19 has passed. This could come in the form of income tax breaks, additional paid annual leave or compensatory payment.",
