        "additional_details": "PWC calculate that the UK drone industry could be worth \u00a342bn by 2030 (https://tinyurl.com/2n75by3c).\r\n\r\nThe restrictive aspects of EASA drone rules require pilots to pass a test and pay an annual registration fee. Minimum distances for most drones have tripled to 150m from structures.\r\n\r\nThese were balanced by a classification scheme which promoted the development and use of safer technologies.\r\n\r\nWe continue to adhere to the former. We must also recognise the latter or risk this growing market.",
        "background": "Two years after leaving the EU the UK has yet to implement a replacement for the EASA drone classification scheme.\r\n\r\nThe CAA has announced a further 3-year extension to the transitional period. Without a classification scheme, UK drone owners are in an unreasonable and confusing legislative limbo.",
