This limits rights to those who applied 20 years ago, ignoring minors amongst others.\r\n\r\nHong Kong permanent residents who had right of abode in 1997, but may not be BNO today, are rightful British nationals but without any form of British status. They have been left behind and forgotten. These individuals should have the right to apply for BNO status and protections.",
