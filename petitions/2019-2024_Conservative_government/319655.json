        "action": "Raise the minimum wage for health & social care workers to \u00a310 per hour",
        "additional_details": "Some supermarket and hospitality workers, who undergo no training, earn more than carers. Without carers society cannot function. It takes a highly skilled person to administer medication, deal with severe dementia, to safely transfer disabled patients, and to change things like pain patches and catheter bags. The care sector has a huge turnaround and it is obvious why - too much giving when they receive hardly anything back. Scotland has raised carers wages (if only by 3%) so why not England?",
        "background": "We hear so much about NHS workers being valued and they should be. But health & social care workers who don't work for the NHS are not valued enough. Carers are considered as 'low skilled' but do extensive training and have a huge responsibility over peoples lives.",
