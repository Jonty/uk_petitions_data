        "action": "Do not authorise the use of bee-killing pesticide to enhance sugar beet growth",
        "additional_details": "Pollinators are vital to our environment: our crops, plants and future rely on them. It is estimated that a third of the UK\u2019s bee population has been lost in the last decade. Despite 3/4 of our crops relying on bees for pollination, Eustice has authorised the use of dangerous pesticides. This is short-sighted and will only damage our crop production in the future. Brexit provided an opportunity to enhance policies, we should not be taking steps backwards and risking vital environmental services.",
        "background": "Recently, environment secretary George Eustice authorised the use of dangerous pesticides to boost sugar beet growth. This pesticide is banned in the EU as it is known to damage the populations  of bees and other pollinators. The use of such pesticides should remain banned in the UK.",
