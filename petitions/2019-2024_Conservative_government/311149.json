This would avoid:\r\n\u2022\tHaving hundreds of people touching and coughing over surfaces and products,\r\n\u2022\tPutting staff at risk by unnecessary interaction, \r\n\u2022\tQueues, \r\n\u2022\tOrdering online & delivery would be sreamlined,\r\n\u2022\tNo more panic buying and discrimination \r\nThis virus is a war we all fight as a team; we all have to pull together, large supermarkets are no exception.",
        "background": "Large supermarkets are laid out to maximise sales of non-essential products: how long would it take you to buy milk, eggs, baked beans, butter & bread and how far they are from each other?  \r\nOnline ordering is inefficient; each order is different, pickers and vans need to tailor each request.",
