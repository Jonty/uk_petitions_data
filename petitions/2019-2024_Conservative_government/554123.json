        "additional_details": "Failure to teach students about the concentration camps in the Boer war in South Africa, or Churchills views on eugenics is insulting. Teaching atrocities the British empire committed is critical for students to grow up informed and educated. Teaching material that is \u201canti capitalist\u201d is extremely rare, if ever talked about in schools, and surely, if capitalism was so good people wouldn\u2019t have to talk about the problems with it? the recent laws passed are Orwellian and ridiculous and dangerous.",
        "background": "Failure to teach children about the atrocities committed by the British empire has resulted in a growth of right wing and far right extremism. This petition is calling for schools and teachers to be permitted to talk about materials that may be viewed as \u201canti capitalist\u201d or \u201canti colonialist\u201d.",
