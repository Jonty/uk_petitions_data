        "action": "Make the unvaccinated COVID patients pay for their own hospital treatment.",
        "additional_details": "It is evident that if everyone got vaccinated, hospitals would be under less pressure. Sunday Times reported that more than 90 per cent of COVID sufferers requiring the most specialist care are unvaccinated.\r\nUnvaccinated people who are critically unwell with COVID are reducing the NHS's capacity to provide care to people needing treatment for non-COVID related conditions. Since we cannot force people to take up the vaccine, it is only right we ask those being admitted to pay for their treatment.",
        "background": "Although COVID vaccines are safe and vastly reduce the chance of getting seriously ill, 1 in 10 adults decided not to take it. Vaccination is a choice. Unvaccinated patients are putting huge pressure on NHS resources. Unvaccinated people must pay for their own COVID related hospital treatment.",
