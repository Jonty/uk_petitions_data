Many people are at risk of losing jobs etc in this cost of living crisis that we already have.we ask parliament to re look at this and do the right thing in not issuing the fines and points.",

Inadequately signed and a 50mph sign still present between the new 40mph that have gone up since people have complained. Many people in the same situation and at risk of losing jobs etc",
