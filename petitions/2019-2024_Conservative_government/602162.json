We're asking the Government to afford responsible citizens, who are \r\nfully vaccinated, the opportunity to travel home to Southern Africa & self-isolate on their return.\r\n\r\nThe current hotel quarantine is not an affordable option for many & this is robbing many people the opportunity to see family for the first time in 2 years due to the COVID pandemic & unaffordable hotel quarantine.\r\n\r\nPCR testing before and after arrival should be used",
