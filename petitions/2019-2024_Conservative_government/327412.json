        "action": "Scrap Plans to Restrict Transgender People's Access to Legal Gender Recognition",
        "additional_details": "I am calling on the UK Government to reverse this decision, and allow transgender people to self-define their gender and be legally recognised. The current process is restrictive - including a doctor's diagnosis, when the wait to see a gender specialist is already up to three years. Using the point of single-sex spaces to justify restricting access to legal affirmation is a baseless attack on our right to live authentically - since the UK already has legislation in place regarding this issue.",
        "background": "In 2018, the government held a consultation on reforms to the Gender Recognition Act. 70% of 100,000 respondants spoke in favour of improving trans lives and reforms were planned to the currently lengthy and expensive process of legal gender recognition. As of 2020, these plans have been scrapped.",
