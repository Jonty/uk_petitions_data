        "additional_details": "My GP surgery has over 20 treatment rooms but the waiting room always seems empty, is this connected to how many patients a surgery can register i.e if a surgery has large number of treatment rooms can they then register a larger number of patients then receive more funds?\r\nI think this indicates the way GPs are funded isn't in the patients best interest and I would like this to be debated.",
        "background": "I have to wait up to 4 weeks for a GP appointment or told to go to AE. I think this is because GPs are paid for each patient registered and not for each consultation so theres no incentive to see the patients, they can employ fewer GPs and surgery staff and not have to see patients.",
