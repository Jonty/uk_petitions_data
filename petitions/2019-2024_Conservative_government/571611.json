We are key workers, without us the country would be brought to a standstill, yet we aren't in a priority vaccination group, even though we deal with members of the public every day, many of who refuse to wear masks and/or use sanitising stations. We need the vaccine as much as nhs staff, so why aren't we getting it? \r\nThis has to change now.",
