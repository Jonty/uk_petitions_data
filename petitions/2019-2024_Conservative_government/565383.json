        "additional_details": "The cases of COVID-19 are rising across the country, in the south especially, and it\u2019s proven that the new strand effects children and young people more so opening schools will massively increase the spread and put a at risk children and families and more risk of loosing there jobs and livelihoods. As a college student myself I am terrified of going back and I have been a key worker throughout the pandemic. Online isn\u2019t ideal but it\u2019s safe and better than nothing. Stopping the spread is VITAL!!!",
        "background": "We would like you to think about all the families you are putting at risk of loosing there houses, families and lives. Please debate this and think of how you would feel sending your own children to school when the cases are so high and children don\u2019t social distance let alone wear masks!",
