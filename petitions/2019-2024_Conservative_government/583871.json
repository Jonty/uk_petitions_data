It\u2019s because they are a major transit hub.\r\nThere are approximately a quarter of a million British expats residing in the UAE, uniquely far more than any other nation in the Middle East. If the UAE is on the red list due to it being a major transit hub then travel for UAE resident visa holders and nationals from the UAE only, should be permitted.",

The residents/nationals will start their journey from the UAE only and will not include transit passengers due to the UAE\u2019s inclusion on the red list as being a transit hub.",
