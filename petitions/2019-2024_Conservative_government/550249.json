Seeing your unborn child on screen for the first time is magical and this has been permanently taken from me.\r\n\r\nThe 20 week scan is an important scan - what if it shows problems with the pregnancy?  I won't be there to support her.\r\n\r\nAntenatal appointments are now remote only.\r\n\r\nPartners are only allowed when the expectant mother is 4cm dilated - potentially minutes from birth (easy to miss).",
