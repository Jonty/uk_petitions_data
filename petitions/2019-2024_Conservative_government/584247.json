        "additional_details": "If a private investor buys a plot backed by help to buy, it abolishes the scheme and they charge more the house even if its rented making the once affordable house into a non affordable house. It not only spoils the chances for first time buyers but buyers will find themselves in a position where there isn\u2019t any land left for new builds backed by the scheme making the generation buy campaign into generation rent again. It\u2019s a money making scandal and is not fair.",
        "background": "Stop private investors buying new build house plots that are backed by help to buy. This ruins the chance for first time buyers to take full advantage of the scheme and defeats the purpose of it being there.",
