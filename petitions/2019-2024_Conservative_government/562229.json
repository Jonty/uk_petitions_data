We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nThe title of your petition refers to parliamentary privilege, but the main text of your petition appears to relate to how petitions are considered by the Petitions Committee.\r\n\r\nUnder the Standing Orders of the House of Commons the Petitions Committee has been appointed to consider e-petitions submitted through the House of Commons and Government e-petitions site.\r\n\r\nAs part of this work the Committee considers whether to hold debates on any petitions that have received over 100,000 signatures. Whether to hold a debate is a matter for the Committee.\r\n\r\nThe Petitions Committee agreed not to debate e-petition 300403 because by the time Westminster Hall, where petitions debates take place, had been reopened, the Government had already acted on the request made.\r\n\r\nA debate on several petitions, including e-petition 550846, is taking place this afternoon. You can watch the debate on Parliament TV here from 6pm: https://www.youtube.com/UKParliament\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
