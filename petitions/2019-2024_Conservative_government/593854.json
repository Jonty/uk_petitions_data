        "additional_details": "Not having the TB vaccine, or polio vaccine does not mean you can\u2019t enter venues or go on holiday. This government have handled the covid 19 situation terribly. They have been secretive by not giving the citizens information in a timely manor. With last minute announcements on lockdowns, vaccine passports and traffic light system changes. We don\u2019t want to penalised for personal choice, nor have to identify ourselves on entering a venue. Not to mention the uproar doormen & staff will encounter.",
        "background": "The people who have signed this petition have no confidence in this government, making vaccine certification to gain entry to clubs, pubs, restaurants etc is nothing short of dictatorship. The people of this country have had the free will to choose to take the vaccine or not. It\u2019s our choice!",
