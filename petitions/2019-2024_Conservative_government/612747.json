        "additional_details": "The need for food banks is ever increasing as a result of the 'cost of living crisis', but, as several food banks and charities have now reported, it is becoming increasingly difficult for these groups to source the produce they need in order to be able to help their community. In addition, the Government has pledged to reduce food waste by 20% by 2025. As supermarkets contribute a great deal to this by rejecting and disposing of usable produce, this would tackle both issues effectively.",
        "background": "If a business has unsold food that is past the best-before date, but is still usable, the business should, by law, be required to donate this produce to local charities, such as food banks. These businesses would, at first, be large, national chains, but could eventually include smaller businesses.",
