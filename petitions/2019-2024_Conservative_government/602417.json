        "additional_details": "My dog was born allergic to pretty much everything. She was a crossbreed between a King Charles cavalier and a Toy poodle. Both of these dog breeds have known health issues like heart issues, allergies and sight/hearing difficulties. A lot of breeders will  crossbreed dogs to look a certain way and a large amount of these dogs end up having health issues passed down from both parent breeds, where they will live with so much discomfort and pain, so it\u2019s not fair nor ethical to crossbreed them.",
        "background": "Ban the crossbreeding of certain dogs at risk of health issues such as; allergies, genetic issues, breathing difficulties + more. We would like the government to put in some guidelines or ban to educate the public on irresponsible breeding. So many crossbreeds live their whole lives in discomfort.",
