        "additional_details": "Having been defrauded myself the man involved was prosecuted by trading standards and fined, he then went on to defraud more people after me and there were plenty before me. He's not alone in this up and.diwn the country people are having to take civil actions as a loophole in the law doesn't cover these immoral earnings. Persistent offenders should be criminally charged with the same penalties other criminals would have",
        "background": "The law supports the earning of immoral earnings as long as the perpetrator is registered as a business..this means that cowboy traders are able to defraud money and the police cannot be involved as it falls to trading standards. However there are people that trade solely to steal.",
