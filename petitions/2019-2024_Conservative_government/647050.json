        "action": "Allow the use of Mobile Phones during Free periods e.g Break/Lunch Times",
        "additional_details": "To sum up the petition, the Department for Education should keep the ban of mobile phones during lessons but look to change the guidelines to allow the use of phones, subject to schools, during break and lunch times to allow students to socialise together online, reduce stress on students and allow them to complete work on school grounds with most schools using online tools for this reason, and create a safe and positive environment for students to turn to whenever it is needed.",
        "background": "While the ban on the use of phones during lessons is a justifiable reason, the ban on the use of phones during break and lunch is unfair as many positive things benefit students from using their phones which outweigh the negatives. Mobile phones should not be seen a distraction but a helpful tool.",
