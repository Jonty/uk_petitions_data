        "action": "Abolish all parking fees for Blue Badge holders in council-run car parks",
        "additional_details": "The government revealed in its most recent Disability Survey that 'Over a quarter of disabled respondents often had difficulty accessing public buildings\u2019. Imposing additional parking costs, essentially exacerbates the problem which the government aim to rectify. These costs also make it difficult for disabled people to attend medical appointments to help with treatment. This severely diminishes their quality of life and ability to interact with the outside world effectively.",
        "background": "The central government should impose legislation preventing local councils from charging blue badge holders to park in council owned car parks. Disabled people already incur additional financial difficulties. Extra parking fees penalise disabled people and further isolates them from society.",
