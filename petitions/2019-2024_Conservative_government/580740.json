        "action": "Remove the requirement for couples to make joint claims for Universal Credit",
        "additional_details": "Currently couples must make a joint claim and are assessed on total household income. This stops the right to be financially independent. In many cases one partner is unwilling or unable to support the other. Jointly many do not receive any benefits at all which can put one half of the couple at risk. The benefit is placed into one or both bank accounts but bank details can only be changed with the partners permission. This system can leave people vulnerable and can create a risk of abuse.",
        "background": "To change the Universal Credit, and other State financial support, rules to allow people the choice to be financially independent and make a single claim when they live with a partner, and be assessed for their own individual contribution to the household.",
