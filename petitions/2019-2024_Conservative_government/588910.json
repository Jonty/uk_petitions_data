        "additional_details": "In the UK there is currently no law expressly forbidding discrimination against tattoos and piercings in the workplace. Nowadays tattoos and piercings are more common than ever yet, the UK government is still stuck in the 20th century and has not updated their laws protecting those who merely want to express themselves through body art.",
        "background": "Allow workers to have visible tattoos and piercings anywhere on their bodies at the workplace as long as they do not incite violence or hate (Piercings can be removed if there's a risk of damaging health and safety at places like hospitals or working around food.)",
