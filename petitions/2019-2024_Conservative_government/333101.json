        "additional_details": "Recently, the government has revealed their new obesity strategy. One solution this strategy includes is calorie labelling in restaurants, cafes and takeaways. The problem with this is that another huge problem in the UK is mental health issues, and included in the term mental health issues is eating disorders, also known as ED's. This new rule can trigger people with eating disorders, especially those with anorexia or bulimia, into not eating enough and becoming dangerously underweight and ill.",
        "background": "I would like the government to stop the labelling of calories in restaurants, takeaways and cafes. When calories are clearly labelled on menus, this can trigger people with eating disorders. When those with eating disorders are triggered, they may revert back to habits such as starving themselves.",
