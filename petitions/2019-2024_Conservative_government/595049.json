        "additional_details": "It is not in the interests of peace and security to withdraw UK troops from Afghanistan. It will cost more in the long run and is costing lives now. We must change strategy and work diplomatically to find a solution. Any threat towards democracy, and particularly women and children in Afghanistan, threatens the world. Leaving Saigon in 1975 was regarded as strategic error, thus Kabul 202. We must take the long view, be open to a range of propositions and become informed sufficiently to act.",
        "background": "Urgently keep troops on the ground to mitigate further violence.\r\nWork with other nations to support Afghanis to fight the Taliban.\r\nWelcome Afghani asylum seekers.\r\nContinued aid and support Afghani human rights and education.\r\nInvestigate UK connections to Taliban finance and divest UK funds.",
