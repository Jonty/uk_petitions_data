        "additional_details": "Many Ukrainians are being forced to flee, both within the country and into neighboring states. Over 100,000 people are reported to be displaced internally within Ukraine already and thousands more are fleeing over borders into Poland, Romania, Moldova and other European states. EU and neighbouring countries eased the entry restrictions for Ukrainian citizens. \r\nUK should also play part and offer shelter to Ukrainian people who are fleeing the war.",
        "background": "By air, land, and sea, Russia has launched a devastating attack on Ukraine, a European democracy of 44 million people, and its forces are on the outskirts of the capital, Kyiv.\r\nUnder such circumstances, please waive UK visa requirements and offer asylum to people forced out of Ukraine.",
