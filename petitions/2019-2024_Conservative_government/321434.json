        "additional_details": "Aside from being incredibly disgusting, spitting spreads disease. We are in the middle of a pandemic, and if people are unable to personally control their urge to spit even at this time, the law should step in. I realise this may be difficult to enforce practically, but this will raise awareness of its irresponsibility and its lack of social acceptability. There should be an overwhelming public disdain for people who spit, and its illegality will reinforce this.",
