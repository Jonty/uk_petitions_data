        "additional_details": "Because animal parks are suffering. They bring joy to a lot of people and if people are not allowed to go right now they might disappear. This isn't good for the public, the people employed by the zoo or the animals. \r\n\r\nIt's easy to social distance in a zoo and actually more beneficial to the experience I'm sure. People can take extra precautions to stay hygienic and alert. There isn't any reason zoos can't open... is there?",
        "background": "I would like for the government to allow zoos and other animal parks to open to the public on June 15th along with shops etc.\r\n\r\nThe animals need us financially. What happens if the zoos can't stay open?",
