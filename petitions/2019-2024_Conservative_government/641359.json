Count their stay as in their number of days as normal from when they first entered the country prior to even acquiring the PSW status as they had to stay continuously after their course.\r\nIt\u2019s only fair if the government end goal is to just tax working immigrants money and send them back once they can\u2019t work as the employees refuse to hire them.",
