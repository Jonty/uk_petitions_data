        "action": "Ban the use of bots to purchase items in high demand.",
        "additional_details": "Currently, PlayStation 5's are being shipped to the UK to be sold at retailers. However, those who are using bots make it difficult for an average person to purchase at least one PlayStation 5 as a bot can purchase in bulk within seconds/minutes. This leaves those who are frustrated or in need of the item quickly, searching for the product on secondary markets such as eBay and StockX, where those who used bots would resell the high demand item for over 3x the original RRP. This is not fair.",
        "background": "The government should not allow the use of bots to bulk buy rare products in high demand to be resold at extenuating prices on the secondary market. Companies, groups or individuals should not be able to use bots on rare or high demand items, leaving none for those who want to purchase normally.",
