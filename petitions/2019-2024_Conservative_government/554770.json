        "additional_details": "I am a professional athlete. I compete in triathlon events around Europe and the world. This year I have been unable to compete in races because of the 2 week quarantine rule. I have been unable to train abroad. If I am not able to race then I cannot make any money & therefore make a living. I have had to move back into my parents house & am essentially unemployed. To begin testing at airports would mean I could go about my daily job and begin competing abroad again without any stress or worry.",
        "background": "Begin testing people for covid-19 instantly on arrival into UK airports. So that people can travel and help the travel industry. If results can be given within 24 or 48 hours and this means self isolation until the result is received then so be it. It will avoid the detrimental 2 weeks quarantine.",
