        "additional_details": "I just think it\u2019s quite unfair, it won\u2019t motivate the students to get higher than 75% plus if students revised to get a grade six making their test scores between 90-100% that would paint an extremely good image of the UK\u2019s education which could help the country profit if many different ways so it would be beneficial for student mental health and motivation and the country\u2019s own reputation",
        "background": "students who want to get a good grade but are in foundation should at least be allowed to get a 6 when scoring 90-100% since it only takes about 75-80% to get a 5, if a student revises their heart out to get 90-100% but only get a 5 because they\u2019re in foundation is completely unfair",
