        "action": "Make sexual consent, harassment and assault a main stream topic in sex education",
        "additional_details": "It has become the new norm that everyone, women and men alike, have experienced some sort of sexual assault. Social media has opened a conversation in sexual assault and it is important that we educate children from young to know if they are being taken advantage of sexually or if they are perpetrating the sexual assault. It is very common that people may not know they are inflicting some sort of sexual harassment. Schools teach sex education but do not emphasis consent and personal space.",
        "background": "I would like the government to push education on sexual consent, harassment and assault within the sex education and LGTBQ curriculum. It is a widely left out topic when in fact it goes hand in hand. This topic is no where near covered in schools when it is very important.",
