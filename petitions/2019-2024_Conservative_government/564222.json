        "additional_details": "COVID restrictions have removed the ability for many families to get together and celebrate Christmas. By declaring 25th and 28th June as Bank Holidays this would give families a chance to reschedule their Christmas celebration in a more COVID-safe way. This would also give people something positive to focus on. The impact to the economy of the 2 extra Bank Holidays could be offset by increased consumer spending in the run up and during the Bank Holidays.",
