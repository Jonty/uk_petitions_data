        "action": "Ban chick hatching projects in schools",
        "additional_details": "Once a chick hatching scheme is over, chicks will either be returned to the company where their fate is uncertain, or they may be rehomed by someone in school. However the cockerels are usually unwanted.  \r\n\r\nThis is a cost to schools, the eggs/chicks are not cared for properly and it results inevitably with unwanted cockerels being born and culled.  Please ban this practice in schools on animal welfare grounds- there are more humane ways of teaching children about chicken lifecycles.",
        "background": "Some schools have chick hatching projects, promoted by some companies. A mother hen turns eggs 30 times a day to ensure the chicks don\u2019t get stuck to the shell, which can result in injury or death. Teachers cannot provide this care, and eggs/chicks may be left unattended over evenings/weekends.",
