        "action": "Force BBC / media to quote the carbon price with the FTSE100 in news broadcasts.",
        "additional_details": "To accelerate collective awareness of our carbon footprints and the impact on the Earth's future, we want major news outlets to include a reference to the latest market \"price\" of carbon in their \"financial markets review\" slots, alongside the latest FTSE-100 and S&P 500 numbers currently quoted.  This in turn will likely encourage and support more rapid and impactful actions to help us address the critical climate challenge soonest, for our and our children's collective benefit.",
        "background": "Parliament should mandate the BBC and legislate for all UK media outlets to highlight the key carbon market price stats in news bulletins. In the year of the UN\u2019s COP26 conference, hosted by the UK, such a small step can help our understanding and awareness of the challenges that lie ahead.",
