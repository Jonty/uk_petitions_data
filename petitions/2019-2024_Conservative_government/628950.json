        "additional_details": "Rawhide is a animal chew made from cattle and horse hide soaked in toxic chemicals such as sodium sulphide.\r\n\r\nRawhide is non-digestible causing it to build up in the stomach. Intestinal blockages, poisoning from toxic chemical residue and choking are also risks associated with rawhide, while some fight through it, others aren\u2019t as lucky.\r\n\r\nMany pet owners aren\u2019t aware of the risks of rawhide products. Therefore, we want to SAY NO TO RAWHIDE, ban sales, and make awareness of the devastating risks.",
        "background": "We want the Government to review the use of rawhide and \u2018SAY NO TO RAWHIDE\u2019. Reviewing and looking at banning all sales of rawhide animal treats will prevent the cause of death and/or other serious health issues for our loved pets.",
