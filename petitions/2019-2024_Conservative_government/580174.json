        "action": "Restrict the use and sale of spy and covert recording equipment to the public",
        "additional_details": "Voyeurism and Upskirting offences are increasing and the public (mainly women) are at significant risk with all the technology available. Once an offender has been caught and arrested, it's too late, the damage has been done. Society is at risk from covert equipment in their homes, hotels and even in public changing rooms.\r\nIt's an offence to install equipment and record indecent images without consent so restricting the equipment would significantly decrease the risk of the offence.",
        "background": "Legislation needs to be introduced that restricts the use and sale of covert or 'spy' recording and viewing equipment unless to a licensed professional (which needs to be regulated) so it cannot be purchased or installed by the public or businesses without a license in the UK.",
