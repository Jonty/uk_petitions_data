        "additional_details": "The actions of the British Government and its agents in the 1960s would draw widespread international condemnation if repeated today. Islanders were forced from their homes to pave the way for the creation of a military base, and later revelations show plans to avoid islanders returning once the base is no longer required. The United Nations have also come out against this occupation.",
        "background": "HM Government must return Diego Garcia to the exiled Chagossian people and allow them to return. A full apology must be issued and the land returned to its original state.",
