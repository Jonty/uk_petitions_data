        "additional_details": "Events with 5,000+ people are a major means of accelerating cross-infection between heavily-infected regions to less-infected. Complex transport and density of participants means spread.\r\n\r\nThere is significant community spread now in Britain, which has imported cases to Vietnam, Greece, Poland, Senegal and China. Events in a week or two from now will show this.\r\nItaly's oxygen and ICUs have been depleted rapidly, action must be taken in ADVANCE to be effective in slowing the epidemic curve.",
        "background": "Large mass events should be held behind closed doors or delayed until the COVID outbreak is in control or no new cases are reported for 14 days. \r\nThis is a Public Health Emergency and those who stand to lose financially can be centrally compensated.",
