With the added pressure COVID-19 is putting on NHS trusts we want to know that the work we are doing as student nurses by putting ourselves in harm's way is being recognised and appreciated by the NHS and the public. We urge you to pay us a fair wage to give up our time and also to reduce the 2300 hours we have to complete so we can qualify quicker and help the NHS with this war against COVID-19.",

We want the government to ensure students will be paid for the 2300 hours that we are giving up for free to the NHS. We also want to have the 2300 hours reduced.",
