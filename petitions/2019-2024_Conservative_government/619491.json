        "additional_details": "It's fair enough to keep NHS funded with the limit if you must but private clinics should not have these rules. BMI doesn't always equal fat and plenty of people have high BMI and have children. Why should the right be taken away to have a family just because you can't conceive naturally? If you're paying towards treatment you should be able to at least sign a disclaimer to say you want to go ahead even with adviced high BMI",
        "background": "Either increase BMI limit or change to fat and mascle mass limits as muscle weighs more than fat and if you are muscular you might still be over the BMI limit that fertility clinics put in place.",
