We've seen Matt Hancock using it for PPE contracts and most recently, Boris Johnson using it to discuss the No. 10 flat renovations. This HAS to stop.\r\n\r\nAny communication by an MP in relation to their work must be via a method that has a permanent and easily searchable record, by relevant parties in relation to misconduct or investigations.",
        "background": "All communication that an elected MP has in relation to their work must be via a fully trackable and auditable method. WhatsApp messages are far too easily deleted and 'forgotten'. This is unacceptable in a modern democracy and we must be able to hold our elected MPs to account.",
