        "additional_details": "The nature of a GP-patient relationship is one where the GP has absolute power and the patient has none. This may make some sense in the case of an infected absess, but very often can cause even more mental distress to a patient who suffers from a psychiatric condition. I propose that, if there is a disagreement between a GP and a mental health patient who has no other care, then the issue should be taken to a tribunal made up at least in part by mental health professionals.",
        "background": "So many people, who already experience of mental distress, are complaining of being not listened to by their GPs. GPs are NOT specialists in mental health and often fail to understand or care about the more outwardly subtle nature of mental health conditions which can, at the same time, be severe.",

It's not clear what you mean by someone being \"soley under the care of their GP\", or what you want the role of the tribunals you propose to be.\r\n\r\nNHS patients can already complain about any aspect of NHS care, treatment or service. You can find out more about this here: https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/about-the-nhs/how-to-complain-to-the-nhs/\r\n\r\nIf what you want is for patients to be given a legal right to appeal decisions made by their GP, and for these to be considered by an independent tribunal, we should be able to accept a petition requesting this."
