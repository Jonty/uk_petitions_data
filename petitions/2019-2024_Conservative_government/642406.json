        "action": "Stop Welsh Gov rolling out a 20mph speed limit on restricted roads across Wales",
        "additional_details": "To ensure drivers are aware of the new speed limit, there should be 20mph repeater signs because of the overarching UK law where restricted roads with street lights have a 30mph limit. However, Welsh Gov is NOT using any signs other than for roads that are 30mph or faster. With analysis suggesting a negative cost of up to \u00a34.5billion, this will affect UK finances, not just Wales.\r\nWe call on UK Government to prevent a change that will affect people across the UK as a whole and damage the economy.",
        "background": "The Welsh Government's plan to change the speed limit in Wales to 20mph from September 17 is inconsistent with the wider rules across the UK. It will lead to confusion with road users, increase accidents and lead to prosecution of visitors and businesses crossing the English border into Wales.",
