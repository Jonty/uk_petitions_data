        "additional_details": "We propose that ALL breeders be licenced be they be breeding one litter or 100 litters, charged on a sliding scale increasing as the number of breeding dogs/ litters increase.  This way the health standards required under the Animal Welfare Regulations will apply for ALL dogs and their litters.\r\nThis would mean anyone breeding with an unhealthy dog could potentially be prosecuted.\r\nThe funds raised by the licence fees could go toward enforcing the regulations.",
        "background": "Thousands of puppies are born to unlicenced breeders\r\n\r\nUnlicenced breeders are breeding with unhealth screened dogs or dogs with poor results which results in puppies being born with ongoing health issues causing  pain & suffering for the dog and both heartache & financial cost for the puppy owner.",
