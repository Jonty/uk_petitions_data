        "action": "Extend the leasehold reform bill to include existing leaseholds",
        "additional_details": "Those in existing leaseholds face paying hundreds (or thousands) of pounds a year in ground rent, with further rises in the future. To make matters worse, lenders typically won't lend on properties with ground rents in excess of \u00a3250 a year. Those paying higher ground rents are unable to sell their properties unless they pay thousands (or even tens of thousands) of pounds to the freeholder or developer to reduce the ground rent through a deed of variation or a new lease.",
        "background": "The leasehold reform bill aims to stop the practice of freeholders and developers raising ground rents to extortionate levels. But the bill only includes new leaseholds. Extend it to include all leaseholds to address the larger problem for thousands of people trapped in existing leaseholds.",
