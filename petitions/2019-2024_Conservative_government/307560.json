        "additional_details": "It is simply unfair and unjust that consumers can and do visit multiple shopping outlets and buy products up to the shop defined limits. The only fair way to manage the problem is for government to provide a scheme which sets absolute limits per person of critical foods and groceries and means everyone has the same chance of getting their fair share, rather than just those who can drive to multiple outlets.",
        "background": "To bring in a scheme to ration the purchase of essential items in our supermarkets to avoid consumers purchasing to the limits in one store then going to another to do the same. I think this is termed 'supermarket grazing'.",
