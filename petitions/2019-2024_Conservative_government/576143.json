        "action": "Legalise electric scooters in the uk",
        "additional_details": "As I am a key worker using a electric scooter will reduce my travel time significantly and as young person it saves me a dramatic amount of money I can put towards livings costs. I know electric scooters are becoming very popular and with the right guidelines in place they could prove to become very efficient in the future especially to help reduce our carbon footprint.",
        "background": "I think electric scooters should be legalised as they are a more efficient, eco friendly and affordable way to get to and from work especially while we are in lockdown as there is no way to obtain a driving license and using public transport puts me at high risk of catching coronavirus.",
