        "additional_details": "These NHS staff, teachers, care workers, Emergency services and social services personnel have shown up, committed themselves to their job. It is only fair that they get rewarded in a way that would ease their burden. A large monthly bonus during the crisis and a significant pay rise at the end of this would be a more useful award than thanks and badges. We need to reward our caring people more. Take care of them better. Without them, even our PM would have been lost.",
        "background": "For working through this crisis on the front line, for their commitment & integrity; every NHS staff, care worker, teacher, emergency services & social services personnel should be paid a nontaxable monthly bonus of double their salary, for as long as the Covid-19 crisis exists (posthumously too)",
