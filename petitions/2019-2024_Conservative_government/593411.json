        "additional_details": "The European fully jabbed citizens have a green pass while those vaccinated in the UK have to always purchase a test for everything when in Europe. You need a test from doing simple things such as going to the cinemas, eating indoors to travelling by all means of transport\r\nBeing fully vaccinated by the same regognised companies, there should be no discrimination between for instance a fully jabbed British citizen and a fully jabbed Italian citizen. It is clear discrimination and it all starts back at the fact that the UK chose to leave the European Union. During these times the price is paid by simple citizens- especially those that have to travel to the European Union to see their families.",
