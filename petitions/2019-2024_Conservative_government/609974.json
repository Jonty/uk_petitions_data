They simply do not have enough mental capacity left to go through an overly complicated beurocratic process of applying for seasonal visas or other available options.\r\n\r\nBritain must do more. Please step up.",
        "background": "Many countries are showing solidarity with the people of Ukraine as they brave the invasion. \r\nThe UK must simplify their visa regime to allow Ukrainian refugees to claim shelter here. \r\nOther countries don't even ask for ID.\r\nOpen the doors to Ukrainians who have been forced to free their home.",
