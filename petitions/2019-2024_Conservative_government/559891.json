Children were deprived a formal education and were expected to teach themselves from printouts whilst private schools switched to teaching virtually. Putting privately educated kids at an advantage. The self isolation process continues to impact the education & create disparity. Since Sept my son has been in self isolation twice whilst peers who have not been exposed to Covid 19 have received face 2 face teaching.",

These reports contain the teachers predictive grade for the pupils GCSEs.",
