        "additional_details": "Yoga should not be classed under the same regulations as sport/fitness as yoga classes do not pose the same risk with regard to Coronavirus. This lack of nuance prevents safe yoga classes going ahead, and is incredibly damaging to the business of teachers as well as the physical and mental health of the public. Yoga is well recognised for its ability to reduce anxiety and stress, conditions that are impacting the NHS and mental wellbeing of the UK population.",
