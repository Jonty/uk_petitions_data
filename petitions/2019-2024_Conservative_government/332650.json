        "action": "Parliament to vote on trade deals that include the privatisation of the NHS",
        "additional_details": "Opening up the NHS to corporations would mean that the profit motive invades our NHS, patient data is up for sale, access to healthcare is rationed and we would be staring at a system, where if you can\u2019t pay you don\u2019t get care.\r\nDecent healthcare is a human right and should never be a commodity to be bought and sold. A debate and vote within Parliament will ensure that the voices and concerns of the many are heard and considered before a trade deal is finalised.",
        "background": "We want the government to guarantee a parliamentary vote on trade deals that include the privatisation of the NHS. We want total transparency on all dealings involving private ownership or overseas control of the NHS. We would also like complete oversight on which MPs are backing trade deals.",
