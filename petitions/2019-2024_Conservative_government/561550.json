It doesn\u2019t make sense that whether you\u2019re on a prepayment or post payment meter and use the same electricity that the amount is different because you pay for it before you use it or you pay for it after you use it. It\u2019s disgusting that people who are unable to get credit or gain a post payment meter have to suffer with higher payments or charges because they are in an awful predicament.",
