A free meal would give us the extra energy to do our job and increase staff moral. Therefore leaving a bit more food for our loved ones at home.",
        "background": "As the goverment is asking staff to work extra and 65000 to come of retirement. Were unable to shop, therefore a free meal a day would be greatly appreciated. It's difficult to buy when people are panic buying. We need a meal to do the work the public expects.",
