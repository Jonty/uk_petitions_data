The defendant is generally the only one at a loss as a result, having to find time in their day to prove their innocence. Rather than companies/agencies being more responsible and lowering the risk of \u2018admin errors\u2019. This is another issue ontop of the cost of living. Taking time out of peoples days to prove their innocence also costs money.",
