        "additional_details": "Before the pandemic, the main rate of out-of-work support was at its lowest level in real terms since around 1990 and its lowest ever as a proportion of average wages. \r\nIt is widely accepted (including by those who were in Government at that time) that the incomes of the lowest-income families had been squeezed too much. \r\nThe six previous Secretaries of State for Work and Pensions warn against the cut. The present DWP has no, 'robust estimate' of the likely effect of the cut on child poverty.",
        "background": "I want the Government to keep the \u00a320 uplift to Universal Credit and not to cut the \u00a320 as it has said it plans.",
