        "additional_details": "The new laws that will require large restaurants, cafes and takeaways to add calorie labels to the food they sell will cause more harm than good. There are 1.25 million people in the UK suffering with eating disorders, and this new law will be detrimental to their recovery. This will lead to increased hospitalisation and inpatient treatment, all of which are cost they NHS. So while being proven to have little to no effect on those it\u2019s aimed at, this new law will make those with EDs suffer more.",
        "background": "We want the government to not make it mandatory to display calorie information on all food bought from large restaurants, cafes, and takeaways. Calorie labelling has an insufficient effect on the choices of those who this new strategy is aimed at, but jeopardises eating disorder recovery for others.",
