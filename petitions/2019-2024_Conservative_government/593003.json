In the UK 3 months into a deal one discovers that one or other party has not even started getting a mortgage application. A seller can drag their feet for months disrupting the lives of many people in the chain in the knowledge that they can pull out at any point causing untold chaos for all involved.  A simple sale in the UK can take from 90-120 days, this is laughable for a country of our standing.",

Purchasers should have mortgages before starting the process and Estate Agents and Lawyers  held accountable for holdups.",
