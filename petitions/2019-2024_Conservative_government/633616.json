Critics argue that this is both unfair and a drain on revenue gathered mainly from English taxpayers. The Scottish electorate persists in voting for parties that will spend more on public services and shows no sign of changing. England has done its best and carried these extra costs for decades now. There should be a referendum to decide whether Scotland should be ejected from the UK and told to live with its own means.",
