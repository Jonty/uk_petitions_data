        "additional_details": "Tuition Fees regardless of whether a pandemic is happening or not leaves every student with a hole in their pocket. Nobody should have to be thinking about their financial situation during a course they have passionately pursued. It is imperative that the Students of the UK get a refund for the academic year 2020/21 because they have been unable to utilise a University\u2019s resources due to the pandemic. Therefore, it is unfair that they have been forced to pay up to \u00a39,000 just for a Zoom call.",
        "background": "The Covid-19 Pandemic has seen University Students sent home while still having to pay the \u00a39,000 tuition fees. All while the majority of University Lectures take place within a Zoom call. This is leaving UK students worse off financially and they should get some kind of refund or compensation.",
