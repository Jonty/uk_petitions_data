        "additional_details": "Recent graduates (who often don't live alone as they're just starting their careers), have been completely forgotten about during the pandemic. Many can't bubble as they live in small households, but have recently moved far away from their families. Many have been isolated before covid having to live hundreds of miles away for graduate roles and now can't even visit their families. For their mental health they should be able to form a bubble with their family.",
        "background": "Give recent graduates the option to support bubble with their families, at least over the longer Christmas period. Students and single households have been looked after mentally while graduates haven't been considered.",
