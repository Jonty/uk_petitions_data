That's 30,000 families who have lost a loved one in the most tragic circumstances, unable to be with them when they died, to say goodbye or to even hold their hand.  Many of these other names were NHS medical staff who sacrificed their lives so that others may live.  As a Nation we are duty bound to remember them and honor their memory.",

These memorials should carry the name of person who died along with their age.  Do not let them fade into history and become a mere statistic.  Each name carries a family grieving for their loss.",
