Our trans siblings are one of the most vulnerable groups in modern society and face discrimination and often violence at a disproportionate rate. We need to carry out the results and apply the new guidelines from the consultation like you promised you would! The UK is a democracy, why do we not follow democratic rules on ALL issues",
