        "additional_details": "The #50\u2019s women have been campaigning tirelessly to have their pension lowered back to 60. However, the 50\u2019s women and those that have reached State Pension age should be treated fairly and be able claim their pension at 60 years old.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is now different ages for a woman and a man. That seems sexist and discriminatory.\r\n\r\nThe Govt and Parliament need to lower the SP age, stop ignoring the older generation, be fair and equal.",
        "background": "The Government and Parliament need to lower the State Pension age back to 60 for both men and women.\r\n\r\nIf the Government do not lower the State Pension age, there needs to be a vote for it in Parliament.",
