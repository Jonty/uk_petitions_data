        "action": "Force all products to state on front whether ALL their contents are recyclable.",
        "additional_details": "We need to bring absolute clarity to the amount of non recyclable packaging used, by forcing companies to admit this on the front of the packaging. Often cardboard packages are used, but non recycled packaging is inside. Also, plastics are frequently used which are not recyclable, and it's easy to forget to check this when buying. By forcing companies to only be able to stock items that comply, we force huge numbers of organisations to take a serious look at their sustainability commitments or risk losing sales.",
        "background": "Make it a requirement by law for every consumable item to state on its front if every item of packaging used is widely recyclable.\r\nIf Not Yet Recycled is stated, to make it a legal requirement to use a recyclable alternative within 26 weeks once the law is passed.",
