        "action": "Abolish the statistical model used for A level results in England and Wales.",
        "additional_details": "Almost 40% of A-level results have been downgraded, impacting the futures of thousands of young people. For many pupils, the algorithm doesn\u2019t even consider the grades our teachers predicted us. This unfairly harms lower-income pupils from schools with poorer academic results in the past, posing a structural obstacle to the achievement of upward social mobility. The postcode you were born in and the school you attended should not determine whether or not you have a chance to go to university.",
        "background": "1. Abolish the \u2018marking down\u2019 of individuals on the basis of their school\u2019s results in the past\r\n2. Launch a free appeals system open to all pupils\r\n3. Place more emphasis on the assessment of teachers, who are better situated to judge a student\u2019s capacity than a computational algorithm.",
