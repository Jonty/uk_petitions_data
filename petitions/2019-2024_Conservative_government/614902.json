        "additional_details": "According to Express, as of 2021, there are just under 40k British expats living in China, many of them live in Shanghai. The UK should try to influence the Chinese government by any means necessary to safeguard the life qualities of its expats in the city undergoing stringent lockdown. It also demonstrates the global responsibility of the UK government in international issues affecting a large population.",
        "background": "Shanghai has been in a stringent lockdown for weeks, severely impacting the lives of >25m people. It has caused a general food shortage and mishandling of patients who need medical attention. Although this is China's internal affair, the UK could express concern over this issue to raise attention.",
