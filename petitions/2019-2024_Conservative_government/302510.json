        "additional_details": "We want placement hours to be signed off if it comes to us being unable to attend placement either due to being told to self-isolate due to symptoms, or if our team that we are assigned to at the time are told to close or work from home etc. COVID-19 is currently out of our control, we do not get paid for placement, and if doctors/nurses/OT\u2019s have to self isolate or their teams close, they get statutory sick pay. Therefore I think it\u2019s only fair that we get our hours signed off as an equivalent.",
        "background": "Nursing/Medical Students have to do a certain number of placement hours to qualify, however in the future it may be recommended for some teams to work from home and do minimal/emergency contact with patients. Where does this leave well students who are expected to make hours up once COVID clears?",
