        "additional_details": "This recent report from the New Weather Institute https://bit.ly/3uLtTqP shows that the places where SUVs dominate are also where road space is most scarce. Large SUVs are too big for a standard UK parking space, and are some of the most polluting vehicles in terms of air quality and carbon emissions.\r\n\r\nSUVs are unsafe. They encourage aggressive driving, and their drivers have less visibility of other road users - particularly children, who may be less tall than the front of the vehicle.",
        "background": "Restrict the use of SUVs in towns and cities, especially in the main centres and residential areas. Enforce a maximum length and width for vehicles parking on narrow streets and in tight car parks. Allow necessary exemptions for commercial vehicles and those specially adapted for access.",
