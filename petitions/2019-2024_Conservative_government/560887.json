        "additional_details": "Incidents in London and Manchester involving knife crime have occurred leading to injury and more deaths of innocent people. The law needs to implement stricter punishment on those who carry knives, mental health shouldn't be allowed as an escape goat. Those who carry & use knives should be given longer sentences. More support mentally is required to those effected by knife crime and reassurance that our streets are safe. More surrender bins should be implemented to prompt the disposal of knives",
        "background": "Knife Crime in the UK is on the rise and 2020 is evident of this. 6th September myself and 7 others were involved in a knife attack, leading to death of Jacob Billington. How did Boris Johnson respond? A simple tweet of wishes, not good enough. Since this day there has been more cases of knife crime",
