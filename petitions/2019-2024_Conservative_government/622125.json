        "additional_details": "Despite Sadiq Khan's assurances, the first ULEZ extension has caused massive problems for residents caught inside the zone, and people that work in the zone - Not just commuters but independent tradesmen such as electricians, plumbers, mechanics etc.\r\nOn top of this, the price of new and used ULEZ compliant vehicles has increased dramatically, putting them out of the reach of most people who are already struggling with increased bills and day to day costs of living.",
        "background": "Stop the ULEZ from being extended to cover all of London - It has already been extended once with a minimal effect on pollution compared to the vast amount of tax payer money wasted one it. This money could be put to better use than trying to 'catch out' more drivers.",
