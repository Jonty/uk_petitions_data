This is more information required than PHD level study, and can take 3-5 years to achieve. By recognising this achievement with a honours or higher degree, will allow thousands of London Taxi Drivers to apply to a wider set of employers, with a more recognised educational achievement. Currently very few employers are aware of the level of study required.",
