        "additional_details": "The Government continues to claim that schools cannot open safely to all year groups. This is despite the fact that the risk of children catching, transmitting or being seriously ill from Covid19 has been proven to be very low.\r\n\r\nThe multiple risks of children being kept away from school are incalculable - lost education, mental health and social impacts and the threat to the more vulnerable to name a few. For many parents these risks far outweigh the risks of Covid19.",
        "background": "All over the UK children and teenagers can visit a car showroom, visit a zoo or go to Primark but many still cannot go to school.",
