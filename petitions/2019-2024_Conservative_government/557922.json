        "additional_details": "Many parents are worried about our children's futures and more importantly their mental health. Schools provide so much more than an education. Some children only get a hot meal at school. For some children, school is their only safe place. Social interaction is imperative in a child's development too. \r\nClosing schools will be detrimental to many children and their parents/carers.\r\nClosing schools will also alienate a lot of children. Especially those that do not have internet at home. Child suicides is another concern. With so many children reliant on school for many different reasons, we as parents demand the schools stay open.",
