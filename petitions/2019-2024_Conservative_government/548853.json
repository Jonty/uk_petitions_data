        "additional_details": "The NHS has been under a lot of pressure throughout the years and this year has been no exception. One of the ways to help alleviate the stress would be to increase the number of doctors within the system. By removing the cap, more students will be able to train as doctors and by 2025/2026 will be junior doctors in the NHS. After cancelling exams and giving results based on a \u2018Postcode lottery\u2019 and classist system, it is only fair the students affected get into their chosen universities.",
        "background": "After the U-turn on A-Level grades, many students have now achieved the entry requirements necessary to get into their chosen universities. Whilst the cap on intake has been lifted in many subjects, it has not been lifted for medicine. This means many students cannot attend university this year.",
