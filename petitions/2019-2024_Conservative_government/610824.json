        "action": "Allow both parents to be present together on childrens wards.",
        "additional_details": "Since covid, hospitals have had restrictions on visiting to protect patients. \r\nHowever as we come out of covid, I think it is important to remember that a child needs their parents when they are ill, whether that be mum or dad. \r\nThe pressure on parents when their child is sick is already very intense, and therefore not allowing both parents to see and be with their child and be together during that time is adding to their stress. \r\nIt is not in the best interests of the child or the family.",
        "background": "Ensure that on childrens wards, both parents can visit together, with a negative covid test if necessary, in order to support the child when they are ill. Some hospitals do not allow parents to alternate regularly or be there together and that causes stress and ill mental health within families.",
