        "additional_details": "After the nation celebrated the work of the NHS and care workers no one actually mentioned anything about the key NHS support workforce. Domestic workers are cleaning COVID-19 contaminated hospital wards and public areas everyday. Without them all hospitals would be closed. Porters transfer patients and taking blood samples. Catering serving three meals a day to all patients.\r\nI decided to start a campaign for the government to recognise their work and give them better pay, as the majority of these workers only receive the minimum wage and are putting their health on the line as they support vital functions for the NHS and public. These workers have only basic PPE as they carry out these services. Let\u2019s recognise this service and bravery with this campaign.",
