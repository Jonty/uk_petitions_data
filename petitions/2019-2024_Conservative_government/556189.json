        "additional_details": "In incidents of sexual violence reported to the National Crime Victimization Survey, 38% of victims were men. Rape, the crime, typically committed by a man, of forcing another person to have sexual intercourse with the offender against their will. The law in the UK states that in all parts of the United Kingdom a female cannot be legally charged with 'rape' she must be instead charged with other offenses such as sexual assault, assault by penetration, or causing sexual activity without consent.",
        "background": "Men can get trauma, like women can. Women still have sexual organs, even without a penis. Change the law about men being raped. Don't give women similar charges, to rape. Forcing someone to have sexual intercourse without their consent is rape, and both genders should be charged for it.",
