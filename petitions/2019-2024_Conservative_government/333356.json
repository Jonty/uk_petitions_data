        "additional_details": "Displaying calorie information on restaurant menus enables and encourages eating disorder behaviours, and harms the recovery plans that those in recovery have put in place with their ED specialists. Between 1.25 and 3.4 million people in the UK are experiencing an eating disorder (this doesn\u2019t include those suffering alone), and diagnosis rate is on the rise every year. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder, making those suffering very vulnerable.",
        "background": "The government should be consulting with eating disorder and nutritional specialists to make decisions about how to encourage the UK public to make healthy food choices. The plans should be supportive of all people, and should not have a detrimental effect on the most vulnerable in society.",
