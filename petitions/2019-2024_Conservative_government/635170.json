        "additional_details": "There has been many incidents where I have not been able to park in a parent/child bay and that extra space is essential, especially with an infant. Trying to get them out of a car seat and then into their buggy requires extra room.\r\nI've had men in vans park in these bays, as well as an OAP couple (without a DB), which left me with a standard car bay, struggling to get my 6 month old baby out of the car, without damaging the car next to me.\r\nEvery parent I have spoken with feel the same.",
        "background": "It should be illegal to park in a parent/child bay if you do not have a child, under the age of 12 with you.\r\n\r\nJust like disability parking, parents should be issued with a badge, establishing the child they are with. If no child is present they should be issued with a penalty charge.",
