        "additional_details": "They are a waste of tax payer's money, there are not enough cyclists on the roads to warrant prioritising cyclists over drivers. Who would want to cycle in the rain or turn up sweaty to work everyday? It causes more congestion, it has been proven that there are approx 97% more drivers on the road than cyclists. Cyclists never use the lanes anyway causing a danger to the public. It should be a public vote whether cycle lanes should be created in London. London is a big city, this is NOT Amsterdam",
