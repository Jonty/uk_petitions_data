It\u2019s crucial for many people to get certain grades to get into uni\u2019s and to get the qualifications they need for the future. There are many students very stressed and worried about what grade they will get because their predicted grade isn\u2019t good enough.",
        "background": "It\u2019s unfair to judge a grade for GCSE, AS and A-level students based on predicted grades, as when I was in school, for both GCSE and A-levels, I was predicted D\u2019s and lower and came out with all of my GCSE\u2019s (10) and two A\u2019s and a C at A-level. The minimum grade given should be a C.",
