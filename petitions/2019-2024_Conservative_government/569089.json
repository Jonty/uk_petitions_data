We want the Government to keep the ban which is currently in place, and not relax the rules on this.",
        "background": "Bee-killing pesticides are currently banned for use in the United Kingdom, they are also banned in the EU. It is reported in mainstream media (The Independent 09/01/2021) that the Government could authorise use of these banned pesticides for sugar beet crops and others.",
