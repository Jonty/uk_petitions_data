        "additional_details": "Edward Colston (1636-1721) was a Bristol-based slave-trader whose ships transported 84,000 men, women and children from West Africa to the Americas. 19,000 died during the crossings and yet his name is still honoured through Bristol.\r\n\r\nOn June 7th 2020, his statue was torn down in protest for the Black Lives Matter movement. The people of Bristol have had enough of living surrounded by schools, venues and other buildings that honour his name.",
        "background": "We want the Government to take a stand with the Black Lives Matter movement in ensuring slave-trader Edward Colston\u2019s name will not longer be honoured in the titles of schools, venues and other buildings in Bristol and the surrounding areas.",
