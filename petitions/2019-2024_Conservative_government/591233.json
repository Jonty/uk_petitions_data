        "additional_details": "There has been around 1 million adverse reactions & 1,403 deaths post vaccination reported by 250,000 people through the MHRA Yellow card scheme since the vaccination programme began. This information is being suppressed. It is never mentioned in Parliament, it is never discussed on the main stream media, & people are simply told that the vaccine is safe & that side effects are minor. The Government & the medical profession are failing in their duty of care to people that are being vaccinated.",
        "background": "I would like a debate on the adverse events data reported to the MHRA through the Yellow Card Scheme. This information should be widely publicised & available to the general public in order for them to make a balanced 'informed consent' decision based on all known risks and benefits of vaccination.",
