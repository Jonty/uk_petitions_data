        "additional_details": "The part of the fees goes for the facilities, equipments, etc. used, that is provided by the universities. Paying the same tuition fee for just online materials like prerecorded lectures and when above mentioned things are not being used is not fair. \r\nTherefore, along with the home students, the fees of the international students should also be reduced drastically.",
        "background": "The tuition fee for academic year 2020/21 should be reduced by at least 50% for international students. Expecting overseas students to pay an average of \u00a315000 for an education that is not to the same standard is not justified.",
