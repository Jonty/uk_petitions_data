        "additional_details": "By implementing the change it will separate families, kids will be without parents and deprive British citizens of their human rights to stay in their own country because of unrealistic wages that majority of UK do not earn.\r\nForeign nationals do not use Public funds as they are not entitled and they pay their taxes and a Surcharge for NHS so this change won't help with the immigration problems. It'll just create more issues of illegal entry as people can't meet these unrealistic requirements.",
        "background": "To not increase wage requirements for Family/spousal visas by double the amount. Minimum wage hasn't increased that much since 2012 so they shouldn't increase requirements that disregard majority of British citizens that marry foreign nationals.",
