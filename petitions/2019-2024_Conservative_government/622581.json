It is a pointless act whilst you have industries chugging out greenhouse gases in economies like China and India. \r\nUntil a global change is agreed on the current net zero policy is a virtue signalling death-knell to many of us regardless of our income levels.",
        "background": "Remove a body that\u2019s not fit for purpose and will cripple our country inadvertently pushing us into a 3rd world state.  The energy caps are perverse and the reverse of what a price cap is considering the profit levels of the energy provider owners like Centrica/Shell",
