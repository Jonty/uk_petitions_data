        "additional_details": "The Government  of the UK has for far to long taken a view that carers just get on with it, while saving them millions in care costs. It's high time that this was addressed in Parliament  to bring this subject to the nation.\r\nCarers,  many of which have no income at all are being  overlooked. The fact they care for someone  they love or are family is used by The government to  gain free care at no cost.\r\nIts about time this changed and Carers are given reward for their efforts in the work they do.",
        "background": "I'd like to see the Government  debate giving home Carers a living wage.\r\nThose that have to stay at home often having to give up wonderful  careers are taken for granted by the state.\r\nBring carers  standard of living up to a fair living wage for the work they do.",
