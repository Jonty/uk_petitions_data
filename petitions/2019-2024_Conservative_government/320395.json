        "action": "Increase income tax to properly fund the NHS.",
        "additional_details": "During the Coronavirus pandemic, we have seen how central a functioning NHS is to our health, our lives and our economy. We have given thanks and been charitable. Now we have to produce the funding to ensure the NHS can fulfil the role we now realise we rely on; today and in the uncertain future. This means redistributive taxation and, as Income Tax is the cornerstone of this, we propose a modest rise to all rates in an income tax structure which has been little changed during many parliaments.",
        "background": "The NHS and its workers deserve our thanks and applause. What they now need, is proper funding. We therefore propose increasing Income tax by adding 1p to the basic rate, 2p to the higher rate and 3p to additional rate. Our NHS, for us and funded by us. It needs us to help in this way now.",
