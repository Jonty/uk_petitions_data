        "additional_details": "Current practices and pressures emanating from the Dept for Education, and filtering down through the system, demand a one size fits all approach, shrouded in the guise of every child matters. \r\n\r\nMany SEND children, parents and teachers are at the end of their individual and collective tethers. \r\n\r\nAccessing appropriate education for a SEND child has become a battleground. Parents and children pitted against teaching staff, schools and LEAs. \r\n\r\nSystemic change is required, this would benefit all.",
        "background": "The current education system in England is not fit for purpose. The race to standardisation & academisation has led to a mainstream education system that many children are unable to access and within which many teachers no longer enjoy teaching. Inclusive and accessible education for all is a must.",
