This leaves students having to look at other means to complete work which has led to alot of mental strain and stress.\r\n\r\nStudents are also having to continue to pay for student accommodation. However now universities have closed they are incurring costs which is not benefitting them because they no longer need to live at the accommodation. In some cases resulting in some getting into debt.",
