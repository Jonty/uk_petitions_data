        "additional_details": "During this pandemic we have been consistently told that we need to follow the guidance in order to defeat the virus. That is the equivalent as trying to defeat the flu that is around every year. It will never happen. By imposing restrictions we are simply delaying the inevitable. People below the age of 20 are 17 times more likely to die due to other factors than Covid. Let's speak up, stop this disproportionate response and get our life back.",
        "background": "Covid-19 has stripped our personal freedoms, prevented people from seeking medical attention on separate issues, nearly 750,000 job losses and of course the economic turmoil. We need to shield the vulnerable and allow others to get on and live with a virus that cannot be defeated.",
