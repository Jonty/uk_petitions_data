        "additional_details": "Pre-CPC legislation dates, drivers could do the same job. Now, all drivers have to have this qualification. When older and thus more experienced drivers passed their HGV tests, there was no requirement for a CPC and it did not make them any less capable for the job. There were driving restrictions in other areas added for drivers who passed their tests after 1997. This who passed prior to that day inherited 'Grandfather rights'. This should be the case now.",
        "background": "To make it easier for ex-HGV drivers to return to the sector, remove the requirement of the CPC for drivers who obtained their HGV licences pre-1997, and provide grants to those who need to pay for a medical exam in order to renew their license.",
