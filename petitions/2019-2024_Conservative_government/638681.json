        "action": "Ban the sale of single-use disposable vapes.",
        "additional_details": "Disposable vapes surged the market, significantly marketing young people, selling over 1 million/week, despite having a scarce lithium-ion battery (Material Focus, 2022).\r\nMost go to general waste. When not recycled (WEEE waste), they risk fires during collection and processing.\r\nContaining mixed materials and hazardous chemicals, they require manual dismantlement; processing 1M+/week is unfeasible.\r\nA ban aligns to a circular economy, net zero, and allows reusable devices for smoking cessation.",
        "background": "Ban the import and sale of single-use disposable vapes.\r\n\r\nInterim:\r\nRetailers, manufacturers and distributors comply with Extended Producer Responsibility, and improve disposal information.\r\nStrengthen trading standards aligning with tobacco; removing multi-buy deals and selling behind screens.",
