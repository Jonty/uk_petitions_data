What the Universities fail to understand is that they haven't the right to dictate what risks we may or may not take with our lives. We are sovereign individuals with the right to take responsibility for ourselves and make our own decisions. They do not have the right to refuse accreditation in retaliation for defiance as they threaten.",

They must be forced to accept the sovereign will of individuals. No matter what the risk or perceived wisdom of that choice. After much failed protest we must petition.\r\nMore Below.",
