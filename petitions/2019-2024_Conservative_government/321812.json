        "action": "Companies must pay tax on all UK assets to receive Coronavirus bailout funds",
        "additional_details": "The government is in an unprecedented position to hold companies accountable for their tax arrangements. With many companies already receiving state funds or hoping to acquire them in the future due to the current Coronavirus pandemic. By making them pay their tax in the UK, they are rightly held accountable for the money they make in the UK and the aid they are receiving from the British tax payer. This would also clearly aid in the economic recovery that will be required in the future.",
        "background": "The government should make all Coronavirus related bailout funds conditional upon companies signing a contract to register all their UK based assets in the UK to pay tax. With a 10-20 year clause that prevents them from moving any assets back into tax havens upon receiving bailout funds.",
