        "additional_details": "My sister is a teacher, for 6 months schools were closed and we had no cases of COVID in our house. I work in the NHS and there is another frontline worker in the house (we are provided face masks). Upon returning to school she contracted COVID. She is not provided face masks. Is expected to take her own, with no such opportunity to change them at regular intervals. Why aren\u2019t you protecting our teachers when figures show that the opening of schools has directly resulted in an increase of cases?",
        "background": "Teachers should be given appropriate PPE, namely face masks (such as the 3-ply) like any other front line worker. The conditions that they work in are crowded and by having to bring in their own PPE, which may not be adequate, will see an increase in COVID cases. Are teachers less valuable?",
