        "additional_details": "I was walking my dog on 19/08/2020 in a public area on a lead. Another dog who was not on a lead attacked my dog and in the process of this happening I received a bite to my right thigh. This has resulted in me needing a Tetanus injection and two courses of antibiotics as the wound is infected. If walking dogs on a lead in public became Law, future events similar to this can be prevented. Having full control over a dog is not possible if the dog is not on a lead. Make it Luna's Law",
        "background": "Change the Law to ensure people have to keep their dogs on a lead whilst in public places or around livestock at all times to prevent losing control of the dog and causing injury to a person or another animal.",
