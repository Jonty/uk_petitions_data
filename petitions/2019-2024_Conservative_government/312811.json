I finally got given some from a friend but out of interest I went on eBay to see a lot of people who\u2019d obviously stock piled and were selling \u00a33.50 bottles of calpol for as much as \u00a330. I\u2019m led to believe they\u2019re doing the same with baby formula. This shouldn\u2019t be allowed.",
