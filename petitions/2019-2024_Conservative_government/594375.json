By 2017, that figure had more than doubled to 4 years.** In many cases, land with residential planning permission isn\u2019t even held by developers; it sits with land promoters whose sole purpose is to speculate on the value of the land increasing with no intention of building anything. The result is an entire generation who are priced out of the housing market. \r\n(*The Times)\r\n(**Home Truths)",

Large housing developers hoard land & slow build in order to keep prices high & maximize profit. These developers should be taxed & ultimately receive Compulsory Purchase Orders.",
