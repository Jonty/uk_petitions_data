This includes the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme that helps protect people\u2019s jobs and helps employers to still provide important benefits such as enhanced contractual maternity pay. \r\n\r\nWe have made regulations to ensure women will not lose out on Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) should they be affected by a period of furlough pay. The regulations require employers to calculate SMP on normal earnings rather than reduced pay. It is also possible for employers to offer furlough pay at the end of a woman\u2019s maternity leave and pay period, in effect extending the period a woman is away from work.\r\n\r\nWe understand that the social distancing measures mean that there are limited opportunities for parents to participate in activities normally available, such as parent and baby groups or introducing their newborn to family friends. This is regrettable but necessary to help safeguard the health of individuals, including other new mothers and babies.\r\n\r\nMaternity Leave and Pay are provided to enable employed women to take time off work in the later stages of their pregnancy and after they have given birth.  In addition, the UK\u2019s Maternity Leave offer is already amongst the most generous in the world, with up to 52 weeks leave available and 39 weeks of pay.

More details will be announced shortly.\nThis session continues the Committee\u2019s ongoing inquiry into the Government\u2019s response to Coronavirus. The Committee\u2019s questions to the Government have been informed by unprecedented levels of engagement from petitioners and other members of the public on this issue, particularly the impacts on maternal mental health, childcare and maternity leave. Thousands of petitioners have completed our surveys which have helped the Committee to understand the issues petitioners are facing, and it is very grateful for everyone\u2019s contributions.\nOne of our surveys, which received over 12,000 responses, found that 78% of respondents have been unable to find and secure suitable childcare to allow them to return to work. 81% told us they were considering delaying their return to work as a result, with 80% of these being offered no options at all to extend their leave by their employer. Many of you reported using your annual leave allowance to delay your return, but some noted this would prevent them taking any further holiday once lockdown conditions had been lifted.\nYou can read a summary of what petitioners told us about their experiences here: https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/5350/default/. \nA separate survey found that less than 3% of nurseries felt they would be able to reopen with the same capacity as before, with nearly 7% believing they would not be able to reopen at all in light of the current coronavirus crisis. In the survey, which was sent to childcare providers and employees who had signed relevant petitions, over 70% of providers said they either disagreed or strongly disagreed with the UK Government\u2019s plans to reopen from 1 June. \nThis information helped the Committee when questioning experts on the impact of lockdown on maternal mental health, access to childcare, and maternity pay on 21 May. You can watch this session and read the transcript here: https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/326/petitions-committee/news/146495/petitions-committee-questioned-experts-on-maternal-mental-health-adoption-and-childcare/\nThese recent surveys were used to dig deeper into issues first raised in the Committee\u2019s evidence session on the extension of maternity leave on 7 May. Ahead of that session, the Committee had received over 27,000 responses to a survey of petitioners, and over 25,000 responses to a Facebook post- a record for the House of Commons Facebook page.

The Coronavirus is having a huge impact on families in many different ways and hearing personal stories and feedback is informing our inquiry and allowing us to better understand why people are signing these petitions.\n\u201cThe evidence we collect drives the direction of our inquiries and ensures that we are challenging the Government on these issues effectively. We will be holding our next evidence session on this topic later this month, where we will question Government Ministers and hold them to account on this very issue.\n\u201cThe Petitions Committee is determined to continue to investigate the impact COVID-19 is having on all communities.

In its landmark report, the Committee urged the Government to meet with the sector to ensure necessary support was received. \nThe Committee also received a petition with almost 15,000 signatures calling for better clarity and support for the sector. The Committee wrote to the Government in September when it emerged the lack of clarity within the guidance was forcing many groups to close.  \nChair of the Petitions Committee, Catherine McKinnell said:\n\u201cThe recent addition of parent, baby and toddler groups to the list of exemptions from gathering limits in all tiers is a clear, if long overdue, acknowledgement by the Government that they are vital to young families and our society as a whole.\n\u201cOur inquiry heard compelling evidence from new parents and experts on how crucial these groups can be for the mental health of new parents, providing support and a much-needed lifeline at such an important time in their lives.\n\u201cThis addition to the guidance on exemptions is testament to our petitioners and campaigners who worked tirelessly to demand clarity for the sector, and of the power of the petitions system. \n\u201cBecause of these petitioners\u2019 drive for change, many who otherwise might not have had the support they need will be able to access these groups during what has been, and continues to be, an extremely challenging time for new parents.\u201d\nWhat does the new guidance say?\nWith the updated guidance now explicitly mentioning these groups, many are now clearly exempt from gatherings limits. The official exemptions in all tiers include: \n\u2022 Supervised activities provided for children, including wraparound care (before and after-school childcare), groups and activities for under 18s, and children\u2019s playgroups, for formal support groups, and parent and child groups \u2013 up to 15 people aged five and older.\n\u2022 In the guidance for early years and childcare providers, the following exemptions are included:\no   Parent and child groups that meet in Ofsted registered settings can operate in all local restriction tiers. \no   Groups meeting in community spaces, such as in a place of worship, community centre or library, can operate in all local restriction tiers and should follow COVID secure guidance for the venue.\nRead the full guidance here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures#parent-and-child-groups \nRead about the Committee\u2019s report here: https://houseofcommons.shorthandstories.com/how-has-maternity-and-parental-leave-been-impacted-by-coronavirus-/index.html \nFind the petition asking for clarity for the baby group sector here: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/331261 \nRead the letter to the Government here: https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/2699/documents/26695/default/ \nAnd the Government\u2019s reply here: https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/2970/documents/28398/default/\n",
