        "action": "Accept single-dose COVID-19 vaccine for previously infected individuals",
        "additional_details": "Studies show that people with previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 mount powerful immune responses to single shots, and gain no added benefit from another injection. France, Germany, Italy, among other countries, now advise only one dose of vaccine for people with a healthy immune system and a confirmed previous diagnosis. This strategy will allow a faster rollout of the vaccination campaign. \r\nAdditionally a one-jab policy for those who\u2019ve been infected might even help to overcome vaccine apathy.",
        "background": "Based on scientific evidence, administer only one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to adults who do not have compromised immune systems and have already been infected by the virus in the past. This strategy would free up many urgently needed vaccine doses and speed up the vaccine rollout in the UK.",
