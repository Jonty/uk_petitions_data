        "action": "Allow 1 family member to stay in the hospital with a Covid patient",
        "additional_details": "We want the government to allow 1 family member to stay with the patient in the hospital so that nurses and doctors can focus on the medical side of their job and not need to be on hand to see to the patients feeding and personal needs. The family member would be able to relieve the nurses of the extra tasks. This will allow the patient to have the help and hopefully a quicker recovery and take a huge burden off the NHS. Covid patients will feel secure having someone they know by their side.",
        "background": "The NHS is overwhelmed. That we all know. Nurses should be working only to see to patients medical needs. For everything else such as feeding, taking the patient to the bathroom and assisting with their other needs 1 family member should be allowed to enter with the patient and remain at their side",
