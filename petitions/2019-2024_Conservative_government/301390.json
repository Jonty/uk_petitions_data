        "action": "Postpone local government & Mayoral Elections on May 7 to help combat Covid-19.",
        "additional_details": "Voting equipment like shared pens and voting booths might be contaminated. Voters could be put off going to vote for fear of getting ill. Polling station and count staff are at risk. Activists across the country going door to door speaking to voters could put people, particularly elderly at risk. Local government staff and emergency services should be focused on supporting vulnerable residents and fighting the virus threat at such a crucial time.",
        "background": "I want the government to postpone local government and Mayoral elections due to be held on May 7, 2020, to help reduce the spread of Corna virus. Delay the elections so our local authorities and emergency services can focus on combating the virus rather than preparing for elections.",
