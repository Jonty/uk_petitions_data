        "action": "Reduce weekly placement hours for student nurses from 40 hours, to 24-30.",
        "additional_details": "Due to stress on student nurses. We feel we are being overworked, some feel burnt out already. With no time for social life without feeling emotionally drained, and no time for academic work as we are in busy wards where staff hardly have time to evidence our work. Also due to the shortages in the NHS at the moment, training has become a daunting prospect. 40 hours a week for students who have to travel long distances for 14 hour shifts is nearly impossible. Please think about us.",
        "background": "Reduce student placement hours, to a more reasonable 24-30 hours a week. This would vastly improve student nurses mental health across the country and reduce stress.",
