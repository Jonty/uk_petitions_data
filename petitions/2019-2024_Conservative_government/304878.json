        "additional_details": "Many university\u2019s throughout England have turned to online learning due to the coronavirus outbreak, which has led to the cancellation of lectures and tutorials for the rest of the academic year. We are often told that the tuition fee of approximately \u00a39250 is spent on the maintenance of the university and physical resources such as paper etc. This will no longer apply. \r\n\r\nMany students renting accommodation will lose out on money but have paid rent in advance or are tied in contracts.",
        "background": "The government should dismiss or reduce the final payment of students\u2019 university tuition loan which will be due in May for the academic year 2019-20 so students do not have to pay for the level of service that they expected to receive but will no longer.",
