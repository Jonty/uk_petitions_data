        "additional_details": "As explained by Independent SAGE the science suggests that a Zero Covid objective will both help the economy recover faster AND save lives by allowing the UK to get back to normal more quickly instead of prolonging the problem.\r\n\r\nCurrently the UK death toll is one of the highest in the world per capita and the economy hit the hardest. The current approach of 'flattening the curve' and 'making sure the NHS isn't overwhelmed' isn't good enough - we need to be much more ambitious.",
        "background": "The UK government should fundamentally change its approach and work towards the strategic objective of achieving a Zero COVID\r\nUK, i.e. the elimination of the virus from the UK.\r\n\r\nNew Zealand, Australia, Iceland and South Korea have successfuly achieved this and we need to learn from them.",
