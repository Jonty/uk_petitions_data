With the increase in rogue landlords, tenants also have a right to know that they are going to have a reliable and trustworthy landlord. Private renting in the UK urgently needs reforms, and without government intervention, it is unlikely that such reforms in the sector would take place.",
        "background": "Tenants are often asked to give references to show they can afford the property, and will be good tenants. This includes providing previous landlord references. It is therefore only fair that similar background checks are required of landlords too, to minimise risks of renting from rogue landlords.",
