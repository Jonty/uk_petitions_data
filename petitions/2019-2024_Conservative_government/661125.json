        "additional_details": "When children leave school with 100% attendance but have missed out on life and family experiences, it is concerning. It is important for children to have family experiences for their own personal development and wellbeing.  The government should be encouraging holidays and life experiences to enrich the education, development, and wellbeing of all children. Not all parents are able to take their children on holiday out of term time, and others are unable to take their family during busy times.",
