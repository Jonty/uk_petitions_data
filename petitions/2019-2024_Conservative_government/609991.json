        "additional_details": "Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine on the 24th of February 2022, the UN predicted that the conflict will create up to 5 million refugees. Hundreds of thousands of people had been displaced within 24 hours of the invasion. Waiving visa restrictions and creating routes for asylum seekers to come to the UK will help people flee Ukraine and find safety and a new home in the UK. Ukrainians have had their lives completely and permanently changed; we must help them in their hour of need.",
        "background": "On the 26th of February 2022, the Government changed the rules around visa applications to make it harder for Ukrainians to enter the UK. We want all visa restrictions for Ukrainians to be waived and for safe and legal asylum routes to be established for Ukrainian refugees to come to the UK.",
