        "additional_details": "It\u2019s so awfully unfair for those caught in the middle of the 2017-2020 changes in funding. As a student nurse commencing the course in September 2017, I will be leaving this course with just over \u00a360000 worth of debt despite the 2300 hours plus I\u2019ve spent delivering care within UK hospitals and other care settings under immense pressures. How is it right that we have effectively paid the government for the privilege of undergoing such stresses throughout the long hours we put into the NHS?",
        "background": "We want the government to reassess and write off the student debt incurred by student nurses/midwives/AHP\u2019s from the September 2017 cohorts and subsequent cohorts. We then want the government to consider funding the future of NHS health workers and remove tuition fees moving forward.",
