        "additional_details": "Many of the businesses that are being forced to close have the smallest infection rates. We need to manage covid in a different way so we have a country left at the end of it. If lockdowns continue the governments problems will be much worse with homelessness, suicides, mass unemployment children and families going hungry. And these are just a few mentioned. As business owners we have helped make this country great with our hard work so lets not let covid effect that.",
        "background": "Allow businesses to stay open as the effects of a lock down again will leave business in financial ruin or closures. Resulting in mass job losses, bankruptcy, families going hungry, mental health issues, suicides on the rise and so much more devastating consequences.",
