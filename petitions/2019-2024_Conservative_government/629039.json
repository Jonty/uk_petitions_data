        "action": "Ban the manufacture and sale of disposable vapes",
        "additional_details": "Disposable vapes contain lithium batteries, metal wiring and plastic parts. \r\n\r\nCarelessly discarded vapes now litter the UK and pose a choking hazard to wildlife. The batteries pose a fire hazard and leach toxic chemicals into the environment. \r\n\r\nResearch suggests that people in the UK are throwing away approximately two disposable vapes every second, resulting in 10 tonnes of lithium being sent to landfill every year.\r\n\r\nLithium is a precious metal that is used in electric cars and solar panels.",
        "background": "Allowing the manufacture and sale of disposable vapes is undermining national targets to reduce the amount of chemicals and plastics entering the environment. Government must work urgently with manufacturers and retailers to ban the manufacture and sale of disposable vapes to protect the environment",
