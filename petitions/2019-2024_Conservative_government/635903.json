        "additional_details": "The Hunting Act 2004 has proved hard to police and uphold in England and Wales in accordance with the laws stated in the act. Hunting with packs of hounds across the British Isles continues as it did before the Hunting Act was legislated in 2004. Loopholes in the legislature of the hunting act 2004 are exploited by Hunts who continue hunting wild mammals with packs of dogs.\r\nThe Hunting Act 2004 is not specific enough and difficult to understand and implement by the police, leading to disrepute of the police forces across England and Wales.",
        "background": "Replace the Hunting Act 2004 with the Hunting with Dogs (Scotland) Act 2023. \r\nUpdate the current legislation detailed in the hunting act 2004 to include the legislation in the Hunting with dogs (Scotland) Act 2023 in order to streamline legislation across the UK.",
