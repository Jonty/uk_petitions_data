        "additional_details": "Currently, Freedom Pass holders can only use their passes after 9am (https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/free-and-discounted-travel/freedom-pass) this restricts Pass holders and forces them to pay for travel should they need to be somewhere before 9am. The Government and TFL should rectify this to reduce the stress of Pass holders who may reschedule appointments or miss other ventures that may aid their physical and/or mental health, due to the worry of not having the means to pay for a ticket before 9am.",
        "background": "The Government needs to work in conjunction with TFL to remove the limitations on Freedom Passes to allow them to be used for free 24/7. Forcing the elderly citizens of our society to pay for travel before a set time when it is free for majority of the week is unacceptable.",
