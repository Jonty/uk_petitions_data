        "additional_details": "I believe the ban on these types of registration is unnecessary. With the correct updates on the ANPR systems, these registration plates would not be an issue. They\u2019re expensive which allows tax to come straight back to the government. I believe these registration plates cause no harm to the roads, providing they are legally spaced and if anything highlight what the registration is more so than normal registrations.",
        "background": "I believe that 3D/4D registration plates do not effect identification of a car when speeding or committing any other illegal acts whilst on the road. Prior to purchasing a 3D/4D registration plate you must prove ownership of the vehicle alongside provide a valid UK driving license.",
