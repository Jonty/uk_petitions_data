        "additional_details": "In May 2020, the bank holidays have served little purpose - they have not been used for leisure due to the lockdown and many remote workers have continued to work through them due to lack of other options for the time. They have neither boosted the leisure industry, nor provided a break. A one-off additional bank holiday in October 2020 would provide a much needed boost to some the sectors that have suffered most.",
        "background": "Add an additional bank holiday in October 2020 as a one-off to help the travel and holiday sector that have suffered so much from lack of leisure travel during April and May when Easter and two bank holidays would normally boost their businesses.",
