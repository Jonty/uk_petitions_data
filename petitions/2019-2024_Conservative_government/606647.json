Their plight, solvency and mental health is under pressure. There are real risks of financial, mental health, housing, and lender crises.",

Improvements to the BSF are needed, for example 0% VAT on all works, regulation of project managers\u2019 fees, and protection for tenants under the Landlord and Tenant and Housing Acts, with a standardised tariff of compensation.",
