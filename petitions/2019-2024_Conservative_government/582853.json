I think it\u2019s wrong and I don\u2019t think it should be allowed for just anyone to be allowed to buy/adopt them. I believe there should be records made when someone has purchased a animal and if they have previously abused or neglected it, it should be noted on a system (similar to DBS etc) that can be checked before they were to purchase another animal.",
