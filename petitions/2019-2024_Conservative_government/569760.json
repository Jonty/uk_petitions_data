For most people these are challenging times for people, there are alot of struggling families that find it hard at the best of times and I believe that the \u00a330 voucher to help with meals while the schools are closed are a big help.  A hamper from Chartwells cost around \u00a35 this is no where near the \u00a330 mark that parents where once recieving.",
