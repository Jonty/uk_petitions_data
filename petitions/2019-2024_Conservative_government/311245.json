The drastic change of no face-face teaching is very difficult as students have to teach themselves and pay the university for nothing. Most universities have moved deadline dates further but that\u2019s piled up everything in 1/2 weeks. Many students feel pressured & rushed worrying they won\u2019t do well. Some have fallen ill from this stress along with the pandemic scare. Very unhealthy!",
