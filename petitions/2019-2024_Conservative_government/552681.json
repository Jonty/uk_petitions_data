        "additional_details": "On the 22nd of September, The Licensees Association wrote to The Secretary of State outlining why we believe the introduction of a 10pm curfew on the hospitality sector was a retrograde step and also that it simply wouldn't work.\r\n\r\nThe curfew doesn't apply to the off-trade and we have seen people simply leaving supervised environments to unsupervised ones increasing risk. The curfew makes maters worse and penalises the hospitality sector.",
        "background": "Reverse the introduction of the 10pm curfew which is penalising an already hard-hit industry. It is a measure that does nothing to stop the spread of coronavirus and indeed may make matters worse.",
