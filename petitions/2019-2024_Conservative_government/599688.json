        "additional_details": "We ask that the Government/Parliament introduce a rental cap like in other countries to help deal with this issue. How are young people expected to even pass a credit check when they have no credit? what will the homelessness rate be in another few years? how are people expected to prosper when they have no security? Surely everyone is entitled to a home? isn't this a country for the people?",
        "background": "The rental market is now so out of control that people are spending majority of their months wages on renting a room in a private house. How will any of the younger generation ever get onto the property ladder? At the mercy of landlords who are the only one's profiting when will things change?",
