The right to cause \u201cannoyance and disruption\u201d by protest is vital to the democratic process and without it this country falls further into authoritarianism as opposed to democracy. Furthermore, the threat of violence against those who protest could exacerbate already tense situations leading to injury and death.",
        "background": "The police, crime, sentencing and courts bill is set to state that any protest which causes \u201cpublic annoyance or disruption\u201d can be shut down by the police. This is the inherent point of protest. This element must be removed from the bill so that the public can legally protest.",
