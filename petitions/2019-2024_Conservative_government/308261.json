        "background": "Government has asked for every citizen to stay safe at home during this pandemic.\r\nPubs, restaurants, cinema, etc., all these places were meant to lockdown and they did. \r\nBut people aren't taking any safety measures by going everyday to the shopping centre for non-essential shopping.",
