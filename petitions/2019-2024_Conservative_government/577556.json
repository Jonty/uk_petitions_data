        "additional_details": "Criminal convictions are visible for employers that specifically ask for criminal background checks, but not all require this. Public has the right to see if they are dealing with a hate crime convict and racial crime perpetrators should have nowhere to hide.\u00a0\r\nBeing held accountable, allowing public to be safer while they have inconvenient consequences to the daily lives they live could be the deterrent to make a change. The government needs to consider the implementation of such register.",
        "background": "We need a Racial Offenders Register, like there is a Sex Offenders Register. This needs to be a mandatory for all convicted of racially motivated crimes. It needs to be public, so employers, landlords, sport establishments etc to use when deciding who they wish to accept or reject dealing with.",
