        "additional_details": "In 2019 the government shelved plans to protect children by forcing pornography websites to require proof of age before they grant access to adult content under the pretext that such a law would be unenforceable. \r\n\r\nFollowing a petition launched by Katie Price, the government will debate whether to 'make it a legal requirement when opening a new social media account to provide a verified form of ID.' \r\n\r\nIf social media access can be regulated in this way, so can pornography access.",
        "background": "If social media websites can be forced to require ID, so can pornography websites. The government needs to: \r\n\r\n- Remove clause 131 of the Online Safety Bill\r\n- Enforce in its entirety part 3 of the Digital Economy Act 2017, forcing pornography websites to require age verification for access.",
