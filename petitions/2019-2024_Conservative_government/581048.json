        "additional_details": "The government should help its young people and start teaching them the things they need to know, not the things the schooling system wants them to know. Help our young people prepare for adult life by giving them a stepping stone into how things work. Include this in the school curriculum at high school age, and children won\u2019t have to learn how to do all of these things by themselves, when they\u2019re thrown into life.",
        "background": "Nowhere in the school curriculum is there an area about teaching young people about how things work once you step into the \u2018real world\u2019 (post education). The majority of young people have no idea how to pay their taxes, how a pension works, how to apply for a mortgage, or what tax bands are.",
