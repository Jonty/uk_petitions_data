We pay our taxes. You have forgotten the small self employed. \r\nWe get no sick pay no holiday pay no employee perks at all. We support ourselves and have to go to work whether we are sick or not. So why in a time such as this when you are telling everyone to stay inside are you not including the self employed.",
