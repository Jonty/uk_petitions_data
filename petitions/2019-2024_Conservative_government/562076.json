Many millions of jobs are at risk which will inevitably impact thousands of families, often the most vulnerable in our communities, depending on employment in all areas. The unintended consequences could be irrecoverable. Property and real estate sector is at very serious risk, should these businesses seek to deliver.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to reconsider the restrictions in respect of pubs and restruants in the hospitality sector. The current tier two restrictions are devastating and will not facilitate the ongoing sustainability. This impacts licensed premises and extends through the total supply chain.",
