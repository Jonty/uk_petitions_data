        "additional_details": "On behalf of the hundreds of thousands of students taking vocational qualification such as Cambridge technicals/ nationals and btecs, i request equal treatment on the matter regarding exams and gradings. If alevel students are not required to sit exams why should vocational students be forced too, you must understand it is diffucult already with a lack of teacher support, school resources and safe learning enviroment. Ergo we should recieve our teacher predicted grades.",
        "background": "The UK goverment has stated \"GCSEs and A-level students will not have exams and an alternative will be discussed\" yet the DfE quietly inform the nation on twitter that vocational subjects will continue this january. With no consideration to the students safety or ability to perform in these exams.",
