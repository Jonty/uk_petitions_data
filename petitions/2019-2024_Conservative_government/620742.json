        "additional_details": "Now the problem is that you pay cosmic amounts of money to bring your pet with you, which is part of your family, but including the vaccines and the certificate makes it even more expensive. The rabies vaccination which most of countries require  usually lasts three years if you do it in U.K. and this long  should  last the health certificate. That way we don\u2019t need to pay extra 200\u00a3 pounds every year for traveling with our little friends. And we all know that the nation loves traveling! Help us",
        "background": "As we can not change the EU law, we can change our law. We all know the  U.K. passports for pets doesn\u2019t allow us to travel to Europe anymore and we need to issue Animal health certificate which is valid just four months, and that is very short period, especially if you travel every year!",
