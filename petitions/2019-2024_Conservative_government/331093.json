        "additional_details": "Thousands of fathers across the UK are depress and emotionally drained from not seeing their children. It\u2019s the government duty to create policies and laws that brings equality for fathers to be able to see their children and also equally contribute financially. If we should live in a equal society I believe this problem of fathers being dismiss in court should be a priority for discussion in parliament. Fathers are seen as disposable therefore the system and society don\u2019t recognise our trauma.",
        "background": "I want the Government to understand the hardship of thousands of fathers struggling to see their children. The family court doesn\u2019t recognise fathers rights. Fathers are been force to pay for children they no longer see, I want policies and laws to be put into place to make things fair for fathers.",
