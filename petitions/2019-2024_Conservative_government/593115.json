        "additional_details": "We are supposed to live in a democracy but the British Government has used the pandemic to erode the rights and freedoms of its citizens using emergency measures as their only mandate. I believe that unless this is adressed we, as a country run the risk of slipping silently into a dictatorship where the rights, opinions and views of individuals are no longer considered. It should be the individuals choice to protect themselves by getting vaccinated and not the states.",
        "background": "Allow the British public the freedom to make their own choices over personal medical interventions and not victimise those who choose not to be pressurised by the state to be vaccinated. They should make natural immunity testing available to all.",
