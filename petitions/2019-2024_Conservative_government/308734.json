        "action": "Stop the exit negotiations with the EU restarting after the crisis is finished.",
        "additional_details": "During the present crisis when all citizens are being urged to work from home, it is imperative that the face to face negotiations about a deal for after the transition period ends be stopped. Face to face is much more effective than over any telecommunications link involving more than perhaps 10 people. It is ineffective and a waste of time and money to continue on a fixed route to the end of transition when at present, the UK is so closely linked with the EU over the present crisis.",
        "background": "Stop all negotiations about a deal and restart them once the crisis in the European Union and in the U.K. has been declared finished. These negotiations should only be restarted once it is safe to do so and once the economic effect of the current pandemic can be more clearly identified.",
