        "action": "End age wage discrimination and apply the national living wage to all workers.",
        "additional_details": "Our recent GMB survey of young workers has exposed the realities of age-based wage discrimination. Our findings show that the majority of those surveyed have experienced age-based wage discrimination, distributed throughout a range of workplaces. This has been found by the Princes Trust to not only undermine the aspirations of young workers but also damage their mental health, due to the double burden of working pay cheque to pay cheque and the constant threat of job loss.",
        "background": "Young people have the same costs and responsibilities as older workers, yet they are not afforded the same economic rights. We are calling on the UK Government to end all aged-based wage discrimination by equalising the National Living Wage for all age brackets. Equal pay for equal work.",
