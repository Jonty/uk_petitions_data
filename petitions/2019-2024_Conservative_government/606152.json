        "additional_details": "In ceasing to use our own coal and gas, we are importing inferior coal and gas from other countries. This is imported using ships and road transport. This of course, is increasing the very footprint that we are claiming to reduce. While we grow poorer by doing this, other countries continue to pollute and become richer.\r\nWe should continue to use our own fuels and explore the possibilities of alternatives, such as building smaller power plants, such as suggested by James Dyson. We can then navigate our way to reducing emissions in a sensible way.\r\n\r\nInsisting that we all throw away our efficient gas boilers is not the answer.\r\n\r\nWe would like an urgent enquiry taking all aspects into account, followed by a debate in parliament and, if necessary, a referendum.",
        "background": "Whilst there appears to be a change to the world climate, we in the UK are one of the smallest contributors to emissions.\r\n\r\nWe are in danger of bankrupting our country, while the larger nations, China and India, continue as they are, causing pollution, which makes our efforts pointless.",
