        "additional_details": "When so many students have been awarded Centre Assessed Grades that are not representative of their abilities, with a corresponding impact on taking up university places, we want schools to be held accountable as to how these grades were calculated. They should provide evidence that a holistic approach was taken to each student\u2019s body of work rather than relying on only a narrow band of evidence, such as a single mock grade. We want students to feel confident that their Centre Assessed Grades are an accurate and fair representation of their ability based on all the available data, including coursework, predicted grades and the hard data of GCSE attainment.",
        "background": "We want a clear and fast appeals process in place that holds schools to account over how they calculated Centre Assessed Grades, requiring them to provide evidence of how they followed OFQUAL guidance.",
