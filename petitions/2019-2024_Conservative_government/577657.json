        "action": "Reverse the UK Government decision to drastically cut humanitarian aid to Yemen.",
        "additional_details": "The UN chief, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said reducing aid was a \"death sentence\". This decision is morally indefensible and damages the UK's reputation.\r\n \r\nThe situation in Yemen has been called the world's worst humanitarian crisis. An estimated 20 million people - two-thirds of the population - depend on humanitarian assistance. Some two million children are acutely malnourished.\r\n\r\nYemen has also seen a collapse of its health system, leaving it incapable of coping with the coronavirus pandemic.",
        "background": "We want the UK government to reverse the drastic cut in aid to Yemen which has been devastated by conflict. The aid is being reduced to roughly 50% of the \u00a3164m pledged last year whilst British ministers have refused to join the US in suspending arms sales to Saudi Arabia for offensive use in Yemen.",
