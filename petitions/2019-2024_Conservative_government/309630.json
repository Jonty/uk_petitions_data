Key workers are still having to pack onto crowded trains to get to and from work, putting both themselves and transport workers at risk.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that fully licensed taxis are now the safest form of transport in this emergency. Additionally, almost all taxi drivers are self-employed. No help has been given for the self-employed under Sunak's plans. This plan stimulates that sector",
