Boris Johnson is believed to be the first Prime Minister to have broken the law whilst in office, a law set under his premiership.\r\n\r\nHe has persistently lied in the house and therefore broken the ministerial code he should be removed from office if he does not resign not least to uphold the integrity of the house.\r\n\r\nBoth are no longer fit for the positions they hold",
        "background": "Remove Johnson and Sunak from office if they do not resign.\r\n\r\nThey have broken their own laws and the PM has consistently lied to the house and by the ministerial code should resign.\r\n\r\nThey should also apologise to the nation of people who abided the law and the millions who suffered as a result",
