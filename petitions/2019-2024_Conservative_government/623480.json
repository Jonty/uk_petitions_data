        "additional_details": "The seizure was allowed based on the Capitulation of Alexandria (1801), a treaty which was negotiated and signed by the Ottoman, French, and English generals.\r\nUnder the terms of this treaty, the Rosetta Stone was surrendered by the French to the Anglo-Ottoman forces.\r\nNot only Egypt was under the occupation of the Ottoman Empire and had no say or sovereignty over its own cultural heritage, the articles of the treaty are in violation of the customary international laws, applicable at the time.",
        "background": "Due to its historical significance, the Rosetta Stone is an essential part of Egyptian Cultural Heritage and must be repatriated to its country of origin. The seizure of the Rosetta Stone is a spoil of war and an unjust colonial exploitation. The repatriation is the right and the moral thing to do.",
