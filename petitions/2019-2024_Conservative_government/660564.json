As humans, we all need to feel comfortable talking about our mind health, just as we do our physical health. We feel the term \"mind health\" is more gentle and sensitive. People avoid opening up for many reasons, but one huge reason can be the fear of being judged or treated unfairly. We believe mind illnesses are no different to physical illnesses, in terms of how we should approach and deal with them. We want to help people address their mind health in the same way they would address their physical health!",
