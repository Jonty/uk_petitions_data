Not only that, it\u2019s good for children to explore the world and LEARN about different cultures of the world also. It\u2019s unfair to fine parents. We are taught to make choices and I feel as a parent we have the right to make this decision. I feel like school is becoming prison. If the child has good attendance what\u2019s 10 days missed of school ? Nothing, as they will be learning something new in every day life. We learn every day",
