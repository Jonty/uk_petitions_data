It also includes other motorcycle clothing and safety equipment for other activities.\r\n\r\nThis issue needs addressing urgently as it could affect a person's chance of survival in the case of an accident. Consumers are misled into thinking they are purchasing a piece of equipment that has been tested, approved and will protect them in the case of an accident when it has not.",
        "background": "A lot of cheap motorcycle helmets and other safety equipment online claim to have the proper approval, but actually just have fake stickers on them.\r\n\r\nThe Government should license and register sellers of safety equipment, so that only approved sellers can sell safety products.",
