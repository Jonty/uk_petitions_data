I wish to live my life just like before the virus. Many people across the country want to get out and about, and a virus doesn't affect what they wish to do at all. They should allow people to stay off work etc if they wish to, but let others go out.",
        "background": "The current restrictions are obscene. All tourist attractions are forcing to close and yet, schools remain open. Schools are possible the worse thing that spreads the virus. Little or no restrictions should be forced other than simple such as wearing a mask or distancing.",
