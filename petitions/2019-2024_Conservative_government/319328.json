        "additional_details": "We have realised the incredibly valuable work NHS and social care does to support us. Every Thursday the public clap and show their support and there has been lots of fundraising. We should sustain this support through a small tax increase. Everyone has access to NHS for free, so we should support funding it better. Other European countries have much higher taxes and much better healthcare and social care services. We should follow suit to have better pay for workers and sustainable services.",
