I have to keep going to many different shops every day and wait in queues, just to find out essential items are gone while exposing myself to COVID-19.\r\nI want the Government to give priority to parents and carers receiving Free School Meals vouchers because we must avoid exposing ourselves to COVID-19 and our children have basic nutritional needs that are not being covered.",

A number of retailers have announced plans to open early for elderly or vulnerable customers, and keyworkers. A number of retailers have also introduced social distancing measures and restrictions on the number of people who can enter their stores at the same time.
