        "additional_details": "The UK events industry is worth over \u00a370 billion to the economy and employs over 700,000 people according to BVEP UK Events Report 2020.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the Job Support Scheme by the Chancellor on 24 September fell way short of expectations. Due to government imposed restrictions, the events industry is mainly out of work and any work that is coming in is minimal. This means that the majority of workers don't qualify for the scheme and most businesses cannot afford to contribute to it.",
        "background": "The government needs to provide genuine and meaningful financial support to businesses and individuals in the event industry, who cannot work or are working extremely reduced hours due to current Covid-19 restrictions. The announcement by Rishi Sunak on 24 September completely ignores this industry.",
