        "additional_details": "On 4/1/21, the PM said \"it is not possible or fair for all exams to go ahead this summer as normal\".\r\n\r\nProhibiting exams during a Covid outbreak would implement this. If it's not right for students to sit GCSE exams then it's equally not right to sit iGCSE exams.\r\n\r\nStudents doing iGCSEs have been through the same disrupted education in Year 10 and 11 as those taking GCSEs. Many haven't taken an exam under exam conditions since June 2019. There should be a level playing field across the country.",
        "background": "It is understood that the Government cannot cancel iGCSEs in the same way it has with GCSE, AS and A level exams but seemingly it could prohibit any exams going ahead during a Covid outbreak which would in essence give the same impact.\r\n\r\nThis is about consistency of approach for all.",
