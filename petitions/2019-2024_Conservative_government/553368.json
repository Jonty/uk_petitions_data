        "additional_details": "Btecs are often overlooked with help given mostly to alevels and GCSEs. The current year 13s have been submitting coursework throughout lockdown without much assistance or guidance. We had limited help from teachers and next to no resources. Also, with the students that just got results, received high grades without having to work for them meaning when it comes to university applications people that took gap years due to corona have way higher chances of being accepted than the current year 13s.",
        "background": "Give more help to those that do btec subjects with a lot of coursework. We should have time to go back over old assignments that we didn\u2019t get help with instead of starting new ones. This will help us improve our grades instead of falling behind.",
