Although the Tax & NI contributions are same for both Permanent full-time and a Contractor, Contracts have to pay addtionally \"Employers NI\" contributions and this is not fair. Contractor is worse off than permanent employee working in the same way. \r\n\r\nAn example:\r\nFor a \u00a350K gross income, a permanent employee take home after Tax and NI contributions is approximatly \u00a337,663.96, where as a contractor take home is \u00a331,982.92.",
        "background": "What is main purpose of inside IR35?\r\nIR35 is to make sure that contractors working in the same way as permanent full-time or part-time employees pay the same tax and national insurance as an employee to crack down on tax avoidance.",
