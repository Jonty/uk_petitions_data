        "additional_details": "The UK clearing banks received billions in tax payer bailouts since 2008 and many have made scant effort to repay this public debt.  Yet in every year since the Crash banks have continued to pay massive bonuses to employees for 'failing' to operate properly.\r\nBanks are back to making monster profits each year and as beneficiaries of public support, their time has come to 'support the public'.",
        "background": "In the light of the huge bailout given to UK banks, by the British taxpayers in recent years, this is a clear time when 'favours should be returned'.  With the impending loss of income across the vast majority in the UK, millions of bank account holders will be relying on overdrafts for survival.",
