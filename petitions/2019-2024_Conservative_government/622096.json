        "additional_details": "There appears to be an ever growing number of rickshaws using cycle lanes in central London. As rickshaws are generally wider than bicycles, there presence prevents overtaking by cyclists and is damaging to the general flow of traffic on cycle lanes. Cyclists are frequently being slowed behind rickshaws, slowing them down and potentially discouraging cycling throughout London more generally.",
