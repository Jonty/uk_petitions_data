This Summer has seen unprecedented Blooms of BG Algae, caused by pollution, an invasive species of Zebra mussel, and some Sunny weather. It is going to get worse year on year. Species of fish that are unique to Lough Neagh are dying out. 40 % of N.I drinking water comes from it. \r\nDumping of Raw Sewage must stop, & tighter controls must be put in place on intensive Agricultural practices, particularly the management of Slurry, Overfishing and Dredging.",
