        "action": "Ban all uk schools from assigning homework",
        "additional_details": "While homework has been a staple of education for years, there are compelling reasons for the schools to consider banning it. Homework often exacerbates educational inequalities, as not all students have access to the same resources and support at home. Additionally, excessive homework can lead to increased stress and mental health issues in students. By banning homework, schools can promote more equitable learning experiences and reduce the burden on young minds. Instead, the focus should shift towards in-class learning, interactive activities, and fostering a healthy work-life balance, ultimately creating a more holistic and effective educational system.",
        "background": "I think that home work should be banned as it is not helpful to students mentally",
