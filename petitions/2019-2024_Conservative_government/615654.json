        "action": "Not to raise staff ratios in early years",
        "additional_details": "The ratios in early years are there for a reason. Raising the ratio will mean staff will leave the profession due to stress and workload. Early years staff are underpaid and stressed already, the Pandemic has seen nurseries closed and staff leaving to do less demanding jobs. \r\nThere needs to be a change in the way the government sees early years education, especially in deprived areas. We educate, care and safeguard the children in our settings and it\u2019s hard enough without higher ratios",
        "background": "Look at \u201cfree childcare\u201d not ratios. The amount the nurseries get funded for child care does not cover staff wages or consumables at all. Settings charge extra to meet these costs. Stop treating early years educators as babysitters, we do not just supervise children, we educate and care for them!",
