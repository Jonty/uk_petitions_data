        "additional_details": "I like countless others, in the previous 3 years worked a combination of PAYE and Self-employed. We paid significant taxes on both PAYE and Self-employed, yet can\u2019t get any help as we no longer hold the PAYE jobs to ask for furlough, and did not make more than 50% income from self employment.\r\n\r\nThis is significantly destructive to young people starting out who had finally been able to go fully self employed & will now set them back and no doubt require them to once again work multiple side jobs.",
        "background": "The proposed self-employed scheme doesn\u2019t cover people who have only in the last year made their whole living self employed. \r\n\r\nAs the scheme doesn\u2019t start until June it gives people who need it 3 months to submit the tax return for 2019/20 and would save the livelihood of thousands.",
