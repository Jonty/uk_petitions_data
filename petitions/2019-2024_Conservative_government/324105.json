        "additional_details": "Learning about slavery will help pupils understand the roots of racism. Understanding the roots of racism is key to its elimination. Racism should play no part in a society in the 21st century. Pupils should be able to study the legacy of the slave trade and slavery in the Atlantic world. The history is significant to the development of the British Empire, and Britain\u2019s place in the world. No pupil should leave school without learning about the Transatlantic slave trade and its legacy.",
        "background": "Make the teaching of the Transatlantic Slave Trade and its legacy a statutory requirement on the KS3 History curriculum. Currently, it is only an optional subject, therefore schools can choose not to teach it. It is of vital importance every pupil in the country is educated about this topic.",
