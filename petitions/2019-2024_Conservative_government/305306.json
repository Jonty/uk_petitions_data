        "additional_details": "NHS staff are vital to our country over the coming months\r\n\r\nI am lucky to earn enough to be in the 40% tax bracket and have the option to safely work from home. 'Redeployment' for them comes with more sacrifices and stress than the majority of us\r\n\r\nThe NHS runs on good will and for years people have worked overtime to ensure good patient care. With little financial compensation over the last few years, a tax increase for those who can afford it would be a small, but meaningful, way to be thankful",
        "background": "I would like to propose paying higher income tax for those in the 40% / 45% so that this money can be 'redeployed' to NHS workers which will give them some monetary relief as a small thank you for the sacrifices they are making.",
