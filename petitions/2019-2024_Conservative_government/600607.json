        "additional_details": "Even with their ephemeral nature, fireworks cause a lot of air pollution in a very short amount of time. ... A scientist told Forbes that when the fireworks go off, the metal salts and explosives undergo a chemical reaction that releases smoke and gases into the air.  As we are fighting to protect our ozone I feel that fireworks are adding to the problem of air pollution.\r\nThey only used to be used bonfire night and from 2000 new years eve.\r\nIt is also causing great stress to pets at home.",
        "background": "Stop the use of fireworks for birthdays, weddings etc\r\nTo let Fireworks only be used at relevant times of the year for BONFIRE night and NEW YEARS EVE only.",
