        "additional_details": "Everyday myself and other families are struggling to gain the right support that our children deserve and should be entitled to. Every child should be treated equally especially those with hidden disability\u2019s but sadly they are being left behind. Parents are having to appeal for Disability living allowance, high mobility allowance and even a disabled badge. Narcolepsy is a rare neurological condition that affects the brain's ability to regulate normally. 30,000 people in the UK suffer.",
        "background": "Narcolepsy and Cataplexy needs to be recognised as a disability because children as young as 7 are being neglected to gain the right support in school\u2019s, personal care and mobility rights. Narcolepsy can have an effect on almost all aspects of daily life and there is no current cure.",

Similarly, eligibility for disability benefits is based on the impact a disability has on a person's life.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore already the case that people who have narcolepsy, where this has a a \u2018substantial\u2019 and \u2018long-term\u2019 negative effect on their ability to do normal daily activities, would be protected under the Equality Act.\r\n\r\nDecisions about making reasonable adjustments for people with a disability are a matter for individual service providers, not the UK Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about disability discrimination here: https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/advice-and-guidance/disability-discrimination"
