        "additional_details": "The question is - are garden centres NOT essential? Are they not selling \u201cgrocery\u201d products?\r\nIn these unprecedented times, can these centres be re-classified as a grocer, selling food products. After all it\u2019s food just in an earlier cycle of growth!\r\nTo grow our own food is not only good for our mental health it is also an answer to possible food shortages later on this year.  How can we predict the same fresh food availability in 6 months that we have now taking into account global restrictions.",
        "background": "Garden centres across the country have 1000\u2019s of vegetable and fruit plants ready for sale. But can\u2019t sell them as they are classed as non-essential \u201cshops\u201d and are therefore forced to closed at this time.  These plants will now be binned. It\u2019s a unnecessary waste.",
