Was it forced upon? Was the father considered at all? They look at the figures and see x amount, staff threaten, use scare mongering tactics to FORCE men to pay. Even if their salary does not cover their own personal expenses, if child maintenance is higher than their mortgage, even if it is not affordable.",
        "background": "Child maintenance is DEMANDED, regardless of your personal circumstances, other expenses, mortgage and bills. You are forced to pay the amount even if it means going into your overdraft every month, not being able to pay personal bills, simply because NO other costs are considered.",
