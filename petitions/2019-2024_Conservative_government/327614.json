        "additional_details": "STA Travel specialises in once-in-a-lifetime travel experiences aimed at students and young people. They are refusing to refund many customers who have invested thousands of pounds in them, and are also failing to provide consistent, reassuring correspondence to these customers, while ignorantly advertising on social media. Many operators of tours & experiences STA sell have confirmed that they do not invoice STA until after the booking, and therefore this money never left STA's thieving hands.",
        "background": "With backing from the Government, Parliament and MPS, STA travel might be pressured to reconsider its position on withholding refunds from customers. Many of these customers are students or recent graduates, who are currently unemployed and struggling financially during the Covid-19 outrbreak.",
