        "additional_details": "The vandalism of war memorials is morally wrong, it causes stress for the families who have loved ones names on the memorials.  It also caused stress and anger amongst the veterans community. \r\nThose who are named on memorials have paid the ultimate price for their country and it is morally wrong that the people who disrespect their service and sacrifice get away with their criminal acts.",
        "background": "I would like to see the introduction of a minimum sentence of one year which would be six months education on British military history and six month unpaid community work with increased fines of at least \u00a31000, which should be split between repairing the damage and a veterans charity.",
