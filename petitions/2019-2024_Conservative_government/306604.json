        "action": "Implement food rationing during COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "additional_details": "Fighting has already occurred at some supermarkets and this is a demand on an already overstretched police service. Shop workers have become targets of abuse and the 'rules' imposed by the supermarkets ignored. Queueing increases social contact - rationing will allow people to shop at varying times to minimise contact. Rationing will ensure everyone gets the food, medicines, etc. they need. A voluntary system has not worked and rationing need not be draconian and can be lifted after the crisis.",
        "background": "Stock piling is unfair and unnecessary and despite a plea from Government and several retailers for citizens to be reasonable and considerate the situation is getting worse. Key workers and the vulnerable are unable to get what they need to survive.",
