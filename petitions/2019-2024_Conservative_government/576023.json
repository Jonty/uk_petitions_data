        "action": "Not to reopen schools until every child and school staff has been vaccinated.",
        "additional_details": "I want the government to do this as this disease isnt safe for anyone to catch, including children. We keep being told that children are less likely to get this disease but there is no cast iron guarantee and i feel that parents sending their children in to schools should feel that their children are safe which at the moment it isnt. Sadly this disease will infect newborns to elderly people and can kill.",
        "background": "Since coronavirus came in to the uk there has been constant threat to life and long lasting effects of the disease. Things are slowly getting better but i believe that all children and school staff members including teachers should be vaccinated before the government thinks about opening schools.",
