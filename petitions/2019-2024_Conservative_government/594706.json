The Government is already funding investment in cycling infrastructure, and has produced guidance on cycle infrastructure design, and it's not clear what you want to be done differently.\r\n\r\nYou can read about Government cycling and walking investment, grant funding, research and infrastructure case studies here: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cycling-and-walking\r\n\r\nAnd you can read the Government's guidance for local authorities on designing high-quality, safe cycle infrastructure here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycle-infrastructure-design-ltn-120\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for increased funding for cycling infrastructure, or to review Government guidance on cycle infrastructure design."
