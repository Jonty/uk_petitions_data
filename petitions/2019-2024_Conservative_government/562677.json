        "action": "Save the north's hospitality industry from harmful Covid-19 Tier 3 restrictions",
        "additional_details": "Hospitality businesses in the North of England are being disproportionately asked to bear the brunt of restrictions to help prevent the spread of Covid-19 with many facing ruin, and subsequent loss of jobs. This is despite the North showing some of the most rapid reductions in COVID transmissions in the entire UK.\r\nWe believe that a roll out of mass testing in tier 3 areas, would help mitigate this more appropriately and allow venues to re-open safely protecting jobs, livelihoods and towns",
        "background": "We urge the Government to save our hospitality industry and protect jobs, mainly in the North of England, by reversing the decision to seek the closure of venues placed in tier three (Covid-19 restrictions) and revert instead to the \u201crule of six\u201d, with sanitisation and safety measures as standard.",
