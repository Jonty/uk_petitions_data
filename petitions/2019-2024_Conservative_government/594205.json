        "action": "Make sign language a mandatory subject in schools to help the deaf community",
        "additional_details": "Those who can only communicate with BSL should be treated no differently and should be appreciated more through the tuition of language to help become a more inclusive country for what could be considered a disability. It is unacceptable how little people know about BSL and how those who are deaf or hard of hearing have to suffer on a daily basis through the non-inclusive language system of this country. Children must learn English in schools so why not BSL as well?",
        "background": "Help the deaf community by including them in the general circulation of languages. They can struggle to communicate without BSL so the government needs to help bring BSL into the public domain and make it mandatory for the equality of deaf people.",
