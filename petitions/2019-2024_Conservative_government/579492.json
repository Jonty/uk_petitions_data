        "additional_details": "Enforcing this would be the absolute reassurance and confidence that women need. Not only would this bring down the already horrific figures on female sexual abuse, but it would also decrease the rate of crime some of these awful men are committing. It would enforce a safer, more confident society. This is something we cannot ignore and this is why I am making this petition as a male because I understand something needs to be done.",
