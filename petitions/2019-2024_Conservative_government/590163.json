        "additional_details": "Companies are making millions from consumers who want to cancel services which they do not use, but face barriers to doing so due to the added complexity of only having one route to do so, often with long waiting times and sales tactics to prevent them doing so and so they give up, continuing paying for an unused service. If companies can offer online upgrades then it should also be possible to downgrade this way and this should be legislated to force media and comms companies to offer this.",
        "background": "The likes of Sky TV are quite happy to allow upgrades online, but make it much more difficult for you to downgrade / cancel, insisting that you call them where sales tactics are used to try and stop you. If upgrades are available online then downgrades should be too. This should be made mandatory",
