        "additional_details": "As a lot of people are asymptomatic yet carriers of the virus the idea is that wearing a mask can help prevent and protect the public, \"My mask protects you and your mask protects me\".\r\nAs we also know infected people can expell virus particles on surfaces so what better way to stop this from happening than adopting a habit of wearing a mask in shops or at work for the purpose of preventing infection.",
        "background": "This petition asks the government to consider launching a campaign in order to make mask wearing acceptable and compulsory in closed spaces like shops, offices by everyone including all frontline workers, bus drivers, supermarket employees and by all police officers.",
