        "additional_details": "Extending the School summer term by two weeks in 2021 is going to have a massive impact not just on teachers that have been working around the clock since the beginning of the pandemic but also on the children that have been tirelessly working from home and actually need time to look forward to in the coming months. Some families will miss out on precious family time due to work restrictions and pre-booked holidays that can't be changed. 2 weeks at the end of a long term is not helpful!",
        "background": "It has been suggested that the School summer term in 2021 might be extended for two weeks using up some of the usual summer holiday time to try and help with missed education.",
