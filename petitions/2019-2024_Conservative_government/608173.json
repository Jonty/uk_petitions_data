It is also not a loan, because we are not consenting to it. \r\n\r\nSome people like my daughter, will never have the loan, but will still have to pay money back. This will cause unnecessary debt, and needs to stop.",

Meaning she will pay back a \u2018loan\u2019 she never receives. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a loan we don\u2019t want, and don\u2019t seem able to opt out of. Making it illegal, because we don\u2019t consent.",
