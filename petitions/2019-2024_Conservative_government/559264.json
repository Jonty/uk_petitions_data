        "additional_details": "Cases of COVID-19 have surged since the reopening of schools; it is difficult to social distance in such large 'bubbles', and it's been shown that although many children don't experience severe COVID-19 symptoms, there are still significant risks of transmission to adult teaching staff and other family members. Practical measures to deliver education whilst reducing virus transmission rates must be seriously considered. Online school offering would satisfy the objective of maintaining education.",
        "background": "When schools closed in March due to COVID-19, many schoolchildren have had positive and negative experiences with online school. To help reduce the spread of COVID-19, giving students the option to access education online would enable more social distancing and a choice for high risk households.",
