        "additional_details": "As we saw with the 2020 results, pass rates were significantly higher than previous years. If England + Wales follow Scotland in cancelling 2021 GCSE exams, students due to sit the GCSE in 2022 will be at a disadvantage getting jobs, due to lower pass rates.\r\nGCSEs also do not accurately represent the five years of hard work a student has put in through secondary school. Teachers know their students best; is it really fair to judge a student from one exam - what if they have a headache that day?",
