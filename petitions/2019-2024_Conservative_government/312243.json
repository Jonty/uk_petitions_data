        "additional_details": "Many industries & sales / targeted job roles have employees on basic salaries below the minimum wage. REGULAR commission & bonuses are a NORMAL PART OF WAGES. These are essential to be liveable; it is discriminatory & unequal to exclude these in this scheme. Receiving 80% of an already below the minimum wage salary, is unacceptable. The self employment scheme dose not specify how profit is made, why should the way typical, regular wages are labelled/named on the employee scheme penalise them",
