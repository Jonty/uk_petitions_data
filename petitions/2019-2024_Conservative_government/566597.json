        "additional_details": "I am asking this because despite the tier system people aren't following the rules, so due to following this virus and the impacts the last lockdown had and the impact the tier system is having, a lockdown clearly works better. Also under new lockdown rules heavier fines should be introduced for those not following the rules, supermarkets etc should only be allowed open at certain times of the day, same for takeaways etc. Thankyou and I hope something is done sooner rather than later.",
        "background": "I am starting a petition to ask the government to start a total lockdown in the uk to help control the spread of the virus. I understand it will have a big impact on the economy but peoples safety and health should come first.",
