        "additional_details": "I want this to come into place because it assures people that the area they are entering is safe and the chances of catching the Coronavirus are lower than it would be if there wasn't a COVID pass. Other countries inside the UK are also doing this as we enter the winter months where respiratory diseases are high anyway. It seems a sensible and a safe thing to do to keep everyone in the country feel safe, to ease the risk of people contracting the virus and the risk of another national lockdown!",
        "background": "I want the Government to introduce COVID passes into England which shall be used when people over the age of 16 are entering a high capacity area e.g. football matches, nightclubs, concerts etc... The pass should either have proof of a double vaccine or a negative test result from the past 24 hours.",
