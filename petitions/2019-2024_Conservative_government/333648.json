        "additional_details": "The current strategies for managing the Covid19 pandemic will require an extended period of disruption to the British way of life. The success of any prospective vaccine is reliant on herd immunity. The British public should be given the option to volunteer themselves to provide this herd immunity sooner if they are of low risk of developing complications. A herd immunity campaign could be facilitated with appropriate medical support e.g temporary hospitals, and measures to ensure containment.",
        "background": "Facilitate a service which allows individuals who are of \u2018lower-risk\u2019 to volunteer to contract Covid19 in a controlled, medically supported environment in an attempt to establish herd immunity within the general population. Lower risk individuals can potentially help shield those of higher risk.",
