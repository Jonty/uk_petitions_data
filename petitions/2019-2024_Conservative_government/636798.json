        "action": "Stop the government forcing schools to 'out' trans & non-binary youth to parents",
        "additional_details": "These guidelines pose a substantial risk of rejection, hostility and violence for those living in homes with anti-trans views. Studies show trans and non-binary youth are more likely to experience bullying and difficulties with their mental health directly associated to social stigmatisation. The Department of Education has offered no safeguarding information on how trans, non-binary and gender non-conforming children could be impacted. The government must not put vulnerable children at risk.",
        "background": "New government guidelines for schools in England will force teachers to inform parents or caregivers if a child is exploring their gender. It will also ban trans girls from participating in sport. Prevent the government endangering the lives of trans, non-binary or gender non-conforming children.",
