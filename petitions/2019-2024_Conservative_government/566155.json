        "additional_details": "The Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine was intended to be given as 2 doses, the 2nd 3 weeks after the 1st. This week the government has, against manufacturers guidance, changed this gap to 12 weeks. Going against guidance could reduce its effectiveness, or make it completely ineffective. The members of the public that have been priority in getting the vaccine are those more at risk. By not providing the 2nd dose as intended is not protecting us and not supporting our NHS and putting more lives at risk.",
        "background": "Do not cancel the intended 2nd dose of Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. Keep the roll out of the vaccine as intended. Provide those who have already had their first dose, with their second dose as intended by the manufacturer and supported by clinical trials.",
