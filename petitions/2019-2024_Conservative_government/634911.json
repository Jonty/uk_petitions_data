And from September 2025...working parent[s] of under 5s will have access to 30 hours free childcare per week.\"\r\n\r\nJeremy Hunt's offer to extend childcare hours from April 2024 does not benefit anyone in this tax year, or Cost of Living crisis. It is also dependent on the election. Parents are struggling right now.",

Only children who are not born. I would urge the Chancellor to bring forward the help towards childcare costs immediately.",
