        "additional_details": "The Premier League\u2019s governing body has shown, time and again, that without the threat of government action they are slow or complacent in ratifying vital changes. An acknowledgement from Parliament that Isak single-handedly created Newcastle\u2019s 4th goal (and that such talent and ambition should always be rewarded) would send the right message to aspiring youngsters about both teamwork and self-belief. The history books, currently, will make no record if his involvement, and that needs to change.",
        "background": "Alexander Isak hasn\u2019t been officially credited with the assist for Jacob Murphy\u2019s goal against Everton (dated 27/04/23) as his pass took a slight deflection on his way through. However given the quality of his run and his role in creating the goal, an exception should be made to this draconian rule",
