        "additional_details": "Restrictions on protests in the controversial new policing bill breach human rights laws and will increase the risk of peaceful demonstrators in the UK being criminalised and punished with up to ten years in prison, merely for causing \"annoyance\". This is an authoritarian move on the government's part. As Sarah Jones said, this bill threatens the balance between the police and the people. Protests are noisy, and sometimes annoying, but they are as fundamental to democracy as parliament.",
        "background": "The draconian policing bill which would highly restrict the democratic right to protest, should not be made law. These are not the actions of the government of a democratic, developed country. This is tyrannical.",
