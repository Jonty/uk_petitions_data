        "additional_details": "If someone works full time Monday to Friday with 28 days annual leave including bank holidays, this would leave the employee with 20 days to take through a whole year of work. Which works out to be 4 weeks off work per year. This is not enough time for people to have a good work/life balance in their lives. If you work 5 days a week all you feel like you do is wake up, go to work, go home, eat, go to bed, and repeat it is so depressing and we need a change.",
        "background": "I would like to see the Government change to law for annual leave to be 28 Excluding bank holidays, so then people would get 36 days a year including the bank holidays. This would make metal health better and work/life balance better.",

Currently there is no legal entitlement to annual leave on bank holidays.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
