Only after 15 days of absence are schools becoming involved. I want this to be automatically recognised from day one rather than parents/schools having to apply for it. Schools are withholding educational work being sent home to children who are absent with medical impairments, putting them at a disadvantage because of their disability. This is discriminatory and wrong.",
        "background": "To have a different reporting system for children with complex medical impairments now recognised as disabilities. Not one size fits all with attendance. From day one when a child with a disability is absent there should be a traffic light system in place to reflect differently from an able child.",
