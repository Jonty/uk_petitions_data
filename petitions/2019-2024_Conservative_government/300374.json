        "additional_details": "The last election in December 2019 was won on a single issue with a minority of the vote.\r\n\r\nMore people voted for parties who supported a second referendum than those who voted for Brexit. \r\n\r\nThis means that the current Government believe they have a mandate to take us out of the EU when actually they do not. \r\n\r\nObviously in this instance FPTP has resulted in decisions being made for the whole, by a minority of voters, which seems grossly unfair.\r\n\r\nThis system needs to change to represent us all.",
        "background": "Democracy in the UK is broken. \r\n\r\nThe current system of First Past The Post fails to represent the views of the majority and can result in a government with a minority perspective.\r\n\r\nThe devolved nations now have more representative systems in place.",
