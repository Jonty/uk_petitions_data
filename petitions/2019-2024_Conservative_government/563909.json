        "additional_details": "The government must consider, debate and differentiate the differences between DVSA examination staff and the Driving instructors that provide their test candidates. It can not be correct that a DVSA civil servant and their union can lobby for the cessation of tests and the self employed driving instructors must follow suit - often not only eliminating income for the instructors but forcing them to personally accumulate debt and, franchise costs whilst the examiners continue to earn.",
        "background": "DVSA driving examiners during the COVID pandemic have stopped tests, instructors have also been told to stop lessons. Examiners are on more favourable employment terms and have received some income in these instances so far. Instructors are mostly self employed some \u201cexcluded\u201d and pay franchise fees",
