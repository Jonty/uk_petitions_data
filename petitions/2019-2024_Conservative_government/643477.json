        "action": "Independence for Sutton Coldfield from Birmingham City Council",
        "additional_details": "Birmingham City Council has been poorly run and managed by its leaders. The City Council is too large (Europe's largest) and it's proven to be unmanageable. The council needs to be broken up and the people of the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield returned to the pre 1974 arrangement whereby it was run as its own Borough Council. Local services delivered locally would better serve the interests of residents.",
        "background": "Following the announcement that Birmingham City Council has gone bankrupt, we call on the government to break up the council and grant the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield full independent borough council status to run it's own services fully independent from Birmingham City Council",
