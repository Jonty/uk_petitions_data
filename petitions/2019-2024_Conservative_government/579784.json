        "additional_details": "We all deserve to be treated fairly with dignity and respect. We all deserve to feel safe at night. But the current laws do not fully help us. This ought to be a basic human right but it isn\u2019t. Moreover, so many people are using change.org petitions which isn\u2019t helping as it won\u2019t get recognised easily. This petition will reach Parliament for debate as it is a necessary step to reach equality of opportunity, something good we all believe this current government will want to help us achieve.",
        "background": "From my research, the Equality Act helps to protect women from discrimination in the workplace, such as through sexual harassment practices. This is currently not enough. Additions to the equality act or a new act entirely is required to start to solve the problem and protect people from atrocities.",
