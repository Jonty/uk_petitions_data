        "action": "Lower the university tuition fees until face-to-face lectures completely return.",
        "additional_details": "As the majority of lectures currently are online, there are less facilities being used. My course, for example, involves the use of mock court rooms and mock crime scenes which cannot be used in current circumstances. Millions of students are going into online lectures and not being able to physically do half the things they need to properly because of govt restrictions. I think this a very valid reason to lower the fees during current circumstances.",
        "background": "\u00a39,500 tuition fees are not justifiable in current circumstances. You don\u2019t learn in the same way online as you do face-to-face. I understand the need for fees, but the amount is extortionate considering the lack and quality of education received.",
