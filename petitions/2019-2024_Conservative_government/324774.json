        "additional_details": "Education is one of the basic needs for human development and a cornerstone element in society. This denial of accurate and cruical history in schools is harmful as it actively enables biases and ignorance to develop which later on manifests itself in countless permanent racial issues. History education, as the Department of Education has said is meant to help pupils gain a coherent knowledge and understanding of Britain\u2019s past and currently it is failing to do so.",
        "background": "For Parliament to include Black British History, Britian's history of colonialism and slavery in the national curriculum and for this to be mandatory. Black British history is British history and involves more than human suffering with untold contributions in art, literature, politics and many more.",
