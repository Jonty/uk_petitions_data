        "action": "In line with the Welsh Government, A-levels and GCSE's should be cancelled",
        "additional_details": "The 2021 students have missed three months of in school teaching and have a severe disadvantage with some schools only partially reopening and many students having to isolate missing more teaching. With the recent decision of the Welsh Government to cancel A-level and GCSE's we feel that if a union wide decision is not made to cancel all of the exams students in different parts of the Country will have advantages over others - especially in A level where there is limited places at universities.",
        "background": "We want the Government to cancel the 2021 A-level exams and GCSEs, like the decisions of the welsh government and the Scottish government, and use classroom assessments instead something that will be much more fair to create parity among member states of the Union.",
