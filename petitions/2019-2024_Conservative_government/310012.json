Many of us know family members or friends that are dealing directly with the COVID-19. These are tough times for all and especially students who have so much on their plate.  As per government guidelines, GCSE and A-Level exams were cancelled so why can\u2019t universities do the same. This is not the time to have to worry about an assignment deadline, dissertation or exam revision.",
        "background": "Libraries have now closed and I believe it is safe to say that asking university students to continue working as normal from home is outrageous. Alot of peoples home environments are just not conducive for study. It is unfair to assume that everyone has access to Internet or resources in their homes",
