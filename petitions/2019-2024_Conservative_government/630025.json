        "additional_details": "The introduction of vaccine passports would be the start of the process of creating digital identities for citizens. These would permit government to exert considerable control over citizens, not only with respect to international travel, but also domestically by restricting access to public and private facilities to those who meet certain criteria, such as vaccination status.\r\nThis would amount to making medical procedures or other requirements mandatory by the back door.",
        "background": "The UK Government to commit to non-implementation of vaccine passport schemes, both domestically or as part of a global scheme. Section 23 of the declaration of the 2022 G20 summit, acknowledged the importance of shared standards to facilitate international travel, including proof of vaccinations.",
