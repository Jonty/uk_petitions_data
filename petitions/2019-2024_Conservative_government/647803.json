        "action": "Investigate huge increases in UK car insurance premiums",
        "additional_details": "Because the insurance industry seem to be making prices up as the go. I personally have been quoted at most, the sum of \u00a34,200+ for a 15 year old 1.4 car worth \u00a3900! This is outrageous. They cannot be allowed to extort this kind of money from drivers' who are already the highest taxed in Europe. Enough is enough!!",
        "background": "I would like the UK Government to investigate the exorbitant price rises in car insurance premiums in 2023. The UK insurance industry are raising premiums across the board with little to no regard of the drivers' good driving records. In a cost of living crisis, this is wholly unacceptable.",
