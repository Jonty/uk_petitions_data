        "additional_details": "Students in the UK have already missed hundreds of hours of learning since 23rd March. Some pupils don\u2019t have the essential resources: a working computer, textbooks, stationary, etc. therefore results will most certainly not reflect the true efforts of pupils. There has also been local lockdowns which have resulted in students missing out on essential learning.",
        "background": "The Government should cancel GCSEs and A Levels in 2021 due to the disruption of Covid-19. Students have gone back to normal learning. This has already had a huge impact. I want to cancel GCSEs and A Levels and provide predicted grades to show the true reflections of students across the country.",
