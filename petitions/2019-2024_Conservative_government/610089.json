        "additional_details": "Aside from the obvious moral code that we have instilled in us, as human beings, it is incredibly important to stand by Ukraine now more than ever. This is a country just like ours who have gone from going to work and meeting friends, to fleeing their country - their homes. Ripped from their sons, fathers, brothers, husbands as Ukraine have now stopped all 18-60 year old males from leaving the country to help fight for their freedom and basic human rights. Standing by is unforgivable.",
        "background": "Follow in the footsteps of Ireland and lift all restrictions on Ukrainians coming to the UK for refuge, organising shelter and safety for those who have fled war. There are currently hundreds of thousands of empty housing and we have the capability to help. Standing by is cowardly.",
