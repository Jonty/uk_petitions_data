        "action": "Change the law to allow electric scooters on UK roads",
        "additional_details": "So If the Government made it legal, electric scooters could offer a number of benefits. They offer an alternative to using public transport \u2013 for shorter journeys such as commuting to work or delivering goods to their customers using their own escooter, they take minutes to set up and are simple to ride and they are better for the environment, helping to ease congestion and address pollution problems.\r\nAnd the people will be able to use them for their own benefits. And make life much more easier",
        "background": "The current UK law states that you can ride an electric bike, drive a car or even saddle up a horse on the road, but you can\u2019t ride a privately owned electric scooter. And people during this pandemic want to commute to work or using the escooter for delivery services but are struggling to do so.",
