        "additional_details": "By cancelling the GCSE\u2019s for 2021, the Government is making it fair on all Year 10 students across England. They should be assessed on all the work they have done over the past few years, any assessments they have done and what the teacher believes their overall grade is. Any work completed online, and their attendance should be considered as well. Lowering the grade bounds doesn\u2019t make up for the work students have missed and wouldn\u2019t be fair.",
        "background": "The Government should cancel next year\u2019s GCSE exams as they have missed out a substantial amount of education- even by re-opening schools now or in the summer part time, some students will find it difficult to catch up and prove successful next year.",
