        "additional_details": "During this crisis, we are seeing people struggle to make ends meet, put food on the table and make their regular financial payments. It's the Government's duty to ensure that self employed people should not have to wait another 2 months without financial support. The Fourth SEISS payments is already late, we can't wait another 6 weeks. It would leave self employed people that are eligible for the SEISS grants 12 weeks or more without any income if things do not change!",
        "background": "Making self employed people wait 3 months for their grants is too long. This could see lots of small, family run businesses go under. People on PAYE furlough don't have to wait so why should the self employed?",
