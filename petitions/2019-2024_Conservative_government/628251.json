        "additional_details": "It is not right that people are struggling with the basics of food, travel and energy costs when at the same time their council tax could increase to pay for desirable but non-essential improvement works and new office buildings for County Councils.\r\n\r\nWe are asking for the government to actively encourage councils to delay spending on non-essential improvement projects in order to limit the need for a rise in council tax next tax year.",
        "background": "Amongst Town Councils and County Councils there is talk of new County Council offices being built next year, renovations to parks and play areas that could easily be delayed, cycle paths being built and many other capital spending projects which are non-essential and could be delayed.",
