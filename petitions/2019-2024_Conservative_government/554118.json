        "additional_details": "The current situation with restrictions have seen detrimental impacts on mental health in the UK and an alarming increase in suicides. Peoples lives have been destroyed and many family businesses will not recover from the economic consequences of national and local lockdowns as well as confusing rules which are difficult to keep up with. Every aspect of life has been disrupted by this and it has not helped that the government has made so many U-turns adding to confusion and disruption",
        "background": "To give the people of this wonderful country a referendum in how we are to progress forward with Covid-19. To give the people a clear choice between having the government continue with its poor handling of the pandemic or revert back to no restrictions as we had before the 23rd of March 2020",
