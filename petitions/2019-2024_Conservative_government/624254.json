This will ensure supplies will not be cut off and I will undertake the challenge in the High Court on behalf of all of you who follow my lead. \r\n\r\nIt is very likely a sensible Judge will find in my favour and I will set the PEPC that the energy suppliers will have to follow.\r\n\r\nThe likely success depends on the numbers following my proposal.",
