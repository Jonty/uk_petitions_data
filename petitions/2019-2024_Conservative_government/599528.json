        "additional_details": "Scotland has its own anthem. Wales does too. It is time that England has its own anthem. \"Mr. Brightside\" is an anthem. It was us brits who supported The Killers early in their career, it is right to set the national anthem to reflect this.\r\n\r\nThe national anthem has become decisive. It is time we had a national anthem for all English people to enjoy.",
        "background": "Like how Greg Mulholland called an early day motion in 2007 for England to have its own national anthem, I want the government to debate putting classic indie rock hit \"Mr. Brightside\" by The Killers as the national anthem to England.",
