        "additional_details": "This current Government have not only failed in every test posed it in under a year in power, it is attempting to renage on the key promises made to win it's power. From not honouring the withdrawal agreement that was meant to deliver a deal to leave the EU, to the extra nurses and police offiicers. They latest debacle over A level results should never have happened when the schools had been closed for four months prior to this. With clear guidance from Government the disaster could be avoided",
