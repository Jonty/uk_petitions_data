        "action": "Reject Vehicle Excise Duty changing to a telematics / GPS tracking based system",
        "additional_details": "A pay-per-mile system was proposed in 2005 & resulted in 1.8 million petition signatures in opposing the changes. The new system should be kept simple, secure & fair - using invasive telematics will have high operating costs and risk the personal data of millions being exploited. Such changes to VED would be unnecessarily disruptive to so many users.",
        "background": "The Government should respect the right to privacy of drivers, there is no fair justification for mandating the use of tracking devices on private vehicles. The existing VED system could easily be replaced by taxing vehicles based on GVM instead, this is easy to understand & cheap to implement.",
