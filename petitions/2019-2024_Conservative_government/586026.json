        "action": "Reconsider plans to force restaurants to display calorie information",
        "additional_details": "Although well-meaning, these plans will make it impossible for anyone recovering from eating disorders to eat out, and encourage unhealthy eating patterns, presenting calories as an enemy. Calories are often already available to see if you choose, but this would mean you can not choose not to see them- how is this fair? Eating disorders cause, directly and indirectly, thousands of deaths, significant strain on the NHS, and massive heartache for sufferers and their loved ones.",
        "background": "Government efforts to combat obesity do not consider the most significant impact: constant exposure to calories will hamper recovery from eating disorders and encourage their development. We therefore request that the government reconsider these plans to avoid a mental and physical health disaster.",
