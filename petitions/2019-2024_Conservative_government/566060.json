        "action": "Dont delay 2nd Covid vaccine dose so elderly/NHS have maximum protection sooner.",
        "additional_details": "The elderly and NHS staff need full protection. Thousands of NHS staff are off work as they are vulverable and wont be able to return to work until their 2nd dose is given. Many are nurses who could do vacinations when they can resume work. Also front line NHS staff are less likely to be off sick with the virus once fully protected. The Elderly will still need to stay isolated from family until they have maximum protection so returning to a more normal life is being delayed 3 months for them.",
        "background": "Give the second dose of the vaccine to people within 3 or 4 weeks as recommended by the vaccine manufacturers and MHRA so maximum efficacy is achieved. Speed up the vaccine delivery program significantly by providing more people to vaccinate. e.g. Pharmacists could be used.",
