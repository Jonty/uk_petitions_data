        "additional_details": "The removal of these paintings/murals is a shameful act that ONLY intends to make children suffer. \r\n\r\nBBC News reports that this is because they \"sent too welcoming a message\". The idea that that might reduce people coming into the country is laughable. \r\n\r\nDoes the government also plan on removing these murals from hospitals? Presumably we also don't want children to frequently visit hospitals? \r\n\r\nRemoving the murals makes the life of these children harder. And the staff. \r\n\r\nPut. Them. Back. Now.",
        "background": "As reported yesterday, Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick has ordered the removal of murals of cartoon characters from Kent Intake Unit. These comfort scared and vulnerable children during one of the most stressful and uncertain times of their lives. \r\n\r\nWe want the government to put them back.",
