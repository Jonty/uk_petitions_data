        "additional_details": "India have not played any bilateral cricket against Pakistan since 2013 because of political tensions between the two countries. Bashir was selected in the squad back in mid- December and now finds himself on the way back to the UK whilst his teammates find themselves preparing for a test match on foreign soil. \r\n\r\nECB should delay the start of the test match to make a stance on this unfair and corrupt decision.",
