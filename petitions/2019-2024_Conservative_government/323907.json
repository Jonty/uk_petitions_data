Every year, emergency service resources are wasted tackling fires believed to be started by disposable barbecues, this was a possible cause of the large Wareham Forest fire responsible for destroying approximately 200 hectares of wildlife habitat. They often do not use FSC-certified charcoal and produce a foul odour that causes a nuisance to others in its vicinity.",
