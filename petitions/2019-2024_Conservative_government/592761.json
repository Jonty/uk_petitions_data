        "action": "Review and reform the new Flexible season tickets to save commuters money",
        "additional_details": "The new Flex ticket that offers 8 days travel within 28 days is over-complicated, produces measly savings for some and costs more for others. To get people back on public transport the Government need to review and reform these tickets with real commuters in mind. Since Covid, many people will work 3-5 days in the office, for some there is currently no difference in cost between a 3 or 5 day ticket. Offering annual Season tickets for 2/3/5/7 day travel is a more realistic and simpler approach.",
        "background": "We ask the Government to review and reform the new and flawed Flexi Season Ticket that was released in June'21. This reform has left commuters feeling disappointed. Train companies should be required to offer flexible annual tickets based on 2/3/5/7 day travel, with noticeable savings.",
