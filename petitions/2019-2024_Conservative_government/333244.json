        "additional_details": "The Government have announced their plans for a range of measures to encourage weight loss including calories on menus and encouraging GPs to refer patients to weight loss services. \r\nPrevious Government anti-obesity campaigns have been ineffective in reducing obesity. However they have increased stigma, and have put those vulnerable to developing an eating disorder or those with an eating disorder at risk. \r\n\r\nThese measures are dangerous and unhelpful where MH services have already been cut.",
        "background": "Parliament should rethink the current plans on obesity in conjunction with eating disorder charities such as BEAT, consult body positivity advisors and mental health advocates and reframe their view of obesity. These measures may do more harm.",
