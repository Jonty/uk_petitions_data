Brexit minister visited in her previous role and she couldn\u2019t couldn\u2019t get out of her quick enough. No LOA, No medal*, No bonus! The least the government can do it allow SP to wear their medals after the parade. It will cost them nothing!!!!!! Don\u2019t tell us you care, show us! The military covenant will mean NOTHING! Prove is wrong.",
