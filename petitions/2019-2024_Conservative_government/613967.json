        "additional_details": "Wirral council have put extra wide cycle lanes on one of the busiest roads in Wirral causing absolute chaos. \r\nWhat will emergency services do when they can\u2019t get through in the case of a fire, accident or someone having a heart attack? \r\nThey could\u2019ve widened the pathways on either side. \r\nTheir mentality in wanting to reduce emissions and creating quiet neighbourhoods with lower traffic levels is flawed. Allowing the building of several hundred new houses totally contradicts this.",
        "background": "Order Wirral council to remove the cycle lanes on the Bidston bypass. \r\nThey didn\u2019t consult the public nor take into consideration the chaos it would and is causing. This is the main arterial route to West Wirral and Liverpool.",
