        "additional_details": "Unsuspecting British Citizens have travelled for legitimate reasons and have found themselves stuck, families with children whom have to go back to school, people with Jobs, Key workers, business people and others. Not being allowed to return home breaches fundamental human rights. People don\u2019t want their children to go to a hotel on their return rather would prefer to be in the safety of their own home; plus the fear of what impact this would leave on the minds of young children is unsettling.",
        "background": "Remove Pakistan from the Red List of countries. At the very least people whom have already travelled prior to Pakistan being placed on the list should be allowed to return without the need to quarantine in the specific hotel quarantine; instead, those returning should quarantine at home.",
