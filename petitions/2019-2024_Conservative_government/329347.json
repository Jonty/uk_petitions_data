        "additional_details": "The UK is the only G7 country to successfully meet the UN goal of spending 0.7% of its GDP on international aid. Now, Boris Johnson has announced plans to put this money into the Foreign Office, a department which mainly exists to protect British interests and has a \"poor\" rating according to the Aid Transparency Index 2018.\r\n\r\nPeople around the world are suffering due to Coronavirus - aid money should be given to those who need it the most, not on spent on foreign policy. Keep the DFID!",
        "background": "The PM has announced that the DFID (which works to end extreme poverty abroad) will be merged with the Foreign Office in Sept 2020. We demand the UK allows the DFIP to continue its vital work, instead of giving the entire aid budget to a new department which exists to \"safeguard British interests\".",
