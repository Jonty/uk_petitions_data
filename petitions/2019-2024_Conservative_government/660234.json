        "additional_details": "For over 200 years, the sails of Bursledon Windmill on Windmill Lane, built in 1814, have turned over the village. Unlike many windmills built in the Victorian era, which featured cast-iron machinery, Bursledon Windmill, is said to be a \u201crare surviving example\u201d of a traditional tower mill with timber machinery. It is a loved heritage venue in the heart of Hampshire but lack of initiative & funding from the council has put a stop to its future. We are all fighting to save our beloved Windmill!",
        "background": "The Bursledon Windmill is a Grade II listed historic building, with significant local significance. It is Hampshire\u2019s only working Windmill, and is one of only 40 that work in the UK. It is part of British history, and needs funding to continue to operate & be enjoyed by future generations.",
