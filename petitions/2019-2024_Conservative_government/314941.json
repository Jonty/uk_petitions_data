        "additional_details": "Due to strikes and now Covid-19 lectures and seminars across the country on all different courses have been cancelled for university students. Students cannot be expected to complete work when they have been disadvantaged for the whole academic term and as a result they won\u2019t do as well on exams or assessments. Further, some university\u2019s have cancelled everything whilst others are still expecting students to do work, this is unfair and there should be an equal standpoint across universities.",
        "background": "The government should make universities cancel all exams and assessments after weeks of strikes and now Covid-19 which means students have missed out on weeks of teaching and help. Their work will not be up to standard and this isn\u2019t fair.",
