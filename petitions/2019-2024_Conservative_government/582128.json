        "additional_details": "Many UK citizens have family in Pakistan along with many other ties, this decision will disable anyone needing to go for urgent matters, due to the high demand of quarantine on return to the UK. In fact Pakistan hasn't banned people entering from the UK despite British citizens going over there and spreading the disease due to ignoring sops. Also there are much higher infected countries like France and India not on the list.",
        "background": "As mentioned by MP Naz Shah we would like to see scientific data on why Pakistan has been chosen to be added to the ban list even though it has been coping very well with the spread of covid-19 and the infection/death rates have been very low compared to UK and Europe.",
