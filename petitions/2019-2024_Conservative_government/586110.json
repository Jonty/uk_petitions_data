        "additional_details": "Most vets will only scan cats for a microchip when brought in as a \"stray\" or lost & found. \r\n\r\nThere has been a significant rise in cat thefts, where people will assume a cat is a stray and start to feed it. The majority of these cats are in fact well fed and have a loving family who are distraught at their absence.\r\n\r\nIt will soon be mandatory to microchip your cat for this reason, so why are they not all being scanned? Let's get this passed and return 100s of stolen cats to their original owners!",
        "background": "We want to ensure that EVERY cat brought into a veterinary surgery, regardless of the reason, is scanned for a microchip to confirm that they do belong to the person who brought them in. \r\n\r\nBy making this law, it would reduce the number of cat thefts, strays/missing cats and heartbroken families.",
