        "action": "Stop treating the Iranian regime as a legitimate government",
        "additional_details": "The ongoing protests in Iran against the authoritarian and repressive regime show that the democratic mandate of this regime to rule the people of Iran has been lost. The regime has no response to these protests other than further escalation of violence and brutality towards its own citizens. \r\n\r\nWithout a democratic mandate, the regime is no longer a legitimate government, and all diplomatic privileges and protocols offered by the UK Government and the international community should cease.",
        "background": "The current regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran has lost its democratic mandate to govern the people of Iran. We are calling on the UK Government to cease recognising this regime as a legitimate government, and withdraw all privileges that come with that status.",
