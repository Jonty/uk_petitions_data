        "additional_details": "We want the texts and poems provided for many reasons. Firstly, students have missed multiple months of in class learning over lockdown, causing significant drops and gaps in knowledge. Secondly the limited teaching over lockdown has lead to a huge amount of catch-up building up for when the school's re open, leaving a lot of pressure on students and teachers in the few months before the first set of mocks. Removing the need to memorize quotes will allow students to focus on the real English skills of analysis, and make the expectations for them reasonable when they come to sit their exams.",
        "background": "Allow and provide the books, play scripts and poems for students sitting their English literature GCSE's and mocks in 2020 and 2021, to remove the need to memorize quotes before the exams.",
