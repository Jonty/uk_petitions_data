        "additional_details": "Coronavirus hasn't vanished. In fact, it is worse than it has ever been. 1 in 16 people are currently being affected by the virus, and cases are on the rise again. Some policies from schools and business places ask for people to remain home if infected, and some people still may want to remain home too, as the virus can still make some quite ill, and adding a cost the Rapid Lateral Flow Tests will make this more difficult for people, espeically during such awful times of the virus.",
        "background": "Rather than making citizens have to pay for the Rapid Lateral Flow Tests from April 1st, the Government should keep them free to allow people to keep testing.",
