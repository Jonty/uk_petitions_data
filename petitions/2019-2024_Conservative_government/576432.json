Golf is logically not putting anyone at any risk. The sport established that with removing rakes and leaving flags in when it needed to adapt last year. Not only will it help our population physically, but mentally as well",
        "background": "Keeping golf courses closed alongside allowing two people from different households to sit beside each other in a park makes no sense. Scotland have allowed it throughout lockdown, and you also allowed it during Tier 4 restrictions towards the end of 2020.",
