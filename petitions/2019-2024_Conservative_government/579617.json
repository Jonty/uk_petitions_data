        "additional_details": "97% of women aged 18-24 in the UK have faced sexual harassment. Does that statistic scare you? Well, its not a surprise to the women in the UK. We try and do everything right; change our routes home, never walk at night, travel with friends and never alone. Yet, women are constantly harassed by being cat-called and disrespected. This has been normalised in today's society but we have had enough and what something done about it.",
        "background": "Make education about sexual harassment mandatory in schools. It'll cause a positive effect with them being aware of the consequences that harassment has on individuals and their families and preventing themselves and others from doing offensive acts that have been normalised in today's society.",
