        "additional_details": "Many companies such as Royal Mail, DPD, Amazon, Tesco and more have stated their drivers will sign on the customers behalf to protect both the customer and courier during the coronavirus pandemic. With the amount of customers that touch the device each day, this is a perfect way to start or sustain a local outbreak of coronavirus and puts the elderly and those with health problems at an unacceptable risk.",
        "background": "Hermes current advice to couriers is to ask those customers that refuse to sign, to use a stylus or other object instead of their finger. This puts the courier in close contact with customers and risks spreading the virus in the community.",
