        "action": "Introduce tuition fee loans for students studying Medicine as a second degree",
        "additional_details": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals have been overwhelmed. At a time when more doctors should be trained, there are many barriers to entry. Few places exist for graduate entry medicine so the only choice is often an undergraduate course. Doctors are more likely to be high earners and pay off their loans so this is a low risk investment. By investing more into the education of doctors, it would make a difference in a world of doctor shortages and increased strain on the NHS.",
        "background": "You are not eligible for tuition fee loans studying medicine as a second undergraduate degree. Only the final year of tuition fees are paid for by the NHS so students have to raise \u00a337000 to fund the four years required to become a Doctor. The government should provide loans for medical students.",
