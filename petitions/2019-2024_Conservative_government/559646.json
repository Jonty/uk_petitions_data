        "action": "To give Key/Essential workers who leave their home to work Hazard Pay Allowance.",
        "additional_details": "The very nature of National lockdown is to say it is unsafe to leave the home. To ones own health and to that of others through transmission. The average wage of essential/key workers is 8% lower than that of the average UK workforce. And yet they continue to put themselves at risk in order to keep essential services going, to keep the backbone of the United Kingdom strong enough to overcome this virus. These are people who who on average make \u00a312.26 per hour but non the less risk their health.",
        "background": "We believe that those essential workers, who have worked hard throughout lockdowns; one and two, disregarding the risks associated with leaving their homes, in order to carry out essential services for their country should be compensated. This should be through a Hazard Pay Allowance.",
