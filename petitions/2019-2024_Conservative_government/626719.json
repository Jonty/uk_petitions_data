        "additional_details": "Whilst our voting system is based upon choosing a local MP, it is clear that the vast majority of people place their vote on who they wish to become PM.\r\n\r\nThis legislation would ensure that, if a PM were to leave office, the question of who should replace them was given to the entire voting public.\r\n\r\nAs the risk associated with ousting a PM would  be far greater, it may also encourage the ruling party to place greater onus on working together, thereby creating a more stable government.",
