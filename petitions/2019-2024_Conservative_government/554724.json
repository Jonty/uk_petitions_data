        "action": "Create a regional parliament for Northern England",
        "additional_details": "For too long, governments of all differing political positions have promised Northern England a plethora and multitude of things to which they have failed to uphold; the 'levelling-up' agenda has materialised into Northern businesses and citizens having inadequate financial support over the pandemic; the 'Northern Powerhouse' concept formed into a distant memory and the railways are some of the worst in western Europe. It's time for government to be closer to the people it governs.",
        "background": "The aim of this petition is for UK parliament to create a regional parliament for Northern England with devolved powers like those retained by the Scottish Parliament.",
