Despite being the second largest world economy and being the lead emitter of greenhouse gasses globally, CCP China refuse to make a decarbonisation push on the grounds that it is a developing country. This problem affects not only the health of people in China and its neighbouring countries but impacts the global climate crisis exponentially.",
