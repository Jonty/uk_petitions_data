        "additional_details": "As a result of national lockdown, public transport has been severely reduced. This means that essential key workers, who do not hold a driving licence and are in the process of working towards it, are finding it extremely difficult to fulfil their essential roles. We urge the government to reconsider this; not only will it ensure essential workers can go to work but will also aid in reducing the backlog of people waiting for tests",
