This is mainly because in schools due to the stress already being presented around and from the lack of PPE children will be more at risk of contracting this virus. Therefore, as a parent myself I am hesitant towards sending my kids to school as I believe schools and communities in general are not prepared for another surge in the amount of cases coming up.",

I strongly believe from the deaths occurred already in schools it will be hard for children to keep distance and from the lack of PPE this will put both children and staff at risk of catching this virus.",
