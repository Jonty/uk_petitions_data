        "additional_details": "As part of the EU, British artists of all kinds and technicians from sound recordists to lighting engineers could freely move around the EU. And likewise those from the EU could come to the U.K.  The new visa restrictions will make it very difficult for all but the biggest productions to go from the UK to Europe or come to the UK from the EU. Not only will this be damaging for the economy, but culturally could see the UK isolated where once we were at the heart of the European arts scene.",
        "background": "From theatre to music, film and television the UK creative industries and arts are globally recognised as being among the best in the world.  Our actors, musicians and the technicians that support them are in demand across Europe and the world.",
