        "additional_details": "We call on the government to implement a student salary AT LEAST in line with minimum wage for the relevant age bracket, for AT LEAST all full-time students in higher education. In addition to this, tuition fees MUST also be scrapped for students eligible for a salary, otherwise this measure is made redundant. People should not be required to live in relative poverty whilst gaining the skills needed for success in later life. Students from non-wealthy families have the right to enjoy education.",
        "background": "The current system of tuition fees and student loans is exploitative and forces people to live in poverty while working full time as a student. University work is difficult and should count for at least as much as any other type of work. Simple free tuition would not sufficiently address this issue.",

Your petition also states that tuition fees should be scrapped for students eligible for the salary you propose, but this appears to be all full-time university students, and it is not clear who you think tuition fees should not be scrapped for.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for the Government to scrap tuition fees and provide financial support to university students, but it would need to be clear how you wanted this to work."
