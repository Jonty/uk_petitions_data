        "additional_details": "Parental Alienation is often met with one of the parents abusing the other by USING their child be that, mentally/emotionally, physically, sexually or neglectfully. The aggressor is able to manipulate the child into thinking, or behaving a certain way towards the other parent. Both recipients fall victim to such onslaughts, maiming children for life. Family Court/Cafcass appear ill equipped to handle this hence why we are calling on the government to HELP SAFEGUARD OUR CHILDREN.\r\n\r\nIF WE RECOGNISE (CHILD) ABUSE IS A CRIMINAL ACT WHY IS PARENT ALIENATION NOT? THEY OFTEN GO HAND IN HAND.",
        "background": "We are asking the Government to treat Parent Alienation as an extremely serious matter. We request the law recognises this as a Criminal Offence which should then be punished as such.",
