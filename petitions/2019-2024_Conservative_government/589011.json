At our wedding we are being moved from an outside drinks reception to an inside one so guests can be seated. Surely this less safe? \r\n\r\nWhy is it I can hug guests, but I can\u2019t dance with them outside? Couldn\u2019t I dance with them inside with a mask on in a well ventilated area socially distanced? Couldn\u2019t we take lateral flows?",
