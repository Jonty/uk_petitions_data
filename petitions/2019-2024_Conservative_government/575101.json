        "additional_details": "Children can be put at risk due to the craze of posting photos of children all over the internet/social media. Photos of under 18s shouldn\u2019t be posted online as they should be protected from the dangers out there.\r\n \r\nThere\u2019s no reason a child\u2019s image needs to be anywhere online and most children don\u2019t get a say over what their parents do, so the law needs to step up to protect them.",
        "background": "It\u2019s about time children were properly protected. Too many parents post photos of their under 16s on social media and the children don\u2019t get a say. People post photos of other peoples' children without a care as to whether those parents are ok with it. Things need to change to protect children.",
