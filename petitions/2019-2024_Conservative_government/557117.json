        "additional_details": "The impact on the mental health of the nation caused by the first lockdown was huge with a dramatic increase in suicide rates. Exercise is proven to improve mental health along side the obvious benefits to physical health. Gyms are vital to help in this, particularly as the weather during this second lockdown is not going to be as good as the spring. Gyms have also put on place strong measures to reduce the risk of infection as shown by the most recent data.",
