        "additional_details": "458 polls since July 2017 asked if Brexit is right or wrong, or if you would now vote Remain or Leave - 427 put Remain ahead with just 10 for Leave and 21 ties. A further 154 polls since Nov 2021 show 150 for rejoining the EU and only 4 for staying out.\r\n\r\nThe last to support leaving/staying out was in May 2022. All 234 polls since then were in favour of remaining/rejoining by up to 28% and with a recent average lead of 19%.\r\n\r\nDemocracy means the right to change your mind. We call for another vote.",
        "background": "The public do not believe that Brexit has brought the UK tangible benefits or that there are any future prospects of any.\r\n\r\nOver 600 polls give concrete evidence that the public has backed remaining in the EU since July 2017 and now backs rejoining, and it was wrong in hindsight to vote to leave.",
