        "additional_details": "my family have owned XL Bullies for years and the dog themselves are not the issue. The dogs are well natured and loyal, if trained correctly. I was bitten as a young boy by a Jack Russel. All dogs are capable of causing damage to a human or other animals. The Unacceptable stereotyping of one specific breed is getting out of control. If one Human murders another does that mean we are all murderers? if we take the governments current stance on bullys then yes we are all murderers!!!!",
        "background": "I want the government to consider the real issues with the breed which is irresponsible owners not training there dogs or using the methods at hand to control the dogs. Mussels not considered? licensed owners not considered?",
