        "action": "Withdraw permission for new UK coal mine undermining the Paris Agreement",
        "additional_details": "Granting permission for a new coal mine is disgraceful. It lazily undermines the Paris agreement and blows our net zero plans out of the water. Our government is making this country look foolish. \r\n\r\nThink of the message that this sends to other nations clinging on to fossil fuels: \u201cother people mine coal so why can\u2019t we\u201d. The government has just shown its utter disregard for their own commitments. \r\n\r\nYou think Covid is bad? Just wait until the climate spirals out of control.",
        "background": "In the year that we will host a UN Climate Summit, our government has approved the development of a new coal mine in this country. \r\n\r\nI am also asking Parliament, and specifically Robert Jenrick, to withdraw the planning permission for the Woodhouse mine, and all future collieries in the UK.",
