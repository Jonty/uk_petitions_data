        "additional_details": "In the last couple of decades most of the vaccine damages has been compensated from the Tax-payers funds. Most families are suffering because of these damages without enough help. This is not the people's or charity responsibility to pay for their mistakes.\r\nThe Law should be revised and make Big Pharma Firms pay for their mistakes again. This will force them to create safer products with less side effects and mortality rate.",
        "background": "It is well known that during the major vaccination programme some people will be harmed or even killed by the vaccine. Currently special public funds pays compensation to those affected. The WHO supports this model of taxpayer-funded damages for vaccine claimants.",
