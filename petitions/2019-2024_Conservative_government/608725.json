        "action": "Reinstate the former Highway Code rules of pedestrian right of way at junctions",
        "additional_details": "The recent change to the highway code in relation to the right of way of pedestrians crossing junctions is by far more dangerous for pedestrians and other road users than the former rules. They open up the possibility for more road collisions involving cars motorcycles and cyclists should a vehicle have to stop suddenly to give way for a pedestrian waiting to cross. I propose that the new rules are suspended and an investigation into pedestrian safety begins with help from motoring organisations",
        "background": "The newest highway code changes which determine the way pedestrians assess road junctions and their right of way when crossing needs to be withdrawn and reconsidered with immediate effect with the help of motoring organisations to determine the best way of protecting all road users and pedestrians.",
