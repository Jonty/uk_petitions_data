        "additional_details": "It is reprehensible that clubs like Arsenal who have made 55 people redundant - an extra burden on the tax player or Tottenham Hotspur, who have borrowed \u00a3175 million pounds of taxpayers money should be able to spend millions of pounds on the transfer of football players. If they have the money to do so, why did they need to make people redundant or borrow from the public purse in the first place. It is insulting to those who have lost their jobs and to every taxpayer.",
        "background": "That HM Government should seek to ensure that no professional football club that has either made staff redundant or that has borrowed money from HM Government should be allowed to pay money in transfer fees for players in this transfer window.",
