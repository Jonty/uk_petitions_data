        "additional_details": "The decision to continue assessing university students across the country through exams is a very poor one.Like students at A-level,I believe assessors should look at previous results from assignments  and exams,progressing students further using these.It is illogical to think that online examinations can fulfill the role of normal on campus exams,especially with the current climate regarding COVID-19 which is bound to impact upon many students.Therefore it should be done that all universities cancel term 3 exams,considering the lack of face to face teaching over the last months and improper alternative methods of assessment.",
        "background": "We would like the goverment to discuss this petition with the education secretary and furthermore,we would like the education department to make contact with the boards of universities to enforce the cancellation of all term 3 exams",
