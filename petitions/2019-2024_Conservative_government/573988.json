        "action": "Reallocate C19 vaccines from non-priority groups to low-income countries",
        "additional_details": "The UK vaccination strategy prioritises the vaccination of lower-risk citizens above health workers and other vulnerable groups in low-income countries around the world. In this scenario Covid-19 will continue to spread globally. More lives will be lost, societies and economies will be further battered, and mutations will have the chance to develop. Not only is this scientifically counterproductive, but is also indefensibly inward-looking at a time when global solidarity matters more than ever.",
        "background": "This petition asks that parliament debate whether C19 vaccines  allocated to British low-priority citizens should be going to higher-risk groups in low-income countries instead.  There are significant epidemiological, economic and ethical reasons for ensuring global vaccination coverage.",
