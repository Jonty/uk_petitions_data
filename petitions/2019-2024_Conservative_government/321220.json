        "additional_details": "Like all nations on Earth, the UK depends on the Arctic Ocean as a global life support to keep us cool and healthy. But today it is under threat. There is 75% less Arctic sea ice today than 50 years ago, making the Arctic Ocean vulnerable to exploitation. These lead to unstable global weather, food and water supply; and the release of buried methane and pathogens. The Marine Arctic Peace Sanctuary (MAPS) protects all life by safeguarding the entire Arctic Ocean north of the Arctic Circle.",
