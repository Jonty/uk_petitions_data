The attack was completely unprovoked and I have been left with a traumatised dog, large vet bill and the knowledge that absolutely nothing will be done to trace or make the owner accountable. This dog will attack another dog and I have no doubt a possible attack on a person or even worse a child.",
        "background": "Please legislate against dogs which attack other animals and not only if they attack people. A dangerous dog needs to be removed from society and the owner held accountable.",
