        "action": "Change the guidance to allow people on antidepressants to join the police",
        "additional_details": "I believe that suggesting those on antidepressants are not suitable to be police officers is counter productive. It potentially prevents those looking at the police force as a career from getting help if they need it. It follows the outdated idea that those on antidepressants are in some way unstable or not resilient, which is not true. Assessing mental resilience in the medical assessment would be better than making judgements about people on the basis of their prescription.",
        "background": "I'd like the 2004 guidance on police recruitment to be updated so that those on antidepressants can join police forces if they are psychologically stable.",

Decisions about frontline policing, which includes police recruitment, are for Chief Constables and Police and Crime Commissioners, not the Government or Parliament."
