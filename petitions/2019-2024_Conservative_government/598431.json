        "additional_details": "Sufferers from IBD often have to take few medications for many years and this can become quite costly. Patients who are diabetic or pregnant do not have to pay for their medications as these qualify for a medical exemption for prescriptions. This is very unfair to those sufferers of IBD who have to pay \u00a39.35 per item and sometimes there can be more. For 2 items, that is \u00a3224.40 per year and if that medication is required for 3 years, then \u00a3673.20. That is a lot of money and very unjust.",
        "background": "I would like for eligibility for Medical Exemption Certificates for prescriptions to be extended to include people who suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Crohn's disease or Ulcerative Colitis).",
