The extended transition period will also allow the UK more time to negotiate other trade deals across the world.",
        "background": "There is currently a world wide pandemic and trade negotiations will be affected across the globe. The risk of a no deal Brexit at the end of the year is too high. A no deal Brexit would be a further blow to our economy and should be avoided.",
