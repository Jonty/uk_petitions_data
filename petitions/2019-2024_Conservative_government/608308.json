        "additional_details": "We want the government to put a law in place creates a fairer rental market instead of working in favour of wealthy private landlords. To rent a property as a tenant you have to go through comparable checks,and income reviews to buyers yet you are treated like 2nd class citizens. With the current lack of social housing more and more people find themselves in this private rental hell and I believe its time the government recognised this situation and intervined.",
        "background": "Most mortgages cost less per month then private rentals of property, which often is not even maintained to a decent standard.  Its bad enough that those who are unable to get onto the property ladder are actually buying houses for other people and we believe you should stop this unfair practice.",
