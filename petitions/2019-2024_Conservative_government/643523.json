        "additional_details": "I want the British government and parliament to stop the embargo immediately and allow air companies to bring pets onboard with their owners up to 8kg\r\nAnd waive the absolute nonsense money grabbing agriculture department fees that can reach up to \u00a3350 just to check at documents like deworming tablets that can be easily checked at the airport by the same staff who check our passports.",
        "background": "It is absolutely insane that people can no longer book flights for they small pets having the right to return to uk with the pet at the cabin. This must stop and people should be allowed to travel with their small pets at the cabin.",
