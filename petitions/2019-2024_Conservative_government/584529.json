        "additional_details": "Because it's very unfair to parents who have multiple appointments at GOSH to have to pay this.\r\nSome family's also have more than one child with complex needs which means they have to travel there more often, a daily congestion charge is \u00a315, the emissions charge is \u00a312.50 and parking isn't easy at all. Thousands of sick children have to visit the hospital every year and parents have to pay these charges regardless of their circumstances.",
        "background": "Make congestion charges and parking charges exempt for those traveling to great Ormond Street, parents traveling to great Ormond Street are already under enough pressure with their child being in hospital and don't need added pressure. It's also very costly to eat in and around London.",
