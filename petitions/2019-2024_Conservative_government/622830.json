        "additional_details": "Lithium-ion and plastic are materials used within disposable vapes that have harsh effects on the environment. There is no education on what to do with vapes once they are finished which creates a grey area for properly disposing of them. If there was a specific place to put vapes, people would have peace of mind knowing the batteries and plastic was going to be used for new material/products i.e. electric cars for lithium-ion and furniture for the plastic.",
        "background": "Provide large bins in Manchester and London for people to be able to dispose of their vapes to avoid them going to landfill. Avoid toxicity of battery acid and lithium being disposed of incorrectly and to give new uses for the plastic used within them.",
