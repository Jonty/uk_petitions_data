This has not happened and students have been unable to fully utilise the accommodation they have been living in. Expecting them to repay these loans is not acceptable.",
        "background": "The government should agree to write off or refund 50% of the maintenance loans taken out to cover accommodation and living costs. Students have been unable to use the facilities fully. Workers have had furlough to cover their costs, students should be refunded to offset their costs.",
