It is clear how valuable and much needed the Nhs is to all aspects of our society. It is also clear, how under resourced and under staffed it has become, effecting morale and staff retention and recruitment. If we wish to maintain this incredible service the government need to act now to stop its disintegration, with staff leaving and services being reduced or closing.",
