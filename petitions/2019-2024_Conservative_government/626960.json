        "additional_details": "Not long ago the UK was the biggest cannabis exporter in the world, and so why would this not be able to be taxed when sold in shops just like alcohol/tobacco? There is scientific evidence to prove how cannabis can help alleviate mental health conditions such as anxiety, and it can also help with chronic pain. Neither alcohol/tobacco can accomplish this without detriment yet they remain legal and cannabis does not.",
        "background": "Make the sale (with a license), distribution and possession of recreational Cannabis legal in the UK. Currently there are drugs which are legal that cause more detriment such as Alcohol. In 2020 there were 8,974 deaths caused by alcohol. Tobacco kills around 106,000 people per year in the UK alone.",
