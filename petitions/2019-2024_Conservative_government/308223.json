        "additional_details": "Whilst European states have shared similar infection rates of growth other countries took more stringent action earlier and with greater success. An enquiry should be established to investigate the following. 1) What did the government know and when did they know it? 2) What anticipatory action was taken? 3) Did a lack of availability of tests and tracing efforts hamper the failed aborted containment? 4) What oversight/peer review was conducted on the faulty UK modelling which led to the abandoned 'herd immunity' response? 5) Why did the UK ignore the WHO's best practice guidelines?",
        "background": "An independent enquiry should be established to ensure full transparency around the timing, efficacy and efficiency of the UK response. To support this the UK Government must introduce statutory testing and reporting of all UK deaths from Covid-19.",
