        "additional_details": "The GP's reluctance to going back to face to face appointments is forcing many many people to resort to going to A&E thus adding even more load on our overworked NHS staff.\r\nIt appears that many GP's are adopoting the attitude that patients really are an inconvenience and telephone appointments goes some way to them (the GP's) have an easier life to the detriment of the patient and NHS service; in many cases having serious results to patients health and even life.",
        "background": "GP's return to face to face appointments instead of telephone appointments and that access to the surgery is reinstated. Illnesses are misdiagnosed or the seriousness of an illness is not realised. Much can be gained by a GP on a face to face basis such as how the patient looks, their demeanour.",
