Many of these students also work in nursing homes, caring in the community, or work with other vulnerable groups. Due to the risk of infection whilst on placement, some will not be allowed to work part-time in these places to pay their bills. Students are not eligible for benefits, and many do not earn enough money to be eligible for statutory sick pay.",
