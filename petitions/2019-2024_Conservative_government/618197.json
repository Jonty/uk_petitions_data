        "additional_details": "Many children whose parents are fighting to restore peace in Ukraine have received no response from UKVI for months, likely due to the lack of clear guidelines. We feel like UKVI is failing to help those needing it most and are avoiding accountability for it by failing to respond to applications, a deadline for a response or update could be an answer to this. This war has already taken over 200 children's lives, we must prevent it taking more.",
        "background": "The Government should urgently provide a clear way for children unaccompanied by their parents to get a visa, as stated in UNCRC Article 22, and force UKVI to issue responses/updates to all visa applications within 10 working days or a similar time frame.",
