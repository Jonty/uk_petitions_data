        "additional_details": "It is evident that student nurses are not given the same protection against COVID-19 as their paid colleagues whilst on clinical placement within the NHS. Student nurses are currently not in a priority group for access to vaccines and mandatory home testing is currently not provided nationally for students. Alongside this, student nurses are not covered under insurance which includes death in service. We believe that, as student nurses, we are not being adequately and fairly protected.",
        "background": "Student nurses attending placements within the NHS during the pandemic should be provided equal protection to paid staff. Ensuring priority access to vaccines; access to regular, mandatory and nationally rolled out rapid home testing (LFTs); and cover under insurance (i.e death in service cover).",
