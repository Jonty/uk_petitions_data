This means that students are having to pay for their accommodation in other cities whilst they are not living there as they may have gone home. \r\nFurthermore, the change to 'online teaching'  reduces the value for money of the services students are receiving as in some cases they no longer have access to one-to-one sessions with lecturers and they no longer have discussions in seminars.",
