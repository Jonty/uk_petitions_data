People are buying more locally produced food items. People are appreciating the work of proffessions that have long gone unrecognised or considered menial(nurses, teachers, shop staff). People are walking & cycling more, and in some ways are now connecting (virtually) more with friends and family all over the world. \r\nWe want to continue down this less destructive path.",

This opportunity should be used to bring the country together going forward, in embracing a new, healthier, fairer, significantly more environmentally conscious future, instead of returning to the ratrace of normality.",
