        "action": "Change the distressing system of telephone consultation/emergency appointments",
        "additional_details": "patients are given very late appointments and GP's just check online on telephone which makes it absolutely impossible for them to see the cause in person. Rather treating the root cause of the problem, they give paracetamol for the time being. The NHS lacks the system for emergency patients, even in A&E they have to wait long especially the children. Children are vulnerable and should be checked on priority basis. GP cannot assess the severity on telephone hence changes are required promptly.",
        "background": "Pass a an extra budget for NHS so they can check the patients face to face. Also, other than regular appointments system they should make a portal for emergency patients in which they check the patients with due care and responsibility because rather treating the cause they give late appointments.",
