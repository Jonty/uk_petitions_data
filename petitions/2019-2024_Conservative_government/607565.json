People still need to isolate because if you don't isolate when infected,then you might pass it on to vulnerable people which could seriously harm them. I know people want to go back to normal and how it use to be, but as a country we are just not ready for that yet.\r\n\r\nAustralia shut down all planes to stop people getting into the country, they now go into full lockdown when just a single case has been found. England's uprise of cases could have been prevented if we acted quicker like australia did.",
