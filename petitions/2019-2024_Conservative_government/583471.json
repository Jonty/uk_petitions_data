Requirements for testing and self-isolation are intended to prevent onward transmission of Covid-19. Vaccination for Covid-19 takes time to be effective, and it is also not yet clear how vaccination effects onward transmission.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nReview quarantine rules for international arrivals travelling for work: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/574771\r\n\r\nNo hotel quarantine for UK citizens, permanent residents and their families: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/571447"
