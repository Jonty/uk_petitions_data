        "additional_details": "Russia Invaded Ukraine. By air, land and sea Russia has launched a devastating attack on a peaceful nation. Ukraine is a European democracy and home to 44 million people who need help. The world so far showed support by announcing a package of sanctions aimed at Russia and other measures. Furthermore many countries around the world announced visa free entry for Ukrainian citizens who have no choice but to flee the country, their homeland, their home. It is an incredibly difficult decision.",
        "background": "The UK government can now show true leadership and grant citizens of Ukraine visa free entry to the United Kingdom. We strongly believe this alongside other support will make a significant difference and so many  innocent lives can be saved.",
