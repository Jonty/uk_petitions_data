        "additional_details": "Wifi has become an essential to almost all we do  in life now - like water, gas and electricity. From working to studying to seeking information, everything we now use is online. Ensuring that every home has wifi would enable opportunity. There should also not be the 'gap' that too frequently occurs when people relocate and have days or weeks without connectivity. Providers should not be able to cut residents off - just offer a basic service until they select the package they would like.",
        "background": "The Government should acknowledge the importance of wifi as an essential service within any household and ensure that it is present and cannot be disconnected when the home changes owners/tenants.",
