        "additional_details": "The UK government is complicit in the humanitarian crisis in Yemen as it is still exporting weapons to the Saudi-Arabian led coalition (SLC). The court of appeal found that the export of British arms sales to Saudi Arabia to be unlawful as it had not properly assessed whether air-strikes that killed civilians in Yemen broke humanitarian law. Despite this verdict the UK government has managed to find a loop-hole by allowing already-registered companies to continue exporting.",
