They shouldn\u2019t be put into overcrowded and unhygienic accommodation to the point that they feel a hunger strike is necessary (as has happened in the barracks site in Kent) we should be providing these people with safe environments, not in environments that are unsafe and could be especially damaging to the mental health of many there.",
