        "additional_details": "The results from exams being taken as normal wouldn\u2019t reflect a valid representation of our abilities. Plus, many teachers believe that there needs to be change to the exams. Teachers are ultimately the people who know this content best, so they already emphasise the difficulty of exams.\r\n\r\nConsequently, A Level exams taking place as normal would definitely have a significantly negative impact of mental health due to the overwhelming stress. The pandemic is already difficult to many students",
        "background": "The A Level 2021 exams need significant changes. AS/A Levels/ BTECs are difficult mainly due to the overwhelming amount of content we have to not only learn but also constantly revise and memorise. We are going through a pandemic, which is a solid reason to consider our mental health and abilities.",
