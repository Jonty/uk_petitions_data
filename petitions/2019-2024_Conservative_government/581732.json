        "additional_details": "Removing a dog from a loving home to be placed in kennels is not only very stressful for the dog it can also affect their usual behavior which could have an effect on the outcome of the assessments performed. \r\nForcibly removing a dog from a home can cause irreparable trauma for the owner and the dog.\r\nA structured testing facility for owners of suspected banned breeds would be the ideal way to asses a dogs true temperament and far less stressful for the owner and the dog.",
        "background": "A change to the assessment process whereby owners are able to keep their dogs within the home and are summoned to an assessment centre to determine if the dog is a danger to others. \r\nThis would ensure the dog is cared for correctly and gives owners a chance to prove that their dog isn't a danger.",
