        "additional_details": "Currently 8 million pieces of plastic pollution find their way into our oceans everyday. This kills one marine mammal or sea bird every 30 seconds. If countries like Rwanda and Kenya can ban disposable plastic bags, then the UK can. We can do better than just charging 10p, we can ban plastic bags completely. This was set to happen anyway in April 2020 and it has not. There is no excuse. The UK government needs to keep to its promises and do more to tackle this pandemic of plastic pollution.",
        "background": "In April 2020 the government had promised to ban plastic bags. Due to coronavirus this got delayed and then cancelled. Now the government is saying in April 2021 they will increase the charge on plastic bags to 10p saying that the 'war on plastic' has been 'stepped up'. This is not good enough.",
