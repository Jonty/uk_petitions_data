        "additional_details": "As many working families we require grandparents to help with school pick ups and childcare so we can go out to work. With the announcement made of new COVID-19 measures across the North East this has no made it near impossible for myself and families across the region to go to work or face fines.",
        "background": "I would like the government to consider making grandparents exempt to help with childcare. You boast that Northumberland is still open for business but now with your announcement many businesses will not be able to operate as working parents have no childcare available to them with these new rules.",
