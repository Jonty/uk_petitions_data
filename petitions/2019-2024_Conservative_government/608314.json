        "action": "Cut household fuel prices and take gas and electricity into public ownership.",
        "additional_details": "Privatisation of gas and electricity has been a giant rip-off. Increases in energy costs for households, public administration and businesses in April 2022 are chiefly intended to benefit corporate shareholders, pushing millions more people into fuel poverty. Nothing short of state ownership of gas and electricity can ensure that all customers are charged a fair price that also takes into account the need to invest in renewable energy on the massive scale needed to help combat global warming.",
        "background": "Halt or reverse increases in household gas and electricity charges and renationalise both industries so they can be planned and developed in the interests of the people, society and the planet.",
