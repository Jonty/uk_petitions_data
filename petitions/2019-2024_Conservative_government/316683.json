        "additional_details": "According to research by Asthma UK, 98% of nurses support the review of the current medical exemptions list, and 57% have had patients who have had an asthma attack or needed emergency care because their patient skipped their medication due to this cost. Their research has also found that the UK has one of the worst asthma death rates in Europe, with the rate of people dying from an asthma attack increasing by more than 20% in five years.",
        "background": "Asthma is a long-term condition which affects 5.4 million people (1 in 11) in the UK.\r\nPrescription charges for other long-term conditions, such as Hypothyroidism and Diabetes, are provided free of charge. \r\nPlease end the unfair prescription charge for asthma medications and help save lives.",
