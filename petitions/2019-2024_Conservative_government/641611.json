There is always the option to buy online, but it does not compare to being able to try clothes on at the shop to gain a better understanding of how your body is changing. The shortage of stock in retail shops makes pregnancy a lot harder for many women\u2019s mental health and self awareness. All retailers have maternity clothes online, so why not in physical shops?",
        "background": "Pregnancy is a period of constant change in women\u2019s bodies. The lack of readily available pregnancy clothes in retail shops makes this period a lot more stressful and complex than needs to be. By ensuring retailers have items in stock at the shops, everyone wins.",
