        "additional_details": "If people are to lose half of their wages then they're simply not going to be following the advice. Most people live hand to mouth and losing out on so much money isn't an option.\r\n\r\nDuring these very testing times we look towards the government for help whether it's making sure employers pay full wages during the isolation or creating a fund that companies can access to claim the isolation pay back.\r\n\r\nWithout this happening then people will  carry on going to work and risking spreading the virus.",
        "background": "Over the next few months it is important that people self isolate where they are advised to prevent a very damaging and destructive second wave.\r\n\r\nThe issue is people will only be entitled to SSP which is \u00a395 per week.This would be a loss of over \u00a3400 per fortnight that they need to self isolate.",
