        "additional_details": "With the average attendance in the 2022/2023 season standing at just 40,000, millions of football fans and supporters are punished on a weekly basis. Abolishing this rule would also potentially be a much needed boost for pubs and clubs, who should be able to show these matches live.",
        "background": "Televised live football matches have been subject to a 3pm broadcasting blackout since the 1960\u2019s, with the UK being the only country to have this rule in place. With match going fans struggling to buy tickets, it is wholly unfair that they are unable to view matches on television.",
