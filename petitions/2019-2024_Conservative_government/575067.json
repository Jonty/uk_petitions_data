        "additional_details": "This is problematic as these unelected individuals fail to recognise that these monuments aren\u2019t just representative of London, but England as a whole. It\u2019s unfair and undemocratic to put a small group of people in charge of regulating the history of the country based on what they deem appropriate. Also, for a panel encouraging diversity, there is a noticeable lack in variety of political views, creating an environment that does not reflect the diversity of thought that England is known for.",

This group has taken it upon themselves to \u2018review London's historic monuments and statues\u2019 with no public input or democratic vote.",
