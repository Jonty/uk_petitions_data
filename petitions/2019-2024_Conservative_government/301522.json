        "additional_details": "As Liverpool is the only city in this county, it makes sense for it the be called \u201cCity of Liverpool\u201d instead of Merseyside. It would save confusion if the name was changed along with the postcode of other places in Merseyside to \u201cL\u201d, rather than \u201cCH\u201d as it is not located in Cheshire. It is a popular idea within the people of Merseyside as well.",
        "background": "Change the name of the county now known as Merseyside to the new name of \u201cCity of Liverpool\u201d as it is what a lot of people from the county have spoken about for many years and has been a popular subject amongst the people of Merseyside.",
