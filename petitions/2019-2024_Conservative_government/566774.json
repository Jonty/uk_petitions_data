        "additional_details": "If 2022 exams are cancelled, our mental health will be much better. We wont have to stress about exams in this tough time. We are bombarded with a lot of work and the thought of doing exams with less help scares us. I believe school is important and we should learn as much as we can, even if its online class so be it. We should continue studying but not have exams for 2022 as its unfair and stressful. Please have a thought about this as I have spoken to many people and they agree and think exams should be cancelled too.",
        "background": "Online class is not as efficient as learning in school. We are learning on our own and it\u2019s very stressful as there is no motivation. We get set a lot of work with no help. If the government could arrange something to help us and our mental health or cancel exams.",
