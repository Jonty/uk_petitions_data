To remove this, at a time when the industry needs to encourage diversity of all types, could have a devastating effect on the performing arts sector.",
        "background": "The government plans to scrap the current BTEC training qualifications and replace them with T Levels. However, there are no plans to replace the Performing Arts BTEC with a T Level equivalent. We call on the government to reverse the decision or provide an equivalent T Level in the subject",
