        "additional_details": "Also, panic buyers can simply do the rounds of several shops on several days, bulk buying and taking their 'ration' in each one. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the current system, where supermarkets control rationing in house, is resulting in the abuse of shop staff.\r\n\r\nSome people are STILL not getting their fair share, especially the vulnerable and key workers. If key workers (including medical staff) can't access basic supplies, then this country's infrastructure will collapse.",
        "background": "We call upon the Government to control the rationing of food and groceries - NOT supermarkets. Asking supermarkets to take charge of rationing is causing major problems. \r\n\r\nShops do not know the circumstances of each customer including how many people they are shopping for.",
