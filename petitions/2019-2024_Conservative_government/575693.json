In the case of electric cars, their CO2 emissions are occurring away from the vehicle, via the grid etc. All car production involves emissions, this data should be publicly available and should take into account things like elemental content such as Cobalt and Lithium for all propulsion types whether it be EV, Hybrid, Petrol, Diesel, Ethanol, Biofuel, Electrofuels/Efuels or other cars.",

The UK Government must make this a requirement.",

You could therefore start a petition calling on the Government to extend this to require all cars and vans to be fully zero emission across their entire lifetime by a particular date, if that is something you'd like to see happen."
