        "additional_details": "Multiple scientists and even the Government's own advisers, including the Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty, have said that children are more at risk from other diseases, such as the flu or measles, than from COVID-19.\r\n\r\nAt a time when case numbers and deaths caused by COVID-19 are going down, there is no reason why wearing face masks should be made compulsory in schools, especially at a time when the mental health of children and young people has never been more compromised.",
        "background": "Wearing face masks have been made compulsory in shops, takeaways, public transport among other places such as museums and art galleries. Now, some people are suggesting that wearing face masks needs to be made compulsory in UK schools. This does not need to happen.",
