        "additional_details": "Everyday that the government fails to review its policy in light of new evidence & adequate NHS capacity, drives the UK into incalculable debt & economic consequences that are reeking untold harm & fatalities that will dwarf the current pandemic. Failure to relax the policy will result in a depression more severe than any previously experienced, & will tear out the economic heart - the working population - that monetarily feeds our NHS & other vital services, which will become extinct.",
        "background": "Review the basis for the lockdown policy (to save the NHS and save lives) in the light of new studies worldwide, including WHO, showing mortality rates to be a magnitude lower than predicted; and on the basis that there is sufficient capacity within the NHS to adequately deal with this epidemic.",
