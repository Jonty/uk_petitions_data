        "action": "Test all who enter U.K. borders for COVID-19 when in Tier 4 restrictions.",
        "additional_details": "Current figures and lockdown measures imply that we do not have the necessary level of precautions in place to insure that this country\u2019s people are not at significant risk of harm due to there being no real restrictions on international travel. Many non-U.K. residents are still moving across the border, dampening the work put in place to protect everyone.",
        "background": "This petition puts forward that all non U.K. residents travelling into a Tier 4 area of the U.K. can not gain entry unless a COVID-19 test is given upon arrival or within 72h prior to travel in a similar fashion to restrictions in place around the globe.",
