If to take a house hold with both working parents, this cost could take nearly up to 50% of total household income, full time childcare cost is way to high to afford a quality live for working parents. It puts under the pressure working parents adding unnecessary stress to them. Nursery is a vital part of child's development to socialise and develop so much needed socialising skills.",
