However there are other MPs that are mainly in safe seats who take their position for granted and when an individual asks their MP for assistance to submit a petition, either they do not respond, refuse to help, label those who contact them or enforce their own opinion.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to consider the impact on the most vulnerable people who have no voice.",

Currently MPs who are in a position of trust can refuse to present a petition by an individual from their constituency to the House of Commons.",
