        "additional_details": "This petition is a test of the government's and common's hypocrisy. Will they reduce their wage to the national minimum wage, and prove that it is not liveable, or will they choose to respond to this petition by claiming their superiority or entitlement over hard British workers by claiming that they deserve more than the living wage.\r\n\r\nThe ball is in your court GOV, admit the minimum wage is NOT liveable, or admit you think yourselves superior to the rest of the country.",
        "background": "MPs have long argued that the minimum wage is in-line with real living wage. In-fact, in 2015 the national minimum wage for 25+ was renamed to the national living wage. If indeed this wage is so liveable, then MPs should have no problem with their wage being set to the minimum instead.",
