        "additional_details": "Endometriosis is an invisible& lifelong illness with limited research and no cure impacting daily lives of the individuals diagnosed with this condition. Difficulties during travel & discrimination at work are the main concerns that need to be addressed. By sharing the same privileges as a disabled person, it would make life slightly easier while living with a condition that affects the quality of life severely and may lead to unfair dismissal at works which could affect mental health adversely.",
        "background": "I want the government to declare endometriosis a disability & the individuals to be issued blue badges as the endometriosis pain is debilitating & affects the walking ability in certain cases. The constant cramps & contractions with no cure in a lifelong condition needs support from the government.",
