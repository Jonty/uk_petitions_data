However, ULEZ and similar schemes mean that they cannot afford to keep their vehicles that mean so much to them. I would like the 40 year old ULEZ exemption to extend to vehicles over 25 years old. Many legends such as the Ford Escort RS Cosworth, the Renault 5 GT Turbo and the iconic Rover Mini will fall victim to being lost due to such schemes.",
