        "additional_details": "The government should allow the public a vote on whether they want HS2 to continue. It is affecting so many lives, but people have had no choice. It is destroying important wildlife habitats, fauna, historical buildings and burial sites. They allowed a vote on Brexit. People should also have an opportunity to vote on whether they want the face of their landscape, and the areas in which they live, to change. In a democratic society, you should allow people a choice and not dictate.",
        "background": "We live in a democratic society; yet HS2 has been thrust on us without asking us whether we want it or not. The public should decide on whether they want this project to go ahead.\r\n\r\nThe project has already negatively impacted so many people's lives and will continue to do so for many years.",
