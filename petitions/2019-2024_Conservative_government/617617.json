        "additional_details": "A lot of blame is placed on individuals when it comes to making decisions but it is the government\u2019s responsibility to make the choices with less impact accessible to the environment accessible to everyone, not just those with money. \r\n\r\nI believe that public transport should be free and accessible to all, the least the government should be doing is making it more affordable for citizens to choose public transport over driving or flying. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s even cheaper to drive than get the bus in most areas.",
        "background": "The difference of impact between travelling by rail and flying should be acknowledged by the government and reflected in the cost of both methods of transport. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s cheaper to fly from one city in the U.K. to another via another county than it is to travel between the same two cities by train.",

In particular, we're not sure whether you'd like the Government to increase taxes on internal flights and subsidise train travel, or if you'd like the government to fund free public transport including trains and buses, or if you'd like something different. \r\n\t\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
