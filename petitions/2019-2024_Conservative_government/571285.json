        "additional_details": "Many of the current year 11's spent approximately 84 days out of face-to-face teaching in the first wave of COVID-19.\r\nWe have now missed at least 145 days of the face-to-face provision in our GCSE courses out of the standard approx. 350 days in years 10 & 11. (And that's without personal self-isolation).\r\n\r\nI think student opinions are being overlooked, in a time where first-hand opinions need to be heard.\r\n\r\nIn a time of perilous variability, the prospect of exams will shatter teen confidence.",
