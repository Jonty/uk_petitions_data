        "additional_details": "There are numerous children suffering from SMA and are unable to get the treatment necessary to live as they're not able to afford the treatment. One dose of Zolgensma, the gene therapy treatment, is a one time injection into the vein which will give the child another shot at life! The current price for Zolgensma is \u00a31.9million. Families across the UK aren't able to save their own child due to the high cost of this treatment. We're asking for this treatment to be funded by the NHS going forward",
        "background": "SMA is a serious condition which gets worse over time. It's a genetic disorder which makes the muscles weaker and causes problems with movement. Babies with Type 1 rarely survive beyond the first few years of their life. \r\nZolgensma is a one time dose which could save a child's life.",
