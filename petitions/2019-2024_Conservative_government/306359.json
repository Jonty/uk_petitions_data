        "additional_details": "It is very easy to focus on GCSE and A-level students who are losing out because of the shutdown of schools and cancellation of exams, but it is all levels of education that will be suffering due to this crisis. The government needs to take urgent action to make sure that all children do not have their education hampered because of this shutdown. We need to consider cancelling summer holidays and shortening other holidays next year to allow the school curriculum to be completed as normal.",
        "background": "With schools closed for the next 6, 12 or more weeks, I want the government to consider cancelling the summer holidays to allow education to continue and children to receive the standard education needed to succeed and not become the generation we failed to protect and support.",
