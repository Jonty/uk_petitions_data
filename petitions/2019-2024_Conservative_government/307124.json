        "additional_details": "The NHS is already at breaking point with workforce shortages, an ageing population and greater demand for it\u2019s services. \r\nWith the rapid development of Covid-19, frontline staff are directly exposed to the outbreak; working tirelessly to care and support the increasing number of people who have fallen ill to the virus. \r\nMany staff are working extra shifts or longer hours to cater for demand, often without breaks, further increasing the stress and strains of working in a care setting.",
        "background": "Frontline staff who work extra shifts should be paid an additional \u00a3100 per shift. This could increase the availability of staff during the high demand for care due to the Covid-19 outbreak. \r\nThus, providing extra support to staff who do additional shifts to help with staff shortages and sickness.",
