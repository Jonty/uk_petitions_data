        "action": "Introduce free access to the internet for educational and other necessary uses",
        "additional_details": "Increasingly accessing education, public and health services, financial services and employment, require the use of internet. In deprived areas families often lack continuous or adequate access to the internet and can be significantly disadvantaged. COVID-19 has highlighted this in remote provision of education. The Government is promoting better connectivity for remote communities and a Digital Britain  but there is also an issue of affordability for many that needs to be debated by Parliament.",
        "background": "COVID-19 has shown there is an increasing \"digital\" divide between those that can afford to access internet services and those that cannot. Previous proposals to address this issue have been dismissed as unworkable but we now know action is needed to give access to all to a  \"Digital Britain\".",
