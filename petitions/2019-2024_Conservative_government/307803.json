        "action": "Encourage universities to freeze/stop accommodation payments during pandemic",
        "additional_details": "This academic year (2020) has already hindered for students as we\u2019ve had the loss of studies to not only Covid-19 but the Feb/mar strikes. We're at a loss to debt when we leave uni and Covid-19 is only making it worse. With the information from the Government and NHS to self-isolate and lockdown occurring it only makes sense for students wanting to leave uni accommodation to go home. We, the students, are asking for our rent payments to stop as has our education.",
        "background": "Since the closure of education universities are still making students pay for accomodation fees for the following educational term (Apr, May & Jun) despite our studies moving online. For domestic & international students that have already evacuated uni to self-isolate at home the fees are worthless",
