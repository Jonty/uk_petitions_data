        "additional_details": "Considering the situation with the outbreak of COVID-19, there are increasingly reduced services, due to lack of staff and Government enforced lockdowns, which includes closures of sexual health clinics and GPs. Soon, women will find it significantly harder to access abortions, which is already a stressful enough experience. We want abortions to be accessible from home, to allow women to have certainty they will be able to carry out an abortion through this challenging and uncertain time.",
        "background": "The Government must allow women to access medical abortions through a telephone triage, instead of visiting a medical clinic to complete the first stage of a medical abortion. Women should simply be allowed to gain access to the necessary medication to carry out the procedure entirely at home.",
