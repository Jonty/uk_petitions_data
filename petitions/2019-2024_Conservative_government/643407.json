Individuals would not be able to afford to go out as part of respite as they are with the individuals that they are caring for 24 hours a day 7 days a week, especially on the \u201cwage\u201d being paid. \u00a32.19 can\u2019t even get a coffee in these current times. Therefore I believe they should at least be getting a Minimum wage salary.",

To qualify for carers allowance you have to care for the person in your household for at least 35 hours a week most people do more than 35 hours in that week. Working that out they are working for approximately \u00a32.19 an hour.",
