        "additional_details": "Most of the above are either sole traders or worker-director limited companies. These are people who may not receive a full salary via the PAYE system. \r\n\r\nSome may have a monthly income via dividends. Others may have fluctuating salaries based wholly on their profit that month.\r\n\r\nIn this time of national crisis, we need the Government to guarantee up to 80% income for ALL workers, not just those based on the PAYE system.\r\n\r\nWe are the backbone of the private sector in the UK. Help us to survive.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, call on the Chancellor to extend the 80% wages pledge to become an OVERALL income pledge so it would cover ALL tradespeople and sole traders.",
