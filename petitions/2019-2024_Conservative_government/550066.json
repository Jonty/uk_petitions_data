        "additional_details": "The class of 2021 has missed the most important year of schooling/college due to the skills needed to succeed not being given as a result of COVID -19. Memory of skills will be lost as a result of not being able to go over topics again properly whilst being at home which therefore means that we will be at a disadvantage if the exams go ahead. As year 11 is mainly a revision year, it is only fair that our exams are cancelled in order to receive the necessary grades to shape our futures.",
        "background": "The GCSE and A - Level students of 2021 need their exams cancelled, the same way the class of 2020 did. We have missed too much work to complete exams and reach our full potential. People who were set to achieve a pass or higher may fail if this does not occur. It is us who\u2019ve been affected the most",
