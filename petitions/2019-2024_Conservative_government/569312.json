        "additional_details": "People are fed up the restrictions, even those who did follow them. Things will only get worse if the repercussions are not more severe as more and more people are giving up. There is a shockingly large lack of consequences, with the majority mere warnings. There should be mobile emergency alerts and TV overrides alerting lockdowns, not hearing about it via social media & friends. The government has not treated this with severity this, it does not feel like as much of a concern to most people.",
        "background": "I want to see lockdown/tier reaction breaking rules such as throwing parties or mass-gatherings treated with more severity. Such as larger fines and community service where rule breakers could meet with ex-COVID Ward patients and current ward staff to discuss the severity of the pandemic.",
