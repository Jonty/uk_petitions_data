        "additional_details": "2020 was challenging to us all: Covid-19 outbreak & uncertainty surrounding post-Brexit Britain have put on hold many lives across the UK. \r\n\r\nGovernment should do everything in their power, to help people regain stability, both mentally and financially. This starts at HOME. Unable to live our lives as normal, unable to see our loved ones for months is hard enough. Being unable to call any place our own makes facing the \"new normal\" and challenges it brings even harder.\r\n\r\nI am calling for the Government to allow qualifying H2B applicants to purchase not only new builds, but also existing properties with Government's help. \r\n\r\nAny property with a standard considered to be \"fit enough to be rented out to live in\" should be considered fit enough to be purchased under the scheme.",
        "background": "Government should support qualifying first-time buyers by allowing the Help to Buy scheme to be used toward purchasing of existing properties. Renting a property should be an option, not necessity successfully preventing generations from owning a home. Because #HealingStartsAtHOME",
