        "additional_details": "I understand that dogs need their space, but they can still have their freedom in the comfort of their own home, or even in a park, with a leash. \r\nThere are many people that may be scared, even allergic to dogs, and the fact that many dog owners do not seem to understand that and let their dogs roam around is unacceptable.\r\n5 years ago, I had been attacked by a dog that was not on a leash. It left me with scars and a broken nose, therefore please sign this petition to prevent this from happening!",
        "background": "I feel like it should not be acceptable for dogs to be in public places like the road/parks without a leash. Many dog owners let their dog off the leash in parks. This is not right as they take no consideration for the people around them.",
