        "additional_details": "As we have seen during the pandemic, the proliferation of misinformation and ignorance of scientific fact costs lives. We call upon the government to better equip the public for their own safety.\r\n\r\nOne of the best ways to combat this has to be through state education, for schoolchildren and adults. An emphasis on rationality, sceptical inquiry, and analysis of evidence should be a cornerstone of academic endeavour. And this needs practical application to the world around us.",
        "background": "The British public are suffering a lack of critical thinking skills amid anti-vaccine misinformation and the proliferation of unscientific 5G conspiracies. We should be better equipped to subject information to critical analysis and discern fact from fiction whether it be in science or politics.",
