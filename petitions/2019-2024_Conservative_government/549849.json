        "additional_details": "In the first year of legalisation, Colorado made billions in tax money, even after pumping it in to education & other social programs, didn't know what to do with it all. This would help ease, & maybe reverse, our recession.\r\n\r\nThere is hundreds of different marijuana based infastructures around the world that ours could copy, or could be adjusted to fit our economy.\r\n\r\nThere's already a huge network of people involved in the industry in the UK, they can be utilised to help make it successful here.",
        "background": "Marijuana has long been on the list of necessary laws that need to be changed, everything from health benefits, to tax income, freeing up police time, etc. etc. \r\n\r\nWe are in a recession, what better time than now?",
