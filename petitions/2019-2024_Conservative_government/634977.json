        "additional_details": "At the very least,  and as a huge urgency, the Gov. needs to urgently import qualified dentists to do NHS work, & make a rule that newly qualified dentists do a certain amount of years as NHS dentists before they can become private patient only. It is false economy to ignore dental needs which can then lead to all sorts of problems, not least of which is sepsis, which involves hospitalization, and possibly death. The gov, could also put in place  a better payment structure for the dentists, for NHS work which is done",
        "background": "In spring 2022, it was reported in the news that many dentists were turning down NHS patients. Since then, the government has done absolutely nothing to address the shortage. They need to address the issue as urgent. It is false economy not to do so.",
