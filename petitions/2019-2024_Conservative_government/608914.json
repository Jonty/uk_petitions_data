        "additional_details": "Government & Parliament are the bodies that can pass legislation to enable an independent fuel regulator to be formed and put into operation. It has been brought to light by the RAC that Fuel Retailers have been slow passing on the reductions when the barrel of oil price has fallen, but from my own and millions of other driver experience, they have been very quick to raise there prices when oil has risen. Electricity, Gas. Water, Telecoms are all regulated & so should the fuel be at the pumps.",
        "background": "Set up an independent fuel regulator to closely monitor Petrol & Diesel prices being charged by retailers of fuel stations. To monitor & clamp down on unreasonable profiteering. To closely monitor Fuel companies from the excessive elevation of wholesale pricing compared to the price of crude oil.",
