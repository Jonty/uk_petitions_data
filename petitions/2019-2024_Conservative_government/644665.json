        "additional_details": "The administration at Balerno Community High School have decided locking toilets during school-time is the way forward. We are a school of 800+ and during lessons we have to share 2 toilets, sadly, sometimes the toilets aren\u2018t re-opened during lunch and break, causing queues. 1 of the 2 open toilets has a glass window above the door and directly opens into a corridor, a clear breach of privacy. Blockages are common, stopping the flush from functioning, rendering the 2 toilets we have useless.",
