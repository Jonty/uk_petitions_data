        "additional_details": "Most students struggle with stress when they are doing a one time only exam which determines their grade for the 2-3 years of the course they studied. Many fail under pressure and it\u2019s not an accurate or fair way of measuring someone\u2019s ability or knowledge of the course. Spreading out GCSE\u2019s into mini exams done across the year which will then be calculated into a final grade results in more accurate results it allows for the actual ability of a student to be determined and not how they did on a set date.",
        "background": "Right now GCSE\u2019s are typically a set of exams done once at the end of year 11. \r\nI believe instead of this they should become mini exams that are spread out throughout year 10 and year 11. It\u2019s also more supportive of young peoples mental health.",
