        "additional_details": "These children are being failed at the moment. SEN parents should be given the autonomy to send their SEN children to school. The decision should not be made by teachers on our children's behalf. The vast majority of SEN children can not access remote learning. As a SEN parent it is heartbreaking to know that the best place for our child is often not to be at home but at school. Early intervention for SEN children is being lost by the day. Which is crucial for their long term outcomes.",

This is the guidance issued from the Prime Minister. However it is not being adhered to by all schools",
