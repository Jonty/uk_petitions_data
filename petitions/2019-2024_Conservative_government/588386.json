People are paying way over what a mortgage would cost on a property because they\u2019re unable to get the deposit they need. Buy to rent schemes are too few and far between for enough private renters to utilise them. Most people are unable to progress with their life as they are stuck in a property which is probably too small for a decent quality of living. We need a way out of renting!",
