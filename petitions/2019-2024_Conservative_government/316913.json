        "additional_details": "To help people financially who are out of work at the moment during a pandemic and cannot access the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme due to being denied Furlough from their ex-employer. We pay taxes and national insurance and deserve to have financial support in times of crisis. We have all worked hard and paid our taxes and national insurance all of our working lives. Mandatory furlough solves the many loopholes this scheme has.",
        "background": "I would like Government to make Furlough mandatory so that those who had a notice period ending as lockdown began/those who cannot secure new work due to covid-19 are supported via the retention scheme as this is a huge loophole. Ex-employers should not have power over tax payers hard earned money.",
