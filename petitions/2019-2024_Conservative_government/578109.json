        "additional_details": "Given that we all owe the wonderful NHS staff an enormous debt, for the Government to put forward a 1% pay rise is a shocking slap in the face !! Recognising that we have seen that many lower paid NHS staff fall into 'work poverty' and have to use food banks is shocking & unacceptable at any time. At a time when the nations health is clearly in the hands of NHS staff, we should be ashamed of our Government.  \r\nThe Govt was happy to take credit for the NHS pandemic response, now pay them properly!",
        "background": "The UK public along with PM, Ministers & MP's stood on doorsteps weekly to thank & applaud the dedication & commitment of our NHS staff, along with other front line workers, who's amazing work throughout the Covid 19 pandemic saved countless lives, putting themselves families in harms way daily.",
