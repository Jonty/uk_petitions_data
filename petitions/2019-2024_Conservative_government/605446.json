The average maintainence loan is around \u00a36,900, meaning most students, meaning the student loan is not enough.\r\n\r\nThe student loan company is putting money directly into student landlords' pockets rather than financially supporting students that need it most. Students are subsidising their cost of living from their families, part-time jobs (whilst studying) or living at home.",
        "background": "The government needs to place restrictions on student rent so that the maintainence loan can support students. The government should be responsible for imposing regulations on the housing market as clearly landlords cannot be trusted to do this themselves. Rent is too high for most students.",
