        "additional_details": "The government are rushing the return to normality process and putting our children's lives and the lives of the staff in schools at risk.  \r\n\r\nThe school term finishes in 6-8 weeks for summer holidays. It's safer to continue with remote learning for now and have the school's fully prepared for the return in September, whereby adjustments can be made to allow children, mainly those currently in Reception and Year 6 to prepare for the next stage of learning.",
        "background": "Delay sending children back to school in accordance with the recommendation of SAGE. June 1st is too early to return. Advice shows that by delaying the return by two weeks reduces the risk to our children, and by delaying it until September is less risky.",
