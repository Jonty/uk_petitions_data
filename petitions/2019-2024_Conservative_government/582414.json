        "additional_details": "The QUAD alliance provides an adequate opportunity for the UK to place more ample pressure on the Chinese regime and their overarching abuses to their own people as well as internationally. From there utilisation of \u201cChinese Debt-traps\u201d in Africa, to them stipulating the Sino-British joint Declaration to be \u201cvoid\u201d in Hong Kong, to them imposing a Chinese puppet as the Dalai Lama. Therefore, a staple precedent must be set to counteract their inundated abuses, and Quad is built for this purpose.",
        "background": "It is paramount that the UK take more initiative to negating China\u2019s encroachments within the South China Sea (Nine-Dash-Line); their Human Rights abuses (Christian, Uighur, Falun Gong, Inner Mongolians), and there invasive actions towards Taiwan should be met with action.",
