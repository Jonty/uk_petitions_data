        "additional_details": "This petition asks parliament to assess properly whether the pay for nurses and health care workers equates with the essential jobs they undertake. The 1% increase in pay doesn\u2019t reward the nurses for the dedication and bravery they have shown and doesn\u2019t reflect what the majority of the public want the award to be.",
        "background": "This petition urges parliament to reassess the current 1% pay rise for nurses and put it in context of the huge personal sacrifices NHS health workers have made, extra hours worked, not going home until well after the end of their shifts & incredible bravery in putting themselves on the front line",
