        "action": "End the subsidy on MPs food and drink",
        "additional_details": "The Government and Members of Parliament voted against the extension of free school meals during school holidays. The families of children in receipt of free school meals have insufficient money for extra food and rely heavily on foodbanks. If they are utilising foodbanks to survive, how on earth can they be expected to spend extra money that they do no not possess to maintain the health and well being of their hungry children. Money saved by ending the subsidy can be used for the free meals.",
        "background": "It cannot be right that in the 21st century there is so much child poverty when Members of Parliament enjoy the benefits of subsidies within the confines of Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. We should not be funding this totally unnecessary 'perk of the job'.",

It is important to note that while in some venues the cost of providing the service exceeds the income received in sales, other venues in the Commons make a profit which contributes to reducing overall costs. The House of Commons publishes details of the cost of House of Commons catering services: https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/foi/transparency-publications/hoc-transparency-publications/catering-services/transparency-reporting-catering-services/\r\n\r\nCustomers of the House of Commons Catering Services include some of the 650 MPs but also around 14,500 other pass-holders, many of whom are staff on lower wages that work irregular hours. In addition, members of the public and non pass holding visitors to Parliament also have access to these services. The irregular hours and the unpredictability of Parliamentary business contribute to increasing the net cost of providing a catering service. To offset this many of the restaurants, dining room facilities and their staff, are used to cater for private events at times when they are not required by the House. This is one of a number of measures used to reduce\r\ncosts."
