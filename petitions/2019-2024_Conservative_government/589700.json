It is a particularly anti-social activity, and one that can easily cost lives and money when things go wrong. People who behave in this way may not respond well to polite requests from neighbours to desist, so it should be upon the government to facilitate behavioural change and promote education in this area, through a national campaign and enforcement.",
        "background": "To legislate against the use of barbecues on balconies. Lighting any source of flame for cooking on a balcony or roof garden is dangerous, inconsiderate and anti-social; whilst it is also a potential source of anxiety and disturbance for neighbours.",
