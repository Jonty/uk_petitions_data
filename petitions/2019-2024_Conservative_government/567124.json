        "additional_details": "We the British people have had enough of the non action in this area and the fact it is still being allowed at a time when people are sacrifising their freedoms to bring the virus under control. \r\n\r\nWe the British public ask the UK government to close all airports, seaports and the channel tunnel to all but emergency travel during the Lockdown. Emergency travel must only be for things like if a family member is seriously ill abroad or UK Citizens coming back home.",
        "background": "Even today you can travel into Britain from anywhere in the world without restriction and only on advise to quarantine, which has proved useless because hardly anyone follows it.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nA the new variant has arrived from South Africa, which would not have happened had the UK closed the Border.",
