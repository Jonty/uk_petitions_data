        "action": "Pause UK vaccinations, once priority groups are done, to curb cases worldwide",
        "additional_details": "In addition to the logical argument that this will reduce our future problems with the virus, I believe this is a compassionate step to save lives worldwide. As we have been so successful in our vaccination program, we are approaching a moral question. Do we vaccinate those at relatively low risk in the UK and leave certain people abroad with no protection from the virus or choose a compassionate route and save lives world wide. I'd like to believe that as a nation we would show affinity to our fellow human beings.",
        "background": "In line with the World Health Organisation's advice, the UK government should aim to reduce the Covid-19 cases worldwide. By pausing vaccinations we can further contribute to the world vaccination effort. This will reduce the risk of new strains of the virus emerging.",
