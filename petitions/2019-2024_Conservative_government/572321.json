        "additional_details": "Our children have missed so much education, the mental health of our children is deteriorating as a result of the pandemic. By putting children back a year in September it allows them to receive the education they have missed, to allow them to adjust and recover from the upheaval and upset from this pandemic. Our children deserve to have a full education and this will help to achieve this.",
        "background": "After this lockdown when children return to school they will have missed a whole academic year of being in school having face to face teaching and socialising with friends. From September put all children back a year and help them achieve their potential, they deserve a full education!",
