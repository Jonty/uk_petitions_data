        "additional_details": "No solar development should be approved until their impact on the environment and biodiversity is understood. There is currently a clear policy conflict within Government.  On the one hand, Government seeks to protect and enhance our domestic production to maintain food security and recognises the pivotal role of farm land as a carbon sink. On the other, Government is encouraging the indiscriminate growth of renewable energy production. Growth of solar farms must be subject to better regulation.",
        "background": "Government should review the regulatory framework which is in place to manage solar developments, to ensure it considers a broader range of factors than the current National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), which is insufficient in preventing speculative development of our landscape.",
