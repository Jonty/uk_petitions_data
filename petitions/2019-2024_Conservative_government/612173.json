At the moment your petition doesn't put forward a clear enough ask from the Government. It's not clear what would qualify as foxes' land. \r\n\r\nYou could start a petition asking the Government to require developers to do a full ecological survey of land before they're allowed to build on it. This might help the protection of foxes.\r\n\r\nOr you could sign other petitions which are open and calling for changes which might help foxes, for example: \r\n\r\nCreate an emergency Vet service to help injured animals.\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/598797"
