        "additional_details": "If you pay for a service, you expect that service to happen. People pay their council tax expecting their bins to be collected. This has been going on for weeks and is really effecting the community. Refuse is piling up in the street and it is not acceptable. Many people are having to pay out of their own pocket to get rubbish collected because they have no other choice. The queues at the tips are unbelievable and the council are offering no help.",
        "background": "We want you to offer a council tax reduction, refund or some form of compensation to people in Warrington effected by the bin strike. Many people have had to pay outside companies to empty their rubbish to avoid rats and infestations taking place where refuse is piling up.",
