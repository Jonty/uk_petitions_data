        "additional_details": "The horrendous scenes we see in our beautiful countryside of rubbish being left from a day of glorious British sunshine is disheartening to see. Many people are too lazy or too inconsiderate to deal with the environmental impact, let alone the visual impact, so why not offer them an incentive? \r\nWe as a nation are too slow and lethargic to change or set up pilot schemes for something that has been happening for decades. I believe the deposit bins should also be digital to help the transition.",
        "background": "Change how we deposit rubbish. Offer deposit return schemes for recyclable plastic and glass, with deposit bins in parks, open spaces and shops e.g. A person buys a plastic soda bottle or bottle of beer drinks it in the park and then deposits it in the said bin receiving a small sum in return.",
