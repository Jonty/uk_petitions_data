If you have not passed your driving test during this time, you will have to pay and sit the test again. \r\n\r\nDue to the global pandemic. 2020 has been a very tough year for everyone, across all settings, in all sectors.\r\nIf a leaner driver has had a driving test/ lessons cancelled who still has a valid theory test that is due to expire, a good portion, if not all of the remaining time will have been lost due to lockdowns.\r\nHow can you penalise learners for this?",
