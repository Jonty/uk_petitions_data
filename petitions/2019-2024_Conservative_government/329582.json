        "action": "Stop sending plastic waste abroad & increase the UK's plastic recycling capacity",
        "additional_details": "Tens of thousands of tonnes of plastic waste from the UK is sent abroad to countries such as Turkey. These countries do not have the capacity to recycle their own waste. So much of the UK's recyclable plastic waste is being dumped or burnt. This is not good enough. Increasing the UK's plastic recycling capacity would reduce our carbon emissions & reduce habitats across the world from being destroyed by the accumulation of non-biodegradable plastic.",
        "background": "The UK needs to stop sending recyclable plastic waste abroad,  increase its plastic recycling capacity & take responsibility for the amount of (often unnecessary) plastic it generates. Investments should be made into constructing more plastic recycling plants in the UK.",
