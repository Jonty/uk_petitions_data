        "action": "Immediately initiate a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas companies.",
        "additional_details": "Oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea are taxed differently from other companies.\r\n\r\nThey have bigger capital allowances than most companies, which means they can pay less tax if they are investing money.\r\n\r\nThe amount of UK tax paid by oil and gas companies has been low in recent years. For many years the government paid more to oil and gas companies in tax relief than it received from them in taxes. It is unfair for them not to contribute to the budget whilst recording record profits.",
        "background": "Immediately initiate a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas companies and redistribute the takings to benefit those who are, and will be, struggling with the dramatic increase in their electricity and gas bills.",
