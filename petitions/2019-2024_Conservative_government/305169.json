        "additional_details": "As it stands, the Conservative government is moving too slow and is resisting temporary socialist measures. To prevent delay in urgent legislation, the Labour party should avoid delaying legislation passed by the Tory government, in return for collectivist and socialist policy concessions by said government.",
        "background": "The two leading parties need to put aside differences to implement 'war-time' like policies, to ensure damage to the economy is minimalised and collective policies are introduced to prevent further spread and death.",
