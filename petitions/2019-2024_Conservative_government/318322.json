        "additional_details": "The first keyworker known to have died from Covid-19 in this country was a primary school Head Teacher.  There have since been deaths of other teachers from coronovirus.  When schools reopen, the virus will start to circulate again and teachers and child care workers will be on the frontline.  Unlike health care workers, they will have no PPE and therefore no protection against this disease.  This will lead to many preventable deaths of teachers, child care workers and their family members.",
        "background": "Teachers and child care workers are at high risk of contracting Covid-19  because their job requires close contact with large numbers of children.  \r\nTeachers and child care workers need, as a minimum, face masks of FFP2 or N95 standard, disposable gloves and aprons.",
