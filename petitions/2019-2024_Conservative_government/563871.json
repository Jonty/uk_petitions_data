        "action": "Ensure the Prime Minister provides answers to questions asked during PMQ\u2019s.",
        "additional_details": "A formal measuring process should be undertaken for each PMQs session where an independent panel assesses whether the question has been answered.  The panel should also be responsible for fact checking the responses.\r\nThe results of which should be made publicly available.  Not only would this allow the public to gauge the effectiveness of the Prime Minister\u2019s performance but also that of the Speaker of the House.",
        "background": "There has been a movement in recent years for the PM to evade answering questions during PMQs.\r\nThis is an opportunity for the public to see that politicians are held to account for policies.\r\nIf questions are to be purposely not answered without any enforcement then PMQ\u2019s might as well be scrapped.",
