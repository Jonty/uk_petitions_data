        "additional_details": "The current education secretary has bumbled along during this crisis for far too long. Inadequate and improper government guidance to Headteachers and schools, shocking support given, over promised and under-delivered. He has lost the confidence of the profession, schools, Ofsted, parents and most importantly the children themselves. Teachers and schools are doing their best and Mr Williamson is undermining their ongoing efforts.",
        "background": "There should be a change in the cabinet office of Education Secretary and Gavin should be removed immediately. He is incompetent and has lost trust with all in education.",
