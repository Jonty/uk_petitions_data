        "additional_details": "By having Emancipation Day as a British holiday it will provide awareness and celebration to the historic events which freed slaves. \r\nAs Britons were at the forefront of the slave trade, it is only right to acknowledge the emancipation of slaves in our nation. \r\nSmall reparations have been made from the atrocity that was the slave trade, though many business, people and families have benefitted up until recent years. One day of the year will help repay those lost.",
        "background": "National bank holiday in remembrance of emancipation day 1833 and the end of the of the apprenticeships that kept free labour legal 1838. It\u2019s imperative to recognise historic events with a national holiday as the government recognised the historic debt/reparations which paid slave owners until 2015",
