        "additional_details": "This would ease the pressure and stress of students making their overall mental health better, in addition students would have a more balanced workload allowing them to exercise, socialise and pick up hobbies and volunteering roles improving their physical health and contribution to society. It is more realistic, and more aligned to the workplace environment and demonstrates more of what students can achieve. It is also a more progressive learning style that can be adaptable to individual needs.",
