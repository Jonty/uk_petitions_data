        "additional_details": "As the infection rate of coronavirus increases in the UK potentially thousands of patients will benefit from adult extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment, normal treatment duration is 5 days but can sometimes be extended to 20-25. Boris Johnson has stated the NHS can have whatever it needs to fight coronavirus so buy more of these machines. Do not put our country in a position where we have to choose who benefits from these machines. All people deserve equal healthcare treatment.",
        "background": "The UK only has 15 beds available for adult extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment at five centres across England.  How can the government not be actively buying addition more ECMO machines? China purchased thousands! Italy is buying more. Mortality rate can be improved with ECMO.",
