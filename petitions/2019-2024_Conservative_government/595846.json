The extra stress this is causing on those who are already vulnerable is crazy and once people have had covid protection, they should be able to return to care homes as normal, without isolation. It is barbaric and defies basic common sense",
        "background": "Scrap the pointless, cruel, futile isolation of vulnerable and older people heading into care homes. Stress and loneliness are already commonplace in such situations and this is only risking affecting older people's physical, mental and emotional health.",
