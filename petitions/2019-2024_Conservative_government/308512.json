But South Korea has shown that 3-8 weeks of suppression can get the virus under control. After that, it\u2019ll be an ongoing \u201cDance\u201d of testing and tracing to keep the virus from breaking out again until effective treatments and vaccinations arrive. A Hammer-and-Dance strategy is the best way to save lives and minimise economic damage.",
