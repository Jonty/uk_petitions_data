People who experience bleeding do not choose to bleed yet still have to pay extortionate prices to prevent the embarrassment of leaking or to feel more comfortable. These products are very pricy and many people are unable to afford these. Therefore sanitary products should be provided for free to those in need. This issue affects people of all genders, everywhere!",
