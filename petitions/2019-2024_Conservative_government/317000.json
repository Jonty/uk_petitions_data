        "additional_details": "Front line staff in hospitals and NHS settings and staff in the private and voluntary sector in care homes and nursing homes put their own health and those of their families at risk for all of us. Many people and businesses will struggle in the aftermath. The Government is in a unique position to ensure that businesses and individuals who have made less of a contribution in proportion to their wealth have the opportunity to show their appreciation to front line workers who benefit us all.",
        "background": "The Government should take action to wholly fund the bonus proactively from Bankers Bonuses and from tax avoidance schemes. This is important given the sacrifices most individuals and businesses have made to support the Governments' strategy.",
