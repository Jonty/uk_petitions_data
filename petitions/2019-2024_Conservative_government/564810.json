        "action": "Give realistic grants to all businesses forced to close for covid restrictions",
        "additional_details": "Businesses are really struggling and the grants given in lockdown 2 were just not enough to pay basic overheads like rent/utilities etc. If they are not kept in line with the 1st grant many small businesses will close forever. These businesses have invested in covid secure measures and are being penalised when there is no proof that any rate rise is because they were open. Remember these small businesses pay full UK tax (unlike Amazon) and without them the economy will not recover.",
        "background": "Give all businesses forced to close during to covid 19 grants that are proportionate to the grants given in lockdown 1 (equivalent of \u00a310000 for 3 months) and not the vastly reduced ones that were given in lockdown 2.",
