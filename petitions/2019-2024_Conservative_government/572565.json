        "additional_details": "Promoting diets that don\u2019t work is incredibly dangerous. It can lead to serious health problems, lack of self esteem and eating disorders. The bombardment of the \u2018perfect body\u2019 is creating an epidemic of mental health problems in young people, with many sufferers of body dysmorphia saying that idealised social media posts fuelled anxiety and self loathing. 1 in 3 people with BDD will attempt to take their life, emphasising the need to crack down on false advertising and protect vulnerable individuals.",
        "background": "Celebrities or influencers should not be allowed to accept payment to promote any type of diet supplement, including skinny teas and diet tablets. Social media sights should completely ban them to assist in the mental and physical health of young followers who look up to these people they follow",
