Parliament provides a range of catering services to Members, House staff, the Press Gallery and a large number of visitors. As a workplace this includes staff canteens that are available for people who work in Parliament. The services aren\u2019t directly subsidised, but they unavoidably come at a cost due to the irregular and unpredictable hours that Parliament works. The service continuously seeks to reduce costs whilst regularly benchmarking their prices with venues outside of Parliament."
