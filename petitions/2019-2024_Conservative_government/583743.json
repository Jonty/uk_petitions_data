        "additional_details": "Franchise soccer is an American abomination that has no place in the U.K. or world of football. Foreign ownership should also be reviewed and the German system of fans owning no less than 51% of a club put in place. We need the legislation to implement the taxation of the clubs who join the ESL to deter them from pursuing this fallacy. If they do they will destroy football in this country and many clubs from the championship downwards will fold. So the tax is essential to small club survival.",
        "background": "Put in place legislation to penalise clubs who join the ESL by firstly relegating them to Divison 2 and then applying a heavy ESL tax on the vast profits that can be recycled into grass roots football and financial support for exisitng lower and non league clubs.",

            "details": "We understand you're concerned about the European Super League. However the relegation and promotion of individual clubs is a matter for the relevant organising bodies, in this case the Football Association, the Premier League and the English Football League, not the UK Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn any case, since you started your petition the Government has made its opposition to the plans clear and all six participating English clubs have withdrawn.\r\n\r\nOn Monday 19 April the Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden MP said that he was appalled by the announcement that a handful of clubs are proposing to form their own breakaway European league, ands said the Government would not hesitate to protect one of our greatest national institutions: football. The Culture Secretary said that the Government would back the football authorities to stop this move, and if the football authorities couldn\u2019t act, the Government would. The Culture Secretary said the Government would \"put everything on the table to prevent this from happening.\" \r\n\r\nYou can read the Culture Secretary's full statement on the European Super League here: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-by-oliver-dowden-on-the-european-super-league \r\n\r\nYou can read a report of the English clubs' withdrawal from the ESL here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/56823501 \r\n\r\nFurther, on 19 April the Government announced a 'Fan-led review of football governance', which will explore ways of improving the governance, ownership and financial sustainability of clubs in English football, building on the strengths of the football pyramid. You can read more about this review here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fan-led-review-of-football-governance  \r\n\r\nYou may wish to sign this petition which calls for a related action: \r\n\r\n'Enforce the \u201c50+1\u201d Rule for professional football club ownership in the UK': https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/583310 "
