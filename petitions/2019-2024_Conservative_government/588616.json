        "additional_details": "Due to restrictions on international travel set by the government either by lockdowns or by the traffic light system which results in the majority of the U.K population being unable to use their passports fully as intended.\r\n\r\nWe understand why these restrictions are put in palace because of Covid-19 but we should be entitled to freely use them for their main purpose which is international travel & if we can't due to current circumstances then we should be reimbursed on validity for time lost.",
        "background": "I want current passport holders who'll renew their passports to be compensated by either adding extended validity on newer passports or prices on renewal to be reduced. This should be based on time which our passports couldn't be used for international travel set on government travel restrictions.",
