        "additional_details": "Exams for GCSE and A-Level students were cancelled in 2020 and replaced with teacher assessments and coursework. This will now also be done for those who would have been sitting exams in 2021. However, there has also been a significant impact on teaching for the current Year 10 and 12 students and so it should be the case that these changes should also apply to 2022 exams and possibly even be permanent.",
        "background": "Students taking GCSEs and A-Levels did not have to sit exams in 2020 and will not have to in 2021 due to Covid-19. As the current Year 10 (GCSE) and Year 12 (A-Level) students have also had their studies impacted, I believe this should extend to at least 2022",
