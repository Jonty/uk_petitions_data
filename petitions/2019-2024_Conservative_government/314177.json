        "additional_details": "Category D prisoners are already being granted home leave to reintegrate into society. Inmates have already gained the utmost trust of the prison system due to good behaviour and their minimal likelihood of reoffending. Home leave and prison visits are currently prohibited, violating prisoner\u2019s rights to maintain family ties. Prisoners still working externally, risking introduction of virus into establishments. Home leave would allow self isolation and enable staff to support high risk prisons.",
        "background": "Grant release on temporary licence to all Category D inmates of victimless crimes. In order to achieve Category D status inmates have already had to prove that they are low risk. Social distancing is impossible in prison conditions. Less staff needed in establishment, reducing risk to them and NHS.",
