        "action": "To ask Her Majesty to withdraw her award of a Knighthood to Tony Blair.",
        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned request the Government to lobby Her Majesty to withdraw the award of Knighthood  given to Tony Blair. Mr. Blair by his wreckers actions has in the past sent our military to war on false pretences. This has resulted in hundreds of men and women losing their lives.\r\nHe was also responsible for the early release of terrorists from jail, letters of pardon/comfort being issued to others on the run. This has resulted in killers not facing justice. He is not worthy of such an award.",
        "background": "The Government should take heed of the feeling of the people in their opposition to this particular award being made to Tony Blair. Almost 1 million have signed another petition, unfortunately it has been set up on the wrong platform.",
