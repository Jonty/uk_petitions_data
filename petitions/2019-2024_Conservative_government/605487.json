England has by far the most expensive tuition fees in the world and while higher education is still accessible to the masses, people from disadvantaged backgrounds are somewhat deterred by the amount that has to be paid. The government thus has to rethink the advantages of charging an extortionate amount of money for tuition",
        "background": "The government and Parliament need to debate on the issue of paying over \u00a39,000 a year for tuition fees. The asymmetrical nature of devolution has meant that Scottish residents can attend university for free, whereas can\u2019t in England. The cost of the fees needs to be either cut on lowered",
