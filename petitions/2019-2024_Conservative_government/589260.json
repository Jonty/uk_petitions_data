        "additional_details": "Bitcoin is now a bona fide foreign currency. Foreign currencies do not, as a general rule, attract capital gains tax in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe humanitarian use of bitcoin to send remittances to people in developing countries, failed states and dictatorships is an important use of crypto that we in the UK should be able to participate in without fear of incurring a tax burden.",
        "background": "As Bitcoin is now legal tender in El Salvador, the UK govt should treat it as a \"foreign currency\" and afford it the same status as all other foreign currencies, like EUR and USD. \r\n\r\nIn particular, returns on Bitcoin (and other cryptoasset) investments should not be subject to capital gains tax.",
