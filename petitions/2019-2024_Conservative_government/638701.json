This included:\r\n\r\no\ta non-consolidated award of 2% of an individual\u2019s salary for 2022-23; and\r\n\r\no\ta one-off NHS \u2018Backlog Bonus\u2019 which recognises the sustained pressure facing the NHS following the pandemic and the extraordinary effort staff have been making to hit backlog recovery targets and meet the Prime Minister\u2019s promise to cut waiting lists. The backlog bonus is worth at least \u00a31,250 per person for somebody working full time but will be determined on (a) how much experience staff have and (b) an individual\u2019s pay band.\r\n \r\nIndependent providers remain free to develop and adapt their own terms and conditions of employment. It is for them to determine what is affordable within the financial model they operate, and how to recoup any additional costs they face.\r\n \r\nWhilst some staff employed by non-NHS organisations are contractually eligible for the payments, it is the independent organisations who are responsible for making them.\r\n\r\nThe department has however listened to concerns around providing the payments in the current economic circumstances and will make funding available, in line with the developed eligibility criteria, to help deliver them, on this occasion. \r\n\r\nThe government has decided to provide additional funding for non-NHS organisations with contracts to deliver NHS services, who employ their staff on dynamically linked Agenda for Change contracts and who meet the eligibility criteria as set out in NHS England\u2019s guidance which will be published in due course. This will ensure hardworking healthcare staff and the organisations they work for are not financially disadvantaged as a result of the NHS pay deal. As a result, eligible staff employed by eligible non-NHS organisations will receive their 2% non-consolidated award and backlog bonus for their efforts during the pandemic.\r\n \r\nOrganisations will be able to apply for the funding and will need to show they have been negatively financially impacted by the pay deal, and that their staff are employed on dynamically linked Agenda for Change contracts.\r\n  \r\nThis scheme will be delivered in conjunction with NHS England, who will soon be releasing guidance on the eligibility criteria for this funding. Once applications have been considered, we will provide funding to eligible organisations at the earliest opportunity. We anticipate the scheme to be completed by the end of the 2023/24 financial year. \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response. The Petitions Committee requested a response which more directly addressed the request of the petition.

The pay offer to Agenda for Change staff, approved by a majority on the NHS Staff Council on 2 May, applied to staff directly employed by an NHS organisation as set out in Annex 1 of the NHS Employers handbook. Therefore, independent providers were not eligible to receive funding for the non-consolidated awards.\nIndependent providers remain free to develop and adapt their own terms and conditions of employment. It is for them to determine what is affordable within the financial model they operate, and how to recoup any additional costs they face. Where independent providers have adopted the same terms and conditions as offered on the Agenda for Change contract, they should review their commissioning contracts to consider whether and how to recover any additional cost pressures they now face.\nMore information, including on eligibility, can be found at: https://www.nhsemployers.org/payofferFAQs.\nDepartment of Health and Social Care\nThis response was given on 26 June 2023.
