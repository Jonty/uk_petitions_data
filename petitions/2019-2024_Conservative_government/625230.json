        "action": "Regulate to allow councils to retain a portion of a new build house money.",
        "additional_details": "This would require legislation to mandate for a proportion of the price paid for a house to be retained by the council responsible for the area where the new houses have been built. With the push for faster development builders can sell off all the houses and start their next projects prior to completion of the earlier one, leaving homeowners waiting long periods of time for their estate to be completed. There is a danger with the current volatility of the economy that the work never gets done.",
        "background": "If councils could retain a portion of a house purchasers money which is only paid to the builder once the whole estate is completed and the streets adopted, then the builder will ensure a timely completion rather than leaving homeowners without proper roads and adequate drainage for long periods.",
