        "additional_details": "The EU and USA have been vaccinating this age group for some time, and the MHRA gave safety approval for UK children in December - but despite this the jab has not yet been made available to all children in the UK.\r\n\r\nOmicron may be more severe than previous variants for children. There have already been many hospitalisations of children with Omicron with an unknown long term health impact. With schools reopening, the inability to access vaccines is placing UK children at unnecessary risk.",
        "background": "We should allow all the children in this age group the chance to be vaccinated as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe vaccine is proven to protect against severe disease, and reduces the chance of long Covid. We need to offer our children a jab so that they are protected and are able to attend school safely.",
