        "additional_details": "Zoos and animal parks in the UK, especially the ZSL zoos, are a vital part of worldwide conservation efforts . They rely on visitor entrance fees to finance their work. Since quarantine was introduced there have been no visitors and therefore no income. It is not possible to furlough many staff - the animals still need to be cared for and fed.\r\nZoos are huge open air sites which easily allow safe social distancing.  Zoos which comply with safety measures should be allowed to re-open immediately.",
        "background": "Allow zoos and animal parks to re-open immediately if they demonstrate that they are complying with the same safe social distancing measures which have been implemented by National Trust parks and gardens and RHS gardens, which have been allowed to re-open.",
