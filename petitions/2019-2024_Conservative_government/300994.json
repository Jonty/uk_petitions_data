        "additional_details": "Currently if a landlord wants to evict a tenant not abiding by the terms of the tenancy an eviction order has to be applied for to the court, this is a lengthy process that incurs legal and rental costs. Even once the eviction notice has been issued and the tenant has not vacated the landlord has to apply for court appointed bailiffs. In the meantime the tenant who has been told to vacate the property by the court is allowed to appeal which delays proceedings even further.",
        "background": "The current law relating to landlords and tenants is too biased. Landlords need to be able to evict tenants quickly and easily for illegal occupation and unpaid rent.",
