This has disheartened many students and these students missed out on the first university didn\u2019t receive the grades that accurately reflected there work ethic.  A computer system does not know each individual student, there circumstances, there knowledge or what there capable of.",
        "background": "I want them to grade students fairly and not based on our backgrounds and past exam results of the college but rather the merit of our hard work and our predictions are a reflection of that. We were marked down if we were from areas in lower backgrounds as that\u2019s what that area would have received.",
