        "additional_details": "The government insists on making holidaymakers pay for \u2018Fit-to-Fly\u2019 PRC and rapid flow tests from private health companies despite making rapid flow tests available for free for the UK public.  It is unfair to charge the UK public wishing to revive the travel industry such high rates. For a family of four travelling to a \u2018green-list\u2019 country it could cost up to \u00a31,000. This makes travel to 'green-list' countries only accessible to the rich.",
        "background": "The cost to travel to and from a \u2018green-list\u2019 country ranges from \u00a390 to \u00a3120 depending on the testing requirements of the country of destination. The government should subsidise this cost partially or entirely to make travel accessible for everyone and support struggling airlines.",
