Would all students be required to have their temperature checked before entering the exam hall, or would they simply be allowed to cross-infect their peers? Is that really what we want? The health and well-being of students should come before exams and therefore, students should be given their predicted grades which at this moment in time is the most accurate and reliable data. This pandemic will not be coming to an end soon which means that postponement would still be very dangerous for the well being of students.",
