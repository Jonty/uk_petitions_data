This is going to result in there being many exams at once and cause underperformance due to many factors, including mitigating factors when applicable. \r\nSome students are disadvantaged with online learning. Some have done mock exams, some have not. However, many are being continuously assessed online which surely provides enough evidence combined with predicted grades and previous work to determine grades.",
