        "additional_details": "Abstention votes are being regularly used support the government while giving the impression that the MP or party is against the government.  This is disingenuous and disenfranchising.\r\n\r\nAn abstention vote is always a vote for, never a vote against - particularly when one party has a working majority. \r\n\r\nMPs are elected to represent their constituents.  MPs are expected to hold, and stand up for, an opinion on an issue.  Using an abstention vote is an abrogation of that responsibility.",
        "background": "Parliament should prohibit the use of abstention votes as these are being misused for party political purposes and not to help support constituents.\r\n\r\nMPs should be required to either vote for or against.  The only exception should be if an MP is too ill to cast a vote or use a proxy (\"Incapable\").",
