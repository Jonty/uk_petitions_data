        "additional_details": "Think about the teens and the adults! Some may be suffering with mental health issues! Some may not be ready to be going back to school because they are still having to put up with their anxiety and depression. Sending them back to school will make their depression worse because of the huge amount of stress. Some may be finding it hard to learn. Putting constant pressure on the teens by sending them back to school could lead to suicide!  Death rates will rise! Children are not ready to go back!!",
        "background": "I think it is the best idea to keep all schools closed. I think this because the young are most likely to spread the virus. If they go back death rates will become higher and the virus will never go away. If we as a country want to be virus-free then it is for the best for schools to be shut down.",
