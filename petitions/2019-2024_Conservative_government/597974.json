        "action": "Stop the government reducing the student loan repayment threshold.",
        "additional_details": "It\u2019s unfair to constantly penalise poor and young people in the bid to try to rectify debts. Education is becoming more and more unattainable for so many people, the fees tripled in 2013, there aren\u2019t nearly enough bursaries to help those who need it and now lowering the threshold to an amount that is in the lowest salary band. This is essentially a tax rise targeted directly at young workers and will prevent people taking the steps into further education.",
        "background": "Prevent the government from reducing the student loan repayment from \u00a327,295 to \u00a323,000 which would cut graduates annual take home by around \u00a3800 per year.",
