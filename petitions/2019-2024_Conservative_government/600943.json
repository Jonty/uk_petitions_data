        "action": "End second jobs for MPs & Ministers, starting from the next general election",
        "additional_details": "People across the UK are fed up of seeing their MPs distracted by lucrative second jobs and advisory roles, rather than viewing being an MP as a full-time job that is well paid (compared to the vast majority) and comes with expenses. If current MPs don\u2019t want to serve their constituents full time, they should step down at the next general election and let someone else do the job. This measure will also help stop conflicts of interest and corruption.",
        "background": "Bring in new standards and / or legislation to prevent sitting MPs and Ministers from having any other paid role outside Parliament. Their primary and sole focus should be serving their constituents and the country. This should begin from the next general election.",
