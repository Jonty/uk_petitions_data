        "additional_details": "More people will listen to parliament or the government , parliament can reach out to bigger more known people to spread the word that animal testing still happens even though it is illegal in the UK. in 2019 more than 3 million animals suffered from experiments. You need 3 licences so you can test on animals but that should be changed to that if u sell cosmetic products you need a licence to prove you do not test on animals",
        "background": "Make it illegal to test products and substances on animals. Innocent animals are being used to test chemicals for cosmetic products which is unnecessary and is killing thousands of animals, companies only test on animals to provide data to protect themselves from being sued by injured people",
