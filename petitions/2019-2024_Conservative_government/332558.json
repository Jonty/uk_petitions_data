        "additional_details": "Nurses are the fuel and oil that keep the big motor of medicine up and running.\r\n\r\n\r\nHundreds of them have died fighting this virus and putting themselves on the line, we all agree that no one was forced to work or stay in the hospital, but think if no one of them showed up.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo please - as a civilian - knowing how much work, time, effort, care and patience they put in their jobs, do grant a significant pay rise to all NHS Nurses of all departments.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson credited the work of NHS Nurses, but failed to mention how their pay has never met the national inflation, especially after this first period of pandemic.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll KEY WORKERS got granted a pay rise BESIDES NURSES, this needs to change, nurses have to be paid rightfully.",
