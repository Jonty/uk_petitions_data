        "additional_details": "It is documented by reliable sources that there are many poor regions of the world that have no vaccines (eg Tribune 18/11/20 & Telegraph 13/01/21). This petition is raised on two counts. Firstly we want to be a generous people who are outward looking, improving the outlook of the recipients and markedly improving the wellbeing of the giver.  Secondly it is clear that the current pandemic, so injurious to society and many individual lives, will not be halted unless the world is vaccinated.",
        "background": "Donate the Covid-19 vaccine to poorer nations where there are little or no welfare resources, in numbers equivalent to the vaccinations delivered in the uk. The people of the UK, who are receiving the vaccinations freely on the NHS, expect their Government to simultaneously donate to poorer regions.",
