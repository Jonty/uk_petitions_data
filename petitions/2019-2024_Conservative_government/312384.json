        "additional_details": "As we now know had the UK closed its doors at the end of 2019 this epidemic could have been completely avoided.  \r\n\r\nNOW the only sure fire way to protect ourselves is to limit all travel into the UK to ONLY returning citizens.\r\n\r\nWe MUST quarantine all returning citizens in allocated hotels for a minimum of 2 weeks unless testing is possible to shorten this duration.\r\n\r\nThis is the only way to ensure a lockdown is worthwhile and UK doesn't relapse.",
        "background": "Clapping for the NHS will not reduce their workload and or protect our family members but this can:\r\n\r\nIn 6 months time a lockdown will have failed if we continue to have flights and ships land in the UK, that are highly likely to have infected travellers onboard! \r\n\r\nCompletely wasted effort!",
