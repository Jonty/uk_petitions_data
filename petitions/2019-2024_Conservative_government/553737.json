        "additional_details": "His comments on live TV interviews since the start of the outbreak have undermined the good work governments and key workers are trying to do by claiming COVID-19 is nothing to fear. His latest comments about how easy it was for President Trump to overcome the virus were nothing short of reckless. His knighthood should be annulled for bringing the honours system into disrepute.",
        "background": "His knighthood should be annulled because of his repeated spreading of misinformation about COVID-19 as documented in myriad tv interviews in the UK and the US. His comments as a man of great influence bring the honours system into disrepute.",
