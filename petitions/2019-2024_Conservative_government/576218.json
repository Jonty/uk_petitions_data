For men and women of faith, standing together praying and seeking God in cities and towns throughout the UK can provide great comfort and relief through God, whether this is covid, broken bones, loss of sight, mental illness, etc. Our religious communities will keep on meeting together to fellowship but we are requesting you to not restrict our outdoor activity. Let\u2019s see how inventive we can be in encouraging love and helping out, not avoiding worshiping together as some do but spurring each other on.",
