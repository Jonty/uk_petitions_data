It is simply moving location of where Parliment actually sits every 2 years. This would not effect dissolved nations powers but rather prove that we are united as a whole.",

You compare this to the rotation of the EU presidency, but that process involves the Presidency of the EU being held by one of the EU's constituent nations, and not the location of the EU changing.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
