        "additional_details": "I just believe that if tighter restrictions are in place at pubs and restaurants and all other aspects of the hospitality sector then why are supermarkets ignored? There are clear issues in most supermarkets e.g too many people in the store at most times of the day making it almost impossible for social distancing to be carried out, make face coverings legal and let stores refuse people entry with no face covering and make supermarkets a safe place rather than a free for all.",
        "background": "I want the government to ensure supermarkets are a safe place to work and shop. Currently they feel like a free for all scenario where numerous people can turn up at once and can stay for as long as they wish. Also social distancing is rarely adhered to.",
