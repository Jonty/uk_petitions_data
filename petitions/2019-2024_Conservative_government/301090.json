It is possible the number of people in this situation has been hugely underestimated as there is evidence that it has already spread into the general population. \r\n\r\nOnly the sickest people will get tested or self report themselves to the hospital as having a suspected case of coronavirus and out of these people, more people are likely to die. This is what the 1% figure is actually relevant to",
