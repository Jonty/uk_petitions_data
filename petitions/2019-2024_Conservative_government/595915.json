        "additional_details": "The govt currently publishes data only on those countries that have moved categories whereas there is no transparency on why other countries are being kept in red/amber lists. It's govt's responsibility to be fully transparent, especially when its decisions are impacting hundreds of British citizens/residents who pay taxes. Either the govt should ban all international travel or at least let its own citizens/residents come back without any hotel quarantine (many countries are already doing it).",
        "background": "The Govt should either make all the data/information/decision criteria on the back of its traffic light system public or finish this altogether. Currently the system is not transparent and amounts to human rights violation. The govt cannot restrict people freedom at its own discretion",
