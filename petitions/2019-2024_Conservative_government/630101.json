        "additional_details": "With the correct training to pupils, their could be less hospital admissions helping the NHS. People could be saved from choking or those who are hurt, the known chest compressions and recovery position would be known. The limitations would also be known to the person helping so they don\u2019t cause harm to themselves. This is a no brainer and the cost that the NHS could save can be put towards training in schools. If the school has a first aider, their would be no extra cost for them to teach it.",
        "background": "Basic Life Support should be taught to children from a young age right through school. This could reduce hospital admissions and save lives. Their is risks in everyday life for everyone, so why shouldn\u2019t we have knowledge of how to possible save a life or at least know the correct ways to try help.",
