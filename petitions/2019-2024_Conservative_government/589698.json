        "additional_details": "Singing is a fundamental way in which Christians worship God. It has been a core element of congregational worship for centuries in the UK, and Christians have been unable to exercise this important expression of their faith for more than a year. There has been no easing of restrictions at all in this regard, whereby restrictions across almost every other sector of society have been eased. This is unfair and unequal, and arguably discriminatory against Christians and people of other faiths.",
