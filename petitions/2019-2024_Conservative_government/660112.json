        "additional_details": "Central government has systematically under funded local highways authorities to the point where they are unable to maintain roads. The government MUST be held to account, they MUST provide protected funds - which cannot be used for any purpose other than high quality, fit for purpose road maintenance and rebuilding - and they MUST fund this by any means necessary. No more foolish talk of tax cuts, no more excuses, no more delay. Systematic underfunding of our road network must end.",
        "background": "Our roads are disintegrating by the hour. Pothole misery is affecting all road users, costing motorists thousands of pounds in damaged vehicles and presenting a genuine threat of injury or death to two-wheeled road users. We need our roads fixed so they are once again fit for purpose.",
