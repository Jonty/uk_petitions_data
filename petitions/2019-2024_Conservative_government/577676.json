        "additional_details": "Many people have not heard of diastasis recti. It is most common during and following pregnancy. Due to ignorance, many are carrying out actions that can make matters worse if they have the condition. If left untreated, it can lead to more severe problems like pelvic floor dysfunction, back pain and poor posture. It should be the GPs duty to inform women about this and do a check during the 6-week postnatal check up.",
        "background": "The government should make it mandatory for GPs to check women for diastasis recti (ab separation) in the six-week postnatal check up. GPs should inform women about this condition as many are unaware of it.",
