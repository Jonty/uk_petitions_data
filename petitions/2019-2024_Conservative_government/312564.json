        "action": "Allow sales employees 80% of total earnings, not just 80% of a low basic salary",
        "additional_details": "Employees who receive commissions as part of their regular income are now faced with being entitled to only 80% of what is often a very low basic salary (sometimes not even minimum wage), rather than taking into account their total earnings, as is being done with other employed workers, and similarly what was later announced for self employed workers. Sales employees pay tax on their commission earnings. Why should they now be told that commissions no longer make up part of their regular income?",
        "background": "Ensure employees that receive commission as part of their income, are entitled to up to 80% of their total income (\u00a32500 max. per month), not just 80% of what is generally a very low basic salary. Please bring the sales industry in-line with other industries being helped during these uncertain times",
