        "additional_details": "The chancellor just announced \u00a330 billion in Coronavirus finding, and yet most of the country's small businesses face ruin under self-isolation, from plumbers to pubs.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to pass some measure that makes the self-isolation period a 'forced closure' in the context of business insurance, back-dated to Boris Johnson's announcement on March 16 2020, so that businesses can safely close their doors without worrying about immediate bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, they lose everything.",
        "background": "Businesses that are forced to close during the Coronavirus social distancing period will not be able to claim insurance for their losses, because the government has not ordered the closures, like other countries have. This will bankrupt thousands of independent businesses. \r\n\r\nSave them, please.",
