In the middle of an ongoing pandemic, they have actively chosen not to negotiate reasonably and have plunged the UK into a cataclysmic double crisis, they have chosen to ensure that businesses face more red tape, that we have to pay more for goods during a time that unemployment is predicted to hit high levels, they have damaged the reputation of the UK.",
        "background": "The Prime Minister and his government launched an entire election campaign on the basis of an \"oven-ready\" deal with the EU which they have failed to deliver, on this premise they have mislead the electorate and have displayed a \"failure of statecraft\" by not ratifying a deal with the EU.",
