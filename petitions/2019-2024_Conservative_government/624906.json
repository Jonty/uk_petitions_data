        "additional_details": "I want Liz Truss to call a General Election. This is because of both her own and her predecessors, inability to lead the nation. Please, out of respect for the British people, call an election. We face a winter of discontent with no contingency provision for energy scarcity. The government will inevitably seek to cut public spending during this most vulnerable time in our recent national history putting an already fragile NHS and social care system at risk of total collapse",
        "background": "The nation has zero confidence in Liz Truss and this Conservative government. The government has almost ruined the nation through thoughtlessly offering the richest minority of our nation massive tax cuts, causing the devaluation of the pound, and seriously harming  the mortgage market.",
