        "additional_details": "There are so many people that are not complying with the lockdown rules (still seeing friends, having BBQs, going for walks or the beach and more) because there are no harsh punishments in place to deter people. \u00a360 (which is reduced to \u00a330 if you pay in 2 weeks) will NOT stop people. Also, there are few teenagers who actually respect the police and see them as authority so bringing in the military to help patrol would hopefully deter people further from venturing outside.",
        "background": "Rather than police just giving warnings and disbanding groups of people, these people should receive an on the spot fine (more than just \u00a360) and to perhaps engage the military to help control the lockdown as they have done in Italy and other countries.",
