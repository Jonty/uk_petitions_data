        "additional_details": "The Gender Recognition Act consultation received 100,000 responses. 70% were in favour of allowing people to self-identify as a man, a woman, or non-binary. This overwhelmingly positive response reflects public opinion. Officials have dismissed the results as having been \"skewed\" by responses from trans rights groups. This wilfully ignores public feedback, as well as silencing the exact demographic that should be making decisions on their own behalf.",
        "background": "The Government has decided to scrap plans to allow individuals to self-identify their gender, despite overwhelming feedback in support of the contrary. We, the undersigned, ask the Government to reverse its decision and to adhere to the responses of the GRA consultation.",
