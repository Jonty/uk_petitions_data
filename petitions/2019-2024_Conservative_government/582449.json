        "action": "Regulate or set a national standard for dog trainers and dog behaviourists.",
        "additional_details": "Currently there is no regulation or set standard for dog trainers and dog behaviourists in the UK, which means that anybody can study a \u00a330 online course and call themselves a dog trainer or behaviourist. Hiring someone who has achieved one of these cheap online courses can be dangerous, as their knowledge base, along with their experience is small. All dog trainers should and must be a member of a reputable organisation, that carry out practical as well as theoretical knowledge assessment.",
        "background": "The dog training and behaviour industry needs a national standard for current and aspiring dog trainers and dog behaviourists. The standard based on a tier system of qualifications, from tier 1 to tier 7 or higher. The tiers should state the level of qualification required for that particular tier.",
