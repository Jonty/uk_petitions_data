Allowing police to focus on more on more harder drugs and more problematic crime. This would reduce unnecessary arrests for cannabis and overall reduce crime levels. Cannabis is less harmful than the already legal drug alcohol which is considered more harmful than any illegal drug. Alcohol also causes more antisocial behaviour more then any other substance yet it\u2019s still legal so it makes no sense to not legalise a drug like cannabis which reduces antisocial behaviour!",
