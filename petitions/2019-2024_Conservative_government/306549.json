        "additional_details": "\u00a394.25 is simply not enough for people to live on in modern Britain. \r\n\r\nWe understand that people must self isolate for the good of public health but financially it's simply not possible for many, under SSP. \r\n\r\nStatutory Sick Pay must be risen to match an employee's full weekly wage or at a rate of the living wage for 37 hours, in the case of those who are self employed/on zero hours contracts.\r\n\r\nThis change absolutely must happen in order to tackle Coronavirus effectively, and must happen now!",
        "background": "Given the unprecedented situation with COVID-19 Coronavirus and the need for people to self isolate for up to 14 days, rapid changes need to be made with regards to Statutory Sick Pay (SSP).\r\n\r\nCurrently, SSP stands at \u00a394.25 a week. This is not good enough and must be raised to a full weeks wage.",
