        "additional_details": "Shoots should be except from closing as shoots that have already put birds to ground and paid for them need to be able to shoot to get paid for the sold days to recoup money to keep the shooting industry alive for the next season. With no support from the Government many shoots will be forced to close next year as they will not be able to afford to put birds down next year or buy feed or pay for ground rent. With out this support the shooting industry as we know it will never recover from this.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to allow Game Shoots to stay open and continue to shoot until the end this season. Shoots can easily maintain social distancing and this is an outside sport. Space and distancing is not an issue.",
