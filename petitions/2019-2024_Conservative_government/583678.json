        "additional_details": "Football is a sport watched by millions of fans across this nation thus those who are responsible for the mass revenue generated (the fans) must have some control over the club's that they support. \r\n\r\nIf we implement the 51% possession rule, it will ensure that private investors are powerless in taking over clubs & enforcing measures which are disagreeable to the fans, thus preventing any incautious decisions which place the value of profit over the supporters and the sport itself.",
        "background": "The Government must ensure that clubs cannot have private ownership that exceeds 49%, while the other 51% retains in the possession of the fans.\r\n\r\nThey must work with clubs to ensure that this happens across all teams in the Premier League as well as lower league teams.",
