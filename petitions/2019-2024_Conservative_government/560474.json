        "additional_details": "Small businesses are the bedrock of our economy. They pay full taxes and employ millions and have been closed again! They need support to survive being forced to close again at, for what is many, the busiest time of year in the pre Christmas rush.  They have paid for stock and have rent, utilities, loan repayments etc to make! They have been offered not much more than 1 third of the support compared to last lockdown and many will not survive! They need government help now!",
        "background": "Small businesses, even though they have taken expensive measures to be covid secure, have been closed again.   Last lockdown they were given \u00a310000 to support them for 3 months and this time it is \u00a31334 for 1 month! This is not adequate! It is the pre Christmas rush.  They need more to survive",
