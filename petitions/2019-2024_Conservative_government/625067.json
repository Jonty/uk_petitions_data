However, if it was a recognised disability, and the employer had a policy in place to recognise the severity of such a condition, it would make women like me feel comfortable in taking days off without feeling guilty. These are conditions that prevent women from being productive in the workplace due to the severity of pain.",
        "background": "I want a menstrual policy to be introduced. Women should be allowed to take a day off when their period is significantly painful and the day should be paid. Period related problems such as dysmenorrhea or endometriosis should be considered disabilities are they affect day-to-day lives.",
