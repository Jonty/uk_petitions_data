        "additional_details": "The current Government Plan will require water companies to take actions in order to tackle storm sewage discharges by 2050, including:\r\nReducing the volume of discharges\r\nTreating sewage before it is discharged\r\nDelivering \u00a356 billion of investment in infrastructure\r\nImprove all overflows discharging into or near designated bathing water, and 75% of overflows discharging to high priority ecological sites, by 2035\r\nEnsure no storm overflows are operating outside of unusually heavy rainfall by 2050",
        "background": "Storm overflows were designed in the Victorian era to be used during extreme weather to prevent sewers becoming overloaded by releasing diluted wastewater into rivers rather than letting it back up into people\u2019s homes. They should all be updated by 2025 (priority areas) and 2030, not 2050!",
