        "additional_details": "Health and social care staff are getting on average \u00a317. 600 per year however other public sector roles with equivalent scope, complexity and accountability pay on average around \u00a324.500 per year, even supermarkets and shops pay more. Health and social care staff are often described as low skilled, however there is a great complexity of the role they are taking on, including supporting with complex medical and behavioural needs, administering medication, GDPR and many more.",
        "background": "Government needs to address the situation in health and social care system and review average wages for support and care workers as they often work on minimum wage, for long hours and get low recognition and this leaves many unfilled vacancies in the sector.",
