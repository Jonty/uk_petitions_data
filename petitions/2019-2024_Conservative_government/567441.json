I hear from my peers and media every day about how the government has forgotten their students. If GCSEs and A-levels are cancelled then on what grounds should Uni exams continue? Students around the country have spoken feelings of abandonment, helplessness and uncertainty as Boris continuously ignores our ask for empathy.",
        "background": "University students have been left with little to no support. With many struggling with mental health or financial situations, it is unfair to expect the high quality of work with the current additional stressors. Exams are cancelled for free education students and paying students are left helpless.",
