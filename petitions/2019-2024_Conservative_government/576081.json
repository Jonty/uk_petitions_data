VAR is destroying the passion, flow and enjoyment of the beautiful game; it prevents fans and players from celebrating goals and causes needless delays in play and does not prevent wrong decisions or lengthy debates around decisions rendering it utterly pointless",
        "background": "The FA persists with VAR, despite the fact that it is destroying football; they refuse to listen to fans, players or managers despite the clear evidence that it does not work and does not prevent incorrect decisions. The government must pressure the FA to scrap it in the public interest",
