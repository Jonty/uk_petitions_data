        "action": "Cease the exportation of British armaments to Saudi Arabia and related coalition",
        "additional_details": "The BBC reports that 80% of the Yemeni population are in need of urgent humanitarian aid. This is a result of a number of factors, but principally the Saudi led blockade, preventing food, fuel, and medical supplies from reaching civilians.\r\nClose to 80% of the UK's weapons exports go to the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia being the World's largest arms importer (gov.uk). Not only is the UK supporting an oppressive regime, but also contributing to one of the World's worst humanitarian crises.",
        "background": "The British government should restrict the supply of weapons to Saudi Arabia and coalition forces for their involvement in blockading Yemen. It is abhorrent that the UK government claims a moral superiority, yet supports oppressive regimes involved in major human rights violations.",
