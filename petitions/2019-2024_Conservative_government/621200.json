        "additional_details": "I fear without action from the goverment that the most vulnerable in society are in servere risk. I fear for people unable to keep themselves warm and those having to decide between heat and food. \r\nWhile the situation is barely manageable right now, how bad will this get. And how far will these Energy giants (that no one alone can stand up to) will do. I truly believe without action from the goverment there will be serious unrest and eventually action from the public.",
        "background": "To adopt a similar policy to the Spanish in which the Govermemt has capped profits of Energy companies in a time of unprecedented increase, the price cap is raised on a whim. This needs to be controlled and regulated and the money reclaimed and returned to helping the people who desperately need it.",
