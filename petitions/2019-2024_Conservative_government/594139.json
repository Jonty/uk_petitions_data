        "additional_details": "Because people have been separated from their families for long enough. It is impossible to go at the moment. As far as mental health is concerned being separated for this length of time is extremely damaging. This is causing irreparable damage to mental health and we will long have to suffer the consequences. The choice to go should be in the hands of the traveller now, not the government. There is no more risk from covid in Turkey than anywhere else. There's no justification for this anymore.",
        "background": "Take Turkey off the red list there is no justification for why this country is still on there. The covid cases and deaths are far less than the UK and now that India has gone on to the amber list, after the devestation we have just witnessed there, how can you defend leaving Turkey on the red list.",
