        "additional_details": "With the utmost urgency the government must inform the public if other dog breeds may be caught up in the xl bully ban, using type and body description alone risks countless dog breeds being caught up in the ban and euthanized. Dog breeds such as the bullmastiff, boerboel, cane corso, presa canario, dogue de bordeux, american bulldog and many others that have similar height, build and muzzle descriptions but completely different personalities should not be included in the XL bully ban.",
        "background": "The impending ban on XL Bullys hasn't set out clear guide lines for which dog breeds will be banned, instead the government has focused on type, this has many dog owners with large, muscular bodies worried their dogs may be banned.",
