        "additional_details": "The high coverage of safe, effective vaccines for the UK population has allowed us to turn a corner in the pandemic, and begin a return to normal. This is not the case in most of the world, particularly LMICs, which are at much lower levels of vaccine coverage. The World Health Organisation states that \u201cthe global picture of access to COVID-19 vaccines is unacceptable.\u201d In this context, \u201cbooster\u201d doses for low-risk adults represents an indefensible form of vaccine hoarding.",
        "background": "The UK Government should postpone vaccine \u201cbooster\u201d doses for low-risk adults until an appreciable proportion of the national vaccine stockpile has been made available to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) for first and second doses.",
