People living in extreme poverty and/or destitution and/or without immigration status in the United Kingdom and/or without access to the NHS are unable to socially isolate as needed, cannot access health care, and income and other social support, and cannot contribute openly and without fear, to making the population as safe as possible, alongside everyone else.",
        "background": "The Government should grant all undocumented migrants in the UK Leave to Remain, as is the case in Portugal. In this way every human, irrespective of their nationality or citizenship can access healthcare, housing, food and the same sources of income as everyone else during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
