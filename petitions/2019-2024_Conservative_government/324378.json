The children are our future, they will shape the world of tomorrow and we need them to grow as well-cultured beings in order to be civilised members of society.",
        "background": "Children deserve to be taught a true depiction of English history because there have been events beyond living memory and historical events that have involved black people. The history curriculum has always focused on white Anglo-Saxons and the bias ingrained in the history needs to be changed.",
