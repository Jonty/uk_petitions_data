        "additional_details": "Petitions after petitions to get the governments attention to deal with low income families who struggle without the free school meals for their children during this pandemic. The day after photographs of the food THEY have supplied is unacceptable for a young child to eat for TEN days. Giving vouchers of the so said \u00a330 would benefit low income families more than the pathetic amount the government has been supplying for our children.",
        "background": "It\u2019s appalling of what the government has supplied for children to eat in ten days. The petty portions of food, the half peppers and onions, the small sandwich bags of pasta and rice. A parent could get so much more for \u00a330 to fend for in ten days.",
