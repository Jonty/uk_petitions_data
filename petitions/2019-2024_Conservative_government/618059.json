I believe there may be a chance of support higher up in the government and hopefully it could be noticed. Everyone struggles and it really needs to be addressed before more paying parents take there lives too",

So many paying parents have battled mental health due to this including myself. There should be a fixed sum as we end up paying more then when we were in the relationship",
