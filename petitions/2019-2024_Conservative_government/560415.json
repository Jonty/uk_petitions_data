        "additional_details": "Banning commercial fishing in coastal seas has been shown to be an effective way to protect wildlife and improve trade. Protecting the eco systems in coastal seas with no-fishing zones allows the wildlife population to recover, this leads to a higher fish population in areas where commercial fishing is permitted, which protects the fishing trade. As David Attenborough has stated, this could be the key to protecting both humanity and nature. No fishing zones Should be legally protected under 'Attenborough's Law'.",
        "background": "Create zones in which fishing is illegal in at least one third of the UK's coastal seas. Protect these areas under a law to be named Attenborough's Law.",
