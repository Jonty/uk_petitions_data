        "action": "Extend the Manchester Metrolink times past 23:30 to allow people to get home.",
        "additional_details": "I would like the government to fund more trams for the Metrolink to have a tram that runs past midnight, possibly two trams that run at midnight and half past to allow people to get home that don't drive or aren't in the position to drive from alcohol, I work in Manchester and cannot work past 11pm as I would then be stuck in Manchester meaning a tram running till 00:30 back to Rochdale would benefit so many people.",
        "background": "The Metrolink in Manchester back to Rochdale only runs till 23:30 or 23:45 on weekends and its a struggle to get home after that back to Oldham or Rochdale so a 00:00 and 00:30 tram would really benefit people.",
