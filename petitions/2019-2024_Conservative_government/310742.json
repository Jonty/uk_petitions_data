        "additional_details": "These unsung heroes are overlooked so many times doing the amazing jobs they do 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. \r\nDoctors, nurses, radiographers, porters, cleaners and many other NHS staff are going to work everyday knowing that they are putting their lives at significant risk. These brave soldiers of health were conscripted purely because of their vocation to help others. \r\nI urge the Government to create a new Queen's Medal of Courage for NHS workers who are bravely fighting on the front line.",
        "background": "Hundreds of thousands of brave men and women are fighting an invisible war to save not only the lives of the entire population, but to save the United Kingdom from a viral enemy.\r\nThis is the first time in national peacetime that war is being fought where people are putting their lives before ours.",
