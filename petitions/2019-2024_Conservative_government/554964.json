This is another example of broadcasters and football clubs overcharging people and being greedy. The fact that fans in the current climate and Covid pandemic have to pay additional fees on top of already extortionate subscription fees is abhorrent. The government needs to step in and regulate how football matches are viewed with a fair pay system to do so.",
