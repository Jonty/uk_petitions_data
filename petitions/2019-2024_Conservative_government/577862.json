        "additional_details": "Parliament is the vital part of the British Democratic institution.It must be restored to it's full function as a matter of urgency.If there is not enough space (for safety reasons or social distancing rules to be obliged,which are very strangely applied even for vaccinated  and immunised people),another venue must be used to enable sessions of Parliament to be fully attended by MPs.All  MPs should be asked to get vaccinated against Covid (and Flu) with their consent.",
        "background": "For the last 12 months apparently there were no full Parliamentary sessions for the social distancing and safety reasons .Now ,with several  Covid vaccines in hand,MPs can vaccinate and gather together ,like in good old times.That will restore British Parliamentary Democracy.",
