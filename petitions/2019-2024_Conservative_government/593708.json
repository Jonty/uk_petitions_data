        "additional_details": "China is fully responsible for the COVID crisis yet they are denying it was anything to do with them and they have yet to make any moves towards making amends for the crisis which they have inflicted upon the world. They are also aggressive human rights violators and international law flouters. See for instance their action towards Taiwan, India, the Uighurs and also their attitude towards western nations. It's time to say enough is enough and punish them for their behaviour.",
