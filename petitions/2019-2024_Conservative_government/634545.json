Many people struggle with this addiction thinking that they can win big on the games that they play. for example people who paly blackjack on a regular basis can lose up to \u00a32020 per year and someone that plays poker can lose up to \u00a31000 per year. We hope to change government legislation on this matter and for the Advertising Standards Authority to reduce these adverts",

This can really damage a persons life in many different way such as family life, mental health or physical health. This is why these ads need to go",
