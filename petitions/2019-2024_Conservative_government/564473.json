        "additional_details": "This year has been hard for the British public and many sacrifices have already been made. Those in public sector jobs risked their health over and over again this year and I believe they deserve to be able to celebrate Christmas with their families.  On Christmas day most will be working 12 hour shifts and will not be able to celebrate and given that the decision was made so close to Christmas it has made it impossible for employers to change shifts to allow everyone to celebrate.",
        "background": "I would like the government to review the Christmas Covid Restrictions taking into consideration public sector workers who are working Christmas day to be allowed to celebrate with family on boxing day.",
