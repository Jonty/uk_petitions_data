        "additional_details": "Prostate cancer is like many forms of cancer more easily treated / cured if it is caught early. The symptoms however are not always obvious and can easily be thought to be similar to a bladder infection or just a symptom of \u201cgetting older\u201d\r\nI myself had only minor symptoms and my health was good overall and delayed taking the matter further until it was clear an infection was not clearing up.\r\nI like many then discovered that a diagnosis of prostate cancer was at more advanced stage and had likely been present for a number of years before presenting.",
        "background": "Make routine PSA checks for prostate cancer as part of the NHS health screening for men in the same manner as smear testing and breast screening for women.",
