UN Secretary-General Guterres says: 'Scientific advances are reducing technical barriers which ... limited the potential of biological weapons.' Now more than ever, the public will welcome a bold initiative to revitalise the Biological Weapons Convention, making it \u2013 at long last \u2013 the instrument for securing permanent abolition of all biological weapons.",
