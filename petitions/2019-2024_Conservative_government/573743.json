        "additional_details": "Increasing funding to the NHS\u2019 gender clinic services may help in bringing the widely feared waiting times, allowing more transgender people to access consultation appointments and treatments. Because of the waiting lists many trans individuals are being pushed into accessing private treatment out of desperation, this can be very expensive, and not affordable for some people, but seems like the only way for many trans individuals at the moment considering the awful NHS waiting times.",
        "background": "At the moment, the UK\u2019s NHS Gender Identity Clinic services are appalling, trans youth and adults are waiting an average of 2 years just for an appointment after being referred, this is unacceptable and puts many trans people at risk due to being unable to access treatment.",
