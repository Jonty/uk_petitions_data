        "additional_details": "Fireworks can be fun, when handled appropriately. However every year too many of us suffer awfully due to them being set off at anti-social times, night after night, and/or in an anti-social and dangerous manner. Our sleep is disturbed and our safety threatened. Many people (eg. survivors of war or other violence) are re-traumatised, anxious humans and pets are scared, wildlife are disturbed or even injured/killed. Humans are injured every year, with life-changing injuries and cost to the NHS.",
        "background": "Local councils should be empowered to grant (and rescind) licenses for any community group or organisation wishing to buy fireworks for a safe community fireworks display.\r\nNobody without such a license should be able to buy or use fireworks at any time.",
