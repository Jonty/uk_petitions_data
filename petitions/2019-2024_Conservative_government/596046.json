We as a country can get better in the rankings as there will be more places to practice. It will bring more awareness to the public to try a sport they may have been interested in but couldn\u2019t due to being no baseball fields in a park to play unless you join a team.Baseball equipment & clothing is available in the Uk so why not the fields in local parks.",
