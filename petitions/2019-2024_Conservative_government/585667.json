        "action": "Remove the 'temporary' traffic lights at the Parkway Station rail bridge",
        "additional_details": "The traffic coming into Stoke Gifford has become unbearable and made it impossible to access the Ratcliffe Drive / Sandringham Road /North Road areas as traffic is backed up to Aviva in one direction and Winterbourne Road in the other. The problem is further worsened by the ongoing road closure at Gipsy Patch Lane railway bridge.\r\nAlthough the lights were provided to widen the pedestrian/cyclist access, the fact that the space is part road and part pavement makes it difficult to use as a cyclist and the current pollution levels must surely be offsetting any benefit.",
        "background": "Please remove these lights and temporary road narrowing as soon as possible as they are stopping residents accessing their own homes and are increasing local pollution levels.",
