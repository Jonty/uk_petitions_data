        "additional_details": "There simply isnt any legislation in place for those who cannot get out without their transport. People who cannot use public transport due to anxieity and people who isolate due to reasons other than covid19 and need their own vehicle so they can still get to shops when they are quiet and doctors n hospital appointments.\r\nWithout goverment help these people are left alone and completely unable to access food and services without transport and there is no service available to fill the gap",
        "background": "My proposal is to ask the goverment to extend cbt licence validity for those who are reliant on their vehicles for essentials and are due to expire, untill after lockdown. or allow resits for those who are reliant on their vehicle for travel. To allow them to access essential services",
