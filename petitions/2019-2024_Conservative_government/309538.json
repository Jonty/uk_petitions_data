Loans are not an option for most self-employed people as most of them are already in a lot of dept and can not afford to take on any more loans. The government need to offer grants and other non-repayable financial support to the self-employed or they will not have a business or career by the end of this pandemic. The lockdown may be temporary but this will have permanent effects on the self-employed.",

They need to ensure that all self-employed people are able to get by during this pandemic and national UK lockdown. The government are not offering the self-employed enough support right now.",
