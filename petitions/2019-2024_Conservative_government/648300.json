        "additional_details": "I want the government to be able to do this because I believe that we have no capability to defend ourselves anymore and as a country we still need that security as there is a constant threat of war with this day and age and the research that is getting put into things our Challenger two tanks can't do anything most of them are now useless our Navy is shrinking very fast and we need a 10 times better Air Force because we just don't have the capabilities like we did anymore.",
        "background": "I think that us giving away all of our military equipment to Ukraine is bad. I do not agree with what Russia is doing but at this point we have stocked Ukraine so full of supplies we can't even defend ourselves anymore so I want the government to increase the military spending budget further.",
