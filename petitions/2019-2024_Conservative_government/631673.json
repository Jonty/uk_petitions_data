With heat pumps that drops to 40C, so tepid showers & increased risk of Legionnaires\u2019 Disease, plus radiators feel tepid.",

We also couldn't publish a petition that made unsubstantiated claims that heat pumps increase the risk of legionella, or that the Government is introducing requirements for underfloor heating.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
