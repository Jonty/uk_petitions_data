        "additional_details": "The Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) expansion is testimony to an incumbent Mayor or London pushing forward with a hugely expensive project. If, the Greater London Assembly Conservative Group (GLACG) are to be believed, the Mayor is doing this without consultation of the London Assembly itself - let alone the people of London. \r\n\r\nWhether, or not one agrees with the ULEZ expansion or not: Whether, or not one supports the work of the GLACG: it is patently clear that the Mayor is abusing his power.",
