Many consultants simply do not have the time to do this. The government shouldn\u2019t be expecting consultants to have to do this when CEV parents already have proof through previous shielding letters and correspondence. These letters can be given in as evidence to employers to show that these parents should not work so surely schools can accept these also?",
