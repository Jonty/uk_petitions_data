With a median salary of \u00a331,461 across the UK's 24,000,000 workforce, a 0.2% NI increase (14% rate) would generate approximately \u00a343.92 per worker and a total of about \u00a31B in revenue. The would allow the country to give these 948,177 Doctors, Other Clinical Staff & Support to Clinical Staff and extra \u00a31,000 each in their salary to say 'Thank You'. There should be enough money generated to also cover Scotland, Wales & Nothern Ireland.",
