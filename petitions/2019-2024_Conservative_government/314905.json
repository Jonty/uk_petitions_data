At this time the deceased only form part of a daily statistic included in briefings from the government and families cannot properly grieve due to the restrictions in place to mitigate the spread of the disease.\r\n\r\nBy having a day of mourning this will enable us as a nation to come together to support those who have tragically lost someone and also reflect on the impact this has had on our way of life.",
