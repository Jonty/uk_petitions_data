How many children do you know who are being denied access to CAHMS etc for their additional, educational and psychological needs as they don\u2019t qualify & told they are on a waiting list like it is some kind of privilege? Why aren\u2019t the NHS, via CAHMS/CYPS not recognising children need help now not in 2, 3, 4 years? What is it going to take to recognise that GP practises need more rights to enable more to be done to help our children?",
