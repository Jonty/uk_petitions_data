        "additional_details": "Areas of the country are becoming inaccessible to locals to buy or rent, holiday towns are depleted of local people living and working there and property prices and development are driven by an ever increasing push to own second homes for profit or individual privilege to own their own part of a holiday destination. While the people living there are driven out by ever increasing prices to buy or rent. This also occurs in cities eg London where property is used as an investment and left empty.",
        "background": "Many areas of the country are becoming unavailable to locals to buy or rent due to second home ownership; airbnb and other. I want legislation passed to enforce all homes to be registered as primary residence or second home on council list and limited percentage to a low maximum amount eg 10%.",
