        "additional_details": "This will allow students to have more time to revise as many of us are unable to at home due to covid 19 measures and the home environment can be very distracting and unsuitable. On top of this the way some of us are being taught online is inadequate as we do not all learn the same way. Some are visual some are auditory and some are dexterous meaning if these exams take place it would be very unfair for a lot of students. Another reason is many students don't have the proper facilities at home to revise and prepare for exams and as this is a time that is unprecedented especially with everything going on and worrying about our elders it is unfair to strain us more with exams and course work.",
        "background": "We would like the government to allow all university's to post post all final year exams and allow 1st and 2nd years to progress based  on they're grades throughout the study of that year with the option to sit exams at the start of september as an option for students unsatisfied.",
