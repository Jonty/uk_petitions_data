        "additional_details": "I feel as a member of the public that we are very vulnerable to danger and can\u2019t always rely on the proper authorities to save us, handguns could and would have prevented multiple dangers in our country and possibly stopped many attacks and murders, the public have been left defenders against crime and bad people and solely rely on the authorities, this I feel needs to be changed just as the world is changing and is ever more a very dangerous place.",
        "background": "The government should relax gun laws and offer a pass/fail course on how to safely and properly own and conceal a handgun for personal protection to the public advising they complete an interview and mental health evaluation.",
