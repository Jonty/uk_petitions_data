        "additional_details": "Too many failed relationships/marriages end with one party having full control over the children and not allowing the other side to have access for no other reason than to cause said other party pain. This IS child abuse. No child should have to go without their mother/father for no other reason than pettiness. It affects the parent, but it could affect the children so much more. People kill themselves over not being able to see their kids every day, and who knows the effect on the children.",
        "background": "I would like for it to be completely illegal for one parent after a break up to hold custody of the children and deny access for no other reason than to cause the other parent pain. It hurts the children just as much as the other parent, and it should be a prosecutable offence. It is child abuse.",
