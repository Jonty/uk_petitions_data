        "additional_details": "Many people who don't have cards and only carry cash, find it difficult or embarrassing when they are refused service from retailers  on buying goods or from food establishments.  A lot of elderly and others who are not good with technology systems. Or have memory disabilities struggle in situations. In some cases being told card only. Yet there are times when the card machines have stopped working.  And businesses lose out. But if they could take cash . Then they wouldn't lose out. Makes sense",
        "background": "For the elderly and others who want to pay by cash and not by card. Due to not having a card or problems with remembering their pin no, and knowing what they have to spend from their account. For all retailers to be made to offer both options on paying for goods compulsory.",
