        "additional_details": "Previous cohorts taking exams during COVID have endured immense stress through exams cancellations and uncertainty over fair grades.  Now is the time students sitting exams in 2022 are beginning to face similar struggles.  It is unfair to expect students to sit exams as time is lost in years 10 and 12 missing valuable face-to-face teaching. It is unreasonable to adopt a 'catch-up attitude', adding to their mental burden. Use this experience to act now and change to fairer marking schemes.",
        "background": "Changes must be made NOW to 2022 examinations to ensure students in years 10 and 13 are treated fairly to receive their deserved grades. A disjointed start to studies, limited face-to-face teaching and mental stress on these children is detrimental. Change the system now to support our young people.",
