I do not underestimate the seriousness of coronavirus but I can\u2019t see the justification for the heartbreak and devastation lockdown is causing. SAGE has no virologist or epidemiologist, mathematic modelling is being for this decision. The figure of 4000 deaths a day is questionable, cases are rising at 6% per week, how can it be 4000 daily deaths unless the virus mutates.",
