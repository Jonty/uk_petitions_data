        "additional_details": "The hitting of children (by anyone, as teachers hitting children was outlawed years ago, including their family) must be legally banned.\r\nIn the news this year, there has been a wave of child deaths following the abuse they faced from their parents/guardians becoming fatal. Banning all physical abuse could protect these children and save young lives. Hitting adults is assault and is illegal, so why are children exempt? Child abuse is wrong and so, penalties could include fines or prison time.",
        "background": "Scotland (2020) and Wales (2022) have both already banned the smacking of children, making it illegal for anyone to hit a child. Hitting can be very traumatic for children, whether it is done with hands or objects, and it is neither a humane nor effective form of discipline, so it should be banned.",
