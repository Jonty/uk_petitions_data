        "additional_details": "The government was created for the best interest of the people not for those who want to take power and freedom away from individuals. If people refuse to take a stand their will be no freedom left. It is not fair that we have been refused the rights to see our family the rights to where you can and can\u2019t go this is dangerous for everyone\u2019s mental health. The economy is shrinking the country is falling. It is wrong and unlawful to bring such laws which restrict liberty lockdown must end.",
