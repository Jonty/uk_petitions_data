        "action": "Make GCSE\u2019s more about the skill of that subject rather than the memory of it.",
        "additional_details": "Because it can show work places and collages about their skill in the chosen field rather than what they have read about in books and have copied down from a whiteboard for the last 5 years they have spent in secondary school, we should be preparing everyone for real life situations rather than writing down notes e.g. geography, you write down you\u2019re answers down on a piece of paper about your KNOWLEDGE and not you\u2019re UNDERSTANDING of the subject (you could make a fake situation to be worked on)",
        "background": "Many people would like the GCSE system to change as it tests people on their memory and not their practical skill as lots of people find it difficult to understand the subject without properly implementing every aspect about it into the exam rather than one part of it like usual tests.",
