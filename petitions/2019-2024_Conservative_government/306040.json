        "additional_details": "Because of the mass social distancing measures put in place, the nature of the epidemic, and in some cases the dark side of society expressed, I feel like the nation should have a day to remind ourselves that we as humans can get through anything, and that we are all there for each other in times of harshness and need. The community spirit will need re-invigorating no doubt, and I feel like a day to promote exactly that with disregard to any other social pressure  will do the job just fine.",
        "background": "Arrange a day, when safe, for a full day where no one has to work, school, or anything of the similar. Just to celebrate life and our survival in general. I believe we will beat Covid-19, so this belief should be celebrated once it becomes reality.",
