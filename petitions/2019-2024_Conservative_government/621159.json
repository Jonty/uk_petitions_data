        "additional_details": "H&R Insurance is mandatory for last mile delivery work. These two changes would:\r\n- make delivery workers job more efficient\r\n- improves economy for all relevant parties\r\n- reduce traffic \r\n- improves health and safety (hot food order arrives faster to customer)\r\n- reduces confrontations with Civil Enforcement Officers and public members\r\n- reduce fraudulent behaviour because many gig workers aren't working with correct insurance.",
        "background": "1) Change the use of Loading Bay law that H&R policy holders would be allowed to use them too. \r\n2) Consider H&R insurance holders as Taxis, or \"Authorized Vehicles\" so they can use dedicated roads \r\n\r\nCivil Enforment Officers and ANPR system could have access to insurance database to check drivers",
