This makes the tubes highly sensitive, so they temporarily narrow and COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, that reaches into your respiratory tract, which includes your lungs.\r\n\r\nTwo medical conditions which affect the lungs but the government think asthma has no impact on surviving covid. Every year asthmatics are given the flu vaccine as they are considered at high risk, so why is Covid different?",
        "background": "The change in those considered clinically vulnerable now includes only those considered as having \u201csevere asthma\u201d. It fails to acknowledge asthmatics who spend years controlling their asthma to avoid being severe. The vaccine should be offered to all asthmatics who take asthma related medicines.",
