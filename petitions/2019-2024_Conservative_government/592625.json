        "additional_details": "As we know, young people like myself are wanting to socialize, get back to school safely and experience life. However, with restrictions being lifted and us having no protection against COVID along with the rise of the Delta variant, teenagers and young people are now extremely susceptible to Long COVID, the effects of we still don't really know. In America, they have started the rollout for all over 12s. This may seem like an entitled young person, but I'm not selfish, I am scared.",
        "background": "Currently, all over 18s have been offered a first vaccine, and many of them are taking it. This is a great step. However, GCSE and A-Level students who go back to school in September, are still at risk. And are the ones wanting to socialize. So we should start the vaccine rollout for teenagers .",
