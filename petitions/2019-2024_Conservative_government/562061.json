        "action": "Forgive students' maintenance loan for 2020/21",
        "additional_details": "Students' welfare and mental health was compromised by the Government in favour of the revenue of fees and rent. Students were lied to about the reality of returning to university and were left isolated. If no action is taken, the biggest killer of students will not be Covid, it will be the declining mental health resulting from the abandonment of students. It is only fair that they remedy this situation by forgiving the maintenance loans and taking action where their words have failed.",
        "background": "The Government misled students into returning to university, and as a result millions took out maintenance loans to pay for tenancies that they are locked into and do not want. Students should not have to bear this cost as a loan and so the maintenance loans issued this year should be forgiven.",
