        "additional_details": "Having experienced the same educational challenges as our peers in the 2020 and 2021 cohort, it comes as a surprise to many in the 2022 cohort that our exam results should be pegged lower than those in previous years. Furthermore, the delay in this announcement has added to concerns, as this has not left many young people suitable time to reassess their post-16 options should they not receive the grades they hoped for. We urge Parliament to review this issue to put these young people at ease.",
        "background": "Young people that sat their GCSE and A Level (and equivalent) exams in 2022 have experienced a tumultuous educational journey over the past 2 years. Unfortunately, it has been announced that exam results for GCSEs and A Levels taken in 2022 will be \u2018substantially lower\u2019 than in previous years.",
