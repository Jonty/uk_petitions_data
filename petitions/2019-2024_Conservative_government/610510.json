        "additional_details": "As there is going to be a price increase starting April, its only fair that they get a pay increase. The money a self employed driver gets weekly or monthly goes straight to expenses for the van and leaves the drivers with bare minimum, on average \u00a362 a day that's \u00a31,240 a month and that's to the nearest figure, working 5 days, just allowing a driver to bring home enough for bills. People expect the drivers to do everything they say not knowing they have to deliver on average 180 parcels a day.",
        "background": "I know a delivery driver. Whether that's an increase pay, the full amount for fuel given back to the drivers not just a percentage or even they van hire price they have to pay weekly or monthly. Once a driver pays all expenses, they have none for themselves.",
