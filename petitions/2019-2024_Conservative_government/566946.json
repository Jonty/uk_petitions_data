        "additional_details": "Due to the close proximity and childcare tasks, Early Years workers are placed under immense exposure to Covid-19. When every other education setting has closed, other than for vulnerable and key children, there is no reason why Early Years settings should not be treated the same. Whilst the positive development of children is of paramount importance, this should not be at the detriment of Early Years workers mental and physical health.",
        "background": "Whilst schools, colleges and universities have closed during the national lockdown, Early Years should not be made to remain open! Early Years workers are not immune from this virus and deserve the same treatment as any other education setting.",
