        "additional_details": "about preserving the environment with respect. As a result, when people do ignore the current law & wild camp, they have no concept of what to do & sometimes leave litter. Outdoor enthusiasts are put off by fear of 'getting into trouble' leaving our green places the domain of those who don't care about the law. This is unjust. Current legislation prevents the people who could & would have a positive, voluntary impact on the environment from enjoying it. Current legislation needs to be changed.",
        "background": "The law should be made similar to the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 covering open land & national parks in England & Wales. Wild campers are not a threat to our national parks & open spaces. Current legislation is ineffective & stops teachers & leaders educating the young",
