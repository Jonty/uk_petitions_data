This is causing indeterminate waiting periods in the countries adjoining the Ukraine border (Poland, Slovakia, Moldova, Romania). If you allowed refugees who have family or friends in the UK, to travel having only completed a PLF, then when they are in the UK, the visa application process could be commenced, but you would have details of where they are.",
