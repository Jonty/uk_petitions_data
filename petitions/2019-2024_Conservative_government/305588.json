        "additional_details": "Alternative medicine is still considered outside the scope of traditional health care, many insurance companies do not cover these visits or offer limited and restricted coverage which excludes a vast number of treatments, including almost all of natural medicine. The fear of going bankrupt often forces patients to undergo treatments which are covered but are known not to be effective such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, often doing more harm than good or cause devastating disease relapses.",
        "background": "Push insurance companies to include alternative treatments as part of covered oncology care. They currently have a vested interest in only covering conventional treatments being the largest investors in pharmaceutical companies. This directly impacts people\u2019s choice of treatments and healing success",
