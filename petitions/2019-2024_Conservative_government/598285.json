        "additional_details": "At the moment, if you are caught littering the penalty amount is currently \u00a3150 which has to be paid within 14 days from the issue date. Unfortunately, this just isn\u2019t enough. There should be heftier fines if you are caught littering. These laws would almost definitely have a massive impact on our streets positively. Only last week did I see 5 people litter in front of my very eyes in a matter of 2 minutes, and most of these were plastics, which is damaging the environment even further.",
        "background": "We want the government to require that if someone is caught littering more than 3 times they must do community service, to pick up litter. We are also asking that schools educate children about littering so they too are aware of the situation and consequences.",
