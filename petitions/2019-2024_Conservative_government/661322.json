        "additional_details": "I want the government to have control on the rules and laws around setting up social media accounts as by making it mandatory for ID to be provided, this will crack down on fake profiles and trolls which will then crack down on online bullying, hate speech, setting up of fake profiles, fraud accounts and hacking techniques. If we can make this UK law I believe other countries which soon follow this stance.",
