        "additional_details": "The issue of forced-to-penetrate has been studied by researchers. See report here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-49057533\r\n\r\nBecause forced-to-penetrate is not classified as rape, this means rape of a male victim by a woman is, in effect, decriminalized under UK law. Those those who commit this crime are not held to account. \r\n\r\nIt is important that a society not excuse rape; should hold rapists to account; and rape victims not be blamed. Yet current legislation does this to men who are raped.",
        "background": "Under the UK legislation (Sexual Offences Act 2003), if a woman subjects a man to coercive sexual intercourse by what is known as \"forced-to-penetrate\", this is not classified, under law, as rape. However, it is rape: its method is the same as rape and its outcome for the victim is the same.",
