Right now we really need to stay in to reduce COVID-19 transmission, we cant socialise as usual.  \r\n\r\nThe fortunate among us who have internet are making the most of video-calling to stay in touch, and it makes such a difference!\r\n\r\nWe need to extend this to the less fortunate, and quickly.  People will donate old computers.  Internet may help adherence to social distancing.  It will improve mental wellbeing.",
        "background": "People on low incomes without internet access will be more adversely affected by not going out or meeting people because of COVID-19.  The government should work with network providers to quickly give free internet access so that people can access family and professional support via video calls.",
