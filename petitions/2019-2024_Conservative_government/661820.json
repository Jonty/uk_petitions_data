        "additional_details": "Since Ukraine has restricted the right of Ukrainians to receive Consular services abroad, and for many of them has made them possible only in Ukraine, this poses a threat to safety and life not only for men of certain age categories, but to the majority of Ukrainians in general. As UK policy has been and remains fair, consistent and most humane, by granting Ukrainians any of the above statuses, the UK will confirm that it remains a benchmark state where human rights are of the highest value.",
        "background": "Provide Ukrainians on Ukrainian Visa Schemes with either humanitarian protection or any alternative status leading to Indefinite Leave to Remain to protect their rights and fundamental freedoms in the UK, enabling them to remain here permanently regardless of the timing of the Russian-Ukrainian war.",
