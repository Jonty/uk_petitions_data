We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nImpeachment still technically exists as a Parliamentary privilege. However, it is now considered obsolete in light of constitutional changes and developments in how Parliament scrutinises Ministers. See:\r\nhttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7612/\r\n\r\nWe think you want Parliament to consider whether it can still use impeachment as a means to censure Ministers, but it's not clear what change you want to come about as a result of this debate.\r\n\r\nIn any case, impeachment of a Minister would be a matter for Parliament, and not an action that could be started by public petition. We can't accept petitions about honours or appointments, which includes calling for Ministers or MPs to be sacked, resign, or to be subject to a recall vote or a vote of no confidence."
