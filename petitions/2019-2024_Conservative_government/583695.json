Making it hard for people new to the roads to identify lanes, directions, junctions and no overtaking markings etc. These need replacing as they're extremely dangerous for us unfamiliar with the roads. I'd like to give examples however this problem occurs almost everywhere I have been. I'd appreciate if this was something that  could be arranged.",
