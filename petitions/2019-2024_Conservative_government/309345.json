Boredom is never a valid excuse to pose a threat of infection to the public. Stores should be cordoning off the majorities of the inside of their stores and only allowing the purchase of necessary and vital products such as piping and plumbing accessories in the case of an emergency.",

Hardware and DIY stores should be almost all cordoned off, with customers being allowed to ask for specific essential items instead of wandering round looking for that perfect plant or paint.",
