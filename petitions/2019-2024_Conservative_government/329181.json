        "additional_details": "The money generated from Carbon Tax would pay the COVID 19 debt mountain and transform to a green economy, revenue to be split 50/50. \r\n\r\nMeasures implemented might be to encourage more home working to reduce commuting, which produces Carbon Dioxide, give everyone a free bike to encourage more cycling, give every house with a roof free solar panels and battery storage.  \r\n\r\nA refurbishments & building programme of energy-efficient homes and infrastructure could be used to kick start the economy.",
        "background": "A Carbon Tax applied to products & services that release carbon dioxide in their production, use, or disposal. Things that might be low in Carbon Tax would be electric cars or local grown fruit & veg. Gas guzzling cars or processed meat products with plastic packaging would cost a little more.",
