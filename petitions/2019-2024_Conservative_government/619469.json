For larger families this cost is even higher. For low income families this is unsustainable and seemingly unnecessary.",
        "background": "Branded school uniforms are often compulsory and very expensive. With the cost of living crisis schools should allow non-branded uniforms which are much cheaper to assist lower income families.",
