        "additional_details": "The current fine of \u00a360 is a \"bank breaker\" to people who are struggling to make ends meet and need their cars for work. The LEZ and ULEZ schemes were not intended for this purpose. \u00a312.50-\u00a315.00 is a cost that will push people to look for an alternative without putting them in financial burden. Especially when it racks up as simple as entering at 2200 and leaving at 0100 you are charged \u00a3120 for passing through a city.",
        "background": "I want the fine for vehicles that do not meet ULEZ and LEZ standards to be lowered. The scheme should not be a shake down on people who cannot afford new cars or vans.",
