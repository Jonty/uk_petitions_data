        "additional_details": "The excessive buying of necessities such as food and sanitary products in the wake of the Cobos-19 pandemic has left supermarket shelves barren across the nation. \r\nWe have a duty to care for the vulnerable in society, those financially less fortunate and the elderly to name, who rely on access to cheap products to survive. \r\nThe hoarding of these items in a time of pandemic is unjust. A legal penalty whilst WHO recognise the outbreak as a pandemic is to act as a deterrent for hoarding supplies.",
