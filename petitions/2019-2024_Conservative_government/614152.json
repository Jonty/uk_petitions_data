Schools must ensure that they comply with the relevant provisions of the Equality Act 2010, under which sexual orientation and gender reassignment are amongst the protected characteristics\".\r\n\r\nAt Primary level, schools are required to teach about sexuality in the context of family structures, specifically pupils are expected to learn \"that others\u2019 families, either in school or in the wider world, sometimes look different from their family, but that they should respect those differences and know that other children\u2019s families are also characterised by love and care\".\r\n\r\nThe RSE curriculum also states that \"sexual orientation and gender identity should be explored at a timely point and in a clear, sensitive and respectful manner\" at secondary level, and that the Government expects \"all pupils to have been taught LGBT content at a timely point\".\r\n\r\nYou can find out more here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/908013/Relationships_Education__Relationships_and_Sex_Education__RSE__and_Health_Education.pdf.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for changes to the national curriculum in respect of LGBT+ content, but you would need to be clear what changes you want to be made."
