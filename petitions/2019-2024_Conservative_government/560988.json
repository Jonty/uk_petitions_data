        "additional_details": "Air pollution is the biggest environmental cause of poor health. Up to 1,200 deaths each year in Greater Manchester are contributed to by poor air quality, which is likely to be increased by Covid-19. \r\nLIDL are proposing to build a new supermarket at Mocha Parade, Salford.  Two years ago they built a store in Malmesbury in Wiltshire with a living green roof.  Unless the government introduces legislation, LIDL and their competitors will not do the same in Salford or elsewhere.",
        "background": "Government should introduce legislation requiring all new-build supermarkets to be built with a living green roof.  These help lower the supermarket\u2019s carbon footprint, increase its energy efficiency, reduce surface run-off following rain and improve overall air quality for the community.",
