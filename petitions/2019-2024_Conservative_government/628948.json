        "additional_details": "Animals endure filthy and cruel living conditions in cages on factory farms, or equally cruel conditions on non-factory farms, painful mutilations, forcible impregnation, having their beloved babies taken away from them, hormone injections, unhealthy weight gain, and then electric stunning, gassing or shooting before slaughter at just a small fraction of their natural lifespan. \r\n Animal agriculture is also ruining our planet!\r\n It\u2019s time to put an end to animal agriculture and fishing!",
        "background": "Each year, 6.4 billion animals are killed and eaten by Britons. The slaughter of animals is the biggest massacre in history, and it\u2019s happening right now.\r\n More and more Britons are going vegan. A switch to veganism for the UK could spare animals and help stop the climate crisis. It\u2019s not too late!",

It's therefore not clear if you just want UK agriculture and fishing to be banned, or for all animal products to be banned in the UK.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
