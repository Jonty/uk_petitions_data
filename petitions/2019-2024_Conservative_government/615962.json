Only those that are very affluent can successfully purchase a property.  The high living costs and tax on hard earned money for middle to lower class individuals, makes it an unfair disadvantage.  The vast majority of the younger generation are unable to get onto the property ladder due to the lack of control in the house prices, and this problem will continue to spiral further.",
