        "additional_details": "The conduct of Special Advisers to Government Ministers has often provoked controversy, particularly as they often wield power and influence, and are unelected. \r\n\r\nThey are appointed without any form of scrutiny meaning that unsuitable candidates may be appointed, and there is no means of ongoing scrutiny of their actions meaning there is effectively no means of holding them accountable for their actions. \r\n\r\nThis is unacceptable in a modern democracy and should be changed.",
        "background": "The appointment of Special Advisers to Government Ministers should be scrutinised by  parliamentary committe that has the power to approve or reject any particular appointment. In addition parliament should have the power to review such appointments on a periodic basis and revoke them.",
