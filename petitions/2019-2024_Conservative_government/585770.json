        "additional_details": "There are several problems with doing this:\r\n\r\n-displaying calories can be extremely triggering for people with eating disorders who are trying to recover.\r\n-it can make people become obsessed with calorie counting (lead to an eating disorder)\r\n-it shows the government's lack of education surrounding causes of obesity. People do not overweight because of lack of understanding of calories, atleast speak to an expert in eating problems (a psychologist)\r\n-People overeat as a coping mechanism",
        "background": "I want the government to not make it mandatory for big hospitality firms to put calories on their menus.\r\n\r\n1.25 million people in the UK have an eating disorder and it is the mental health issue that leads to the most deaths. I have nearly been a part of that statistic.",
