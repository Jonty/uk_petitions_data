        "additional_details": "I believe quite simply that every child deserves a fair start in life, and punishing them for circumstances outside of their control is immensely inhumane.  The main goal of me making this petition is to get the free school meals back for the poor kids who need it.  However if the government insists on taking these away the very least they can do is not effectively accept free meals for themselves.",
        "background": "With the shocking realisation of so many MPs voting to abolish free school meals it only seems fair that MPs food and drinks expenses are also not covered.  If this is the way parliament is looking to save money they need to look at themselves as well.",
