        "additional_details": "Covid-19 has created a hostile environment for those suffering from an eating disorder. 1.25 million people in the UK have their lives controlled by counting calories that would only be heightened by this change, so this policy is most certainly not a \u201cfair deal\u201d for everyone.  We should be making life more accessible and less triggering for this not-so-small minority as to not increase the rate of the mental health issue with the highest mortality rate in the country. Weight does not equal health",
        "background": "The Government needs to rethink and remove the policy to add calories on menus to make \u201cmore informed choices\u201d. This could trigger those with an eating disorder and could cause more eating disorders in maybe the most vulnerable generation around the country, the kids we are trying to protect",
