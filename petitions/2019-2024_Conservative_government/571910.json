        "additional_details": "The impact of keeping children at home - on their education, their social wellbeing, their mental health, their very futures - is unconscionable and unacceptable.\r\n\r\nThroughout history - across all nations and cultures, in spite of wars, pandemics and global crises \u2013 children are put first and the importance of protecting them is unquestioned. \r\n\r\nTo now be compromising our children's future in the 21st century \u2013 with all our scientific, social and technological advances and capabilities \u2013 is fundamentally wrong and will have deep and lasting repercussions for the next generation.",
        "background": "Children of all ages need to be in school. \r\n\r\nVaccinate teachers. Implement testing in schools. Shield the vulnerable. Whatever it takes. Set out a road map for the return to normality.\r\n\r\nThis cannot go on any longer.",
