        "additional_details": "By introducing something like a fact checker it shows a reliability that is now being challenged. I understand that it could be difficult to enforce on private media such as Sky but by ordering the BBC a public funded media outlet other organisations would have no choice but to follow or lose customers if found to be false. The system works on Facebook and other platforms and will go along way to reinstalling trust",
        "background": "Freedom of the press is an important cornerstone of our democracy. However it seems increasingly they have taken one side over an other. I am asking that the press are forced to show a fact checker to show a balanced argument in things like statistics rather than driving their own agenda.",
