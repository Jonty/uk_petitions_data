The Government is also not responsible for introducing names such as \"the Great\". That would be a decision for the current Monarch. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, we could accept a petition calling on the Government to introduce a bank holiday in celebration of Queen Elizabeth II or to provide funding for certain activities and events, if that's something that you'd like to see.
