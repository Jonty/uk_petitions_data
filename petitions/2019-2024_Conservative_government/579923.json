        "action": "Allow both same sex parents names on children's birth certificate.",
        "additional_details": "The rules of marriage before conception need to be removed to allow same sex families the same right and equality of that of heterosexual parents. I have been with my partner 17 years and used the same donor for each of our children but have been denied my name on their birth certificate each time. Same sex families deserve the same rights as heterosexual parents and changes must happen in order for families to be equally accepted and recognised as a family unit.",
        "background": "The government should allow same sex parents the same right to put both parent's names on their child's birth certificate. The current rules state same sex couples must be married before conception for this right, however, any man can be added at any point without proof of being the child's parent.",
