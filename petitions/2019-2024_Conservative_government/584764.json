This triage is conducted by the reception staff who are not medically trained and are hopefully bound by privacy rules\r\n\r\nThe system being adopted by the NHS is deeply flawed and extremely unpopular and has been sneaked in under cover of the Covid 19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nThis policy should be reversed immediately for the good health of the taxpayers of this nation.",
