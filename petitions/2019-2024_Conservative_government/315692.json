This is just after the Government said that supplies of PPE were plentiful, and that equipment was flowing out to trusts. No doctor, nurse or care worker should ever have to be in harm\u2019s way when they go to work, and in these unprecedented times, this has never been more important.",

There should have better forward planning and its not right for Government to warn NHS staff against the overuse of PPE.",
