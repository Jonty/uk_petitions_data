        "additional_details": "Tattoo parlours/studios have been ruled out for reopening on July 4th. The UK has over 3000 tattoo studios which may contain 3+ artists per studio. That's roughly 9000 artists (no doubt more) waiting to return to work. Tattoo parlours practice hygiene measures and sterilisation procedures on a daily basis. Covid-19 will only increase how sterile these businesses will be. Many artists fail to see how hairdressers, barbers, restaurants and pubs have the go ahead to open yet they do not.",
