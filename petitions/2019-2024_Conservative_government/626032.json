        "additional_details": "The current Conservative government has completely lost its way and the recent dismissals, resignations and disputes within the party mean they are unfit to run this country anymore. Any effort made by the current government to introduce a new leader would be unconstitutional, undemocratic and an embarrassment to the UK and democratic power in the eyes of the world. The UK public did not vote for this, and a General Election must be held.",
        "background": "HRH King Charles has the power to dissolve parliament, and, although this is traditionally done under instruction from the Prime minister, on this occasion this power should be exercised independently to force a general election. Parliament should vote or encourage HRH to do this.",
