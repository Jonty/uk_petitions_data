        "additional_details": "Every year people have to make the heart breaking decision to give up their beloved pets just because landlords are bias stating they cause damage and fleas. My own pets are very healthy and taken care of and we have had no incidents. And loads of other people are just the same as me. But landlords never listen to us. They don\u2019t appreciate our family pets! Pets are people like us and they are our family. If we can keep children, why can\u2019t we keep our pets? This rule needs to be stopped and fast!",
        "background": "The no pet rule for cats and dogs etc is absolutely cruel and ridiculous in rental homes. So many people struggle with finding new homes because of bias landlords saying \u201cNo Pets\u201d.  This rule needs to be completely scrapped and let all animal lovers keep their companions.",
