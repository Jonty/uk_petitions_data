        "action": "Heal racial divisions and defend our history by protecting our statutes.",
        "additional_details": "To many the toppling of our statues without democratic process is anti-patriotic and may harden racial divisions e.g. hate crime reports skyrocketed after Colston's statue was toppled in Bristol.\r\n\r\nOur statues memorialise historic moments some by those with now outdated values. However, without them we wouldn't live in a free society with slavery abolished. Which of your values will be outdated in the future? Leaving them in place prompts open conversations whilst celebrating our shared history.",
        "background": "Give all UK statues legal protection from removal from their original location without referendum, backdated to March 2020. Not restoring our damaged public property to its original setting is creating a dangerous precedent which could be used by other more extreme organisations, e.g. the far right.",
