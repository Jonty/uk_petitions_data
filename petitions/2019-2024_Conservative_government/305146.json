        "additional_details": "Although the Bank of England has reduced its base rate, and government are offering a 3 month payment holiday. By freezing rates of interest on borrowing, many people will resort to using credit cards. The Interest rates are high (e.g. 30%) and this will cripple families that cannot afford to buy essentials/pay for items during times of hardship. \r\nThis will have a knock-on effect to recovery after the crisis has stabilised.",
        "background": "Ensure that Banks and Credit companies freeze interest on borrowing for the foreseeable future until things stabilise.",
