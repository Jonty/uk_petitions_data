        "additional_details": "The extent of the rollout of the vaccine programme means that a large majority of adults in the UK have now had the vaccine. Science suggests that the virus caused by Covid 19 is not mortally dangerous to children and yet we continue to disrupt their education. I ask for parity with large events and to allow children from a bubble where a positive case has been identified, to be able to resume face to face education on presentation of a negative PCR test or agreement to undertake daily LFTs.",
        "background": "We are living in perverse times where our children are unable to resume their education on presentation of a negative PCR test, and yet thousands of people can gather to spectate at sporting events.",
