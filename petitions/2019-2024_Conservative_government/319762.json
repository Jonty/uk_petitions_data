        "additional_details": "For the sake of current and future generations, we have to be more responsible in our use of resources. Energy from Waste (EfW) has only minor benefits - producing fuel - as against major deficits - waste of resources and increased pollution. A linear economy uses increasing amounts of virgin resources which is unsustainable. Recycling is still underutilized. An ESC would be a sustainable economy going forward into the future. This is based on research from the University of Leeds.",
        "background": "Up to 99% of goods end up in landfills or are burned to produce fuel (EfW) within 6 months of purchase. This is both inherently wasteful and bad for the planet. An SCE makes better use of resources than our current linear economy, prevents waste and pollution, and provides employment in recycling.",
