        "additional_details": "As key workers, we are exposed to this more compared to everyone else.\r\nIt is highly irresponsible to keep the nurseries open to the general public when schools etc are having to close down. We understand that we play a big role in the lives of families all over the country, but we too have responsibilities that we need to consider and need the government to take into consideration.\r\nThe government needs to revisit their stance and keep nurseries openly available only to children of key workers.",
        "background": "As the government is introducing a new national lockdown, Boris Johnson has exclaimed that nurseries will be open as per usual for all children. We understand that nurseries need to stay open, but they should stay open only for the children of Key Workers as opposed to the general public.",
