        "additional_details": "Due to COVID-19, year 11 students have missed out on being taught up to half of their courses in person, which they are then expected to learn online, where it has proved learning is not as effective.\r\nThe government has already decided that they are cancelling the 2021 series of exams for current year 11 students undertaking the GCSE, and give them grades predicted by their teachers who know them and their abilities. IGCSE students should be given the same opportunity.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
        "background": "The government needs to cancel iGCSE\u2019s along with GCSE\u2019s to prevent inequality amongst results. To make the 2021 results fair to all students, everyone in the UK should undergo the same testing as each other.",
