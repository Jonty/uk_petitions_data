        "action": "Legalise cannabis, so that the industry can replace jobs lost due to COVID-19",
        "additional_details": "The economic damage from COVID-19 will be devastating for the British economy. By legalising cannabis the government will be ending a failed war on drugs that has wasted tax payers money. Whilst instead allowing individuals who have lost their job due to COVID, to again work. This will not only mitigate the damage done to the economy, but will infact boost the economy through extra jobs and decrease unemployment. This has been seen across multiple states in America since legalisation.",
        "background": "To consider potentially legalising cannabis in an effort to boost the british economy and replace the jobs lost due to COVID-19. This can easily be accomodated through proper planning, funding and taxation that will see a 'kickstart' of the economy as seen in Colarado (US).",
