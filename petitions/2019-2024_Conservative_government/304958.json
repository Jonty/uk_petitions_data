        "action": "Protect the childcare sector and nurseries during the coronavirus outbreak.",
        "additional_details": "Many parents depend on nurseries and with nurseries facing the prospect of long closures parents are being asked to foot huge childcare bills at a time when they are unable to work as they have to care for their children. This is particularly an issue for low paid and self employed parents and single parents who are less able to work with their children at home.\r\nI am asking the government to cover nurseries costs while they close to protect the sector and prevent job losses.",
        "background": "I want the government to provide financial support to nurseries and childcare providers if they are forced to close by the coronavirus outbreak. I note that other industries such as airlines are being promised support and would like reassurance from the government that this will extend to nurseries.",
