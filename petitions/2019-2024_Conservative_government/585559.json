        "additional_details": "I would like this to happen as many people in the UK (and other countries) suffer very badly from Emetophobia. There is nothing worse than sitting in a cinema constantly on edge incase a vomit scene comes up, it can make people have panic attacks and it puts many people off visiting the cinema etc, as they can find it extremely unsettling. There is evidence proving that over 5.5 million children and adults in the United Kingdom suffer from Emetophobia.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to make it essential that Vomit/Sick warnings are added to Movies and TV shows, they could add this beside the \u201ccontains violence, graphic content etc\u201d area, they should add this at the beginning to make people aware that it also contains vomit scenes if appropriate.",
