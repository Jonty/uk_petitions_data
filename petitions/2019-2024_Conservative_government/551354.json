Buses become packed during work and school times, so hows that following the rules.\r\n\r\nWhat I want from everyone, is to vote for this petition to go through, as we want schools, stores, restaurants and pubs to close down because without closing schools, stores etc, the corona cases will drastically increase.",
        "background": "The days I've taken my brother to school, I've found out that social distancing does not exist. When it's time to take your kids to school and collect them, there is no social distancing between parents on the playground, everyone is crowded despite the fact theres an increase in Corona cases.\u00a0",
