It is now well understood that hunger directly leads to poor physical and mental health issues. Continuing malnutrition also ensures that these children are doomed to underperform at all levels versus their well fed peers.  \r\nIf we help the children first, we should naturally be encouraged to continue the fight to end all food poverty.",
        "background": "End UK child hunger within the lifetime of this current parliament.\r\nBy changing government policies that directly result in child hunger. Primarily, these are free school meals and universal credit policies.",
