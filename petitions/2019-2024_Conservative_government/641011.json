        "additional_details": "There are around 10 million dog owners in the UK. They face severe restrictions on travelling with their pets, as the UK is just one of three countries banning dogs travelling with their owners in aeroplane cabins, regardless of vaccination status and safety certificates.\r\n\r\nWe call for this ban to be lifted -  provided all necessary safety requirements are met - both those imposed by the airline and those relating to pets vaccinations.",
        "background": "The UK, Iceland and the Arab Emirates are the only countries to ban pets flying with their owners in the cabin of passenger airplanes. We would like to see this ban lifted in line with the majority of countries.",
