        "action": "Stop the government displaying calorie amounts on food in restaurants",
        "additional_details": "This policy will have a negative impact on those who have eating disorders in which calorie counting can be a huge factor in their development and maintenance. This will only add further issues to those who have or have had an eating disorder and could stop them from feeling comfortable to eat at restaurants. The government should increase funding to eating disorder treatments and use education whereby those from low economic backgrounds are prioritised to help tackle issues with obesity.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson has suggested that as a part of a plan to combat obesity that the government introduce legislation to force restaurants and other food outlets to display food calorie values on their menus. This should be stopped as it will have a detrimental effect on those who have eating disorders",
