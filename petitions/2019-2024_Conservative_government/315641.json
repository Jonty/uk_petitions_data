        "additional_details": "We need to submerse the UK in to a cryogenic type state until a vaccine is readily available to use. Why is this so? Unfortunately no matter what type of program we follow the virus is unlikely to just go away. There is the constant threat that the virus will take a hold again or indeed re-infect those who have already suffered from it. Unless we can be confident that we can go about our everyday lives, that key word \u201cCONFIDENCE\u201d will prevent us from recovering.",
        "background": "If the Gov 100% underwrote peoples livelihoods based upon their earnings over the past 3 years there will be no need for the public to venture out to spread the virus. Not company profits, just incomes. We mothball non-essential businesses and only keep the \u201cESSENTIAL\u201d businesses functioning.",
