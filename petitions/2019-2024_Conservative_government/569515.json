        "additional_details": "Its unfair for a levels exam to be cancelled and not btec vocational exam in May 2021 as theyre both equivalent courses with equal exams and as they have all been equally disrupted with covid and lockdown and many people have missed the majority of exam content due to this so it would be unfair for them to have to sit the exams. Btec exams should be easier to cancel as they have coursework and clear evidence of their grade to be graded on unlike a levels and it won\u2019t be safe to sit exams in May",
