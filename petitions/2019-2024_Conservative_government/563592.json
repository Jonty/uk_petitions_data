        "additional_details": "Students had to travel to university in September, for something they could have done at home. Within a month of term starting, everyone was shut in their rooms due to the lockdowns. Consequently, many students returned home but are still paying 1000s of pounds for rooms they don\u2019t reside in. We urge the government to imply a force majeure clause in the contracts that allows us to cancel our contracts in these extraordinary conditions and ease the financial pressure on us, by providing refunds.",
        "background": "Universities asked students to return to campus in September as in-person teaching would be conducted wherever possible. However, most students simply sat in their halls and studied online. For this, they have signed 44/51-week contracts which they can\u2019t opt out of. Help us cancel these contracts.",
