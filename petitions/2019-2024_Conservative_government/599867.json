        "additional_details": "Different rates of pay for different ages is discriminatory. It is set regardless of the job someone does or the experience they may have showing the ageism that our government holds. Im sure that they will say that businesses are welcome to pay their employees as much as they want but that would be avoiding the issue all together (which we all know they\u2019re very good at!).\r\nBoth the Minimum and the Living wage are hardly liveable as it is, but let\u2019s at least give everyone a fair chance.",
        "background": "Currently the National Living Wage is set to rise, giving over 23 yr olds a payrise. However, all under 23\u2019s will be missing out on this opportunity purely due to their age. The Minimum Wage should be scrapped and the Living Wage should encompass everyone of school leavers age or older.",
