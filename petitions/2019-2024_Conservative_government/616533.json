The courts have powers to make a \u201crestraining order\u201d that forbid someone convicted of certain offences from pursuing further conduct against the victim (or any other person named in the order) which amounts to harassment, or will cause a fear of violence. Similar provisions exist in Australia.\r\n\r\nBreaching a restraining order is a criminal offence, and decisions about investigating and prosecuting alleged restraining order breaches are a matter for the police and Crown Prosecution Service.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for changes to legislation enabling restraining orders to made, but it would need to be clear how you wanted this legislation to be changed."
