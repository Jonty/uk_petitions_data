        "additional_details": "In September 2020 the government removed the right to compensation for the covid vaccine yet at the same they are full on promoting the vaccine safe. If it\u2019s safe why the need to remove the ability to receive compensations. \r\n\r\nAs this vaccine is new and untrusted by many then the government and the pharmaceuticals need to be responsible for the vaccine and accept liability for any proven damages claim for injury. It is also right that there should be no limit for damages claims.",
        "background": "The government is promoting the uptake of the covid 19 vaccines being made available. They are constantly reminding people how safe these vaccines will be yet they have withdrawn the ability of those injured to received any compensation.",
