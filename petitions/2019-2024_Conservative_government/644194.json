There needs to be a responsible owner who can provide the correct training and enrichment for these beautiful dogs. And putting a stop to backyard breeding will help this. Backyard breeders don\u2019t care who they sell their animals too, they just care about the money. We need to stop these people from irresponsibly breeding these gentle creatures and throwing them into horrible home. Registering breeders will prevent this.",
        "background": "Banning XL bully\u2019s will not stop dog attacks. Irresponsible dog owners will just find another powerful dog breed to use. It\u2019s time to blame bad humans, not the breed. I own a Rottweiler, whilst it\u2019s not the same breed he\u2019s still a powerful dog. And I fear that one day his breed could be next.",
