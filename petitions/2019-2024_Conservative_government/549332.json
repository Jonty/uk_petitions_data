        "additional_details": "Because the country had a serious problem and no one seems to care, you give pedophiles a slap on the wrist but drug dealers 10+ years, how on earth did you work that out? Surely destroying children\u2019s lives or at least having the intent to do so is much worse than someone selling drugs, the system is a joke, to say you\u2019re in on it would be a conspiracy but it doesn\u2019t seem so far out.",
        "background": "For too long you\u2019ve stood by and spared these monsters from jail, even the elite are riddled with them, increase sentencing to 10 years minimum with no chance of early release and no sparring them because they wouldn\u2019t survive,",
