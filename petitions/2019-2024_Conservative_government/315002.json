We have lost doctors and several nurses and this number is only going to continue to rise. These brave individuals are also putting their families at risk by providing our essential services as well as working long hours. Their bravery and the dangerous situation they are constantly in should be reflected in their pay.",

This is exactly the time for our NHS workers to get a pay rise instead of the MPs working from home.",
