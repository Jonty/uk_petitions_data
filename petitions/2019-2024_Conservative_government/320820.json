        "additional_details": "I wish the government to do this because the country faces huge and unanticipated costs as a result of the steps that have been necessary to support businesses and individuals through the Coronavirus emergency. At this time spending needs to be prioritised even more carefully than is usually the case. I have no doubt that most of the country do not regard HS2 as a priority in comparison with the cost of supporting the NHS, individuals and businesses adversely affected by Coronavirus.",
        "background": "Put the HS2 project on hold until the cost of dealing with the Coronavirus emergency has been calculated, and a plan has been made to finance it. As the UK embarks upon a struggle to finance the huge and unanticipated consequences of Coronavirus, HS2 is quite clearly no longer a first priority.",
