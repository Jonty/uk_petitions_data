The only aspects in their manifesto were tougher sentencing for serious crimes and greater police powers for the policing of traveller sites. We did NOT agree to curtail our right to protest, we did NOT agree to be arrested for being \"annoying\", and we did not agree that the Home Secretary should be able to decide when someone is too noisy!",
        "background": "The Home Secretary claims that the 'Police, Crime, Sentencing & Courts Bill' is a manifesto policy which therefore automatically has public assent. However much of this bill was NOT in the conservative manifesto on which they were elected, and therefore these aspects should immediately be removed.",
