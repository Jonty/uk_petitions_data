        "additional_details": "It is inhumane being locked up 23 hours a day with no access to courses, classes and other things set to bring about rehabilitation. Also the lack of human contact is detrimental to mental health as its the lack of visits. Some have had none in 7 months and this adversely affects family relationships and has caused parents to lose contact with their children. Purple visits are unsatisfactory they cut out all the time. Please reduce sentances or you'll have a mental health crisis in prisons.",
        "background": "Take into consideration that prisoners are having harder sentances due to covid 19. All prisoners should have their sentances reduced by a set percentage due to covid 19. More prisoners to be released on tag for minor crimes. Those with longer sentances get a percentage off because of covid 19.",
