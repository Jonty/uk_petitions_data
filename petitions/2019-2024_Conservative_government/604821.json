        "additional_details": "Many packagings are either \"not yet recycled\" or \"only recylable at large supermarkets\". Action needs to be made to stop single use packaging in everyday domestic products that aren't recyclable. Recycling must be accessible from the home for every recyclable product to reduce landfill. Recycling is important to buffer environmental impacts and needs to be acted upon quickly as a step in long-term sustainability, whilst greater and more direct changes are made. Let's protect the UK environment!",
        "background": "Plastic packaging should be recyclable and  recyclable in all locations by funding more recycling bins. It should be possible to recycle ALL plastic packaging with home recycling bins. Greener alternatives should be encouraged with greater incentives/disincentives for businesses e.g. greater tax.",
