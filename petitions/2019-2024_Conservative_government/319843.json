        "additional_details": "These are challenging and unprecedented times. The Government response to the Coronavirus pandemic is inadequate with the highest record of COVID19 related deaths in Europe to date. \r\n\r\nThe oversight commission will establish the means of gaining cross-party support, with the collective responsibility of Parliament and not the Government alone. All outcomes need to be public through a mandate of complete transparency, scrutiny of past and present decisions leading to a public inquiry.",
        "background": "Public trust in the UK Government is at risk requiring intervention to maintain the integrity of Parliament. An independent and public oversight commission needs to be established, with a mandate to guide decision making and report outcomes to the public.",
