        "action": "Provide boats for migrants to safely cross the Channel & shelter on arrival.",
        "additional_details": "It has been reported that in 2020 so far almost 4000 people have crossed the Channel illegally, using at least 300 small boats. Since 1999, almost 300 asylum seekers have died, including small children & babies. Regardless of the UK's policy on immigration, it's clear that these people feel there is no alternative and will continue to attempt this dangerous crossing, risking their lives. We must recognise that we have a duty to protect these vulnerable people.",
        "background": "The government should be providing a safe route for migrants and asylum seekers who are attempting to cross the English Channel from France due to persecution in their home countries. Migrants should be offered safe passage and given shelter upon arrival so that they may complete their application.",
