        "additional_details": "I feel that cannabis should be legalised as it has scientifically been proven that the drug is safer than lots of other drugs like alcohol which is in fact legal although is 114 times worse. You guys have also stated that legalising weed would make it more appealing and seem like it is safe to do for young people, but this opinion is in fact wrong as since weed has been legalised in Colorado it has actually dropped in the number of young people smoking it.",
