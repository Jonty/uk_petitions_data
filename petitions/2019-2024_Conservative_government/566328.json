        "additional_details": "Last year GCSEs and A-levels were cancelled but students had leant all the content they needed and were basically exam ready. This year student have been through 3 lockdowns, missed countless months of education and what seems to be a simple decision for the government they are completely discarding the comments of teachers and stressed students and insisting exams will go ahead. Its time the English government do something like wales and allow teacher based grades to make sure it is fair.",
        "background": "Student in year 11 and 13 who are scheduled to take exams are facing huge pressure and stress to cover all the content before the exams. Its time the Prime minister and his cabinet listen to the suggestions and voices of the pupils and teachers in his country and stop making knee jerk decisions",
