        "additional_details": "In countries that have instituted deposit return schemes, the rate of returns is circa 90%. In spite of kerbside collection schemes in the UK. Much of the huge amounts of litter collected by volunteer litter pickers is made up of recyclable containers. There are few areas that are not littered at some point by containers thrown where they can not be retrieved. \r\nThe well meaning fines imposed by the 1990 EPA are ineffective in the vast majority of cases. The creation of a financial incentive not to litter is needed.",
        "background": "Reduce the amount of discarded containers which are littering many areas in the UK in spite of the provision for fines imposed by the 1990 environmental protection act.",
