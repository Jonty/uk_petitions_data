        "additional_details": "It is unfair that students are paying full price for tuition fees when students either cannot attend their university or are confined to halls in isolation. Students are unable to receive the full amenities available to them. Office hours are mostly cancelled. Lectures are cancelled. Libraries are not available. Seminars are reduced. This is a breach of university standards that hasn't been addressed. This has to stop. It would be amazing for the mental health of all students in the UK.",
        "background": "I would like the government to postpone all student tuition fees until the Covid 19 pandemic has ended.",
