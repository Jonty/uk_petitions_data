        "additional_details": "I'd love for the government or parliament to give us more time at least! Most of us have children, Christmas is coming up, New years coming up and you've dumped all this stress on us this close to Christmas it's ridiculous. Dogs are our family members or as I said they are my children, there's no way in hell they are going anywhere but we can't all afford all this money for neutering and exemptions etc this close to christmas and new year. GIVE US MORE TIME PLEASEE",
        "background": "We aren't asking for you to stop the ban because we know your minds are already made up but all we are asking is for you to give us all more time. You don't actually understand the stress, the worry, the anxiety and the depression this is putting most of us XL bully owners in.",
