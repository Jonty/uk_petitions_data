        "additional_details": "We are trying to promote clinicians and nurses with advanced roles into careers in general practice due to an ageing work force within primary care, yet we do not offer them the same entitlements they would get if working in the secondary care sector; maternity pay, sick pay, pension scheme etc. It is down to the partners and the agreed contract, yet as GP surgeries are small businesses, surgeries are often left out of pocket if they provide basic human rights such as maternity pay.",
        "background": "I would like the government to consider the rights of nurses working in general practice so they fall in line with the entitlements offered under the Agenda for Change scheme:\r\n8 weeks *\u2018full pay\u2019 including Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)\r\n18 weeks 'half pay', plus SMP\r\n13 weeks SMP \r\n13 weeks unpaid.",
