        "additional_details": "I am tired of politically and personally motivated individuals using the media to deliberately mislead the public and skew debate. This has been brought in to sharp focus by Trump in the USA, misinformation about Covid in the UK and the growth of the fake news industry. If individuals and media platforms (social and mainstream) faced substantial fines, we would restore order to debate and protect democracy.",
        "background": "We need to combat fake news so political and social commentators need to face consequences in terms of substantial fines for disseminating false and misleading information in the media. Fines should also apply to the producers of media that carry this misleading content.",
