        "action": "Change Covid-19 guidance to permit corporate sung worship in church services",
        "additional_details": "Corporate sung worship is a vital part of Church services. Christians are currently unable to fully exercise their human right (article 9) to manifest their religion because of Covid-19 restrictions. They prevent  full participation in worship, are not in line with recent research and are disproportionate compared to other guidelines. Singing should be allowed as churches are following other guidance, including social distancing and masks, to reduce Covid-19 transmission risk via droplets.",
        "background": "This Petition requests the government changes Covid-19 guidance for places of worship, to permit corporate singing, as this is a vital & biblical part of all Christian denominations' traditions. This would reduce the disproportionate restrictions on freedom of religious practice for Christians.",
