        "additional_details": "1) reduce Visa application Fee\r\n2) NHS surcharge should be reduce to minimum.\r\n3) both of these payments should not rise during Covid -19\r\nDoctors,Nurses,anyone worked in Hospitals got their visa extension for free which is unfair. Europeans only paid about \u00a335 to pre-settlement and got 5years visa, again very unfair.\r\nInstead of keeping the home office application/NHS surcharge stable, it is getting increased every year which is unaffordable for the people who has lost their jobs in this pandemic.",
        "background": "Stop rising the NHS fee, and it should be reduced so that immigrants can afford to pay visa fee. Some of the people haven\u2019t even visited doctors and they still paid NHS surcharge, rising payment during this time is stressful for many.",
