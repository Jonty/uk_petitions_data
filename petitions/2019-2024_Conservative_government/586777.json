I have had months of physio and seen other doctors, had a scan, x-ray and all confirm my condition. My son is now nearly 3 years old and I'm still very much in pain and suffering the effects of living with what I call a pregnant belly, it restricts me from simple things like putting my shoes on, laying on my tummy, what I wear, it's destroyed my confidence, I can't afford surgery.",
