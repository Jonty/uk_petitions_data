        "action": "Make Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha a public holiday in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "The change required to make Eid an official public holiday needs to come from Senior Government officials, who should be promoting and acting models for Inclusive behaviours and actions. Just like Christmas and Easter, Eid is an important event in the Muslim community and we need to show respect to the faith by allowing our Muslim residents and colleagues have a Public Holiday for Eid, instead of having to book it as an annual leave or even, work on the day of their celebration.",
        "background": "Being a country who is known to welcome people from all backgrounds and faiths and given the popularity of the EDI agenda in most, if not all, large and small organisations, including local government, it is paramount we consider Eid day as an Official Holiday in the UK.",
