        "additional_details": "So many girls are raped and have children without proper financial support or education on how to adhere to a child. I find it disgusting that males who don\u2019t even have to go through the pain of carrying a child get to decide wether women keep theirs or not, I believe it\u2019s a woman\u2019s uterus so it\u2019s their choice. We need to remember pregnancy isn\u2019t always a choice and it isn\u2019t always an option. I hope we can make change and help  girls because this isn\u2019t deserved and quite frankly it isn\u2019t right.",
        "background": "We need to lift the van of abortions in the US.  It\u2019s unacceptable and dehumanises women and takes away their rights. I understand this isn\u2019t a issue in the UK but we can still fight for what\u2019s right and make a change. It\u2019s an unjust, disgusting action and it needs to be changed fast.",
