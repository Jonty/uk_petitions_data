        "additional_details": "A basic financial education at secondary level would reduce the risk of young adults falling into financial difficulty. It would allow generations of individuals to make more educated and informed financial decisions and promote a greater quality of life for many. Giving individuals an understanding of items like credit score and savings accounts, (especially existing government incentives such as Help to Buy), at a young age would encourage behaviours that would benefit them into the future.",
        "background": "Many people reach adulthood with limited understanding of credit facilities, how to complete tax returns, how mortgages and fixed borrowings work and the risks involved, or how to maximise savings and interest. This can cause many to fall into financial difficulty through no fault of their own.",
