        "additional_details": "This action will make it fair for all students across the country. If students are to sit exams with face masks which can be distracting and in a space with more than 200 students, this is putting people at risk of contracting the virus. With Wales announcing exams are cancelled, it will ensure fairness for all A level students who are applying for Universities as this will rule out any unfairness across the country. Some students haven't had the same amount of teaching as others as well.",
        "background": "Exams should be scrapped and cancelled to ensure fairness. To grade students the government should announce it now and say that grades will be given on any class room assessments, homework's and any coursework available as well as considering predicted grades and teachers own predictions.",
