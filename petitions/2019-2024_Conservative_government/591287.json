        "additional_details": "Because there are living so many foreigners in this country who haven\u2019t been able to see their families in over 2 years. The government just announced that Englisch people can travel without quarantine but foreigners do have to quarantine when coming here. This is a double standard and I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s necessary. Surely you should accept it when people are double vaccinated no matter where they are from.",
        "background": "I would like to propose to allow everyone that is double vaccinated to come here and visit their close family. It\u2019s absurd that someone from Germany has to quarantine yet they have way less cases than the UK does.",
