        "additional_details": "I have this year received a letter stating we need to pay back the child benefit we receive as a family, this money pays for my children to participate in clubs, having a positive impact on a range of things from mental health to staying fit and active, since having to stop my child benefit payments I have found it difficult to keep up with payments for this as not only am I now down \u00a3156 per month I have a very extensive tax bill, that I have had to pay in two chunks.",
        "background": "Inline with the rise in cost of living, and the rise in wages in accordance the threshold needs to be raised from \u00a350,000 as more families are suffering the loss of the child benefit or the repayment due to hitting the threshold, therefore leaving families who rely on the child benefit without this.",
