The Culture Secretary said that the Government would back the football authorities to stop this move, and if the football authorities couldn\u2019t act, the Government would. The Culture Secretary said the Government would \"put everything on the table to prevent this from happening.\"\r\n\r\nYou can read the Culture Secretary's full statement on the European Super League here: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-by-oliver-dowden-on-the-european-super-league\r\n\r\nSince you started your petition it has also been announced that all six Premier League teams that were initially involved in the European Super League have withdrawn.
