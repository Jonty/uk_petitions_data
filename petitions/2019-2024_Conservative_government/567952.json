        "action": "Extend the winter fuel payment to all households during the current lockdown",
        "additional_details": "During the first two lockdowns when the public were asked to stay at home, the weather was warmer and extra costs to households limited. Now for the third lockdown, it is midwinter and so if people are confined to their homes they will be using more energy for heating and hot water",
        "background": "Help households meet their increased energy bills during the third lockdown because they are mainly at home during the day as well as the evening when temperatures are lower than average. The government could give an amount to energy companies to credit people's accounts and pre-payment cards",
