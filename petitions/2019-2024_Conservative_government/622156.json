        "additional_details": "We believe this could make a real change to child safety. 789 children (aged 1 to 15) died in the year of 2020. Although this is the lowest on record it is extremely high. Walking home or making extremely long journey home by themselves can be not only stressful & overwhelming but unsafe for students. We believe funding direct bus services between home and school could help reduce safety risks.",
