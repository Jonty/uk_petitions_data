If executed competently, it should allow us to deal with the situation effectively.\r\n\r\nIt is clear however, at the moment, that containment has failed. Person-to-person transmission is firmly established and every day of inaction that passes puts us at further risk of seeing our health service becoming overwhelmed.",

Cancel large gatherings and events, and test anybody showing symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe government seems determined to wait until it is already too late. Newsflash: it might already be \"already too late\"",
