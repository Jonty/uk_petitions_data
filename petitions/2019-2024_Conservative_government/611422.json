        "additional_details": "Due to species differences, 92% of drugs which prove promising in animal trials fail in human clinical trials. There is substantial evidence that shows animal tests are poor predictors of drug safety and toxicity in humans.\r\n\r\nThe use of animals is scientifically, ethically, morally and financially (taxpayer funded) unjustifiable. \r\n\r\nDefined in 1959, UK law enshrines the principles of the 3Rs. The UK must abandon these principles and redirect funding to focus on the development and use of NAMS.",
