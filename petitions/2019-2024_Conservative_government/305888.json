        "additional_details": "As coronavirus (covid-19) is escalating at this very second, GCSEs should be cancelled as most schools are on lockdown. This means some students won\u2019t be able to study as they cannot afford computers and phones. Students should automatically get a pass (grade 4.) Students shouldn\u2019t have to sit their GCSEs as the risk of coronavirus (covid-19) is too high. If this virus affects people\u2019s grades by giving them their predicted grades (which are worse than they can actually get on their real GCSEs) or even making them resit next year this will affect their lives and not give them the chance to get the grades they deserve. To conclude, all students should be given a pass to minimise the risk of covid-19 spreading across the country.",
