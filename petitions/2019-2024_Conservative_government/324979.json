I believe that a public apology and a sizeable donation (perhaps directly to Black Lives Matter) would show solidarity for the Black Lives Matter movement, and help to put this country onto the right side of history.",

Since then tax payers have been paying this amount back.  Make a public apology and make a sizeable donation to underprivileged black communities.",
