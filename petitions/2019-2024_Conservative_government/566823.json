        "additional_details": "Millions of students have been overlooked by the government throughout this pandemic and tuition fees have remained the same, not to mention the  interest which hasn\u2019t been addressed. Thousands of students have already paid for accommodation fees which which will be abandoned for months. I believe that tuition fees should be reduced at the very least and hope the government will act considerately through unprecedented times and acknowledge the hardships that university  students are facing.",
        "background": "Students across the UK were expected to partially return to University to be told that learning will be predominantly online for the foreseeable future.\r\nThe Government should therefore lower our tuition fees and we should receive a partial refund for the effects this will have on learning.",
