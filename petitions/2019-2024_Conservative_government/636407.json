I am on a local forum, their are many stories similar to mine:\r\n*Cancelled appointments. \r\n*Poor treatment.\r\n*Inability to find an open NHS list.\r\n*Being told your NHS registered dentist has left the practise to work privately. \r\n\r\nMost issues I have seen, seem to stem from the massive gap between their earnings in the private sector and what they receive as an NHS dentist. \r\nPeople health is being negatively impacted!",
        "background": "Our NHS dentist has gone to the private sector, we are unable to get treatment until our practice finds another. We are still on their list but how likely is it we will get another NHS dentist?",
