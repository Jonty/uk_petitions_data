        "additional_details": "People who access routine care are being discharged and excluded. Those attempting to access emergency care are also being turned away (Mental Health Network). The mental health of the Yorkshire and Humber area is particularly at risk. For example, Yorkshire and the Humber have the highest suicide rate per 100,000 people (12.5) from 2018-2020 out of any other region in the UK. This statistic is significantly higher than the average rate in England (10.4). They matter.",
        "background": "We need more funding for mental health & neurodivergence services in the Humber, & cooperation between these & local generalised services. This will provide adequate training & pay for new and current staff, early intervention (e.g in the workplace & educational institutions),  & specialised care.",
