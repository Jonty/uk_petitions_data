        "additional_details": "It\u2019s not fair for the people to have to pay and do again for something they have already achieved and worked hard for. I don\u2019t agree with us having to pay or do the test again if it expires as it\u2019s not our fault it\u2019s actually the governments fault in hand as we are on lockdown! So I think the government should have the audacity to extend our theory test certification! Or at very least let us take the test for free.",
        "background": "This petition would make a huge difference and help people like me!!! I disagree that we are being made to pay and do a theory test again if it expires during this time. It\u2019s is not our fault so we shouldn\u2019t be made to pay and take the test again!",
