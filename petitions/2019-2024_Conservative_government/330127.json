        "additional_details": "We understand you needed to limit the transmission of Covid when these rules were put in place, but these visiting restrictions should only apply to Covid wards now. In this particular example Mum can go and see Dad in the hospital reception but Dad can't wear PPE and come up and see his son, who is in his own room? This is just one example of thousands of other 'non Covid' examples where safe and healthy adults are being kept away from loved ones at a time when they are needed the most.",
        "background": "There are too many examples of cruel situations where hospital 'visiting rules' have impacted catastrophically on people across the UK but when a little 2 year old tragically gets diagnosed with leukaemia and can only have Mummy OR Daddy with him in hospital - this rule needs reviewing quickly.",
