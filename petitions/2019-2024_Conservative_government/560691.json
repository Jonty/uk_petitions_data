See also the \"pleading\" for demonstrations to be held responsibly - the message is clear almost anyone can ignore rules without comeback.\r\nThe \"silent\" majority looks on in disgust as Covid is helped by mistaken appeals to the good nature of the selfish.\r\nEveryone orders on Amazon or uses social media with success. Confused messaging is only a lame excuse we do not accept.",

We would like Police to fine more heavily, but also to show no tolerance so all are fined and have phone use restricted. We request Armed Forces help to achieve this.",
