        "additional_details": "More details\r\n\r\nThe All Party Parliamentary Group for the Private Rented Sector in their report of 2014, Access to Private Rented Housing for the Under 35s, highlighted evidence of people in these properties facing Council Tax arrears, and being driven into less economically vibrant areas. The group recommended that the Government consider banning the practice of Council Tax being applied to bedsit rooms or introduce a more realistic Council Tax band for such accommodation. Thanks",
        "background": "We would like the Government to amend legislation on how Council Tax is charged to prevent the Valuation Office Agency from \"disaggregating\" Council Tax bands so individual bedrooms in properties are given their own band and Council Tax bill. The problem affects a growing number of room let tenants.",
