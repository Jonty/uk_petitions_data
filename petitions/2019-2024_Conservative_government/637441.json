        "additional_details": "The reason why the UK Government should do this is because the current system offers the agency staff less end of contract termination notice, less sickness and health packages, less bonus and welfare benefits and is therefore against the agency workers human rights to be treated unequally, agency staff is working the same shift alongside full contract staff, who are selected to full employment status at random, and current system is open to prejudice and neglect",
        "background": "I would like the government to end long term agency employment loop hole, whereby currently instead of an employer offering full contract rights to all staff, employers contract this responsibility out to a recruitment agency, which provides zero job security or benefits to agency workers.",
