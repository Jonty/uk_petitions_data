        "additional_details": "I would like the government to seriously consider banning the sale of fireworks. I would like them to consider that fireworks can get in to the wrong hands and that they can be set off by irresponsible people. Fireworks are dangerous. Fireworks that are bought by members of the public are often set off at all times at day and night causing disturbances to other residents. Fireworks also scare animals. Fireworks should only be sold for private fireworks displays.",

Fireworks are dangerous and also cause disturbances for residents when being let off at all times of day and night. Fireworks also frighten animals",
