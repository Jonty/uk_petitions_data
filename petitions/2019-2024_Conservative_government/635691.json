There is currently no law in the UK that prevents a person from uploading a photo of a child to social media without the consent of the parent of that child. This in effect means that your personal images of your child can be uploaded anywhere online and there is nothing that can be done legally to prevent this. I can take a photo of a child, and upload it online with no consequence regardless of the parents wishes",

This means that as a parent you have no power over where your child's images are uploaded. I want the government to protect the privacy of children by making this law.",
