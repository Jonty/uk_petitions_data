        "additional_details": "Should the government sanction such an exception in unprecedented times, people who require financial aid and support when other means are unavailable would alleviate some of the pressure and on a case-by-case basis. For example, my partner are both self employed and have only been trading for six months; we do not meet the criteria for support from the government's recent scheme, only Universal Credit is available however this amount falls far short from what we need and would like to survive.",
        "background": "Following closely in line with Australia's recent economic rescue package, notably allowing applicable citizens to withdraw up to $10,000 from private pensions, thus supporting individuals in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
