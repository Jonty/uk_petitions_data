        "additional_details": "Leading experts have warned delaying the second dose could have a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d impact on the efforts to end the coronavirus crisis. They fear the delays to the second jab could foster vaccine-resistant mutations in the virus, making it harder to end the pandemic. We need to stop taking leaps of faith that could potentially kill thousands more and administer the vaccine the way that was intended.",
        "background": "The vaccine was tested under the conditions of around 21 days between dose one and dose two. There is no evidence to show that the vaccine is still effective if you delay it for 12 weeks. The second dose needs to be given after 21 days to meet with guidelines.",
