        "action": "Allow university students to cancel accommodation contracts due to COVID 19",
        "additional_details": "Student accommodation providers, either universities or private companies, may not allow students to break their contract due to their cancellation policies. However, a global pandemic must qualify as an exceptional circumstance. There is no way students could have known this would happen when they agreed to the cancellation policy. \r\nSome students may have also lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic and, as they are not eligible for Universal Credit, may not be able to afford their rent.",
        "background": "With the current outbreak of COVID 19 and the closure of universities, many students may choose to go home to self isolate. However, these students will still have to pay up to \u00a3500+ a month in rent for a room they are no longer staying in and some may be unable to afford it due to job loss.",
