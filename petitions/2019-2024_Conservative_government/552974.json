        "additional_details": "I would like to see some kind of licensing, registration or governing body to control dog swimming pools (not hydrotherapy) to protect the dogs and owners from money grabbing copycat pools. I have seen dogs in real distress being thrown into pools, left to fend for themselves with no-one in the water, with the potential to drown. Too many dogs are being crammed in pools at once, putting profits over safety.",
        "background": "I run a well established, award winning dog swimming pool and others are copying what we do as a get rich quick scheme rather than helping dogs. Some of these people have no idea what they're doing and I have seen film if dogs being hurled into water to get them swimming.",
