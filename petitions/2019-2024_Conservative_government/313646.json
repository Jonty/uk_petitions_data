        "additional_details": "The government should take this action because the current year 10's and 12's have to self teach the GCSE/A level course due to the lockdown from the coronavirus. As a result, many students are struggling with self teaching and the content they need to learn. This could be 25% of the GCSE and A level course they are learning, meaning that up to 25% of the grade they could've gotten cannot be earnt. Aswell as that, year 10 and 12 students do not have mocks, meaning they have no prior preparation.",
        "background": "The government should call off GCSE examinations and A level examinations for 2021. The current year 10 and 12 students should not have to sit a GCSE or A level exam for 2021 due to the reasons listed below as a result of the coronavirus lockdown.",
