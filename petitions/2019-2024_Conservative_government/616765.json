        "additional_details": "I feel like without it being acknowledged not many people are aware of what goes on in prisons. They don\u2019t understand the extent of what spice does to a person, how it tortures, kills and causes significant pain up until their death. More people need to be made aware. Prisons need more preventative measures in place, guards need to be taken accountable for what they\u2019re doing and interrogated. Unless it\u2019s something that the government has got going on themselves? Why are they getting away with it? They\u2019re there to help rehabilitate not supply. I have seen from personal experience what synthetic drugs such as spice does to a person and their families and it is devastating. There is so many painful deaths.",
        "background": "I want the government to make effort in stopping the use of spice and other synthetic drugs in prisons to protect the prisoners and previous drug users who will turn to this as a substitute. It\u2019s evil, it\u2019s heartless, and it\u2019s murder. People don\u2019t understand the extent of torture it performs",
