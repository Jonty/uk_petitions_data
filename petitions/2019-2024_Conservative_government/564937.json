        "action": "Continue the UK's participation in the Erasmus programme post Brexit",
        "additional_details": "The completely arbitrary decision to discontinue our involvement is frustrating. Whilst UK students will supposedly be able to continue to work and study in Europe through the 'Turing' programme, this will no longer be the case for EU and EEA students. We will lose out on the cultural enrichment that these students bring to our universities and to the UK. It is unclear why we should put such time and resources into creating a new, poorer scheme when we already have a perfectly adequate one.",
        "background": "The Erasmus programme allows for both UK students to work and study in the EU as well as for EU and EEA students to study in the UK. Studying abroad can already be prohibitively expensive but the cultural, educational and life experiences to be gained from a study abroad programme are numerous.",
