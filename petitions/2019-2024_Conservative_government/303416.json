The Government is failing to listen to the World Health Organisation and are prioritising the economy, disregarding the lives of the most vulnerable in our communities. We need to pause the system, put the UK into lockdown and support everyone in doing so. A change from business as usual will give humans and the planet a change from an economic system which is destroying the planet and provide the space to reflect and imagine better alternatives.",
