We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, we could accept a petition calling on the Government to increase funding for diagnosis and treatment of a specific genetic disorder, if that's something you'd like to happen.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like help drafting a new petition you can email us at petitionscommittee@parliament.uk"
