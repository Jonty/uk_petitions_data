        "action": "Grant Chagossians The Right To Return Home",
        "additional_details": "Between 1967 and 1973 the British government forcibly removed the entire population of the Chagos Archipelago to build a US military base. The government murdered their pets, treating islanders inhumanely and with contempt. In 2019 the ICJ ruled British control as a breach of Mauritian sovereignty. Continued British presence and denial of the right to return is contrary to international law and against the wishes of the UN General Assembly, as well as a breach of human rights.",
        "background": "This petition wishes to see the government grant the right to return to the Chagos Islanders, who were forcibly removed from their homeland between 1967 and 1973, contrary to international law. Chagossians have been banned from their homes since 1967 and should be allowed to return.",
