        "additional_details": "Currently, DVSA has suspended driving tests all over the country due to the national lockdown. This is totally inconvenient for keyworkers who have already planned to take their tests and get cars for ease of mobility to work especially with the rising cases of COVID-19. This will also ensure less contact with people while using the public system of transportation.",
        "background": "The Government should allow the keyworkers in the country to carry on with their scheduled driving test or allow the DVSA draft a timetable for the keyworkers to take their driving test.",
