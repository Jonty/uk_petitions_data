        "action": "Reduce VAT by 10% for 18 months to alleviate the cost of living hike.",
        "additional_details": "In the financial crisis of 2008 VAT was reduced to 15% and it has a positive effect of consumer spending. It had the effect of stimulating the economy and making life a little easier for both business and consumer alike. The same should apply now. The cost of living is now higher than in the last 30 years. Government, by its nature, cannot set prices. But it can cut taxes to help people pay less. A short term cut in VAT would be a huge help to millions of us who are struggling.",
        "background": "Vat is a standard tax paid on many things. It currently stands at 20%. The government should strongly consider reducing this to 10% for a period of 18 months.",
