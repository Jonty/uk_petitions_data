        "additional_details": "The school uniforms prices are unreasonable and parents should not have to spend large amounts of money. Several parents have been out of employment for such an extended period of time and still have bills and food to pay. \r\n\r\nThere are several of us who are still struggling. \r\nNow with the children going back to school, many parents are struggling and can not afford to buy school uniforms. \r\nI think I speak for many parents when I say secondary school uniforms are very expensive.",
        "background": "I would appreciate the government to please evaluate decreasing prices for secondary school uniforms as they are so expensive.\r\n\r\nI myself am a single mum, with a child in secondary education, the informs are certainly expensive. Particularly during these difficult times.",
