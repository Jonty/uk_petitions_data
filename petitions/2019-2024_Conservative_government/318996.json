        "additional_details": "These staff deserve to be paid in full for this period. Social care providers are unable to meet this cost themselves as they are already struggling under immense pressure from the virus, due to reduced income, increase agency costs and rocketing PPE costs.",
        "background": "Millions of workers in the UK have been furloughed and are allowed to stay at home and receive 80% of their wages. Any member of social care staff who contracts the Covid-19 are required to self isolate and will only receive SSP during this period. This seems very unfair in the scheme of things.",
