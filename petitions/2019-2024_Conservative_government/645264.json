        "additional_details": "A lot of women struggle with fertility. One common cause is PCOS. As it currently stands in the UK you need a BMI of 25 or less for atleast 6 months. For someone with PCOS this is pretty impossible as it is a constant battle to lose weight. Doctors tell individuals to lose weight and they'd consider putting them forward for IVF. However, they know full well that it's not practical, it's unrealistic and going to be a constant battle with very little chance of success.",
        "background": "Consider fairer more realistic BMI requirements for NHS funded IVF. \r\nIncrease the BMI requirements from 25 to 35. \r\nFor private ivf it is safe for someone with a bmi of 40 to have treatment but it is not always affordable.",
