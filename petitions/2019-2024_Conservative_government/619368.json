        "additional_details": "If a mother wishes to breastfeed and it is going well, this is can be protective of her mental health. It gives affirmation of capabilities and a sense of belonging. Breastfeeding also protects mothers when they are depressed by protecting the parent-infant relationship. \r\nHowever, the inability to breastfeed can cause guilt and trauma, and can exacerbate postnatal depression, anxiety and OCD, especially when the choice is out of the mother\u2019s control.",
        "background": "There is an established link between breastfeeding and perinatal mental health. Yet breastfeeding peer support is not included in the NHS Long Term Plan. We would like to see funding for breastfeeding peer support within perinatal mental health teams across the UK.",
