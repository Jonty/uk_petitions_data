        "additional_details": "The immune system has to battle novel viruses. Once the lungs are restricted, a patient may need oxygen to help in this battle. Cases such as these could be treated aboard aircraft. Seats have oxygen delivery systems. Economy sections can be turned into bed space. Planes can be sealed form the surroundings, based at secure airfields around the UK (with excellent transport links). They can be heated, cooled, have toilets, kitchens etc. The aircraft owners, who are struggling, can be compensated.",
        "background": "The only effective treatment for Coronavirus is our immune system. Once the lungs are infected more acute cases require oxygen therapy or a ventilator. At its peak, the NHS may not be able to supply this. Aircraft (fewer of which are flying) can be easily adapted and already have an oxygen network.",
