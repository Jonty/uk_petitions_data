        "action": "Amend working hours and self-employment rules for international students",
        "additional_details": "Students are at the sharp end of the cost-of-living crisis, and international students are particularly affected. Unlike home students, they cannot access student finance, so many are forced to work to fund their studies. But they are limited to 20 hours of work and week and cannot be self-employed.\r\n \r\nThe cap on work limits not just the right to work but also curtails the economic contributions of international students, which was \u00a325.8 billion to the UK economy in 2019, according to HEPI.",
        "background": "We want the Government to abolish the weekly 20-hour working cap and allow international students to work as many hours as home students and pursue self-employment.\r\nThe average student's living costs are \u00a31,078 a month. The 20-hour cap leaves international students struggling to meet basic costs.",
