        "additional_details": "A reason for having a self driven car is that the driver would be free to relax while the car is driving itself, but the driver is meant to be alert to take control whenever the self driving function goes wrong, but if the person in the driving seat falls asleep or loses concentration then the reaction time could be delayed enough to cause a collision so this could be more dangerous than any human driven car as the human driver would already be focused and ready to react to avoid a collision.",
        "background": "I am calling for the government to stop the introduction of driverless cars and make it illegal to manufacturer any self driven car. This is because driverless cars can be extremely dangerous if there are any faults while it is in use.",
