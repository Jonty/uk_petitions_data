        "additional_details": "With the cost of living going up and up people in London can not afforded to put themselves in to more debt by purchasing a new vehicle or paying the charges the Mayor wants to impose on them. A lot of hard working Londoners are already using food banks to make ends meet. It seams that the Mayor of London is disconnected from reality on how people are struggling to trying to live in London. This will also have a big impact on SME and their clients.",
        "background": "We would like them to stop the London Mayor extending the ULEZ and Congestion Zones any more than what is already is right now and to stop any plans of any other charges on Londoners or people who work in or visit London.",
