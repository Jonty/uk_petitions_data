        "additional_details": "This last year has been one of hardship and misery for many people. The effective cancellation of family gatherings at Christmas was something the government clearly did not want to do, but the circumstances made it necessary. With the rollout of the Covid vaccines progressing well, it is likely that most of the restrictions will have ended by 25th June, so this would be a good day for a national celebration.",
        "background": "This additional Bank holiday will allow the country to celebrate a belated Christmas Day. It will generate much needed consumer spending, give people a special day to look forward to, and, hopefully, signal an end to the Corona Virus Crisis.",
