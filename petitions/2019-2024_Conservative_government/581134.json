        "additional_details": "Police officers put themselves in close contact with members of the public on a daily basis, often without the time or ability to prepare themselves fully with PPE. They do not have the benefit of being able to socially distance, frequently getting up close and personal, and even spat or coughed at. Whole teams are being forced to isolate, leaving the public at risk at a time when they are being stretched by an dramatic rise in domestic and mental health incidents caused by the virus",
        "background": "The government need to protect Police officers by vaccinating, as the sole agency expected to enforce the restrictions they have implemented. The public are owed a fully operational police service, which is not possible with teams left short by vulnerable officers having to isolate after contact.",
