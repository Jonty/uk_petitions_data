        "additional_details": "Kids are spending more time in school (6\u00bdhrs).The argumemt that the children recieve their \u00bdterm and full term breaks and should use that time for holidays is very out of date. Prices of holidays (even within the country) are rediculous. Even prices from the week before term time to the week after are astrinomical. With the cost of living and inflation, holidays are very rare for a lot of families now and is made harder by this threat. Parents should be the parents and the choise should be ours.",
        "background": "Stop fining parents for taking children on holiday during school time. Id propose a 2 week allowance for 'school time holidays' weather it be taken as a 1 time holiday or taken with however many days are needed.",
