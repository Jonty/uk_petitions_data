The nurses are overworked and understaffed and the current situation is affecting their mental health massively, I have unfortunately seen daily evidence of this. Help them, give them free parking at their hospital permanently, waive this year\u2019s registration fee and if they work extra shifts to help out, do not charge them basic rate tax as though it is a second job.",

If you want overtime pay for NHS to be exempted from income tax we could accept a petition requesting this."
