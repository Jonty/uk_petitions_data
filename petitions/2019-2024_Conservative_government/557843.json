        "additional_details": "I want the government to change this because it\u2019s so sad and unfair to have our pets cowering in a corner, hiding under beds, having accidents and crying because of the noise they make. I don\u2019t want to completely stop the fireworks as I enjoy them too but limit the time they are sold will limit the time the pets are scared. A couple of days before the day is okay, but between Bonfire Night and New Years is nearly 2 months, a very long time for our pets to be scared and stressed, it\u2019s unhealthy",
        "background": "I am wanting to limit the amount of time before Bonfire Night that fireworks are on sale to the general public. The reasoning behind this is the fear that they put into animals, especially dogs, is unfair as they don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.",
