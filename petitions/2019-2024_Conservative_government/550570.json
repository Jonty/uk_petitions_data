        "additional_details": "In 1940, as the British army faced annihilation on the beaches of Dunkirk, King George VI called for a national day of prayer.   The result was miraculous.  As the men gathered along the shore, pounded by enemy guns, God sent an extraordinary calm - which allowed ordinary people in their small boats to set out across the Channel to rescue and bring home over 300,000 men.  \r\n\r\nToday, with Covid 19, Britain faces another merciless and deadly enemy.  As in 1940, God can deliver us.",
        "background": "We humbly request Her Majesty the Queen follow the example of her father King George VI in WW2 and call for a National Day of Repentance and Prayer, asking the people to call on Almighty God to deliver us from Covid 19.",
