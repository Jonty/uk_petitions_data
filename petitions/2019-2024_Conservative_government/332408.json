        "additional_details": "Given recent welcome announcements of a pay rise to key workers, it is an opportune moment to revisit the pay deal that was not delivered in good faith, and has left the nursing profession out of pocket. Since 2010 nurses have seen a real-term pay decrease of 7.8% which equates to receiving around 20% less in wages than we would have 10 years ago. This is grossly unfair and must be opened back up to discussion. In addition, student nurse bursaries must be re-instated to ensure future workforce.",
        "background": "The amendment to the Agenda for Change in 2018 was misrepresented to nurses and nursing unions by the government. The terms were misleading, and meant nurses took an equivalent pay cut. Nurses passed a vote of no confidence in the RCN for agreeing to the terms, and there needs to be a renegotation.",
