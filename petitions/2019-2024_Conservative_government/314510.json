        "additional_details": "900,000 tonnes of plastic are produced every year by supermarkets. Most of this plastic cannot be recycled and ends up in landfills at best. Often this plastic is sold to other countries which carelessly dump it into the ocean. Plastic not only impacts fragile ecosystems but could seriously harm our health by releasing toxic chemicals which can enter the human food chain.",
        "background": "To stop supermarkets from selling fruit and veg covered in single use plastic. To stop the sale of multi-packs e.g. of tinned goods sold with plastic around them. Supermarkets should not be able to sell any plastic bags, these should be replaced by reusable cotton bags.",
