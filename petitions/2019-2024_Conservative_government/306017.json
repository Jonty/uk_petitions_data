        "additional_details": "To date, the evidence on the effects of coronavirus on pregnant women and newborns is very limited. They are a category at risk, as emphasised by the prime minister's speech on Monday 16, 2020. \r\n\r\nThe recent infection of a newborn in the Middlesex hospital raises concerns that newborns can be either contract the virus in the womb, or that the environment is not safe enough for mothers (infected or not) delivering their babies.\r\n\r\nWe ask for more testing and better equipment for maternity NHS staff.",
        "background": "For staff in labour wards and maternity units to:\r\n- be routinely checked against COVID-19\r\n- wear adequate equipment, including FFP3 masks\r\n- take all necessary precautions, including limiting or banning visits\r\n\r\nWe also ask that pregnant mothers are tested even in the presence of milder symptoms.",
