        "background": "The TV licensing model is outdated and forces people to pay for a service (BBC) that they do not support or want.\r\n\r\nThis petition asks that the current TV license is abolished with immediate effect or in the very near future. The BBC should compete for subscribers like any other TV network/service.",
