This could impact on our economic competitiveness. Extending this existing visa to the EU will benefit our young people and assist with skills shortage issues in the UK. Demand could be managed by quotas.",
        "background": "The Youth Mobility visa is in place for 9 countries and is a reciprocal arrangement which allow young people to work for 2 years in another country. The Government should work with EEA countries so this can be extended for young people in the UK and EEA.",
