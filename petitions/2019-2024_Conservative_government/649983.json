        "additional_details": "The DfE must bring student loan maintenance payments in line with inflation so that students can afford to live, buy food and other essentials. The DfE have stated that students struggling should contact their university and yet, university budgets are being squeezed. This government must realise that it is NOT the fault of students or universities as to why they cannot afford basics but the fault lies with them and they need to raise maintenance loan payments in line with inflation immediately.",
        "background": "As the BBC have pointed out, majority of student maintenance loan payments are being used entirely for rent. The government needs to bring maintenance loan payments in line with inflation so students can afford to live, buy food and other essential items whilst studying.",
