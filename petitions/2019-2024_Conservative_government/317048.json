        "additional_details": "I worry about vulnerable people at this time. Recovering gambling addicts are at risk, people who are suffering from financial hardships are at risk. I understand that gambling is perfectly legal and I by no means am calling for online gambling to be banned. However, I am calling for the bombardment of advertisements to stop. People are now mostly confined to their houses often watching television all throughout the day, I genuinely worry for those who are at risk or vulnerable.",
        "background": "During the COVID-19 lockdown there has been a noticeable increase in advertisements for online gambling services. These advertisements often offer incentives to play. I believe that the accessibility of these dangerous sites in these uncertain times is concerning.",
