        "additional_details": "Banning a dog breed isn't a proper solution to preventing dog attacks. It lies in preventing the wrong people from owning dogs who could do serious harm. Banning a dog breed today will only result in irresponsible owners moving onto the next large dog breed, mismanaging it's care, and resulting in the same issue in a few years' time. The introduction of dog licenses for certain breeds would mean that we're able to regulate, track, and ensure proper dog care, reducing these horrible attacks.",
        "background": "Dog attacks, against both humans and pets, are a serious problem in need of a sensible and fair solution. We need something which fairly looks after the wellbeing of our communities, helps to regulate breeding, and prevents the wrong people from owning dogs who could do more serious harm.",
