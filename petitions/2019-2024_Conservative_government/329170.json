        "additional_details": "Beauty Salons and Medispas are highly trained in strict hygiene protocols and infection control before Covid-19 and the industry has always been one of the most sterile work places in the UK.\r\nWe\u2019ve spent months closed, which as one of the largest industries in the UK, has been incredibly hard. We\u2019ve spent time and money ensuring the safest way to treat clients to keep in line with government protocols and thus keeping the R rate down. The beauty industry is no different to hairdressers.",
        "background": "Allow Beauty Salons and Medispas to reopen on the 4th July alongside Hairdressers. Do not disregard an industry that is classed as one of the most sterile work places in the UK. Do not penalise an industry that trains in infection control and is used as a strong support for mental health.",
