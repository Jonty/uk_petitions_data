This isn\u2019t the fault of ordinary working people in society but it also affects the very vulnerable too who will struggle to choose between eating, starving or freezing.\r\n\r\nThese charges apply whether you use energy or not. A 54% rise last April, now we are looking at a another potential catastrophic 64% rise.\r\n\r\nSCRAP STANDING CHARGES & VAT immediately so people can have a better standard of living.\r\n\r\nITS TIME TO ACT NOW !!",
