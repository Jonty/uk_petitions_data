Considering that millions who are eligible for the SEISS can get up to \u00a32500 / month + UC, and furloughed ppl can get 80% of their salary but DO NOT HAVE TO PAY THIS BACK, it's outrageous that 1000's if not millions who went fully SE in 2019/20 who were employed before that and paid tax into state, can only get UC, which IS NOT close to enough",
