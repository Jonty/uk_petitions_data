        "additional_details": "Local branch closures and loss of staff is causing stress and concern for vulnerable members of this country. Online banking cannot achieve all banking needs and people are being forced to queue outside large banks, and use touch screens due to loss of staff.\r\nIn the winter, standing outside banks in busy streets will lower the immune system increase susceptibility for contracting the virus. Further, using touch screens will make it more likely for the vulnerable to catch COVID and become ill.",

Ideally offer incentives for banks to re-open their branches and re-hire trained staff to avoid use of touch screens and limit queues.",
