We cannot understand racism in the UK today without critically acknowledging our colonial legacy. In order to enable the future citizens of this country to tackle systemic racism, brought to the forefront, due to COVID-19 and the Black Lives Matter protests in the UK, we need to Fill in the Blanks of our history, and that starts with teaching the history of the British Empire.",

The Government argues schools \"have the freedom & flexibility [...] to teach pupils about the history of Britain and the wider world. This can include the topic of the British Empire.\u201d This is inadequate.",
