With the way the economy is going people can\u2019t afford to lose the money they pay solicitors and the money for the surveys, searches and storage to be done.\r\nWhen a price deal is sealed for a property, that should be final. There should be no further actions or discussions of a party all of a sudden withdrawing themselves from the sale because they don\u2019t want to sell or buy anymore.",
        "background": "I would like the government to enforce a law or documents in writing to which neither party of an agreed sale of a property can withdraw from. \r\nThis is what Scotland do and with England having a larger population I believe that this would be highly beneficial and would stop loss of money.",
