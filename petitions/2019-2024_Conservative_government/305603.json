        "additional_details": "I am pleading for the government to consider the release of prisoners who fall into the following categories: \r\n(A) Less than 3-4 years of their sentence remaining \r\n(B) Serving a custodial sentence for a minor offence \r\n(C) Low risk prisoners \r\n\r\nhowever, for the prisoners that do not fall under this category, something needs to be put in place. It is simply inhumane to treat prisoners with such a lack of respect. Lockdown in prisons could potentially lead to a massive rise in suicides & concerned family\u2019s",
        "background": "During this spread of Coronavirus, prisons have stated they will be going into lock down. What this means for prisoners: \r\n- no visits from loved ones \r\n- no daily regime such as education/Gym/socialising time on the wing \r\n- less frequent or no showers \r\n- no contact with friends and family",
