If the Government or Parliament were to look into our topic we hope it would help people in their future as they will learn more relevant skills and prevent future issues. Adding on to what has been said, we as students believe the school curriculum needs to teach us and others more life skills.",
        "background": "We want the school curriculum changed to enable students from secondary school up until the age of 18 to be taught important life skills to help them in their future. Some examples include tax, finance, mortgage and money management.",
