        "additional_details": "A sense of community and society has become much more apparent, perhaps contrarily, during our isolation, and I hear people everywhere calling for support for the NHS and other key workers, and I feel that this country should (as it would for great military endeavours to keep us safe) recognise those workers by giving them something that would remain a lasting testament to their work during the crisis.  A general service medal and special recognition medals (e.g. bravery etc) would do that.",
