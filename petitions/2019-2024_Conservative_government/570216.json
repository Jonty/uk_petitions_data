        "additional_details": "Care workers are an army of mainly low-paid women who are in direct personal contact with those most at risk of dying from Covid19. They should not be working if they are experiencing symptoms or are in a high risk catagory. However, the alternative is statutory sick pay of \u00a394.25 a week. They must not fear destitution if they need to isolate. They deserve full pay from day one - based on actual hours worked - in order to protect themselves, their families and those they care for.",
        "background": "The government must ensure care workers can self-isolate if they show symptoms of Covid-19 or are in a high risk catafory on full pay. They must put in place measures to ensure that tax payers money reaches carers and does not end up in the pockets of business owners.",
