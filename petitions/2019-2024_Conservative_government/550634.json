        "additional_details": "For the past few weeks, there has been a lot of havoc with public transportation especially in the form of buses. Kids are late to school with no consideration about the bus situation, Adults without cars are late to work as well. \r\n\r\nUnderstandable that the intent is to limit transmission of COVID-19 as much as possible but I don\u2019t believe this has been the case as I\u2019ve witnessed first hand drivers going past stops regardless of if the bus was full or not.",
        "background": "I\u2019d like to government to consider increasing the frequency of school buses or grant access to time tables for school buses so that kids don\u2019t have to wait hours waiting for a bus that doesn\u2019t even let them on.",
