        "additional_details": "Schools are in an impossible position: they have to cancel the trip, but cannot get the money back from insurers. Hard working parents who have saved up to give their children a once in a lifetime experience are facing losing the money, which means their children won't get that chance again.",
        "background": "Since the government advised schools to cancel school trips abroad, due to the Corona virus, parents are being told they will not get refunds. Insurers will not reimburse the schools because the advice is not from the Foreign & Commonwealth Office, meaning it is not official.",
