        "action": "Legalise the recreational use of cannabis",
        "additional_details": "The Institute of Economic affairs estimated the illicit cannabis market to be worth \u00a32.5bn a year, with 255 tonnes sold to 3 million users in 2016/17. Currently, this money is used by organised crime groups to fund other illegal activity, such as human trafficking and producing counterfeit goods. If cannabis were sold legally from licensed stores, this would take money out of the hands of criminals and put it into the economy, with a significant amount being paid in tax to the government",
        "background": "Cannabis being illegal allows criminals and organised crime groups to profit from the sale of it while failing to keep the drug out of the hands of the public. The government should legalise the use of the drug so that it can be sold legally, which would make the criminal sale of the drug redundant.",
