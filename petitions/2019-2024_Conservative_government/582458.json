        "additional_details": "Common plastic packaging contributes to the emission greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, which contributes further to global warming. Plastic packaging needs to be replaced with sustainable alternatives and clearly state how they should be reused or disregarded. In turn this could help save our planet, save our money and create new jobs. We do not have much time left, we must act now. This is an emergency.",
        "background": "We propose a new incentive scheme to get all businesses selling goods to replace all \u201cnot yet recycled\u201d packaging with recyclable, recycled, reusable, upcycled or compostable packaging instead. Not only will this tackle the global crisis this has the potential to save a substantial amount of money.",
