        "action": "Permit congregational singing in English churches in some circumstances.",
        "additional_details": "As Christians from many different denominations in England, we note the widespread group singing, close embraces and communal hugging in many inside venues that has taken place as a result of England's much-enjoyed win against Germany. We also note the inconsistency that seems to permit this, and yet not permit simple singing in churches. With appropriate safety measures in place, we are convinced it would be reasonable for English congregations to sing once again as in Scotland and Wales.",
        "background": "We respectfully ask the Government to (a) consider aligning the rules on singing in English churches with those in Wales or Scotland so that some congregational singing may resume as soon as possible and (b) if possible set out a plan for lifting of all restrictions in time.",
