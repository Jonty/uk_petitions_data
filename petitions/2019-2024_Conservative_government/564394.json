        "additional_details": "So many families have given up seeing each other for special celebrations that it seems fair to allow a new Bank Holiday to compensate the nation. The UK currently has fewer Bank Holidays than the majority of the world so we are definitely due an upgrade. A new holiday that encompasses the diversity of the UK would acknowledge the community spirit that sprung up during lockdowns. Spending on celebration preparations would also give the economy a boost.",
        "background": "Create a new national holiday for the entire UK which is not tied to a specific religion, but allows for families to celebrate in ways similar to holidays/traditions they may have missed due to lockdown restrictions. The Bank Holiday should be 2 days long like it is around Christmas and Easter.",
