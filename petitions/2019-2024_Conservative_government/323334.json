        "additional_details": "A social safety net only works if it's there for everyone. NRPF discrimination leaves workers & children homeless, hungry & destitute. By creating insecurity it undermines wages for everyone.\r\n\r\nAt a hearing on 27 May, Stephen Timms MP described the plight of a family left with zero support during COVID-19, and reported at least 100,000 children are affected.\r\n\r\nBoris Johnson was shocked to hear about NRPF. The PM said those \"who live and work here should have support\".\r\n\r\nWe agree. End NRPF now.",
        "background": "\"No recourse to public funds\" (NRPF) conditions discriminate against foreign citizens and their children accessing social security. This policy leaves workers and their families without a safety net, traps victims of domestic abuse, and denies school meals to impoverished children. It must end.",
