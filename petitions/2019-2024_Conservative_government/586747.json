        "action": "Don't allow universities to defer the 2021 summer graduation ceremony to 2022.",
        "additional_details": "Students have been treated awfully during the pandemic. They were locked up in halls and private accommodations, accused of causing covid outbreaks, denied the quality academic education and the essential social interaction with fellow students they signed up for, while having to pay full tuition fees. And now, after all their hard work and dedication, their moment of pride and glory that they were looking forward to sharing with their friends and family will be unjustifiably stolen from them.",
        "background": "Parliament and Government should question and reverse the totally indefensible and very dubious decision many UK universities have taken to defer the 2021 summer graduation ceremony to next year, thereby destroying the momentum of this milestone in the lives of our students and their loved ones.",
