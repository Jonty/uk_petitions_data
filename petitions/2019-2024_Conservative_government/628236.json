        "additional_details": "The burning of fossil fuels, in particular oil, contributes hugely to climate change. As a developed country the UK has a responsibility to follow the examples of other countries and stop oil extraction. Even if it brings the UK money now, new oil licences will hugely contribute to climate change and will result in the need for much heavier spending further down the line, in order to prevent catastrophic consequences.",
        "background": "We demand that the UK government stops extraction of oil in return for renewable energy sources. New oil licences and oil exploration must be halted and current oil drilling phased out.",
