        "action": "Give all students their CAGs across the UK, following the Scottish government.",
        "additional_details": "Following the Scottish government's decision that all 125,000 downgraded grades will be reversed, students will be issued their CAG (teacher predicted grades) and this will lead to an estimated 20% jump in the pass rate and a record level of attainment overall. This will put Scottish students at an extreme advantage over other students within the UK as OFQUAL are following the same system as the SQA, UK students can expect the same harsh downgrades with up to 39% of grades set to be adjusted down, and thus for it to be as fair as possible the UK government must follow the Scottish government and award CAGs.",
        "background": "Give all A-Level students their CAGs as Scotland have done so, as a failure to do this will put Scottish students at a significant benefit to other students within the UK who will have had their CAGs downgraded. With an estimated 39% of CAGs going to be downgraded the UK government must act.",
