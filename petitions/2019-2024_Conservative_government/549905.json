        "additional_details": "The main reason for scrapping ICT was to promote more academic subjects such as Computer Science however not everyone wants to program and students are missing out on key skills needed for many industry jobs such as spreadsheets, databases, word processing, photo editing and rapid web development which Computer Science does not cover.\r\nVocational qualifications are limited and many academic students are put off studying them. Therefore less students are now studying computer based subjects",
        "background": "GCSE ICT was scrapped in favour of promoting Computer Science, however not all students want to program and many are missing out on vital skills needed for the workplace.\r\nICT and Computer Science are 2 different disciplines and both are needed for a well rounded education",
