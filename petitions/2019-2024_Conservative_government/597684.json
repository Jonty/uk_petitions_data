        "additional_details": "This petition is against the proposal to add fluoride to drinking water. \r\n \"..elevated fluoride intake during early development can result in IQ deficits that may be considerable.\" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6923889/). \"The average loss in IQ was reported as a standardized weighted mean difference of 0.45, which would be approximately equivalent to seven IQ points\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/fluoride-childrens-health-grandjean-choi/",
        "background": "The proposal to introduce fluoride into drinking water focuses solely upon caries prevention & dental health, however, multiple peer reviewed studies, including most recently, in 2019 show that fluoride intake directly corresponds to lower IQ scores, especially among developing brains of children.",
