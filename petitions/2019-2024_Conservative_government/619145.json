        "additional_details": "The surrounding countries in the United Kingdom have adopted advanced information for their own students, yet England has decided not to. This seems highly unfair as not only will the pupils in other countries have better chances at success, but they will also avoid revising information that will not show up. Advanced information would prevent students from potentially revising the wrong topics and would allow them to focus more on the useful aspects, likely allowing better final grades also.",
        "background": "The government and Department of Education should allow all students sitting these exams accurate advanced information as to the topics and subjects that will show up on their papers. All students missed the same amount of time however these age groups were arguably the most affected.",
