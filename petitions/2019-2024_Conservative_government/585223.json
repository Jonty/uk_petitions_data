        "additional_details": "Good breeders can be found on the Kennel club web page.  Have a register for rescue centres & groups & allow ONLY them to advertise pets they have up for adoption.\r\n  Stopping online ads/selling of pets will put a stop to puppy farms & dog theft, by removing their sales opportunities & outlet.\r\n  The money saved from policing dog theft & stopping puppy farms etc, will more than cover the cost of doing this.  It will also be a much easier system to aid in the protection of animals",
        "background": "ONLY allow rescue centres & groups to advertise online.  The pups that make it, mainly end up in rescue centres because of very expensive vets bills.  YES, they charge a fee,however, in most cases this does not cover medication & vets costs.",
