        "additional_details": "This petition addresses recent changes to the skilled worker visa salary requirement, impacting individuals contributing to the UK economy. The sudden alteration undermines trust in established rules, disrupting meticulously planned careers. We advocate for reconsideration, emphasizing the injustice faced by those negotiating job offers. The blanket rule overlooks ongoing efforts and fails to recognise the commitment of individuals to shaping their professional futures.",
        "background": "The sudden GBP 38,700 skilled worker salary increase for students/post-study visa holders from 2020-23 jeopardises their negotiated job offers and disrupts their careers. Applying the new threshold only to the next intake would be fair to those already invested in careers in the UK.",
