A few days ago, a loose dog killed a baby goose near a pond. Where I live, there\u2019s stories constantly about people being attacked by loose dogs. Please, so many livestock, beloved pets, wildlife, and other people are getting hurt unnecessarily because people refuse to be responsible dog owners.",
        "background": "Lately, I\u2019ve seen so many posts about loose dogs slaughtering sheep, wildlife, attacking children and causing bodily harm, and I think it could be avoided if all dogs were prohibited from being off lead. It would make the country a safer place.",
