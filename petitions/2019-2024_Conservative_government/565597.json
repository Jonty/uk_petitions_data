I want to make it clear that I am not creating this petition as a means of hate or republicanism - I am merely expressing how hundreds of thousands of Britons (like myself) across the country truly feel. I think we can all agree that since the death of our beloved Lady Diana Spencer, public opinion of the PoW has never been the same. The Duke of Cambridge is loved & respected by all",
        "background": "Firstly, I would like to make it known that I love & respect our Queen dearly. She has been a symbol of continuity and strength for this country for decades. Our Queen represents peace and togetherness across the globe - unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the Prince of Wales and Camilla.",
