        "action": "Follow the actions of the Welsh Government and cancel GCSE, AS and A Level exams",
        "additional_details": "On the 10th November the Welsh Government announced the cancelation of the 2021 exam creating huge discrepancies between students competing for university spaces. Many English and Welsh students study courses on the same exam boards. Welsh students will have a level playing field due to assessed grades, whereas in England the gap between will continue to widen. Hard working students at large schools have a much higher chance of falling behind than students at smaller schools. This is not fair.",
        "background": "Implement a revised robust system that allows students to obtain the grades they deserve in the examinations of year 11s and 13s, using previous attainment, teacher assessment and modelling to award students accurate grades.",
