        "additional_details": "As it stands, with today's legislation around sexual assault, victims  suffer more than perpetrators when it comes to reporting sexual assaults. Perpetrators walk away without punishment due to restrictions on evidence. This is demonstrated by the fact that so few reported rapes and sexual assaults result in a conviction. Perpetrators are then free to potentially offend again. Through changing the law, it is more likely that victims will receive justice, preventing the risk of future offences.",
        "background": "I believe that this is necessary in order to allow prosecutors to present a wider range of evidence for example, relating to the character of the defendant and whether there are similar charges against the defendant.",
