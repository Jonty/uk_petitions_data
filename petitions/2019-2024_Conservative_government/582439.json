        "additional_details": "On the Erasmus scheme, students can receive \u00a3630 a month to support their living costs abroad, whereas the Turing scheme only offers \u00a3490.\r\nOn the Erasmus scheme, students can receive \u00a31,315 for travel costs, but on the Turing scheme they receive \u00a30 (unless they are from a disadvantaged background). Full-time students should not be expected to cover the cost of flights and other travel.\r\nFor some courses the year abroad is mandatory, and with COVID-19 uncertainty, we should receive more support.",
        "background": "The Turing scheme is regarded as a great thing for UK students, when in reality it is far from that.\r\nIt provides a measly amount of funding for most students, and they are expected to cover travel costs on their own.\r\nThe government should ensure we get the same funding as we would get on Erasmus.",
