        "additional_details": "In recent weeks, hot weather has led to a surge in the public buying and using disposable BBQs yet, the damage and destruction it causes the environment, alongside the intense pressure it puts on our emergency services is unfathomable. The news is constantly showing the death of wildlife, ruined countryside and precious resources being used to put out the out of control fires these BBQs can cause. They are single use, unsustainable and cause more trouble than they are worth in the modern age.",
