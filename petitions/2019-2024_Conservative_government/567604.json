        "additional_details": "To give students fair grades, and stop them stressing about exams. Mental health has risen tremendously in these unprecedented times. Therefore students should not be given the stress of doing any form of exam, whether that\u2019s doing 1 less paper than they would have done if this pandemic didn\u2019t happen. This goes for every form of exam whether it\u2019s BTEC, A level or GCSE.",
        "background": "Students have been off school for too long... even longer than last years students who received teacher assessed grades. With the new variant it\u2019s highly unlikely students will be back in school anytime soon, therefore they should not be made to do any form of exam whatsoever.",
