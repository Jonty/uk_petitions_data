        "additional_details": "It shouldn\u2019t matter what creed, colour or race you are. A life is a life which is why the govt should extend its \u2018Homes for Ukraine\u2019 scheme to all refugees fleeing conflict, especially those families still living in refugee camps in the Middle East decades after the Iraq war. It is deeply troubling and disheartening that the same courtesy was not given to the refugees fleeing political unrest and conflict in the Middle East which was a direct result of the western invasion of Iraq & Afghanistan.",
        "background": "On the 2nd day of the Homes for Ukraine scheme opening 100,000 people registered their interest and I want the govt to extend this scheme to all refugees fleeing conflict and rename the scheme Homes for Refugees as refugees residing in Jordanian refugee camps for decades are desperate and destitute.",
