But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing it is stupid.\" Humanity is beautiful & diverse. Each child should be treated differently, and their strengths, weaknesses, and individuality should be celebrated. Forcing square pegs into round holes does not foster creativity or passion, and requiring all children to pass subjects that they acutely struggle with is both soul-destroying and damaging.",
        "background": "We urge the government to recognise not all children, especially those with EHCPs, excel academically. Forcing repeated Maths and English resits until aged 18 adds unnecessary stress at exam times. Many careers don't need these subjects, underscoring the need to rethink education and testing.",
