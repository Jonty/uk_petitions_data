        "action": "Stop the Home Office from mass-deporting people to Jamaica before Christmas",
        "additional_details": "There should be no plans to mass deport people to the Caribbean, using charter planes or other methods, given the failure of the government to fully implement the findings of numerous Windrush Reports.\r\n\r\nTo do otherwise is immoral and demonstrates the disdain the government has for Black British individuals in general and during the pandemic. It would also indicate that the government has no interest in working to address 'institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness' towards Black Brits.",
        "background": "Halt the inhumane planned deportation of up to 50 individuals on a charter flight to Jamaica on the 2nd of December until further notice.\r\n\r\nNo human being deserves to be dehumanised by being chained to two guards and shipped off to another country with no scrutiny, no visitors, and no hope.",
