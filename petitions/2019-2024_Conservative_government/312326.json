        "additional_details": "In 2017, more than 20 million votes (or 68%) where wasted. This shows us how flawed and undemocratic the outdated first-past the post system really is and how it must be made redundant if we are to salvage our democracy. Another 6.7 million votes where made tactically during the 2017 election which means that 6.7 million voters where unhappy with the their own vote; this is the sole responsibility of the undemocratic first past the post system.",
        "background": "The current voting system is inadequate at representing the interests of a vast majority of the British people. Our current voting system allows a party to form a government without the support of the majority of the population, this is an insult to democracy and needs to change.",
