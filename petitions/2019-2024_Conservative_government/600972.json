        "additional_details": "If we stop MPs from exploiting their roles for extra financial personal gain then we will discourage inappropriate people seeking the role in the 1st place, encouraging more passionate candidate MPs who just want to honestly represent the views of the people who elected them with zero bias for anyone who may have paid them on the side. It's a role with huge power & responsibility, so any claiming to have enough \"spare time\" to do a 2nd job isn't doing all they can for their constituents.",
        "background": "No MPs allowed 2nd jobs / privately paid work, & former Ministers must not be allowed to lobby after they leave office. MP very well-paid full time job, time paid for by tax payers & constituents their sole bosses. Parliament controls every aspect of UK life so every other job has conflict.",
