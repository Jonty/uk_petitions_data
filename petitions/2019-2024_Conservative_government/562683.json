No other vaccine has been made mandatory before so why should this one all of a sudden? \r\n\r\nThose who decide to take the vaccine and continue to follow the \u2018safety procedures\u2019 should be deemed safe and \u2018immune to the virus\u2019. Therefore those who do not want to be vaccinated would only be putting themselves at risk. \r\n\r\nI believe it will prevent a lot of mayhem for the government if the vaccine is taken by choice.",
