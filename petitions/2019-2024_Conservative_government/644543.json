        "additional_details": "The issue is owners of these dogs get very little in terms of punishment, other than their pet is often euthanized.\r\n\r\nIf a person had stabbed that man/girl instead of their dog they would likely get a prison sentence. Having a dangerous dog (of whatever breed) is like going out armed with a weapon. \r\nIf a dog attacks a person and causes grievous bodily harm or even kills them, the owner should be the person facing the sentence as if they committed the crime themselves.",
        "background": "Last week 1 person was killed and a few others injured in dog attacks. another person was seriously injured by a dog. I'm sure that wasn't the only one that day, but the reason it got the headline was that it was an XL Bully dog. Yes bigger dogs do more damage but it's irresponsible owner at fault",
