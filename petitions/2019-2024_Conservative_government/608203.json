        "additional_details": "The cost of living is going up food prices and fuel bills members of parliament get subsidies for both regardless of having one of the highest wages in the UK. The working class people are paying more for services and necessities, in fact the price of everything is going up whiles wages remain under inflation and stagnant. The conservatives cut universal credit, and the 'help' offered for fuel is actually a loan. We demand an end to subsidies for MPs until genuine help if offered to everyone.",
