        "additional_details": "The government has failed to consider that most people can't afford to live a healthier lifestyle. A BBC reporter, has said that obesity is more likely an issue in deprived areas.  \r\nThe new measures are harmful to those who have eating disorders. According to NHS digital, there were 11,117 hospital admissions directly for obesity in 2018/19 & 16,489 admissions in the same year for eating disorders. Living in a society where calorie counting & diet culture is the norm won't help.",
        "background": "I'm proposing that they put a more practical solution in place, for example:\r\n\r\n1. Make the sugar/alcohol free option more available. \r\n2. Weight loss surgery should be more accessible on the NHS. \r\n3. Reduce the cost of gym membership.\r\n4. Make the healthy option more affordable.",
