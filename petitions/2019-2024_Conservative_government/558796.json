If this happens we will still be working for than not but it is still a more even split. At school children get a lot of homework and can spend most of their time off just doing more work when they\u2019re supposed to be relaxing. There is a time for work and a time for rest and it should be more balanced.",

The Government does set the maximum hours someone can work in a week, although people can opt out of this: https://www.gov.uk/maximum-weekly-working-hours\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for the maximum number of hours people are allowed to work to be reduced, or for the ability to opt out of the current maximum to be brought to an end. You could also start a petition calling on the Government to prevent employers from requiring staff to work on certain days.\r\n\r\nDecisions on the structure of the school day and school week are the responsibility of individual schools, but we could accept a petition calling on the Government to require schools not to open on Fridays.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nReduce the maximum working hours to 30 hours per week after Covid-19 lockdown: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/317794"
