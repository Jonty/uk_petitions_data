The only logical thing to do is to give students their predicted grades as this is what teachers have predicted them to get for their GCES/ALEVELS/UNI. Also this would help them having to do it at another time as it could affect the curriculum for next year and could affect other years. If the Government does decide to do this it would help people self isolate to prevent the spread of the virus.",

The reason for this is that it could increase the spread of COVID-19 not only to other students but also to the examiners and Invigilators.This could have a massive knock on effect and people are most likely be scared",
