I know exactly how much goes out of my bank account every month and I do not want, nor do I need, a \u00a3200 Government loan that I subsequently have to repay over a 5 year period. This is supposed to be a democracy but Rishi Sunak's hair-brained scheme is straight out of a dictatorship and needs to be addressed.",
