        "additional_details": "Two reasons for this \r\n- For British expats living and working in the UAE, to be able to visit family in the UK without spending 10 days in a hotel. Most of whom haven't been able to visit in over a year. \r\n- For tourists to visit a country that has a high and successful vaccination drive with low number of cases.\r\n\r\nWith the UAEs success in fighting the pandemic, the need for it to remain on the red list has been greatly reduced.",
