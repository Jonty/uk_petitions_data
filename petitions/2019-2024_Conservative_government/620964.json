        "additional_details": "So many young people, especially non-males, are being left undiagnosed and misdiagnosed because CAMHS professionals are not considering that they might be neurodivergent. Getting a diagnosis as early as possible is essential for the young persons mental health, confidence, and potential. It will also save the NHS a huge amount of time and money on resources, therapy and medication that are wrongly given to young people who are misdiagnosed with mental health conditions.",
