        "additional_details": "Healthcare has become almost impossible to access post the coronavirus pandemic. Waiting times are ridiculous, booking face to face appointments are impossible and patient care has become somewhat unprofessional and has declined significantly as a result. Citizens no longer feel safe, nor believe that their health will be sustained when needed. If there was more access to GP\u2019s, the out of hours services and A&E\u2019s would receive a lot less patient income.",
        "background": "Make Face to Face GP appointments more accessible. Improve patient care in A&E\u2019s and Out of hours services. Improve the A&E/Out of hours services triage rotation. It causes unnecessary prolonged waiting times.",
