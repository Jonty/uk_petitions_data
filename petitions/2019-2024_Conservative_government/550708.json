        "additional_details": "In my local school, already Year 11 and Year 7 have been sent home for 2 weeks due to cases. I know 2 primary schools in my area which have also closed. How on Earth can the government allow for their popularity to overcome the health of CHILDREN. Not only do children risk giving it to parents who could easily become seriously ill, but a large portion of students have weakened immune systems and are at risk. Regardless of health, students are not receiving a sufficient education due to measures taken. Online classes should be returned and schools should be closed for the safety of our nation's future.",
        "background": "Schools have been opened again and as a student, I witness the horrors first hand. Not only have classes been shortened but so has our free time. While the latter is not as important, students are receiving a higher standard of education through online classes than through school.",
