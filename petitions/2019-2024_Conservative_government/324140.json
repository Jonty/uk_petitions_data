        "additional_details": "The UK has a history of suspending exports where it deems appropriate, and are required to under certain conditions. Last year, the UK halted sales of tear gas to Hong Kong until an independent investigation into accusations of police brutality & excessive uses of force had been conducted - the same should happen now. \r\n\r\nExplained more eloquently & in more depth here: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/george-floyd-protests-uk-export-tear-gas-rubber-bullets-shields-us-a9543106.html",
        "background": "The UK exports weapons including anti-crowd gas & riot equipment to the United States. The unrest in the US & the Govt's response has led to allegations of police brutality against journalists and peaceful protesters. We may be enabling this through our exports - this needs to be investigated.",
