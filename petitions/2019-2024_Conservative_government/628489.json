        "additional_details": "I\u2019d like this restriction for the following reasons:\r\n- Fireworks can cause great distress to animals and the elderly. \r\n- Fireworks are often used by drug dealers to advertise the availability of new stock.\r\n- Fireworks create pollution and the tenements are a danger to property and wildlife.\r\n- Fireworks are more likely to be abused by children/teens if they have a larger window of opportunity to use them.",
