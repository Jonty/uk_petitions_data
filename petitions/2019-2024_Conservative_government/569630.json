You can read the framework here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/596629/EYFS_STATUTORY_FRAMEWORK_2017.pdf\r\n\r\nFurther, while primary schools in England are required to teach relationships education, sex education is optional and parents have the right to withdraw their children from sex education lessons if their school offers them.
