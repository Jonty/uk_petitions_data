        "additional_details": "The farming of sentient animals for use of the skins and feathers is cruel, inhumane, unnecessary and barbaric and must be stopped across the globe. The fashion industry is slow to remove fur and feathers from its products so there needs to be a greater incentive to change. If the potential uk market for fur and feathers is removed change will follow more quickly.",
        "background": "The use of real fur and feathers involves cruel and barbaric treatment of animals, who are kept in dreadful, cramped and overcrowded conditions and then subjected to terrifying barbaric inhumane treatment, torture and or death, to harvest their skins or feathers.",
