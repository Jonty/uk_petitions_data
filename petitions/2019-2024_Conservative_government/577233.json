        "action": "Change the conveyancing laws in England",
        "additional_details": "After moving from Scotland to England the difference in the process is staggering. The current system causes added delays and stress as there is no guarantee that a sale will proceed until exchange of contracts. Under the current system buyers can change their mind with no explanation. The system in Scotland is more straightforward and sales are more likely to proceed as an independent home report has to be provided when advertising so buyers are better informed when making an offer.",
        "background": "I am currently going through an extremely stressful house move with the possibility of having our third buyer back out right before exchange. I want the UK government to change the conveyancing law to mirror the Scottish system so that sales are less likely to fall through right before exchange.",
