        "additional_details": "Many people's mental health deteriorates because they are being refused help and ignored when they show symptoms of PCOS. Or they're refused any help until they've been trying a while. So when it comes to being \"old enough\" or they've been trying for over a year, it's sometimes too late. A massive denominator in my mental health was the fact I couldn't conceive, all the symptoms of PCOS and I was constantly pushed aside because of either my age or the fact I wasn't actively trying.",
        "background": "Drs don't seem to want to look into running tests or diagnosing PCOS when symptoms are very clearly shown. They refuse to look into it until you're closer to the age of 30 or have been trying for a child for at least a year. Catching and treating it early is important.",
