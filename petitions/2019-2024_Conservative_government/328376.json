Especially as many countries, including our own, once landed we would have to quarantine for 14 days (now what's the point in going on holiday for that?) I think all flights up until the end of August should waive the fees to change to a later date. Airlines then won't have to issue any refunds or vouchers as it can be done online by the customer and keeping all customers happy in these strange times, knowing they can postpone their holiday that people have saved for.\u00a0",

Due to Covid-19 many peoples circumstances have now changed and we should be able to choose if we still want to go abroad or not.
