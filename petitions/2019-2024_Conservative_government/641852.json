        "action": "Stop car insurance companies charging so much for insurance for new drivers 17+.",
        "additional_details": "As a 17-year-old, the high car insurance costs can be overwhelming due to limited financial resources and the fact that insurance companies often view young drivers as higher risk, leading to unaffordable premiums. By regulating these charges, the government can make car insurance more affordable and equitable, encouraging responsible driving behaviour and enabling young drivers to participate fully in society without facing disproportionate financial challenges.",
        "background": "I strongly urge the UK government to regulate exorbitant car insurance premiums for new drivers aged 17 and above, as they hinder access to affordable coverage and vital mobility. Implementing measures like reasonable premium limits and safe driving incentives can create fairness and road safety.",
