Please keep the winter timing. \r\nThis was quite crucial when Britain used to have a mining industry and other forms of industry that needed long working hours. However, the situation is quite different nowadays, as one hour of sleeping time is taken away from children. Children will find it much more challenging to fall asleep until dark and it turns dark at 10:00 pm therefore they will be tired waking up early and sleeping late, also difficult for Muslim to fast when Ramadan the holy month in summer time, that would give extra 2 hours eating for them.",
