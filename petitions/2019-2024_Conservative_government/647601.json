        "background": "you must make period products free. if men had periods they would be free but because it\u2019s women we have to pay every month. for example, condoms are free, there for men. you don\u2019t have to have sex. every woman has a period. it\u2019s not fair and it\u2019s not right. it needs to be changed.",
