        "additional_details": "Social media is rife with altered images of bodies and faces. As an image editor myself, I have the knowledge, skill and resources to alter my images, and will admit to doing so in the past. I now know how damaging that is, not only to myself but to others who see my images. Norway\u2019s Ministry of Children and Family Affairs has now made it illegal for influencers and advertisers to share retouched photos on social media, now we should follow, for the mental health of all who use social media.",
        "background": "I'm asking for the UK Government/Parliament to either ban or make into law that images that have been drastically altered and are to be published on social media have a clear warning that they have been altered - much like how warnings about Covid-19 have been placed on images.",
