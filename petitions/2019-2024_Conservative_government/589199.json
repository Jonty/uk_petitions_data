        "additional_details": "Think about how hard many of us have worked over the last 18months with many of us keeping our residents safe the whole time just by following our infection control policies and procedures. To make us loose our jobs because of our own individual opinions is not fair or just. It will be our residents that will end up suffering the most throughout the country.",
        "background": "I want the goverment to realise that people in health care have worked hard, some for many years to get where they are in their career. Many have their own personal reasons for not having the vaccine. For the goverment to force a vaccine upon us with already having staff shortages is a crazy idea.",
