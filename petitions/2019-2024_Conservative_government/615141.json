        "additional_details": "The UK has every right to deport illegal immigrants but sending asylum seekers to one of the world's poorest countries with the worst records on human rights violations is simply cruel. UK's opposition and the human rights groups have strongly condemned the scheme and called it an 'inhumane, disgraceful, cruel, and repellent act'. This has been slammed as an 'egregious breach of international law' and 'really unacceptable' by the UN Refugee Agency. The UK must immediately withdraw this scheme.",
        "background": "Priti Patel has signed an agreement on migration with Rwanda. This is to transport UK Asylum seekers to Rwanda, in Central Africa. The Rwandan government will decide under their law whether the migrants get to stay or leave. Whoever gets asylum will only be able to stay for 5 years in Rwanda.",
