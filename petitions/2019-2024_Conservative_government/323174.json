        "additional_details": "A reduction in the number of weeks children are off for the summer over the next 2 years will allow a lot of what they have missed to be caught up too.\r\nEnsuring that teacher training days take place on the last day of the school holidays instead of what is supposed to be the first day back after a break will also allow for more schooling to take place.\r\nOur children's education has suffered enough because of COVID-19, it's time to start making steps to get back to some form of normality.",
        "background": "Children of all ages need to get back to their education. Ensuring that all children get back to school before the summer break will also have the knock on effect of allowing more adults to return to work too, thus giving a much needed boost to industry and the economy.",
