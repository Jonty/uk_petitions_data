        "background": "We support the efficient running of trains, but this is completely irresponsible when we have little time to tackle climate change, & can't wait 100 yrs for trees to grow back. This is short sighted cost cutting.  Being a major carbon sink & wildlife habitat this needs urgent reconsideration.",
