We feel as if the government haven\u2019t done enough to help and support us. On top of dealing with a pandemic some students have had to stay away from home and their families and even spend Christmas by themselves. Also, online teaching is not enough for the price that we pay. \u00a39250 to sit in a room and be expected to produce the same quality of work is unacceptable and impossible.",
        "background": "Give refunds or at least some form of discount from student fees. We have not received the level of education that we are paying for so deserve compensation, or at least some form of support from our government.",
