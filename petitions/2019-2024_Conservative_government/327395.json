It is a legal and life-changing bond that allows them to live together and begin a new life as husband and wife. It is frustrating that the Government have readily allowed people to now go shopping in crowded shopping centres for non-essential things like hair bobbles and socks, yet the truly life-changing event which they have looked forward to for years and will be looked back on as 'the best day of their lives' is strictly forbidden.",
