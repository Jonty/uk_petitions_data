        "action": "Ban the use of Private Jets in UK airspace",
        "additional_details": "Almost 8,000 new private jets are expected to be bought by multinational companies and the super-rich over the next decade, with the market greatly expanding.\r\nThese jets will burn 40 times as much carbon per passenger as regular commercial flights. \r\nThere are currently no plans to restrict the use of private jets. Fossil fuel powered cars are being banned which will affect the lives and livelihoods of the majority of people whilst the elite fly overhead with no restrictions.",
        "background": "The Government must ban flights by private jets within UK airspace. Private jets are the most carbon producing means of transport and are not necessary with over 99.9% of the UK population not using them. The UK has a chance to be a world leader in this action to prevent climate change.",
