Capital punishment is completely unacceptable, as are all forms of prejudice and negative discrimination, and abolishing these laws could help make Northern Ireland a better place.",
        "background": "The Government should make the Northern Irish Assembly repeal blasphemy laws. Not only can they make non-Christians feel discriminated against, they can also encourage stricter regimes, such as Saudi Arabia, to continue their practice of capital punishment for blasphemy and apostasy.",
