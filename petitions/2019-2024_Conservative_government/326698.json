        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to keep Sir Thomas Guys statue and every other historic monument built so people can learn about the history. We learn from the past to build a better future and without these people things would be so much different now. Therefore I am asking on behalf of everyone signing this petition to allow any statues, monument or any other historic items that are able to be viewed in the public eye to remain in the public eye.",
        "background": "History should be spoken about, taught and learnt from and taking away statue built in remembrance of people should not be taken down because of what happened in a time where such things where legal. Sir Thomas Guy sponsored Guy\u2019s and St Thomas hospital whilst leaving \u00a3219,499 in his will to help",
