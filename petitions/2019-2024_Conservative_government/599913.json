        "additional_details": "The inconsistent application of 'fully vaccinated' is both confusing and unfair.\r\n\r\nCertain overseas administered vaccines and their associated certification (eg EU Digital COVID Certificate) are accepted for exemption to quarantine on arrival in England, they should also be accepted by T&T.\r\n\r\nThis is a distinct issue to recognising one or both of British residents'/citizens' overseas administered vaccines and adding them to their NHS record so they are also eligible for an NHS COVID Pass.",
        "background": "The government should accept the same definition of 'fully vaccinated' for exemption from self isolation when identified by the Test and Trace (T&T) programme as a 'contact' that it does for travel to England and exemption from quarantine.",
