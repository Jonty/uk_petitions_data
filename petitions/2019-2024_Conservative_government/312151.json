        "additional_details": "The current crisis is similar to a wartime scenario, those on the front line are endangering their health to keep the rest of the population safe. This is an heroic act. These workers, from the cleaners and admin. staff through to the Nurses, Doctors and Consultants are putting themselves on the line, often with scant training and sometimes with little protection and always for long hours - some have already lost their life. I believe we should honour them as a Nation.",
        "background": "To celebrate the great work being done during the Coronavirus crisis by all those working in these great institutions of our state - the NHS and Care Sector.\r\nTo then present these medals locally at the Town Hall or County Hall with a celebration event.",
