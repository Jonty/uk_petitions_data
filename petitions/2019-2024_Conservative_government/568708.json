        "additional_details": "Recently A-level and GCSE exams 2021 have been cancelled. As online learning continues there are still plans for mocks once we return to school/college. Online learning has impacted some students more than others as some students don\u2019t have a quiet place to work, or the technology. Furthermore, potential mocks are causing students to worry as there is huge gaps of knowledge, some schools are doing online calls whilst others are working through emails which is creating unequal chances.",
        "background": "Exams have been cancelled and replaced by teacher assessment. However, the cancelled exams have been brought forward a couple of months and renamed as mocks. With huge gaps of knowledge this has caused students major stress as there is still a wide range of content planned to be on the mocks.",
