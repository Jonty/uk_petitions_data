        "additional_details": "The announcement of the European Super League is an existential threat to UK and European football at all levels.  It needs to be answered in the only language the 12 participants understand: money.  If the ESL participants know that 98% of their revenues from taking part in this non-sanctioned competition will be forfeit, it should kill the competition stone dead.  In the unlikely event it does not, the revenues can be used to boost the grass roots (League 1 and below).",
        "background": "Legislate to impose a 98% super tax on any revenues of UK-based professional football clubs derived from participation in a competition which is not sanctioned by UEFA, FIFA or one of the domestic FAs, and distribute the revenues to grass roots football.",

            "details": "We understand you're concerned about English clubs joining the proposed European Super League (ESL), however since you started your petition the Government has clearly expressed its opposition to the plans and the six participating English clubs have all withdrawn, as you may know, so there will be no ESL revenues which could be taxed.\r\n\r\nOn Monday 19 April the Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden MP said that he was appalled by the announcement that a handful of clubs are proposing to form their own breakaway European league, ands said the Government would not hesitate to protect one of our greatest national institutions: football. The Culture Secretary said that the Government would back the football authorities to stop this move, and if the football authorities couldn\u2019t act, the Government would. The Culture Secretary said the Government would \"put everything on the table to prevent this from happening.\"\r\n\r\nYou can read the Culture Secretary's full statement on the European Super League here: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-by-oliver-dowden-on-the-european-super-league\r\n\r\nYou can read a report about the English clubs' withdrawal from the European Super League here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/56823501.\r\n\r\nFurther, on 19 April the Government announced a 'Fan-led review of football governance', which will explore ways of improving the governance, ownership and financial sustainability of clubs in English football, building on the strengths of the football pyramid.
