        "additional_details": "Introduction of Herd Immunity is gone lead to a lot of deaths in the UK Population. Immunologist and Epidemiologist from around the world don't support it. We shouldn't allow half a million of our population to die when we can introduce stringent isolation controls to help slow down the viral spread. From my research herd immunity prevents second waves of outbreaks but only works with influenza outbreaks. Coronavirus is not influenza. We need tough action to stop this NOW.",
        "background": "The government needs to do more than expose the general population to the Corona Virus so we possibly develop immunity. This action will cause 300,000 to 500,000 people to loose their lives. The government should not sacrifice people in this way but work 200% to save as many as they can.",
