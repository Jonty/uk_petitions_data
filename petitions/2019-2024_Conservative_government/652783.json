        "additional_details": "UK citizens working hard to build a life with their foreign spouses face hurdles meeting the \u00a318,600 annual requirement for a UK Spouse visa. The government's proposal to double this threshold endangers these dreams just as they near their goal. The existing threshold challenges hardworking Brits with modest incomes. Any increase would strain us more, risking our peaceful cohabitation with our partners. We hope the government reconsider this proposal which could ruin many families.",
        "background": "Is there a chance to reconsider the increased financial requirements for UK Spouse Visas? It seems to be causing strain on families and creating obstacles for Brits.",
