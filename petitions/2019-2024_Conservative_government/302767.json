        "additional_details": "During the Corona Virus outbreak, the main hesitation for not shutting schools is that pupils will miss out on important work. However, with online school, students can remain safe in their homes while not interrupting studies in order to reduce risk of catching Corona Virus. This is an excellent alternative for students with important exams coming up, e.g. GCSEs or A-levels, and has proved to have worked successfully in other countries, like the US.",
        "background": "Each school should have an online school set up so that teachers and students can have their lessons over videochat, and and will be able to continue with lessons in the safety of their own home.",
