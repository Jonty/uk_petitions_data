You could therefore raise your issue with a local councillor who represents you. You can find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them, by entering your post code here:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\r\nYou could also start a petition on the Essex Council website asking them to create some form of exemption from parking requirements for delivery drivers in your area, if that is something you'd like to see happen. You can find out how to do this here: https://www.essex.gov.uk/get-involved/petitions."
