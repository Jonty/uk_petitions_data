        "additional_details": "Pet Insurance as a financial product is governed by the FOS, but there is no governance around renewals.  There is over 50 million domestic pets in the UK, a 1.1 Billion pound per year business.  People are struggling to pay for pet care due to the growing costs.  Pets are dying as the costs increase year on year.  The Government needs to review what is happening in this industry and ensure that this sector is treating everyone fairly and not putting profit before affordability of care.",
        "background": "I want the UK Parliament to look into better regulation of Pet Insurance.  There is no set criteria to how they manage the renewal of premiums meaning that some providers are charging over 50% increase year on year with an unfair risk rating.",
