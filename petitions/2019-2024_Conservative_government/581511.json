        "action": "Allow Non-Binary to be a 'gender' option on legal and medical documentation.",
        "additional_details": "It's been 3 years since the last petition was discussed that included non-binary gender, since then there has been no notable change to include non-binary gender on legal documentation. This is something that can negatively impact those who identify as non-binary. Recent changes by some countries including but not limited to Canada, Australia and Argentina and these countries have studies showing how these changes have positively impacted the lives of people who identify as non-binary.",
        "background": "With the growing number of people self-identifying as a non-binary gender within the UK it is only right that they should be able to have this stated on their Identification or legal documents. Other counties updating their transgender rights to include non-binary, it's about time the UK catch up.",
