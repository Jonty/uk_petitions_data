        "additional_details": "I switched to vaping with a few friends after smoking 60 a day for over 40 years. The tank being so small means not only do you need to fill it more often but you also need to carry refill bottles with you when you go out. The bottle size limit is just as frustrating as if you are a heavy user, for example me switching to vaping after smoking so much i need a few refill bottles and dread running out when the shops are closed. My friends are all back on cigs, could not be bothered with the hassle",
        "background": "The vape tank size limit should be increased or removed from the TPD, the same applies to the eliquid refill bottle sizes. They achieve nothing but the frustration of people who are trying to switch from smoking, push up costs for consumers and increase the amout of packaging ending up as waste.",
