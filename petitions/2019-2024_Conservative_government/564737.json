        "additional_details": "As COVID-19 is a global issue and affects everyone I don't belive that it is a party political issue and believe that all UK parties will want to come forward and show a sign of respect for those who have passed away due to COVID-19. Many people across the country came together to celebrate the NHS but the deaths have now became just a statistic and those who have losses loved ones will feel supported if Parliament would help remember those who have unfortunately passed away.",
        "background": "I believe that we should remember all those who have died during the battle with COVID-19 and a national day or remberance/mourning will help those who have lost loved ones by showing them that the nation will rember each loss.",
