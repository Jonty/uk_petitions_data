We want change so there is a world for us to leave to our children. We want change because we don\u2019t want to be the wretched race that destroyed so much beauty because we couldn\u2019t get our heads out of our arses. We want change and to calm the aggression this gluttonous way of life causes. We want respect for our mother Earth.",
