They are also a fire hazard and pose a risk to all properties, and are a huge drain on the resources of all our overstretched emergency services.  At the most fundamental level, they are littering, which usually incurs a fine if caught.\r\nNight or sky lanterns have no place in the future of our country which seeks to encourage wildlife to thrive, whilst reducing unnecessary waste.",
