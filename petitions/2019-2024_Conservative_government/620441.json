        "additional_details": "The government should be doing whatever possible to facilitate schools being climate resilient going into the future. Children have already missed enough learning due to the pandemic, they don\u2019t need more missed time due to extreme classroom temperatures putting their health at risk. Closing schools is not a solution as many families are already struggling and may not have suitable cooling facilities at home either. Government must help to make schools safe environments for children.",
        "background": "Due to climate change, extreme weather events are occurring with increasing frequency. It is unreasonable to expect staff and students to work in classrooms which were not designed to withstand 35-40 degree temperatures, and school budgets are too overstretched to afford effective solutions.",
