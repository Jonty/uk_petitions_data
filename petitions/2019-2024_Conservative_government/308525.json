        "action": "Require universities to reduce students tuition fees during Covid-19 closures",
        "additional_details": "Many students losing semesters of contact hours can still access online support, though this was previously available. Open University estimates tuition fees with minimal to no contact hours at around \u00a34,000 a year. University tuition fees are \u00a39,000 a year due to having contact hours. Whilst university remains closed, students are not accessing this, though still paying - the disparity is clear. We are asking that parliament reduce tuition fee costs for the time that universities remain closed.",
        "background": "We urge Parliament to demand that universities reduce the fees corresponding to lost services, as students must pay fees in full even when contact hours are lost due to closure for public health. The loss of contact hours should be reflected in the \u00a39,000 tuition fee cost and adequately reduced.",
