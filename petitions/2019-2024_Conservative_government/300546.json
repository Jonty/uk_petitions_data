Drivers who have held a license for less than two years, the license would be revoked under the Road Traffic (New Drivers) Act 1995 (Samuals, 1995). Mobile-phone use has a detrimental impact of performance on crucial manoeuvres when driving a vehicle (Hancock et al., 1999; 2003). The likelihood of a car accident is more than four times greater when the driver uses a mobile-phone (Redelmeier & Tibshirani, 1997).",
