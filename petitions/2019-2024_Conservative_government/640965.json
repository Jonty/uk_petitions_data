        "additional_details": "I won't receive the full pay deal despite working in the NHS at a GP surgery as a Practice Nurse. The DOH + NHS England are not funding this. Hearing that I will not be receiving the lump sum was so disheartening. Friends who I started my career with in 1989 and now work in Hospitals are all receiving the lump sum. I believe the general public are not aware of this disparity. There are many Nurses in my position who feel this is unfair and unjust and feel unappreciated and undervalued",
        "background": "Reconsider funding the lump sum for 2022 to 2023 as part of the Nurses Pay deal for Nurses working in social enterprises such as GP practices who are not presently entitled to it and to facilitate the same terms and conditions as our NHS counterparts on Agenda For Change.",
