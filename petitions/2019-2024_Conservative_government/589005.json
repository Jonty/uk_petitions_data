However, there is no national ban on students doing so, so we're not sure what it is you'd like the Government to do. The setting of uniform policies, including any rules relating to the wearing of shorts, is a matter for individual schools and academy trusts, not the UK Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou could have a petition calling on the Government to require all schools to allow students to wear shorts in hot weather, if that is something you'd like to see happen.\r\n\r\nYou may also like to sign this petition which calls for a very similar action: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/588797"
