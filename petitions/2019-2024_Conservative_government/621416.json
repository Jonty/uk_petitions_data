It's not clear if you want the Government to reimburse any childcare costs people are eligible for as part of their Universal Credit entitlement immediately, or in some other way.\r\n\r\nYou can claim back up to 3 months of future childcare costs, and these costs will be paid back month by month.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about Universal Credit childcare costs here: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/universal-credit-childcare-costs\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
