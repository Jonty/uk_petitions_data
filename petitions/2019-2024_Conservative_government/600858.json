More than 70 million deaf people around the world use sign languages to communicate. Sign language allows them to learn, work, access services, and be included in their communities. Why are hearing and deaf communities so segregated? Let\u2019s sign!",
        "background": "I would like to have sign language taught in schools because we have different types of languages we can learn but not everyone can go abroad but anyone can be born deaf. And I would like to interact with the deaf community. It really should be a compulsory law I can\u2019t understand why it isn\u2019t?",
