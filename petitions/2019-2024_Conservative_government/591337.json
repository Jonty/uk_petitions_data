        "additional_details": "We as nursery workers are teaching and raising the future. Key workers such as doctors, the NHS, Police, Ambulance services and teachers are able to provide their service to the community because we are taking care of their children. This job role affects workers, not only physically but also mentally on a day to day basis. Poor pay, increasing work load and low status is forcing staff out of the profession.",
        "background": "We want the Government to grant a pay rise for nursery workers and nursery apprentices. We have a huge responsibility to raise and teach a great number of children with poor pay and a high amount of work load. We prepare the children for school, as we help them develop all aspects of the EYFS.",
