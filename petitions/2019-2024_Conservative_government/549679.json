        "additional_details": "Great Britain considers itself a multicultural nation. In recent events it has become apparent that certain cultures and traditions consume dog meat. The Government should consider making the farming and consumption of dogs legal to accommodate these cultures. \r\nDog numbers in Britain are continuing to grow. If measures aren't taken soon the country will be overrun with dogs. So animals should also be taken from shelters to relieve the pressure on this system.",
        "background": "To introduce legal free range farming of dogs for human consumption. To ensure that all slaughter is performed in the same humane method used for cows, pigs, chicken etc. \r\nAlso consider harvesting the females milk for the use of cheese and other dairy products.",
