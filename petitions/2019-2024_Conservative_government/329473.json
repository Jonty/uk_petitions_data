        "additional_details": "Fracking/oil & gas drilling on the Island would be economically disastrous for the \u201choliday Isle\u201d as the suggested sites are areas that welcome a high volume of tourists. Furthermore, the decision to further exploit natural gas & oil runs counter to the government\u2019s position in facing climate change. Put simply, our government should not stand for further fossil fuel extraction and should instead seek to find alternative sources of energy.",
        "background": "The government should intervene to prevent the drilling of oil or gas on the Isle of Wight. Proposed plans would see exploratory wells dug with the potential for further drilling.",
