        "action": "Raise the limit on attendees at weddings in England from 15 back to 30",
        "additional_details": "The new limit is arbitrary and ridiculous because:\r\n-Current rules still allow much larger numbers of people in pubs or restaurants\r\n-Places of worship are still allowed to set their own occupancy limits on ordinary services, but not for wedding services\r\n-Funerals are still allowed 30 attendees\r\n-No evidence suggests that wedding services or receptions contribute more to transmission of Covid-19 than other gatherings\r\n\r\nWe therefore call for the reversal of this inconsistent, non-evidenced decision.",
        "background": "On the 22/9/2020 the Government reduced the number of people allowed at wedding services and receptions from 30 to 15 for up to 6 months. This arbitrary change causes yet more disruption to wedding plans, placing unnecessary additional mental stress on couples who have planned ceremonies this year.",
