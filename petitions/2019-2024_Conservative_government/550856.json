        "additional_details": "It would not cost the government anything.\r\n \r\nIt would be a good use of public money. Having people paid by the government do nothing is a waste of a very valuable resource.\r\n \r\nFurloughed staff brought back to work are much less likely to be made redundant as they are visible, part of a team and making valuable contributions.\r\n \r\nIt would reduce the mental health issues that are very worryingly on the rise.\r\n \r\nThe benefits of allowing this would far outweigh any possible fraudulent use of furlough.",
        "background": "The government is desperate for businesses not make employees redundant when furlough comes to an end.\r\n\r\nThe ability for employees to work whilst on furlough for the remainder of furlough would make a huge difference to the possibility of survival for many businesses.",
