        "additional_details": "I and many British citizens now no longer feel welcome in our own country. The country we were born in. Because we had the audacity to fall in love with a foreign national. Our choices, given the drastic increase in salary requirements is either break off the relationship or leave the UK behind. Families will be torn apart by this reckless and cruel change.\r\n\r\nThe government MUST rethink this decision or risk losing hard working citizens. Our rights as British citizens are being stolen.",
