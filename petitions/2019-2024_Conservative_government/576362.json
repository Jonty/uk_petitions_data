At Good Mental Health we see the results daily and know how much people are going to need support to come out of this. Children will face the impact for years to come, adults have had to adjust to a way of life that will leave emotional scars and frontline workers will be dealing with the impact of things they have faced for the rest of their lives. Institutional support is needed to ensure we move forward.",
