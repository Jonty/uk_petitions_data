Allow a legitimate regulated safe market taxed by yourselves. For example you could work with other countries such as canada to provide the necessary frame work to move forward with legislation. Cannabis is a naturally grown plant which is medicinally proven to be beneficial to many people, far more than the likes of alchole which has never had a positive outcome from consumption.",
        "background": "Stop trying to crackdown on drug dealers and move for decriminalisation and legalisation of weed.By doing this you will remove the demand for drug dealers where you can also provide safe medication and tax all recreational use,which in turn would massively boost the economy and decrease drug addicts",
