They will continue to live in fear and self-imposed isolation.\r\nc) People cannot take steps to protect the most vulnerable (whether they are colleagues/friends/family).\r\nd) Others countries such as Sth Korea have been able to manage the outbreak through testing resulting in less extreme lockdowns.",
