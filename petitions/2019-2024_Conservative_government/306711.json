This will allow the self-employed sector to see this through & bounce back when it is over.",
        "background": "Government support for self-employed (Coronavirus) is insufficient & unfair. It will not cover ongoing business costs. Self-employed will not be able to cover costs, eg mortgages,vehicles,machinery,rents. Gov. must be realistic & realise without support self-employed \u201csmall businesses\u201d will fail.",
