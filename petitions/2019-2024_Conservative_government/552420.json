Recovery meetings are not a social gathering. Recovery meetings have been using social distancing measures, track and trace, providing hand sanitiser, cleaning, and face masks in order to be COVID secure. We are asking that venues who adhere to social distancing rules to continue to be allowed to hold meetings of up to 30 people.",
