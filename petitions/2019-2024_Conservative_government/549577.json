You can find more information here: https://www.hse.gov.uk/involvement/riskassessments.htm\r\n\r\nYou may wish to sign this petition:\r\n\r\nDon't make the wearing of face masks compulsory in public places in England: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/331174\r\n            \r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
