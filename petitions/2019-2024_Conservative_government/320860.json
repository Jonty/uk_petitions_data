        "additional_details": "I think that the exams next year should be reconsidered as exams are already stressful. Being unable to receive months of help is going to make taking the exams next year significantly harder. Studying and learning the courses from home is not the same and is much more difficult as we don\u2019t have all the same resources and face to face help.",
        "background": "In 2021, current year 10s and 12s will be sitting their GCSEs and A-Levels. I think it is unfair that we are going to have to learn a whole course within months before going into the revision phase of preparation. We are losing valuable time and learning from home isn\u2019t the same.",
