        "additional_details": "I have read articles claiming that the clock changes have adverse effects on our health. Whilst I have not seen the specific research that corroborates that conclusion, my own recent experience with my 9-month-old baby and the clock change's impact on her sleeping pattern has been cause enough for me to question daylight-saving's existence. Appearing as a resolution to a World War era issue, in modern times the disadvantages seem to far outweigh the advantages.",
