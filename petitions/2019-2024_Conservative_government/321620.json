        "additional_details": "There is much research of the absolute importance of nurturing in the Early Years. Reception teachers see the effects of poor nurturing, across all areas of development. Many of these children will go on to have criminal, addiction, or mental health issues.\r\nSocial distancing is totally inappropriate for a young child - closeness is a need. \r\nThe vast majority of children in the Early Years should be nurtured at home until  they can be safely nurtured in their Nursery, Reception or Year 1 Class.",
