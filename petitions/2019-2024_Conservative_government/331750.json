        "additional_details": "Due to the impact Covid 19 has had on the housing sector, this has made many people unable to purchase a property on the current help to buy scheme due to completion dates being put back. From April 1st 2021 the scheme will only be available to first time buyers and there will be much lower spending caps on properties available. \r\nThe Scottish government has already pledged to extend their scheme until March 2022 so I urge the same to happen throughout the UK",
        "background": "I would like the government to extend the current help to buy scheme for up to 12 months so help buyers complete a purchase that has now been affected by COVID-19",
