We think this is unreasonable.\r\n \r\nThe Government has said that this scheme is designed to target the 'able to pay' market, but excludes SO and SH tenants. Many shared owners may be priced out of the market by lending and affordability criteria, but retain a reasonable disposable income.\r\n \r\nFor a 2 bed semi-detached house, a heat pump can be installed from as little as \u00a3500 after the BUS. There are many in SH and SO who could afford \u00a3500 to unlock cheaper energy bills in the future.\r\n",
