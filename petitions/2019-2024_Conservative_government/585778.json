        "additional_details": "I believe that over the last 300 years the UK has been a force for good. It has given the British Isles the social and economic stability that any nation needs to thrive and it has acted as a force multiplier, making us all greater than the sum of our parts when it comes to the power and influence we project to the outside world. To disrupt the current union would diminish us all for no obvious gain, and we should not be allowed to squander any more precious resources on discussing its breakup",
        "background": "To create legislation that would prevent the devolved UK national governments from promoting initiatives that would give them a mandate to leave the current union in whole or in part. The devolved governments should be allowed to govern as they do now, but not as independent nation states",
