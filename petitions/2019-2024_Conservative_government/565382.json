        "additional_details": "In addition to seeing their businesses destroyed by Covid 19, small business owners face the additional hardship of personal guarantees (PGs) on debt, something banks insist on nowadays for most small businesses. PGs will bankrupt our small business owners who've already lost their livelihoods due to Covid 19. They may lose their homes and be  prevented from starting new businesses. We need our entrepreneurs now more than ever. So let's support them by giving them a fresh start.",
        "background": "Protect our small business owners affected by the Covid 19 pandemic. Allow them a fresh start by nullifying personal guarantees on debt that\u2019s un-payable due to Covid 19. Prevent them from losing their homes. Allow them to start again, with a clean slate, so they can help rebuild our economy.",
