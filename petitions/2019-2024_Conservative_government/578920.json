        "additional_details": "Police officers are entrusted with protecting the public, sometimes that also means carrying a weapon. Policing by consent means that we, the public, agree to the police having certain powers over us. It is therefore only right that potential officers undergo stringent psychological assessment.\r\nThis will help to ensure that suitable candidates are fit for the role, and also that officers' mental health is valued. Therefore prioritising the safety and wellbeing both of officers and of the public.",
        "background": "This petition is asking for a review of any existing psychological screening, that real psychological assessment is made a basic part of recruitment, and that all current serving officers periodically undergo assessment, particularly following traumatic situations. To be consistent across forces.",
