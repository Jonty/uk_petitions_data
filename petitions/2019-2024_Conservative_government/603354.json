        "additional_details": "Too many men do not get diagnosed with prostate cancer until they have symptoms and by then the cancer can be in an advanced stage. This often means more radical treatment or that no treatment can cure the cancer \r\nRegular PSA tests would show any abnormalities in the prostate at an early  stage which will lead to early intervention and a potentially better outcome.\r\nUnlike bowel cancer screening, there is at present no regular Prostate cancer screening. PSA checks are a cheap and simple way of screening for potential prostate cancer.",
        "background": "Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men. Unlike mammograms and smear tests for women, no regular checks are available for this cancer. A regular PSA test could help in diagnosing prostate cancer before it becomes advanced.",
