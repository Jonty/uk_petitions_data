It doesn't mean that it doesn't cause other problems though.\r\n\r\nRecognised journals and societies have shown links between sweetener and anaphylaxis, glucose intolerance, Crohns, migraines, increased depression and weight gain. There's also known examples of urinary issues in children. The Harvard Medical School linked sweetener to type 2 diabetes.\r\n\r\nThere's also no research into the long term effects on the population.",
        "background": "The increased use of sweetener in many of today's drinks has lead to numerous health issues amongst both children and adults. The tax needs to be eliminated and sweeteners should now be listed as allergens. The focus should be shifted to making sure people have sugar in moderation.",
