Businesses unable to stay open and are trying to keep afloat.\r\nMP\u2019s being offered \u00a310,000 to work from home as extra money is disgraceful at a time when most are struggling. \r\nThe money should be better spent where it\u2019s needed....the NHS! They deserve the extra, they deserve the bonus, they deserve the recognition, they deserve it not the MP\u2019s!!!!",

MP\u2019s are no different and will still have a salary coming in but many others aren\u2019t and are struggling. The money pledged here should go straight into the NHS for PPE or for bonuses for their hard work at this time.",
