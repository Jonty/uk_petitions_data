        "action": "Ban cryptocurrencies' mining and transactions as action to fight climate change",
        "additional_details": "On top of the energy usage, crypto mining requires millions of computers, semiconductors, other equipment which could be needed elsewhere, water for cooling, and space for mining farms. It also has a huge carbon footprint.\r\nCryptocurrencies enable criminals, drug and arm dealers to make easy, secret money transfers, out of any control. \r\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies made the biggest financial pyramid in history.\r\nBlockchain technology, useful for other purposes, but not investment, should be regulated by government.",
        "background": "Carrying out cryptocurrency transactions requires the work of millions of computers calculating each transaction. Just Bitcoin alone consumes 0,46% global electricity production (Yougov, 21.10.2021), more than Argentina usage , or approximately 1/3 of all coal power stations\u2019 production in the EU.",
