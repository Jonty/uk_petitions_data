        "additional_details": "This will create a huge divide between the vaccinated and unvaccinated.\r\n\r\nIt will affect many business\u2019 as they will lose the custom of the unvaccinated. \r\n\r\nSomeone who is vaccinated can carry covid and spread this around. A negative test should be suffice for everyone. \r\n\r\nA vaccine should be a choice and there are people unable to have this vaccine. \r\n\r\nIf a business decides to do this, let them. But do not make it compulsory and penalise business\u2019 as well as mental health once more.",
        "background": "The government plans to make covid passports compulsory for nightclubs and large venues , where a negative test will not be suffice. \r\n\r\nWe have been fine for months without this & it is highly discriminatory and against human rights to demand such a thing.",
