        "additional_details": "Other countries like Australia,Ireland,New Zealand,Italy and Germany all use a form of proportional representation. Why dosen\u2019t the UK? For example, if the Conservative party got 30% of the vote they\u2019d get 30 seats and if Labour got 29% they\u2019d get 29 seats. This means voters that don\u2019t bother to vote will be encouraged to as their vote would be directly and fairly counted.",
        "background": "This would represent the other countries in the union more as England currently holds 533 seats in the House of Commons which means it is the most represented country by far. Switching would make the UK democratic by representing all parties equally.",

Your petition suggests that proportional representation would better represent Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but the number of English MPs is roughly equivalent to the proportion of the UK electorate that live in England, so introducing proportional representation would not reduce the representation of English votes.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining more clearly what new voting system you would like to be introduced."
