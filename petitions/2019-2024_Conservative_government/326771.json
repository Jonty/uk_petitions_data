        "additional_details": "I think it\u2019s unacceptable that key workers have to help contribute to the debt caused by the furlough scheme. Whilst the majority of population have enjoyed months of free time and free money, the crucial key workers have and still are putting their lives on the line and have had nothing but a pitiful clap to show for it. So I\u2019m asking out of an act of decency to make all key worker staff exempt from the tax increase as if it weren\u2019t for them the country would be in an even bigger crisis.",
        "background": "I want all key workers to be exempt from the addition tax increase that\u2019s is to follow post ending the furlough scheme.",
