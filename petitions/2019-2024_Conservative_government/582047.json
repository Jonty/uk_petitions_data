        "action": "Remove Pakistan from the Red List for Covid",
        "additional_details": "We believe that putting Pakistan in the red list of countries by UK government is discriminating and not based on scientific facts.  Pakistan has much lower incidence of Covid cases and deaths per  million than many other countries which are not on this list.  Infact, WHO has praised Pakistan on its handling of Covid.\r\nThis decision seems to be biased and should be immediately reversed.  There is a large UK population of Pakistan descent who are facing difficulty due to travel restrictions.",
        "background": "We recommend that Pakistan should be taken out from the so called red list of countries with immediate effect.  The decision is an unfair and discriminatory one and is causing major issues for a large segment of UK population which has strong connections with Pakistan.",
