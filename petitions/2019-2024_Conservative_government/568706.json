        "additional_details": "School children present very little risk to the wider community in terms of covid transmission. \r\n\r\nSchools provide far more than an academic education. They are a major framework for their emotional and social development too. \r\n\r\nProlonged withdrawal of school will have a detrimental long term effect that will impact our social, economic, and medical wellbeing for years to come.\r\n\r\nThey are the ones that will have to repay this covid debt AND perform on a post-Brexit world stage. Reopen schools.",
        "background": "Further closures and subsequent dumbing down of our education system is a betrayal, and a wholly selfish act, of this low risk group.\r\n\r\nResources should be prioritised to enable teacher vaccination and to reinstate education quality.",
