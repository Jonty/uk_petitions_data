        "additional_details": "There should be a difference between the people who have been vaccinated and those who opt out of getting vaccinated.\r\nThis will develop the trust of people in the vaccines and compel more people to become vaccinated. The strict 10 day period at home will ensure that the virus does not spread, if any passenger is infected.",
        "background": "The separate airport terminal for red zone countries already ensures that there is no cross contamination. Hence, it is pleaded that passengers who have been given UK approved vaccines should be able to quarantine at home even if returning from Red zone countries.",
