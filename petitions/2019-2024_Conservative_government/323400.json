        "additional_details": "The UK's Fashion industry is worth \u00a332bn, making it the UK's largest creative industry. As a London based fashion designer going freelance mid 2019 was great; until Covid-19 paralysed the fashion industry, hire freezes and demand for work grinding to a halt.\u00a0\r\nBy cutting us out from the SEISS, it has been devastating for people all over the country. If the self-employed income support scheme isn't extended to the 2019 newly self employed, many of us won't be able to survive on JSA or U.Credits.",
        "background": "Most of the self-employed have been successfully covered by the SEISS, but a lifeline has yet to be given to the 2019 newly self-employed, now unable to find/resume work. JSA and Universal Credits just doesn't fair up at \u00a374pw (\u00a3320pm) which is a far cry from \u00a32500pm for those on furlough or SEISS.",
