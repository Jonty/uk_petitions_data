These companies should not be allowed to continue their rampant profiteering, supported by Ofgem.  We have no desire to return to the 1970s when ice would gather on our windows.  We have moved on as a society.  Plus jamais  \u00e7a! Enough is enough.",
        "background": "To instruct Ofgem and the gas and electricity companies to cap their increases at 10 % maximum, better still freeze the annual cost at the current rate.  Otherwise people will freeze and starve.   These companies are making obscene profits and Ofgem should act in the interests of the consumer.",
