        "additional_details": "The recognition of those working on the front line during the Covid 19 pandemic should not be paid in doorstep claps. The daily dangers faced in their ongoing service to the general public should be paid back properly and monetarily. Frontline key workers should have a temporary higher hourly wage, or be paid a fixed-rate hazard bonus for each day worked. This should be in place for the duration of current and subsequent national lockdowns.",
        "background": "Those unable to shield themselves should be rewarded for their front line service and dedication. The government should support public services and private businesses which continue to operate during lockdown with further financial input.",
