        "additional_details": "Several study\u2019s have found a connection between higher levels of neonicotinoid residues and lower bee reproduction, with a reduced number of queen bees in bumblebee hives and less egg cells in solitary bee nests. In 2018 the EU agreed a ban on all outdoor uses of three neonicotinoid insecticides to protect bees. However since 2018, multiple emergency uses of the pesticide have been allowed in the EU. In January 2021 the uk government granted emergency use in the UK. We call for a total ban.",
        "background": "Neonicotinoid pesticides, which kill bees, are still allowed to be used in the UK for emergency purposes. We want the government to completely ban this toxic chemical in order to protect our declining bee population and raise environmental standards.",
