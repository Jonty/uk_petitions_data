        "additional_details": "The recent announcement and clarification of the Government grants to help support furloughed worker, because of the COVID-19 outbreak.\r\nSimply, workers not on employers PAYE system before 28February are ineligible for government Job Retention Scheme.\r\nIn summary, workers who started a new job after 28February are not entitled to claim the 80% of their salary.\r\nThis is a massive oversight and puts thousands of workers, who have recently changed jobs, at risk and left without pay because of an apparent loophole in the government's Job Retention Scheme.",
        "background": "This decree is putting thousands of workers at risk, laid off across our country having no income in this current economy.\r\n\r\nPersonally, after paying tax for almost 10 years and starting a new job on 2nd of March, I cannot believe that we are without any sort of income.",
