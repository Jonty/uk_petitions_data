        "additional_details": "SDLT is a poor government policy and abolishing it will bring many economic and social benefits. This includes the additional dwelling supplement. \r\n\r\n1. Greater personal freedom and liberty for people to move house.\r\n2. Better use of housing space through people being able to move up and down the housing ladder when needed. \r\n3. Greater labour mobility due to people being able to move more freely for work.\r\n4. Increase housing transactions giving economic benefits.",
        "background": "For house buyers SDLT is a material amount of tax charged for buying a home. This tax typically occurs at points in life where finances are stretched and penalises flexibility. SDLT (and its devolved equivalents) should be abolished so that there are no taxes on buying houses in the UK.",
