        "additional_details": "The hospitality sector is the fourth largest sector in the UK employing millions of people.  It was affected pre lockdown prior to the 23rd March and continues to be one of, if not the worst affected sector with over 600 thousand job losses this year with many more expected if action isn\u2019t taken immediately.  The sector needs to be open and allowed to trade, it\u2019s also desperate for additional financial support.  To date, most lobbying has fallen well short and its become desperate.",
        "background": "Address the desperate situation the Hospitality sector finds its self in, there have now been over 600 thousand job losses. The tier system has no scientific basis and the sector desperately needs additional financial support.  I want the Government to help the hospitality sector in crisis.",
