        "action": "Vaccinate teachers as a top priority so children can return to school",
        "additional_details": "During the November lockdown, when children were at school, new cases of COVID-19 dropped dramatically to as low as 12,000 cases a day. Over the Christmas break, when no children were in school, cases increased to over 60,000 cases per day. Therefore there is no evidence that keeping primary school children home will reduce new cases but letting them to return to school will at least allow their parents to focus on their jobs which will get the economy back moving in the right direction.",
        "background": "The UK should follow the example of other countries in considering teachers the same as first responders and vaccinate them as a top priority.\r\n\r\nEducating at school is essential for children's development of empathy, fellowship, engagement, and encouragement that are essential in adult life.",
