        "additional_details": "On Thursday 31st December 2020, the application for Hornsea Project Three Offshore Wind Farm was given development consent - a potentially disastrous decision for local wildlife. The Flamborough coast hosts the largest seabird colony in the UK, with rare seabirds including Gannets, Kittiwakes and Puffins nesting there each year. \r\n\r\nAlthough the company plan to build nesting towers to reduce the negative impact on the birds, the RSPB have commented that it will take a decade to see whether this works, and it is likely to be too late by then. With the birds being forced to dodge turbines in order to reach feeding grounds, the Hornsea Wind Farm could severely deplete numbers of seabirds in the area, disrupting the local ecosystem even further.",
        "background": "We would like the government to reconsider consent for this new wind farm, re-evaluate it's necessity, and reassess the costs and benefits of this venture with a thought for the local environment.",
