        "additional_details": "Schools and other educational settings have faced closure baring those in early years. Staff, children and parents will still be mixing and coming into contact regardless of procedures put into place, therefore allowing the Covid-19 virus to spread. The new variant has shown to be more transmittable, meaning children are more likely to now pass this virus on. \r\nPractitioners within early years settings are still at high risk of catching and spreading this virus and this risk should be prevented",
        "background": "Nurseries and education settings should be closed due to the high rise in new Covid-19 cases. Schools, colleges and universities are shut across the country, leaving nurseries the main breeding ground to spread the virus.",
