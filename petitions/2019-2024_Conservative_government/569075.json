        "additional_details": "Covid droplets can remain in the atmosphere in confined spaces for several hours so collecting a car in which a stranger has been working is a significant risk. \r\n\r\nIn the case of those with underlying health conditions this is a particular concern. It places them in an impossible position when they really should stay at home, but feel under pressure to venture out so that their cars remain legal and ready for use in an emergency situation.",
        "background": "The government should grant a six month extension to MOT certificates as it did under the first lockdown. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for garages to remain open during the pandemic for essential repairs and servicing, but MOT testing is an unnecessary risk while transmission levels of Covid are high.",
