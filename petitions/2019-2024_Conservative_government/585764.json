        "additional_details": "Approximately 2.5 million Arab Palestinians live in the occupied West Bank under Israeli military rule. The new Israeli coalition government will meet this Sunday to finalise plans to annex this land. This is a breach of international law obligations that reject the acquisition of territory through force and would be a major threat to peace. It has erupted violence causing death and hardship to thousands, and should annexation take place, will leave millions of Palestinians without a home.",
        "background": "This is a call on the UK Government to make clear to the Israeli government that such annexation of territory will have severe consequences for the UK-Israel relationship, and a further call to introduce sanctions similar to those imposed on Russia in 2014 in the event that annexation takes place.",
