I have as a job coach, employment advisor and recruiter met lots of people that have been affected. It appears that it stays with you for ever as the question just states \u201chave you ever had an insurance policy cancelled?\u201d I would like the government to amend this so that anyone that can prove they have been affected by redundancy will not be penalised moving forward",

Your insurance is increased and you are penalised for this come out there is no date so time is it taking into consideration like accidents are.",
