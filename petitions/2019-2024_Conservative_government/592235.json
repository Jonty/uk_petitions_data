        "additional_details": "Long before the pandemic, waiting lists were around 18 months for children to be seen by CAMHS or mental health services. \r\n\r\nEven more so now than ever there has been a decline in childrens mental health. Waiting lists are getting longer. \r\n\r\nThis is crucial due to the high rates of suicide attempts by teenagers and children. COVID-19 has had a major impact on these children and young people and the support and services are not there!\r\n\r\nThere are not enough services to support Children and young people with mental health issues. This needs to change. . . The current system is broken !",
        "background": "I would like the government to provide more funding to CAMHS (child and adolescent mental health services). Additional funding should be used for better training and more staff, as well as more sites to make it more accessible for children and young people.",
