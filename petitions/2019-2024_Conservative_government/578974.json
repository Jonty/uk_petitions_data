        "action": "Extend theory tests to 1 year at least",
        "additional_details": "We\u2019d like the government to go through with this appeal because it is unjust on the students who have passed their theory but not being able to have any practical tests. In a normal year, students should be able to get in at least 6 practical tests in a year not 1 or 2 or 0 if their theory had run out near the end of 2020/2021. Giving students a 1 year extension wouldn\u2019t put a backlog into their knowledge on road safety and in fact would extend their knowledge whilst they are learning to drive.",
        "background": "We would like you to extend the theory test certificates to one year due to not being able to have any lessons, tests being cancelled and only able to have 1 or 2 tests or 0 in the year 2021 due to covid. There are students out there who had their tests cancelled 5+ times which isn\u2019t their fault.",
