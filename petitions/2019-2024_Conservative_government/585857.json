        "additional_details": "There are approximately 150k British Citizens who face 10 days quarantine in a hotel, for many of whom, it is impractical (through loss of annual leave spent in the hotel) to see their families in the U.K as 2 weeks work leave would mean 4 days with family. The complete lack of clarity regarding when the UAE will not be on the red list creates significant stress for those hoping to see their family. Therefore, immediate qualify fully vaccinated expat British Citizens separately.",
        "background": "Immediately qualify fully vaccinated British Citizens living in the UAE separately from tourists and set the traffic light for these citizens. Thus allowing fully vaccinated British Citizens who are UAE residents to adopt the same quarantine procedures as those travelling from Amber countries",
