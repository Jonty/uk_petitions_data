        "additional_details": "Now that Wales and Scotland have cancelled exams it is unfair to expect English students to sit their exams. They have not had enough school input to be able to complete these exams and for the results to be a true reflection of their abilities. These exams will be detrimental to their future college, university and job applications when competing against Welsh and Scottish students. It\u2019s also detrimental to their mental health in these difficult times.",
        "background": "Current Year 11 and 13 in England have had to complete more than a 6th of their coursework at home and have had numerous cover teachers since returning to school. Their summer exams need to be cancelled and results based on teacher assessment.",
