        "action": "Nationalise the water companies now.",
        "additional_details": "During the decades that the water companies have been private they have let billions of tons of drinking water be wasted through leaks which they have not fixed. They have sold off reservoirs instead of building new ones. They are killing our rivers and harming our seas by dumping raw sewage into them. No country outside the UK has a fully privatised water sector; it has been a disaster and needs to be back under public, not private, control.",
        "background": "Make water a publicly owned utility again. Stop raw sewage being dumped in our rivers and seas immediately. Forbid the water companies from selling any more reservoirs. Fine the water companies now and stop them paying any dividends or bonuses while they are being nationalised.",
