        "additional_details": "With the high quantity dog thefts occurring, there is more to assess than just laws regarding thief's. Many breeders have abused increases in puppy demand over lockdown, selling puppies over 3 times the price of pre covid prices, making the animals more desirable to steal. \r\nA combination of this with a lack of dog laws has meant many families have lost their beloved pets. Selling puppies at such prices is therefore irresponsible and unnecessary and to stop this, prices need to be capped.",
        "background": "The selling price of puppies has soared due to lockdown and un-coincidentally so have dog thefts. Therefore, the selling price of puppies should be capped at approximately \u00a31000 which was standard price for most puppies pre lockdown",
