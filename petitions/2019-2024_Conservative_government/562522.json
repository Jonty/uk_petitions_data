People are losing their livelihoods whilst he views yachts overseas over a meagre \u00a330 million pounds that could have saved the Arcadia Group. Compare that to his and his wife's accumulated wealth.",
        "background": "Phillip Green should have his MBE revoked due to his direct and obscene behaviour to his current and former staff. There is a gaping hole in the pension plan for current and future staff. He and his management team have overseen the demise on the high street. Yet he still profits from his wealth.",
