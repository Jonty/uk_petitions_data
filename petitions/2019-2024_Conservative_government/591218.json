        "action": "Delay lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, as recommended by experts",
        "additional_details": "The letter states that premature lifting of restrictions \"risks creating a generation left with chronic health problems & disability\" & that \"the government's strategy provides fertile ground for the emergence of vaccine-resistant variants\". Hospitals are again strained from increased COVID-admissions and staff isolation; operations & cancer-treatments are being cancelled. Lifting restrictions too soon will make this situation worse.  Government shouldn't be gambling with people's lives this way",
        "background": "Delay until everyone, including adolescents, have been offered vaccination & uptake is high, and until mitigation measures, especially adequate ventilation and spacing, are in place in schools.  Follow the advice of >100 experts, who published an open letter in The Lancet on July 7th 2021.",
