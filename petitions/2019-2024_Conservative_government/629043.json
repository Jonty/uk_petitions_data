Homeless people must not be blamed for being homeless. My hope is to see people recognised and respected as victims rather than instigators of homelessness and its causes.",
        "background": "Under the 1996 Housing Act: A person becomes 'homeless intentionally' if they fail to do everything to live in the accommodation available to them.\r\n\r\nThis legitimises a lack support for those in difficult circumstances. 'Intentionally homeless\u2019 indicates that becoming homeless was their choice.",
