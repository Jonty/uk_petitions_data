        "additional_details": "West Lindsey District Council voted to acquire the RAF Scampton site & partner with an investor to deliver a regeneration & redevelopment project. The deal, which will secure over \u00a3300 million of investment will preserve, protect & enhance the site by providing aviation heritage, business, aerospace, space & aviation technology & education opportunities. The Home Office have recently announced that the site could be used for the accommodation of asylum seekers, for which there is currently no planning permission & which would prevent the realisation of the major redevelopment scheme. The Home Office plan would be catastrophic with far reaching economic & social implications. The Home Office plan would be counter-productive to the Government\u2019s longer-term investment & Levelling Up agenda.",
        "background": "Ministers are urged to remove the former RAF Scampton site from its list of places for an Asylum Centre and keep the agreed regeneration plan in place.",
