        "action": "Expand laws on scalping to include other consumer goods",
        "additional_details": "In 2017 the government amended the Digital Economy Act to stop the use of automated bots from buying tickets for the purpose of reselling at unfair prices. Since being enacted, scalping groups have begun targeting products in other industries which are in high demand (e.g. Gaming Consoles, Graphics Cards and Trainers), employing bots to secure items en masse, lowering supply and causing greater demand. They have taken advantage of the pandemic, but are unlikely to go away any time soon.",
        "background": "The government should expand current legislation on scalping to include other consumers goods such as electronic hardware and clothing, in order to prevent individuals buying up and reselling high-demand items at highly inflated prices.",
