The Government sets national minimum wages, but is not responsible for setting wages for particular groups of workers.\r\n\r\nIf you want the Government to increase funding for health and social care, with a view to reducing the need for private or charitable health and social care providers, you could start a new petition calling for this.\r\n\r\nWe have published a number of petitions calling on the Government to take actions to financial reward key workers due to the coronavirus outbreak, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nMake hazard pay mandatory for key workers in the midst of COVID 19: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/307619\r\n\r\nGive all key workers a 100% tax and Nat.
