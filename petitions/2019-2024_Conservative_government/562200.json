        "action": "Allow Yoga & Pilates Studios to operate under Tier 3 Covid Regulations",
        "additional_details": "Dedicated yoga premises deemed \"covid secure\" should not pose a greater risk of transmission than attendance at a Gym, however Gyms are able to continue operating.\r\n\r\nYoga studios positively contribute towards local economies by operating as small businesses; they provide much needed wellbeing support which contributes towards participants' abilities to remain economically active.\r\n\r\nMany instructors are self-employed individuals who have not been supported by the Government during the Covid period.",
        "background": "Yoga studios were able to operate in Tier 3 prior to the national lockdown in Nov 20. The latest guidance now excludes the same organisations from operating in Tier 3 from the beginning of Dec when the national lockdown is lifted, despite Gyms & Leisure Centres being allowed to continue operating.",
