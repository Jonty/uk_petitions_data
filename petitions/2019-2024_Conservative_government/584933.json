        "additional_details": "The dire situation in India will soon be replicated across low income countries. Not all countries have the economic stability to enforce lockdowns and isolation. \r\n\r\nVaccines have already shown early signs of wide scale protection of transmission and severity of COVID19 infections.  Many countries are asking for the rights to produce these vaccines in house. \r\n\r\nGlobal coverage of the vaccine is required to eradicate COVID19.  This is a pandemic not an epidemic",
        "background": "The government must ask pharmaceutical companies to waiver all intellectual property right for COVID19 vaccines to ensure that there is better access. \r\n\r\nWe need more southern manufacturers of the already established COVID19 vaccines to ensure no country is left unprotected.",
