        "additional_details": "The government's reasoning for excluding the newly self-employed from income support during the previous lockdown was to avoid fraud in the scheme. Proof of earnings through tax returns was required for this reason. \r\n\r\nNow that self-assessment tax returns can be submitted for the 19/20 financial year, the government should accept these as proof of earnings and extend SEISS to those who started business in the last financial year.",
        "background": "In the March national lockdown, those who started their business in the 19/20 financial year missed out on inclusion in the self-employment support scheme. In the current lockdown, the SEISS should now be extended to this group if they have filed a tax return for the 19/20 financial year.",
