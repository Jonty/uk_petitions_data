        "action": "Remove Tony Abbott from the Board of Trade",
        "additional_details": "Abbott's appointment to the Government's Board of Trade is an insult to those that he holds prejudice views against, and to those who believe in the values of tolerance. It signals that those with hateful views can be excused, so long as the individual that holds them has other talents that are of use.\r\n\r\nThe process and merit on which Abbott was appointed is also unclear. Significant government appointments warrant transparency. In the absence of this, Abbot must be removed.",
        "background": "Tony Abbott's views are completely incompatible with the values of the modern United Kingdom. These include misogyny and sexism towards women, prejudice towards the LGBTI communities and racism towards indigenous communities. His cited \"expertise on trade\" is also entirely unevidenced.",
