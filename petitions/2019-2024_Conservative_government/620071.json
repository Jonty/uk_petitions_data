        "action": "make all secondary schools in the uk to start later",
        "additional_details": "people who live far from schools should get more time to get to schools preventing them from being late all the time. Everyone also needs sleep around 7-9 hours a day. with school starting to early no one can get that much sleep causing high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure or stroke. Other potential problems include obesity, depression, reduced immune system function. on top of this tiredness, making people not focus in class leading to poor grades.",
        "background": "for all secondary schools to start later around 9 and ending later at about 3. Not primary schools because most parents/careers need to take their kids to school before work and they cant do that if schools start later. Whereas secondary school kids are old enough to get to school themselves.",
