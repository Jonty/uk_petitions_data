        "additional_details": "As it will make cyclist's more aware when it comes to using the road as they can be easily caught out for doing illegal stuff. For example, hitting wing mirrors or scratching cars when cycling on public roads, motor vehicles have to have these and i think anything that uses public roads should be easily identifiable for whenever there are incidents so they cant just peddle off somewhere cars cant go and get away with it like they do on a daily basis",
        "background": "I want the Government to make it a legal requirement for cyclists whilst using the roads to have visable Number plates and insurance so that when they cause damage to others peoples property they are easily known, as I had a cyclist dent my car and ride off and I couldnt do anything or catch them",
