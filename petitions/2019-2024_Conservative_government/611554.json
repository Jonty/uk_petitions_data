        "action": "Urgent review and increase required for current mileage rates set by HMRC",
        "additional_details": "HMRC have not increased mileage rates since 2011. The average fuel price in 2011 for petrol was 133.65p, and for diesel was 138.94p. We are looking now at a minimum of 50p increase to fuel per litre, and this is not reflected in the current mileage rates. I am calling for an urgent change in the rates to allow employees to continue their work without having to pay out extra from their own pockets. Mileage rates must be increased, just like National Insurance and other taxes have been increased.",
        "background": "Mileage rates must reflect the cost in fuel, as well as general wear and tear of vehicles. I work in a special school, and rely on the use of my car daily. I am now having to pay the extra fuel costs out of my own money to be able to fulfil my job role.",
