        "additional_details": "In April 2021, 6 Premier League football clubs attempted to form a breakaway competition known as the European Super League.\r\n\r\nThis decision received widespread condemnation from supporter groups and many individuals connected to the sport.\r\n\r\nThis anticompetitive behaviour threatened the integrity of the pyramid system, jeopardising the possibility for any club to rise to the top of the game.\r\n\r\nA similar system was implemented in the German Football League in 1998, and remains in place today.",
        "background": "Protect football clubs from the commercial interests of greedy investors, by legislating for a system of majority fan ownership (50% + 1 share).\r\n\r\nThis will drive supporter engagement and enable them to veto decisions that are not in the long-term best interests of the club, or the sport.",
