        "action": "Re-open schools in September allowing proper time to prepare & understand risk",
        "additional_details": "The Government continues to cite 'science' as being the key driving factor for all changes.  Education unions and teachers are in consensus that schools should not reopen in June, the Government just replies that 'it is based on science'.  Other countries which have begun a phased easing have already seen an increase in R (Germany reporting R to be above 1) which the Government says is the biggest indicator of risk.  We want you to exercise common sense and not reopen too soon.",
        "background": "The phased re-opening of schools couched as June, appears to be based upon economic rather than a health/safety rationale.  The education unions, being the experts in schools (Not the Dept of Education), have expressed legitimate concerns which must be addressed.",
