        "additional_details": "On 14 September 2021 almost 1500 dolphins were killed with hooks and knives after being driven into a shallow bay, the sea turned red while children were allowed to witness this brutal carnage, and it happens year after year. There is no need for dolphins to be killed for food, the Faroes have sufficient livestock and fishing industries, and this wealthy population have everything that any civilised nation has at their disposal. There is no valid excuse for continuing such a 'tradition'.",
        "background": "Send a clear message to those who perpetrate this savage crime against innocent, intelligent and emotional creatures that this not an acceptable tradition and will not be condoned or ignored by the UK. Stop all trade with the Faroe Islands until they ban this archaic and brutal practice.",
