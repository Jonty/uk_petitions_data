This is not a problem that needs solving. \r\nThe introduction of such administrative barriers to voting will deter honest, law abiding citizens from voting, which harms our country's democratic legitimacy. This deterrent will disproportionately effect citizens in economic hardship, who are less likely to have existing photo ID, and who may lack the time and money required to obtain it.",
        "background": "Cancel the plan, announced in the Queen's Speech, to introduce an \"Electoral Integrity Bill\" to require British voters to provide photographic ID in polling stations in order to exercise their democratic right to vote.",
