        "additional_details": "I feel the governments (national & devolved) should reward those staff who have worked on the frontline and provided key/essential public services during this crisis with the ultimate job security - permanent contracts. Agency staff are selflessly taking the same risks and providing the same services to the public that their permanent counterparts are providing but with no reward at the end other than a source of income. Less job security (if any as agencies claim they are not the employers and the public sector depts claim they are not so were do agency staff stand?), different pension, different sickness/maternity pay etc etc, yet agency staff are doing the same work and taking the same risks.\r\nI feel now is the time to reward our agency staff with an offer of a permanent position.",
        "background": "I request that permanent contracts be offered to all Key/Essential agency workers who have worked & continue to work in the public sector. \r\nThese workers are taking the same risks and providing the same public services as their permanent colleagues also provide but with less rights & job security.",
