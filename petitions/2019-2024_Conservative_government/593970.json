        "additional_details": "Air Source Heat Pumps (ASHP) are great for high specification new build properties with under floor heating throughout and airtightness in the construction way in excess of current building regs standards.  ASHP's are not good retrofits for gas/oil boilers in existing properties with radiator based central heating.  To make existing properties suitable for ASHP heating performance is beyond that planned for. The Govt should look carefully at this plan before spending \u00a3billions of public money.",
        "background": "Inadequate consideration has been given to the consequences of attempting to replace fossil fuel (gas, oil, etc.) boilers for domestic heating with Air Source Heat Pumps. A significant percentage of govt subsidy will not deliver the benefits expected and consumers will be left with poor outcomes.",
