        "additional_details": "The Centre was the highest performing in the country , it was sold  against all logic , and still stands empty & unused, planning permission being refused for housing . Currently donors have to travel by car to Cambridge , or train to Tooting or The West End . This deters many former Brentwood donors who gave up a lot of time to donate . At a time when Blood products are even more important , the site should be bought back for the NHSBT so vital blood supplies can again be obtained locally .",
        "background": "Repurchase and reopen the Centre closed and sold in 2015 to enable it to harvest Blood Plasma , and other components of blood for use in the current Corona Virus Pandemic and any future demands for Plasma Platelets and Whole Blood .",
