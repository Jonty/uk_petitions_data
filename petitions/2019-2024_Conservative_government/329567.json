The fact exam boards don\u2019t have enough trust in teacher judgment to be accurate and fair, isn\u2019t the fault of their students. The plan should\u2019ve been better thought out! For students who did well and worked for their mocks and for students who still needed that extra two months of revision it\u2019s: unfair, unjust and desponding",
        "background": "The system is favouring private schools over state schools. If the average gcse grade in a school is a c in maths and someone works to get a level 8 why should their hard work be hindered because of an unjust average which is completely inaccurate.",
