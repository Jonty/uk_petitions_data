        "additional_details": "Freedom of expression continues to be used as a way in which racism and bullying continues on a daily basis. The verify identity check would continue to protect the persons anonymity, however, would allow authorities where required to trace the people who continue to break the law and take relevant action. \r\n\r\nThis way it avoids the original concerns the Government has in May 2021 but puts checks in place which would hopefully ensure freedom of expression does not turn in to racial abuse.",
        "background": "Introduce legislation that requires checks to be carried out by social media companies before allowing them to create social media accounts. Anyone aged over 16 has a National Insurance number and anyone under 16 should need a parental link up in order to verify their identity.",
