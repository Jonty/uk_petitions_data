Previous plans of HS2 which would have seen the line go to Leeds, Newcastle and Scotland have been ditched. The current line to Manchester is now under threat. The north should not have to be deprived of vital infrastructure that is always served to the south on a silver platter. The north and Scotland should be given high speed rail.",
