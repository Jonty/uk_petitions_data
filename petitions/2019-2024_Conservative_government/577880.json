Many of the self-employed have not been allowed to work since December 2020, are entitled to little or no Universal Credit, yet still have to pay overheads as well as their own rents, mortgages, bills and manage their living costs. What exactly is someone expected to do when their UC payment is a mere \u00a33.22 more than their mortgage/rent alone?",
        "background": "The Government needs to bring forward the payment of the 4th SEISS grant before the end of April. Furthermore, we need clarity about why there is no monthly payment for the self-employed as there is for those on furlough.",
