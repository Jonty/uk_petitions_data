There are multiple studies available on gingerbread charity\u2019s website. We would like the government to make the law equal so fathers cannot abandon their children like a mother cannot. The family court is outdated and needs to be looked into with positive changes in order to assist \u201csingle parents\u201d and innocent children to seek equal responsibility.",
        "background": "We want the government to make an \u2018unavailable\u2019 father to be legally responsible for his child emotionally as well as financially. If not possible, the same consequences should be in place as a mother who abandons their child. It should not be solely down to the mother to raise their child.",

It is illegal for any parent, not just the mother, to abandon a child.\r\n\r\nA mother automatically has parental responsibility for her child from birth. A father usually has parental responsibility if he\u2019s either married to the child\u2019s mother or listed on the birth certificate.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for changes to rules for parental responsibility, but it would need to be clear what changes you wanted to existing rules."
