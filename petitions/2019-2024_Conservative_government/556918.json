        "additional_details": "I am selectively mute. I have had to participate in activities I CANNOT do because people don\u2019t understand my condition. Many teachers found it difficult to understand and get help to make my time at school worthwhile, and a few just didn't seem to care. I'm at university now and I'm being told some of the adjustments that would help me might not be met. Government should fund a campaign to raise awareness on the condition and how people with SM can be supported in school, university and work.",
        "background": "The name Selective Mutism implies that it\u2019s a choice, that one has decided to become mute. That's not the case. It causes confusion for people, mostly teachers/educators who have never heard of the disability, and it devalues the condition. ",
