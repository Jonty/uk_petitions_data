        "additional_details": "These students have missed vital school time in 2020 and now again in 2021. Many people from disadvantaged backgrounds have no access to a laptop or an internet connection. Students' mental health is now worse than ever and this pressure of exams is only going to make it worse. I don't see why the government have cancelled GCSEs and A-levels if we're still going to sit exams. Teacher-assessed grades should be based using mock exams and topic tests that have already been taken.",
        "background": "Cancel all 2021 exams for GCSE and A-level students. No 'mini exams' or internally and externally set exams. Children can still go to school to finish learning the content but must not sit any exams.",
