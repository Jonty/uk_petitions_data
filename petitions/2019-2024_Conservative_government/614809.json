        "additional_details": "The current proposed strategy is entirely focussed on new nuclear. \r\nNot only does this cost billions to build, it will be a decade before they generate a single watt, taking us to at least 2032.\r\nAdded to this, the end to end costs including decommissioning end of life stations and storage of spent fuel into infinity is obscene. \r\nTo commit to build,the generator, (EDF) is guaranteed price per GW \r\nConsumers will have a levy attached to future bills to pay for both the build and inflated energy costs",
        "background": "Redirect the hundreds of billions allocated to new nuclear to a programme to ensure that all residential properties are offered installation of solar panels at zero cost to the property owner or energy consumer.\r\nNot only is this far cleaner and cheaper, it starts generating immediately!!",
