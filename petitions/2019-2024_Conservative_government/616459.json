        "additional_details": "Energy companies have and continue to report bumper profits amidst the Energy crisis, with Govt current avoiding higher taxation to prevent discouraging investment in renewable, whilst the general population is in hardship as price caps continue to rise.  A progressive tax system would enable subsidisation of household costs in the short term (removal of VAT an example) whilst incentivising the Energy industry to continue R&D and investment in renewable long term. Force a change!",
