Despite the undebatable importance of education, mental health is a critical factor in a student\u2019s ability to perform to their full potential. Due to this, students should be supported when speaking up and taking action, and being able to take some time out of school should not be something that\u2019s discouraged as it can be hugely beneficial for a young person\u2019s wellbeing.",

Students struggling with balancing their emotional well-being and the pressures of education should be free to make the decision to take time off whilst being supported by school staff.",
