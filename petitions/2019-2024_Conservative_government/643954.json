        "additional_details": "We want to see the stopping of certain dog breeds being banned. Dogs are not inherantly dangerous, as a professional in the Vetirinary industry I can safely say that there are no such thing as \u2018dangerous\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 breeds, only \u2018dangerous\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 owners, that willingly teach their dogs to be violent, or mistreat the dog in such a way it becomes violent due to the nature of it\u2019s surroundings. \r\n\r\nIf a human was being mistreated and acted out in violence, we\u2019d offer them support, not ban them, so why don\u2019t we do this for dogs?",
        "background": "Create a dog licence that would have to have certain criteria met to ensure owners are not violent and will provide the dog with a kind, nurtering and ultimately safe home. This would lead to the decrease in animal related violence as the animals wouldn\u2019t be taught aggression or act out in fear.",
