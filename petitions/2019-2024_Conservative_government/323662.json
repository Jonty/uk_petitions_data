        "additional_details": "Britain prides itself on being a multicultural society, with people of black heritage so pupils should learn this key element of its past. Black history helps to enrich the moral needs of all ethnic groups.Educating pupils during the length of this month is more than Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks and deeper into the roots of the past. It's vital in understanding our nation to learn about Africans prior to the arrival of europeans.A eurocentric view doesn't embody this diversity sufficiently.",
        "background": "To make an obligation for primary and secondary schools to educate pupils on black history, culture and the achievements accomplished despite the struggles faced. This should be done yearly during the span of black history month to raise awareness.",
