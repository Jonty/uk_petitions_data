        "additional_details": "This would be beneficial to students sitting exams in year 10, because they will be more prepared for core subjects which are important to pass. If students are busy covering topics from options they will be more likely to fail/not perform well. This will cause a disruption to their learning and keep them behind trying to resit exams in sixth form.",
        "background": "Let 2021 GCSE students drop one or two GCSE subjects from their options so they can focus more on Core subjects; mathematics, English and science.",
