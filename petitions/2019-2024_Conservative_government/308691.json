This will continue to disadvantage thousands of students from obtaining their desired degree and progressing onto the next stages of their careers.\r\n\r\nThis will help students in isolation as they will be able to focus more on achieving the grades they deserve at a later date with the right facilities and support that physical university environments provide.",
        "background": "Postponing studies will support those who rely on the direct learning and experiences of the practical environments, such as dentistry and medical students.There are thousands of students disadvantaged by the closure of universities and its facilities, especially who do not have access to computers",
