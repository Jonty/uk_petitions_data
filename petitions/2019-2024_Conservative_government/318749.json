        "additional_details": "As of 28th April 2020 over 100 NHS workers have died with Covid-19 (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52242856). They paid the ultimate price to treat patients and they continued to go to work despite the dangers they were facing being well known. Their sacrifice should be honoured with a permanent memorial on behalf of a grateful public, where the families, friends and colleagues can come to pay tribute. This is especially important given many relatives live abroad.",
        "background": "At the time of writing over 100 of our NHS staff have died whilst fighting to save the lives of people with Covid-19. The tragic reality is that this number will only rise as time goes on. These everyday heroes continued to working incredibly hard, despite the danger of the virus being well known.",
