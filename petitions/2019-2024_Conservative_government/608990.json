        "additional_details": "Many family members are not receiving the care they deserve from care homes charging exorbitant fees. They are also being let down by the system designed to protect them i.e. CQC, Adult Social Services. CEO's are simply transferring wealth from the poor to their own pockets aided by the social care system. Fees should be capped. The law needs to be reformed to make directors culpable for neglect and abuse happening in their establishments. The system is broken and urgently needs fixing.",

CEO's and directors of care companies prosecuted for neglect in line with H&S legislation.",
