        "additional_details": "The proposals will bar trans people from women's refuges & the correct toilets among other things & will cause an increase in transphobia & hate crime. There is no need to change these laws as there is no correlation between transgender access to single-sex spaces and women's safety. These changes will target transgender and Non-Binary people and lead to an increase in attacks on transgender people.",
