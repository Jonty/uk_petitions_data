        "additional_details": "I would like to government to abolish the charges levied against motorists who own pre 1991 cars. The vast majority of owners do not drive there cars very much and this in turn will not severely effect the revenue generated by them. \r\nIt will also allow people to showcase there pride and joy to the general public. \r\nDue to age/scrappage scheme/rust/neglect etc not many of the wonderful cars developed pre 1991 survive. \r\nAllow future generations the opportunity to see and marvel at old designs.",
        "background": "Owners of cars that are over 30 years old (1991) are becoming scarce. These cars tend to be used in good weather or weekends. \r\nA lot of money is spent on the purchase and subsequent upkeep. \r\nIn the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s there was little information about emissions etc, these cars are part of our heritage.",
