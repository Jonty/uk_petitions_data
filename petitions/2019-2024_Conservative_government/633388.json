        "additional_details": "People are on their knees, working class folk who do all the hard work for the country. The people are crying out, going on strike and the government just WONT engage with them or tell them they can't afford it. Well here is a simple way it can be paid for. \r\n\r\nBy giving a windfall tax to energy companies and MPs taking a pay cut, this would more than allow for a public sector pay increase. Also lowering the energy price cap (because with profits so high the price is too high). Power to the people",
        "background": "With the recent news of yet more strikes by NHS staff, Nurses, Teachers, public sector workers on very little pay. Coupled with the news on an increase in MPs Pay and High profits by Energy Firms. MP's should take a pay cut energy firms should receive a windfall tax and the energy price cap lowered.",
