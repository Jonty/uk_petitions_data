        "additional_details": "I believe that these sites should be closed down, there is no need for non-essential building sites to remain open. These construction workers cannot properly social distance when working, and they are having to board overcrowded public transport as providers reduce services. \r\n\r\nThey are being put at risk of contracting and spreading COVID 19 for no reason",
        "background": "Numerous non-essential construction sites are still open as companies put profits before people. \r\n\r\nIt is impossible to properly social distance in this environment, and these companies have shown they will not put safety first unless forced\r\n\r\nPlease protect our construction workers",
