Art enriches our culture and improves our visual experience of daily life, dance provides us with an emotional outlet, whether it be through participation or viewing. Music keeps us all going. I\u2019m a university student; I experience the effects of the Conservative upward transfer of wealth every day. Even non art-based faculties must be very careful with money because of underfunding. Imagine what a further 50% cut would do. Please help.",
