These children come back with mental health issues/PTSD which causes more strain on the NHS and welfare system as it is. Parents should not force any child to live abroad for being badly behaved or to force marriage or religious beliefs on them.",

The title of your petition refers to failure to return a child to the UK, but it's not clear if this means failure to return a child when this is what has been agreed, or something else.\r\n\r\nWe couldn't accept a petition calling on the Government to make it a criminal offence for children to move abroad, as this would be extreme and stop families moving abroad even if there were no child welfare issues.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
