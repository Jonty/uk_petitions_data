This is a natural thing that women can not help or controls so why do we have to pay for something that isn't our fault. Women's toilet items should not have to be paid for. I am 21 years old yes I am young and yes pads and tampons might not seem a lot in some but this is just human rights. There are so many people that can't afford them the prices seem to be just going up!!",
