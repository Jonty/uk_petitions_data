        "additional_details": "The Non EU overseas workers significantly sustain the NHS services. Considering the effect of the pandemic on the economy, They are four fold hit! Its logical that the gruelling shifts grappled with in the war of Covid19 pandemic leave them devoid of the energy for extra shifts that they rely on to sustain their needs, besides the visa renewal  and Immigration health surcharge costs. They need to legally access the public\u2019s funds too when they can\u2019t work. Stop this austerity and be kind to them.",
        "background": "The government needs to recognise the challenges the immigrant NHS workers like nurses and doctors battle with given the low pay that hardly sustains their needs. It\u2019s can not be right that  at this time of a pandemic of this magnitude, they can be denied access to public funds following this clause",
