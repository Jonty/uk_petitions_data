        "action": "Abort the Treasury's plan to decrease the student loan repayment threshold",
        "additional_details": "Young people will not only bear a disproportionate burden, inflicted by the government's plan to increase national insurance. But, if current speculation is true, the plan to decrease the student loan repayment threshold will impose a greater financial burden upon young people. Living costs continue to rise, and disposable income continues to fall. \r\nUltimately, the decision to proceed with this plan will only harm the ability of young people to contribute to the UK's post-COVID recovery.",
        "background": "Currently graduates start to pay back student loans when their salary hits \u00a327,295. However, the government wishes to decrease the threshold in a bid to save money. We are calling upon the government to scrap any plans it has to decrease the threshold.",
