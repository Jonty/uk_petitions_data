        "action": "Nationalise our railways following the COVID-19 pandemic",
        "additional_details": "As soon as passenger numbers started to fall the government stepped in to ensure each franchise wouldn't get into financial difficulty. This was a necessary action to ensure \"service can be sustained over this difficult period\". This really does beg the question - why are we allowing overseas based companies to run our railways if they cannot be relied upon to sustain a reliable service unless they are making a profit? It renders their very existence pointless. It simply isn't right.",
        "background": "On March 23rd the government suspended all passenger rail franchise agreements for six months due to the Coronavirus pandemic. I am calling on the government to cancel these franchise agreements permanently as soon as possible. The pandemic has demonstrated these franchises aren't fit for purpose.",
