        "additional_details": "The first UN special session on Iran was held on the 25th November, requested by representatives of Germany and Iceland. These actions demonstrate solidarity but most importantly strong actions to hold the Islamic Republic accountable. \r\n\r\n227/290 Islamic Republic Parliament members have voted for the swift execution of protestors. So far 2 have been hanged, 1 in public to generate terror in the country.\r\n\r\n18,000 imprisoned since September, approx 500 murdered, 68 of whom are children.",
        "background": "We ask the UK government to provide solid actions more than words of condemnation and support. British Iranians ask for action. \r\n\r\nIranians have been taken hostage for the past 43 years. A theocratic government who brutally torture, rape and murder any protestors and oppositions.",
