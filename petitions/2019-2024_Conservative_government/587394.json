Luckily the drivers of the vehicle were fine but what if it was another story. Who had a first aid kit to save a life? I had to go to a local business to borrow a high fix jacket to control the follow of traffic. I am asking to for you to sign this petition to get it to parliament to make it law during a MOT to have this in the vehicle and in date.Thank you for reading.",
        "background": "It should be law and part of the MOT in the U.K that every Vehicle should carry high visibility vests 1 per seat as well as a first aid kit( which is in date) . If these items are not present in the vehicle it does not pass its test. Might just save quite a few lives even one.",
