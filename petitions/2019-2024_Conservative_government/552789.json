        "action": "End the 10pm curfew on the hospitality sector",
        "additional_details": "PHE data shows the number of coronavirus cases coming from food outlets is lower than education, care homes, places of work and hospitals. \r\nHospitality and pubs are not the problem. The pub trade reopened on 4 July. The public was encouraged to go into venues to support the trade. Pubs, bars and restaurants followed the guidance to ensure the safety of their customers and staff. \r\nCases only began to rise steeply when schools and university students went back. Again, the data clearly shows this.",
        "background": "We're urging the Government to end the 10pm curfew on the hospitality sector, which is causing mass gatherings in the streets, damaging businesses and unfairly pointing the finger of blame at the sector for a rise in coronavirus cases. PHE data clearly shows this is not the case.",
