        "additional_details": "It\u2019s unreasonable to make Health professionals quarantine in a hotel after returning from red list countries it would just add mental and financial stress. \r\nIf NHS can trust a health professional with patients\u2019 lives , Government should be able to trust their integrity. \r\n\r\nFinally,Hotel quarantine is adding financial stress on NHS as well. Employers will have to pay for hotel quarantine for International Medical Graduates , coming from countries on the red list to start work in NHS.",
        "background": "Health professionals have worked hard for NHS during this pandemic. Residents of UK who are health professionals would only visit their homeland weighing the risk and benefit of foreign travel a lot more responsibly than any other person.",
