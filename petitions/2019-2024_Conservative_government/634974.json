        "additional_details": "Stop them from closing the SEN nursery\u2019s at Netherton, especially after their OFSTED outstanding rating. It should be kept as the main hub to train other staff to help children with SEN. We are all for more hubs but they need to replicate Netherton. Those who have worked in mainstream nursery\u2019s for 20 year would NOT be equipped for the role. It is crucial for our children\u2019s development that they receive specialised input. Why take a service away that is proven to work for parents & children",
        "background": "The integrated early years service has already been massive downsized over the last 18 months. They are now planning on closing 2 SEN nursery\u2019s, that have been rated outstanding by OFSTED to create hubs in mainstream settings around the borough. We want you to stop them from closing the SEND.",
