        "additional_details": "As stated in the response to \u201cpriotise vaccines for first responders\u201d the governments justification for nhs and care staff is that they are at increased personal risk of exposure to Covid-19, and transmitting it to susceptible and vulnerable people. This quote defines the police service.\r\nThey help all members of society and often have little or no time to prepare and apply appropriate PPE, before coming in contact with individuals of unknown risk. \r\nIt\u2019s our turn to our police safe.",
        "background": "The government should be providing our police service with the Covid-19 vaccine. Not just giving, but prioritising our police. Often the least desirable and appreciated of all the emergency services, they at least deserve to be safe and \u201ckeep people safe\u201d",
