        "additional_details": "Clearly day light hour reduce in August, thus reducing outdoor activity time.\r\n\r\nStarting school year in mid August would be good due to Corvid 19 affects on schooling. So we have an obvious opportunity here.\r\n\r\nWe also need to increase family activity time to help the country become more active and healthier.\r\n\r\nBy giving 9-5 workers longer day light hours, while the children are off school with potentially better weather, will have the affect of increasing evening activity time spend together.",
        "background": "Using the effect of the pandemic to move school year start date forward to the middle of August if safe to do so.\r\nThis would make better use of day light hours and increase activity time for all.\r\nWeather patterns show that we get better weather increasingly at the beginning of July & early August",
