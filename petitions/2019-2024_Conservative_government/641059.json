        "additional_details": "The UK creates 1% of global emissions. The government is causing financial hardship for people by continuing plans for their green agenda. We believe that the Government could achieve more for the planet by negotiating with the worst polluting nations, than by virtue-signalling with the people's money. We also want the 2030 ban cancelled until there is sufficient infrastructure in place to support electric vehicles.",
        "background": "The people have had no options for input into the net zero plans. Given the costs incurred by green levies, and plans to ban sales of petrol and diesel vehicles, we believe that a referendum is needed to ensure this is what the people actually want.",
