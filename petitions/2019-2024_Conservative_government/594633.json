        "additional_details": "Economic migrants in vital roles such as social care are being needlessly priced out of immigrating because they're forced to spend outrageous sums on hotel accommodation fees. The DHSC seems to have forgotten that those migrating for work do not have the same buying power as those in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe DHSC has also failed to list social care workers as exempt, though it has listed nursing as an exempt employment category.\r\n\r\nPLEASE can we stop making it up as we go along and get some clarity?",
        "background": "The Managed Quarantine process appears to have been designed exclusively with the wealthy holiday traveller in mind. The Department of Health and Social Care has failed to provide any compelling evidence that the expense is any more effective than quarantine in a place of residence.",
