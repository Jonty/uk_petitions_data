        "action": "Cancel GCSE/A-Levels for all England schools.",
        "additional_details": "Many other governments inside the union (Scotland and Wales) have already canceled their GCSE/A-Level (or equivalent) exams as they think some areas may benefit more than others. Many of my fellow students have made countless petitions asking for this but the government has not responded sufficiently. Both teachers and students are uncertain over the exams and many students with anxiety have suffered even more. As told by past petitions a lot of students both want and need this.",
        "background": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, many children are recovering from a large learning chunk from the UK's first national lockdown. Many children were not able to learn during the lockdown due to a lack of access to teaching material and/or lack of motivation.",
