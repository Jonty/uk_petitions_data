        "additional_details": "Around 20 million people, or two-thirds of Yemen's population, depend on humanitarian aid for survival. Yemen's healthcare system has collapsed under the pandemic and citizens now face famine.\r\n\r\nUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said reducing aid was a \"death sentence.\" Donations prevented famine in 2018 and the international community must now act to stop this from happening in 2021. The UK must be part of that response.",
        "background": "The UK government must reverse its decision to slash aid to Yemen from \u00a3214 million in 2020 to \u00a387 million in 2021. \r\n\r\nThe government must at least equal its 2020 contribution as Yemen faces the prospect of a humanitarian disaster.",
