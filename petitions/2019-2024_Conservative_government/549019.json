The huge amount of construction needed to reinstate the line would not only destroy this habitat,but these lives of many people who live adjacent to the line.\r\nThere are safety concerns for local school children going to and from school and also playing on the line and causing a danger to road users by dropping stones onto the road below bridges as has before.\r\nIt needs to stay as a green space.",
