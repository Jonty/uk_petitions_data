        "additional_details": "By design, international students are in the UK temporarily, for a limited period of time. How, therefore, are they immigrants? \r\n\r\nInternational students make a net positive contribution of at least \u00a326 billion per year to the UK & are the source of almost 70% of our education export earnings. They sustain jobs all over the country. In many ways they subsidise the world-leading research that goes in British universities. They further ties of trade and culture, going back as friends of the UK.",
        "background": "Please stop classifying international students as 'immigrants' and making policies based on this limited view. Design a creative policy that encourages the most talented students to choose the UK & through which Britain's international graduates can solve for our critical skills & labour shortages.",
