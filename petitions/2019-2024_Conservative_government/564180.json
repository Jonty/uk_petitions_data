        "additional_details": "The Covid-19 outbreak is now such that the government feels the need for a new Tier 4 while still keeping schools open. It is clear since schools reopened that the number of cases has risen. Now is the time to demand they remain closed till it is safe to return. This means the following:\r\n- All schools close effective immediately.\r\n- online learning to take over for all students.\r\n- cancelling of GCSE and A-Levels due to take place this year, replace with teacher grading (with no algorithm).",
        "background": "I call on the British government to protect its people. All educational facilities in England, especially in tier 4, should close immediately and move to online learning. Teachers should no longer be put at risk and students should not be put in impossible positions to keep their families safe.",
