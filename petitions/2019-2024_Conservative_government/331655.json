        "additional_details": "Key workers have worked extremely hard throughout the pandemic, a lot of extra hours, added pressures, demands and stress. They have not had any opportunity to stay at home and stay safe. As an acknowledgment for all their hard work a 3 month tax break would be highly appreciated from all. Without this if and when taxes increase these key workers will be hit again as they will have paid tax throughout and again will have to pay without any regard for the work carried out during COVID-19.",
        "background": "Allow all key workers who have worked throughout the COVID-19 pandemic a 3 month tax break to show appreciation for keeping healthcare and essential industries going within the UK. Key workers have had their own anxieties about catching and taking home the virus but continued to work regardless.",
