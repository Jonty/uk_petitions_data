        "additional_details": "I have started this petition now after the worrying incident at the Euro 2020 match between Denmark and Finland. This made me realise how I might find myself in a situation where I would be ill-prepared to give potentially lifesaving first aid.\r\n\r\nI intend on learning first aid in the immediate future to ensure I would be prepared should a critical situation unfortunately arise at any point.",
        "background": "To make the teaching of first aid compulsory for all school students across the UK.\r\n\r\nAs a recent school leaver, I am concerned at the fact I went through primary and secondary education without any such training. Though widely offered as an optional module, I believe it should be made mandatory.",
