        "additional_details": "All the social media channels are full of paddlers frustrated at not being able to exercise in their chosen sport when social distancing is possible. They are further exacerbated when so many people are exercising in parks and open spaces where only 2 metre distancing is required. There is absolutely no reason to prevent canoeists exercising in their chosen sport when social distancing well in excess of 2 metres would be the norm.",
        "background": "Ease lock down restrictions to permit people to include canoeing/kayaking  in the list of accepted exercising activities providing paddlers continue to maintain minimum 2 metre distancing rules at all time and only travel the minimum distance to reach waters to paddle on.",
