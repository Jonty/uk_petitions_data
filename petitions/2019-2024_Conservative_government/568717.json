        "additional_details": "Parliamentary privilege grants certain legal immunities to MPs to allow them to perform their duties without outside interference, e.g. freedom of speech & the right to regulate their own affairs. This is not the reality the public face as some MPs do not represent all those in their constituencies. Those who run government departments & cover up failures, mistakes or loss of lives are not held to account. Of course there are many good MPs but as public servants they must be held to account.",
        "background": "Allow the petitions committee to be able to accept petitions from the public calling for action against MPs. Currently MPs are not being held accountable for their actions/failure due to parliamentary privilege. Give the public the fundamental right to hold politicians to account, a democratic norm.",
