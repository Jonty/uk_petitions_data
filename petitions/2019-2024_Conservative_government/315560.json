        "additional_details": "I want the government to this because this is what the healthcare and hospital staff deserve. They have been looking after the sick and elderly, risking their own mental, physical and financial health. \r\n\r\nIncreasing the pay of healthcare staff 3 times what it is now is what is right and fair and they deserve it. Many staff suffer abuse from patients, the endure great stress daily either due to doing extra unpaid work or making life and death decisions.",
        "background": "I propose that due to the conditions that healthcare staff have been working in, the reponsibilities they have, the stress, the suffering, the abuse they have faced and inadequate support they have endured, all hospital and healthcare staff should have their pay increased to 3 times what it is now.",
