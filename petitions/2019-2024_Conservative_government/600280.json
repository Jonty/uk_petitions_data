        "additional_details": "Fireworks are sold to people that don't know the dangers and distress they cause people. Animals, disabled people, the elderly are startled by fireworks being let off randomly on days around Halloween, firework night and Christmas. Fireworks are also let off in streets, being aimed at cars, emergency workers, and random people on the streets. I feel like the safety of everyone needs to be looked into and fireworks to be better managed.",
        "background": "Fireworks are being sold to people with no ideas of the dangers and distress it causes people. I would like this to be stopped and fireworks to only be sold to planned even organisations",
