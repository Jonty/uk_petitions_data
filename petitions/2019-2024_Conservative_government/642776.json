Such visitors can have several six month visits to the UK without the requirement for a visa as long as they adhere to the Home Office's published rules. In contrast UK citizens are restricted by Schengen regulations to ninety days in any one hundred and eighty days: a much more restrictive policy that clearly disadvantages UK travellers. This is clearly an unequal balance of systems.",
