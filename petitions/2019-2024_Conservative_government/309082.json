Also, it is strange that BTEC students are expected to still continue even though their study sessions have been completely disrupted by the ongoing pandemic. There are certain tools/resources that are only available in colleges that can't be accessed at home. In addition, some BTEC students don't have a laptop to use making it difficult to complete assignments.",
