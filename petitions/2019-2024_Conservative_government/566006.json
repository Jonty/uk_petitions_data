        "additional_details": "Currently the law on fireworks does not require consumers to buy quiet, pet-friendly fireworks. The result of using loud fireworks, as it is currently possible under the law, causes hundreds of thousands of pets fear and distress when the fireworks are used. The issue is particularly prominent on Bon fire night and New Years Eve, but is a regular occurance throughout the year. This ban would prevent the unnecessary suffering of animals when fireworks are used, without affecting anyone's fun.",
