        "action": "Stop the government's unjust 'Stop the Boats' legislation",
        "additional_details": "The government's new 'Stop the Boats' legislation, placed before parliament by Home Secretary Suella Braverman is set to turn away all migrants who arrive to the United Kingdom on small boats, in conjunction with denying all such asylum seekers the right to bail or judicial review. This is a disgrace to Britain and the values it holds at heart. Ours has always been a country of open arms and compassion. To introduce such legislation goes against all we stand for. Migrants are an asset to this country.",
        "background": "Suella Braverman has announced disgraceful new legislation to turn away all migrants who arrive in the UK on small boats. This is unfair, wrong, and defies international human rights law, whilst also being completely averse to the values and morals of the Unites Kingdom. Halt this legislation.",
