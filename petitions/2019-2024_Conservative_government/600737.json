It puts too much pressure on an already delicate situation. It is highly damaging to the children. \r\nOften these families have already faced a legal fight about child residency. So imagine then having to lie to the school about the child\u2019s address.\r\nWith the divorce rate currently at 42% this will affect a lot of children.",
        "background": "Quite often separated parents live in 2 different school catchment areas meaning that the child qualifies for neither.\r\nSchool admission policies need to change so that the child can qualify for one or both of the catchment areas, not neither.",

Disputes about where a child normally decides are a matter for the parties involved, not the Government or House of Commons."
