        "action": "Ban the manufacturing, sale, and import of disposable vape pens in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Not only do vapes contain plastic, but also   metals in the battery and heating element, including 0.15g of lithium. Lithium can be toxic to wildlife, and there is evidence that both domestic and wild animals are attracted to chemicals found in vapes, which animals will seek out and chew with potentially lethal outcomes. Lithium is also rare, and is a vital component for batteries which are used for more useful devices, such as laptops and mobile phones. We should not be wasted it in vapes.",
        "background": "168 million disposable vape pens are sold annually in the UK, with a significant number of discarded vapes not even making it to landfill; they are increasingly found in our streets, rivers, and seas, where they pose a threat to our ecosystem. As they gain popularity, the issue will get worse.",
