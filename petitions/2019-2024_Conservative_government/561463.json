        "additional_details": "The recent MP\u2019s pay rise was amidst the coronavirus pandemic when it really wasn\u2019t the right time to spend extra on MP wages and they also didn\u2019t deserve it. They need to look at what they are spending and allowing an extra \u00a32,000,000 to be spent in wages across 650 MP\u2019s is disgusting if they are now going to bring in a \u2018pay freeze\u2019 for public sector workers. I think MP\u2019s need to be brought back down to earth on what is viable considering the current climate and issues. Make yourselves equal.",
