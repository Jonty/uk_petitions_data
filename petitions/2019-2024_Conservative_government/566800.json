        "action": "Allow golf courses to remain open during lockdown. All payment done over phone.",
        "additional_details": "I would like the government to do it as I feel it is a great way for people to exercise physically and also provide a great distraction in it will benefit people\u2019s mental health. I feel like this therefore is in the governments best interest and strongly believe it will result in a safe form of sport. Going out for a walk or a run is not in everyone\u2019s best interest, however, people enjoy doing golf as an alternative form of exercise. This is a great way to get people out of their homes safely.",
        "background": "I would like the government to consider the same attitude as Scotland to keep golf courses open. All payment should be done over phone and golfers should only play with members of their own household.  People will not come any closer than they would in a park doing exercise.",
