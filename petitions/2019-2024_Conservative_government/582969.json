This was agreed to. \nVisual explainer: Backbench Business debates (https://ukparliament.shorthandstories.com/cet-backbench-business-debates/index.html?utm_campaign=&utm_medium=email&utm_source=petcom&utm_term=petitioners) \nGet involved in the work of the UK Parliament\nSign up to the Your UK Parliament newsletter (https://parliament.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=098af33234df9814f59fb205f&id=6e29cb1262) for the latest information on how to get involved and make a difference. \n",
