        "action": "Make it a criminal offense for publicly elected officials to lie to the public",
        "additional_details": "There has been a dramatic increase in the occurrences of officials knowingly telling lies to the public and this has engendered mistrust in officialdom. It has also encouraged the proliferation of \"fake news\" both from within and in opposition to officialdom. It is essential that officials can and are believed; and making them criminally liable for knowingly lying will reduce the extent to which it occurs and increase the public confidence in officials and what they say and do.",
        "background": "The new law should apply to all publicly elected officials and apply both inside parliaments and elsewhere (i.e. Parliamentary privilege explicitly should exclude knowingly lying). It specifically applies to knowingly lying in a similar manner to the application of perjury in a court.",
