        "action": "Make Sex Trafficking a mandatory topic in the UK National Curriculum",
        "additional_details": "There is no 'typical' victim of Sex Trafficking. Anyone can become a victim, which is one of the reasons it can be so hard to spot sexual exploitation and trafficking. If young people are educated on not just the signs to spot in others, but the warning signs of someone targeting them, we can make a real change. A spotlight needs to be put on Sex Trafficking once and for all, and the best place to begin are the institutions that young people are being educated in.",
        "background": "Sexual exploitation is prevalent not just in the UK, but worldwide. Millions of people, in particular women and girls, are victims of sex trafficking every single year. We want Sex Trafficking to become a mandatory topic to be covered in PSHE lessons in the UK National Curriculum.",
