No - we want to support them and not sit back and let so many die! \r\n\r\nEventually we will have a vaccine - even if it takes over a year.",
        "background": "Lock down as far as possible for an initial two week period to prevent us reaching the peak - which we are no where near.\r\n\r\nContinue and expand testing to monitor and trace contact. That is what South Korea successfully did.",
