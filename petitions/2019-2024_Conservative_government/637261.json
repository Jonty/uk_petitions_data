        "action": "Ban the practice of cordectomy in laboratory dogs.",
        "additional_details": "Cordectomy puts the animal at risk of infection, haemorrhage,  laryngeal damage along with obvious anaesthetic risk. Physically in the longer term, scar tissue can form at the back of the throat leading to breathing difficulties, choking  plus chronic inflammation. Emotionally the dogs will become very withdrawn, even more nervous and vulnerable. The only reason this is done is to keep them quiet. This is a cruel and unnecessary procedure which is why we ask the UK government to reconsider this.",
        "background": "Laboratory animals used to be protected under the Animal Welfare Act (2006). They are now regulated by the Animals in Scientific Procedures Act (1986) which allows cordectomy to be performed on laboratory dogs. There is no scientific rationale behind this procedure.",
