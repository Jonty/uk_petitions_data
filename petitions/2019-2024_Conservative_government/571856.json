        "additional_details": "It\u2019s not fair that fines only effect the poorer members of society. The charge should be a reflection of your take home pay - this would be a better way to prevent people breaking the rules (Covid or other) while also making them effect people more equality. No good if fines only have an effect on the poor. \u00a3800 is nothing to some people and everything to others. It should be proportionate to someone\u2019s salary. Either monthly or yearly!",
        "background": "We want the government to change the amount they charge people. It seems that the fines only negatively impact people on lower incomes. \u00a3800 isn\u2019t a lot of someone on a 200k salary, but for many people this would put them in a lot of debt. We believe it should be 1% of your salary!",
