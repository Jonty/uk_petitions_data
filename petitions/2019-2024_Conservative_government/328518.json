        "action": "Extend International student visas expiring in September 2020",
        "additional_details": "Many International Students, such as myself, suffered due to the current pandemic (lockdown) and were not able to experience or enjoy what the UK has to offer us academically, professionally, and culturally.\r\nI believe that it is for the benefit of both the Students and the UK to offer International students a visa extension so that they can benefit from what the UK has to offer them. It is also an opportunity for these students to work in the UK and support the economy.",
        "background": "International students in the UK suffered due to the coronavirus pandemic and had to observe the lockdown for several months since March 2020. Some of the students' visas expire this September and it is only fair for these students to get an extension of their visas until December 2020.",
