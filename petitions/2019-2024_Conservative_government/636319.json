        "additional_details": "There has been no account of the effects this could have on the many small businesses and people relying on the summer trade. Tourists, visitors and families flock to Weymouth & Portland in the summer to enjoy the lovely resort and beaches. The barge itself will, in effect, be a quasi-prison, where hundreds of young men will spend most of their time. Doing what? The port is heavily restricted and what happens if there\u2019s trouble on board? Not to mention, what will they do in the wider community?",
        "background": "The Home Office confirmed that the Bibby Stockholm barge will host more than 500 single-adult males in Portland, Dorset, near Weymouth. This matter has only been discussed in private with the port owners which has exacerbated the issue for the public. We demand the immediate reversal of this plan.",
