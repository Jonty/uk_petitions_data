        "additional_details": "We are living in a world where racism is prevalent in everyday life. Sports stars are leading campaigns for change. Media coverage of riots in the US are showing the fallout of a society which is fundamentally flawed by racism. Children are exposed to campaigns in school such as KickitOut which do all they can with the small amount of time they have with children but it is not enough. Role models for our future generation are failing. This needs to be tackled at the source and that is education.",
