        "additional_details": "Extend Covid-19 benefit increases to legacy benefit claimants\r\nMany legacy benefits claimants already live in poverty. \r\nAll across the country people are being financially impacted by the pandemic and lockdown. While additional financial support is being provided to many, people already on legacy benefits such as JSA and ESA have been excluded from the support package I propose benefit claimants and Child Tax Credit are given similar additional support.",
        "background": "Excluding legacy benefits unfairly penalises those who may not have access to other support. Universal Credit and Working Tax Credit have been given an increase. I propose that to prevent unfair discrimination legacy benefit claimants and Child Tax Credit are given similar additional support.",
