        "additional_details": "This would provide more afternoon daylight for leisure activities, boosting the economy. This is also highly likely to save energy, as less artificial light and heat would be used in the afternoons. Lighter evenings would also reduce the number of road accidents in the evenings, and overall, as evidenced by the 1968-71 trial. Lighter afternoons and evenings would also increase public safety.",
        "background": "Keep GMT+1 (British Summer Time) all year round for a trial period. Another option would be to extend the use of British Summer Time, and use GMT only from late November to late February, for example.",
