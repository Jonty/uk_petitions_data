        "additional_details": "Students year 10 through 13 are all under exam stress regardless of COVID, but now we, students, face added anxiety; now more than ever we face uncertainty. Moreover many have lost loved ones yet still tackle their education at home. Post-Covid life will not be the same after lockdown, as we near to the new academic year this September. With a possible second wave lingering, please think ahead and do not leave our exams till the last minute. We want reassurance now, not weeks before our exams.",
        "background": "To consider open book exams for the 2021 GCSEs. It is evident that COVID-19 has disrupted education for all, this academic year. Thus, with Year 11 being most vital in GCSEs, it is unjust to allow students to sit through normal exam conditions. Our GCSEs decide our careers and shape our lives.",
