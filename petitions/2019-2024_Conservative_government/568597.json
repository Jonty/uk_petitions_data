The science and the evidence is out there to contradict what actions the government are taking. Lockdowns don\u2019t work and blaming the public for not adhering to them as a way to impose further restrictions is morally wrong. This needs to end, figures for deaths are being recorded incorrectly, lives are being destroyed not from the virus but from these restrictions.",

To allow the public to resume their normal freedoms and for the economy, health education and well-being to get back to normal",
