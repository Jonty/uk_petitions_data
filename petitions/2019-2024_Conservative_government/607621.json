Any missed payments AT ALL automatically effect the non payers credit score, borrowing ability, interest rates.  Scrap enforcement actions.  These actions have been proven not to work time and time again.  They\u2019re expensive to implement have an unsuccessful ratio i.e money spent on paperwork admin etc to actually retrieving funds.  This is a waste of government funding.  Be able to take non payers to court independently of the CMS",

Make non payment of CM a punishable offence in the form of credit scores and independent court proceedings.  DWP needs to bridge CM payments after 12 months of failed retrieval attempts.",
