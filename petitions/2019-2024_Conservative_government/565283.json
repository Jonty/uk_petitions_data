        "additional_details": "Not delaying schools for all years including Y11 &13, children risk the lives of their parents, grandparents and teachers who potentially live in the same household. Delaying schools for a short period of time will still give enough time to Y11 & 13 mocks to take place before their examinations in June/July. \r\nAs summer exams have been pushed back by 3 weeks, closing schools in the new year for a short period gives time for cases to decrease. For GCSE science there should be a reduced curriculum.",
        "background": "It is clear to see from the statistics shown upto the 28th of December that there has been a dramatic increase in COVID 19 cases. On December the 27th there were over 30,000 cases and a day later on the 28th it increased by almost 11,000 cases.",
