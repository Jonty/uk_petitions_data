        "additional_details": "Funding for dementia care by local authorities is not realistic meaning that once a person can't self-fund, they are being removed from a home they have lived in for several years to go somewhere \"cheaper\".  For people living with dementia this is detrimental to their health.  Families are forced into making decisions that they shouldn't be faced with.  Local authorities should offer realistic funding based on the cost of living.  It's about time they saw people as individuals and not cost saving.",

Local authorities aren't offering realistic funding which means that people are being forced from their homes to live somewhere \"cheaper\".",
