It's also not clear what, if anything, you want to happen as a result. Employers normally conduct criminal record checks to determine whether to employ someone applying for a role, but MPs do not have an employer.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
