        "action": "Tax fossil fuels proportionately to the damage caused to the environment.",
        "additional_details": "This is a key issue in the fight to stabilise the climate. Without a disincentive to use fossil fuels any help given to alternative energy and energy saving measures will reduce the demand for fossil fuels and as a consequence reduce the price of ff thus increasing and not reducing consumption.\r\nFunds raised form the tax are badly needed at this time espesially if the govenment intends to support alternatives.\r\nBetter air quality, reduce pressure on the NHS\r\nBritian must take the lead at the COP26.",
        "background": "Introduce a tax that would encourage the reduction in use of fossil fuels in order to encourage alternative sources of power and reduce use of ffs. An example of profligate use, growing trend to weekend breaks in European cities. This would also help to reduce road congestion & help reduce other tax",
