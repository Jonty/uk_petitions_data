        "additional_details": "The government is controlling the press by deciding who can and who cannot hold it to account about its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Thus, a basic tenet of democracy, namely freedom of expression, is being undermined by what appears to be an autocracy, one in which an unelected special advisor has been given seemingly unlimited powers to rewrite the rules of engagement, and is treating the electorate with disdain.  This hypocrisy is undermining scientific advice.",
        "background": "Our democracy is broken.  At a time of national crisis, this government is treating voters with contempt by failing to practise what it preaches.",
