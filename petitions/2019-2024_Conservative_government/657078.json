        "additional_details": "f a female ferret isn't neutered it can be hugely serious. Female ferrets called 'jills' are 'induced ovulators'. This means they need to mate to stimulate the ovaries to release eggs. If the jill does not ovulate, she'll continue to produce oestrogen (she'll stay in season until they're mated).\r\n\r\nBut, remaining in season can cause severe health problems for a jill. It can cause alopecia (hair loss) and even death from oestrogen-associated anaemia (deficiency in red blood cells).",
        "background": "The company making the delvosteron jab ceased production, putting the lives of ferrets at risk, and risk causing Jill's to be needlessly bred and litters of kits to be dumped. Failing that Jill's will die. The jab is cheap and reliable.",
