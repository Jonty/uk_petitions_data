        "additional_details": "Our society is failing young people. They have inherited an uncertain future involving environmental collapse, reduced opportunities for education and employment, and an increasingly polarised world. Their education system is focused on exam results rather than true enrichment. And yet we are not helping them. Mental and social care services are so reduced that most cannot access help when they need it. We are not equipping them with the skills they need to flourish in an uncertain world.",
        "background": "Develop a cross-cutting strategy that identifies the key issues and challenges faced by our children and young people - covering environmental, economic and social issues - and the policies, agencies and funding needed to address these and protect the mental wellbeing of children and young people.",
