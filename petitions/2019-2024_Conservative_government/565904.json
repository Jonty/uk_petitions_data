        "additional_details": "This will help reduce transmission in school bubbles as the children\u2019s bubbles will be smaller. It also helps families that are trying to shield high risk family members. \r\nI don\u2019t believe parents should be penalised for choosing to homeschool their children whilst in Tier 4, at least for the month of January.",
        "background": "In Tier 4 parents should be offered the flexibility for their children to attend school (where they are open) OR home school their children during this current peak in the pandemic (January 2021). Parents should not be fined by their schools or local boroughs for choosing to do so.",
