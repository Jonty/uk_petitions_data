        "additional_details": "Most of us know someone who works for the NHS. Personally, I have both friends and family who work within the NHS. Believe me, some of the horror stories I have heard regarding parking and fines make my blood boil. A nurse FINED because the only available machine was out of order. A porter reprimanded due to his card being declined and thus making him late for duty. The tales go on. To ask for a pay rise for these wonderful people has sadly become a cliche these days. but we CAN help.",
        "background": "It goes without saying that NHS staff have gone above and beyond. Lives have been lost and lives still continue to be at risk. We all came together and clapped - a true show of British solidarity for a debt that can NEVER be repaid. But we can try, starting with free parking for ALL NHS employees.",
