        "additional_details": "It would be very unwise to continue with Brexit when the whole of Europe needs a multilateral approach to restore full economic confidence. We need a postponement of Brexit for a minimum of 5 years to allow Britain to work with the EU as a whole to rebuild our damaged economies. Attempting to complete Brexit during this period threatens the economic and social stability of the UK society.",
        "background": "Please would you ask the PM to consider a postponement of Brexit for a minimum of 5 years to allow Britain to work with the EU as a whole without having to contend with further economic uncertainty and the difficulties of trading friction.",
