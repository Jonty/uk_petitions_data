        "action": "Create and award a range of service medals to recognise/honour NHS workers.",
        "additional_details": "There are thousands of NHS workers fighting in the national interest to combat Corona virus. Doctors, nurses and hospital staff; young, old and retired, have been thrust into a world where they selflessly compromise their own health and well-being on a daily basis for the good of the nation. Doubtless these workers deserve a pay rise, but with economic difficulties forecast coming out of the crisis, another formal way of recognising contributions in a high profile way is required urgently.",
        "background": "A range of service medals (like the existing Military medals) should be introduced nationally, to recognise the outstanding contributions of individuals in the NHS in combatting the Corona crisis (and other future crises). Young staff, outstanding compassion and dedication should all be recognised.",
