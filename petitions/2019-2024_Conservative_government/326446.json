        "action": "End use of the metric system and restore imperial units for weights and measures",
        "additional_details": "Joining the EU inevitably meant that the UK had to adopt metric units of measurement and provide EU federalists with another tool to erode our national identity. This forced our Commonwealth and English-speaking trading partners to follow suit. Imperial units are just as valid and evolved naturally and are therefore superior for reasons of usability. The law must be changed so that imperial units can be restored as part of the process of rebuilding our national identity.",
        "background": "Cease metrication and restore the use of imperial units in all national standards. Businesses should be required to display imperial units relating to their goods or services with metric units in brackets following and/or permitted to trade exclusively in imperial units should they choose to do so.",
