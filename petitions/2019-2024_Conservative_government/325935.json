        "additional_details": "In overlooking the realities of extractive capitalist economies, the legacies of colonialism, imperialism and racialised hierarchies of power, British youth are not made aware of the contributions Black people have made to the UK. Redressing the Eurocentric approach to the national curriculum will illuminate the historical factors that contribute to contemporary POC marginalisation, discrimination and poverty, whilst working towards improving social cohesion and a more inclusive nation.",
        "background": "Reform the national KS1-KS4 curriculum so that History, English and PSHE accurately reflect Black history, & identity in Britain. The marginal and systematic teaching of Empire silences this reality, reinforcing the message that some of the British population are more valued than others.",
