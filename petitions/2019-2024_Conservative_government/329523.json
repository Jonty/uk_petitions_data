        "action": "Require practical GCSEs to involve practical work that contributes to the grade.",
        "additional_details": "I'll use computer science, again, as an example here. Currently, students following the AQA or OCR GCSE computer science course complete two exams to earn their GCSE grade. There is also an added programming project, but this doesn't have any effect on the final GCSE grade.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem because I believe you should be required to use the skills necessary, which a practical project would teach you, in real-life jobs in order to pass GCSEs - in this case it would be programming.",
        "background": "Require practical GCSE subjects, for example computer science, to include at least some coursework (practical assessment) that contributes towards the overall GCSE grade given at the end of Year 11.\r\nThis could be having a programming project that contributes towards the computer science grade.",
