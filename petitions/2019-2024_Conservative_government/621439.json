        "additional_details": "I\u2019m a DVSA approved driving instructor and new into this career. It seems fundamentally wrong that a 45 min assessment is enough to gauge safe driving for life. Most people due to human nature pick up bad habits in every skill. Driving is one skill where bad habits have to be eliminated. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that every 10yrs a full licence holder re-takes their driving test. If they fail, then this is good as they are not safe and hopefully realise the need to fine tune their skills.",
        "background": "Currently a 17yr old can be assessed in 45 minutes if they are safe or not to drive and this licence lasts their lifetime. Nothing is in place to ensure safe driving for life. Too many people lose their life due to reckless driving.\r\n\r\nDriving ability should be assessed every 10 yrs.",
