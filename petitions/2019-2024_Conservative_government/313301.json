Also to pay respect to our brave NHS workers and show them that the UK and parliament respect what they do for us and that the UK will never be in a position again where doctors and nurses have to fight for basic PPE or to decide who gets to live based purely on available resources or struggle to pay bills based on low incomes. The NHS needs to be the flagship healthcare service",

The UK must have the best health care service in the world and the individuals working in the NHS should have the best wages to match.",
