Farmers get permission to live on a premises because of the welfare aspect of caring for the animals. And also get class Q permission to convert barns to dwellings. It is a welfare issue to leave stabled horses unattended overnight. They can become ill suddenly (colic for example). They can get injured or cast (stuck upside down against a wall).",

Currently it is extremely difficult to near impossible to live on premises where horses are kept stabled whether private or commercial. This could be restricted to only mobile homes.",
