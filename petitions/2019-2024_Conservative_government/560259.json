It could be achieved within a 5 year time line if organised and controlled properly.\r\n\r\nIt would also give \u00a3155 annual boost to all paying the TV licence which would be politically beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe BBC as a govt institution is outdated, and has a left wing bias, is expensive to run, receives complaints of censorship of world news items.",
