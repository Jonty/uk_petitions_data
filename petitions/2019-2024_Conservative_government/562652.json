        "action": "Tier 3 Ice Rinks - Allow all ages to access patch, skating lessons & training",
        "additional_details": "For the adult skating community, skating is hugely beneficial if not essential for physical health & mental well-being. Loss of access to rink facilities for adult skaters is therefore highly detrimental. Restricting access to under 18s risks the livelihoods of many coaches. Reduced income for rinks could then affect all tiers, possibly every UK rink & every UK skater. Adult skaters must have access to these important training sessions & lessons as well as children & should NOT be excluded.",
        "background": "Tier 3 access to gyms, swimming, skiing & snowboarding has resumed for all ages. We as a community of adult skaters need skating to be reclassified as a sport and not entertainment and most importantly we need the govt to allow adult skaters access to the rinks for lessons, training and patch ice.",
