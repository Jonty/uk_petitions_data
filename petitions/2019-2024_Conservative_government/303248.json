Large classes will be a major spreader of infection. Education could continue at home via the internet. Older children may safely be left at home with minimal supervision. Instruct the schools to seriously step up hygiene, reduce class sizes, monitor health of remaining children.  Act NOW before we are forced to follow suit of our neighbours.",

Other countries allowed  rapid infection, now forced to shut down, causing health, economic and social disaster. We are encouraged to avoid mass gatherings, yet send 8.2 m to school daily",
