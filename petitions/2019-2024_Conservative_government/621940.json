        "additional_details": "Instead of cutting pollution, because many drivers have to take longer routes, doing increased mileage in heavy traffic, which due to these schemes are all forced onto heavily congested roads using increased fuel consumption and causing an increase in pollution.  These traffic charging schemes and ULEZ zones have been a complete failure and all, including the London charges, should be scrapped without delay.",
        "background": "All ULEZ, pollution and congestion charges should be scrapped as they are not cutting pollution but increasing it.  They also hit the poorest the hardest as they mostly drive older cars which fall foul of these unfair charges.",
