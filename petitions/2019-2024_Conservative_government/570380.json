Let\u2019s kickstart the industry and have a right royal knees up at the same time, with a pint or soft drink for every adult in the UK.\r\n\r\nNot only will it get UK residents flocking to the pub, it will also remind us of everything we love about our pub culture. A celebration of the British people and all we've had to endure over the past year.",

For example, if you want the Government to fund a scheme that allows every individual to get a free drink from a hospitality venue when they are reopened."
