        "additional_details": "The Five Year Forward View plan did not account for the impacts of a pandemic, in which people have lost loved ones, jobs and relationships, or are at risk of losing jobs, homes, and some cannot afford to provide for their families, all without usual support networks. This has resulted in increased stress, loneliness, and anxiety, and this hasn't been reflected in the funding and action of the government as there have been no additional measures implemented within the NHS mental health services.",
        "background": "Increase funding to NHS mental health services to implement a plan ensuring that earlier triage appointments are available, follow up sessions are offered, and waiting times are reduced following GP referral to account for the impacts of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown on mental health.",
