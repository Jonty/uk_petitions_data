        "additional_details": "As a young woman in the UK I find that having to pay for a problem i can neither control nor want is simply unnecessary. I am also horrified and disturbed that women have to spend as much as \u00a35000 on sanitary products yet contraception is free. Keep in mind that sexual intercourse and activities are an option yet something that half the population have to deal with are paying for something they cannot control. I chose to make this survey to use the voice the government are giving us.",
        "background": "I think that Parliament should make an example of Scotland and make all sanitary products free for women all over the UK. Ending a problem which is so silenced.",
