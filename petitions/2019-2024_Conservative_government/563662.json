SAY NO TO NO DEAL\r\nIt is too late for this to be debated, but this petition is to draw attention to the depth of feeling in the UK.\r\nThere are too many urgent issues in the World that need all nations to pull together.\r\nThis is not a time to pull apart. If we cannot agree terms for leaving the Union, with Europe, our closest friends and neighbours, how can we expect to agree solutions to the World\u2019s greater problems that are leading to extinction of life on our planet, as we know it?\r\nA Brexit with no deal is bad for Britain, bad for Europe and gives the wrong signal to the rest of the World. It is based upon misguided self- interest. It will make life in this country more difficult and more stressful.\r\nThis is not leadership. This is failure.",
