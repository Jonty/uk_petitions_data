We have a golden opportunity to show the world that we are united with Europe and EU against Russian invasion of Ukraine. We want rejoin EU now.",

British people want to be part of EU.\r\nLeaving EU was a mistake and a result of manipulation of public opinion by misinformation and lies about EU and disproportionate exposure of the \"leave\" campaign in the media.",
