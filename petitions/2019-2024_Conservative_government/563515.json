        "additional_details": "The current environment in which new homes are being constructed provides little to no incentive for home builders to incorporate these kinds of technologies into the homes that they build. Due to the nature of the industry, it is only with the implementation of legislation that these technologies would begin to see wide adoption and installation.\r\n\r\nIt is also currently common for restrictive covenants to prevent the installation of such technology without prior approval. This should be illegal.",
        "background": "Introduce legislation requiring that construction of new homes include at least one of: solar panels, domestic wind turbine, air or ground source heat pump.\r\n\r\nThis legislation should also make it illegal to prevent the installation of  these or similar technologies on existing homes.",
