        "additional_details": "More than 100,000 responses were received on the consultation, largely in favour of improving lives of trans people. \r\n\r\nThe government scrapped these results due to their belief that \"the results were skewed by an avalanche of responses generated by trans rights groups.\" \r\n\r\nIt was a consultation on trans rights, and transgender people responded to it. This is not skewing results, this is the voice of the people the Gender Recognition Act effects. Bring back the results. Listen to us!",
        "background": "The government held a consultation regarding the Gender Recognition Act, which aimed to find how the general public thought the UK could help transgendered people. It proceeded to scrap the results. Demand that the results be reconsidered and that the Gender Recognition Act be accelerated.",
