        "action": "Put \u00a31000 into every bank account of working age for a minimum of six months.",
        "additional_details": "This action will remove the fear of unemployment and no income, enable people to keep shopping, working, providing for their families and prevent the economy crashing completely.  It is a comprehensive measure.  The money can be recouped later by a temporary 1% increase on income tax as the economy strengthens.  It also means people will be better able to support the vulnerable in society and focus on health.",
        "background": "Government should avoid bringing people into a complicated benefits system and act now - decisively - to guarantee incomes.  This means putting \u00a31000 into the bank accounts of working age people through existing payroll systems - immediately.",
