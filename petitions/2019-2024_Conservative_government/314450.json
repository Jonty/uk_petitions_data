        "additional_details": "Since the coronavirus outbreak, Universities have been forced to close and shift online. This disruption and closure of campuses means science students are without their labs, art students are without studios, and proper, interactive feedback cannot be obtained. While the pandemic is nobody's fault, students need concrete reassurance that the current situation will not hinder their assessments, degrees, and future careers. A blanket \"no-detriment policy\" is the best way to secure our futures.",
        "background": "A no detriment policy means a student's lowest possible grade is their average from before campus closed. This enables students to improve their grades overall if they can, but means they don't suffer from the disruption of losing their learning space and resources so abruptly.",
