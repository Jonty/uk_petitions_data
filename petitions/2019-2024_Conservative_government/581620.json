        "additional_details": "Stop compulsory hotel quarantine for British nationals living in the UAE. Allow these people to be with their families in a time of profound stress, worry and grief. Allow such individuals to provide negative PCR tests pre and post flight and enable them to be at home with their loved ones in an already difficult time. Mandatory hotel stays are not only costly and inhumane, but completely lacking in compassion and a waste of precious time for those affected.",
        "background": "The UAE is one of the safest places to live in the world, yet remains red-listed.  \r\nRestrictions are preventing nationals, with terminally ill relatives from returning home quickly. In such extenuating circumstances, restrictions should be lifted for Britons in the UAE to travel directly home.",
