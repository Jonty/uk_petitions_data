Fiscal studies show that Scotland\u2019s fiscal deficit has risen to nearly \u00a32,000 per person after the gap between tax income and spending widened to become more than three times larger than the UK as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe SNP has treated UK politics with contempt in pursuit of its own independence agenda with attempts to derail Brexit negotiations & undermine trade talks. The rest of the UK should be allowed to vote on allowing Scotland to remain part of the union.",
