Many people have parents, sons, or siblings living in their home country and I feel like they should have the right to see their families more easily. If they come to UK just to visit their families and friends then there should be no problem at all, as long as they are not working or claiming benefits, and are able to support themselves or someone is supporting them.",

This will give easy access to people that live in those countries to travel and visit their families in the UK.",
