        "additional_details": "Whilst some students have felt a sense of relief at the cancellation of exams, others have understandably been disappointed given the DfE's stance on the significance of exams as the fairest method of assessment. In this light, students who have spent years preparing for external assessment and would feel unfairly judged by teacher assessment, should have the option to sit exams this summer in order to ensure these exam cancellations do not serve as an impediment to their future.",
        "background": "I would like the government to give students, who feel they would be unsatisfied with teacher assessed grades, the opportunity to sit optional exams this summer. Thereby, allowing these students to subsequently obtain the higher of either the teacher or exam assessed grades.",
