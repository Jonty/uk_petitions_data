        "action": "Formally classify unpaid carers as \"workers\" of the state, under the law.",
        "additional_details": "Unpaid carers are required under UK law to provide care for a minimum of 35 hours per week (most work over 60). This is a term of employment. Carers working 60 hours per week receive on average \u00a32.30 per hour. This is not acceptably. The way the UK treats carers is exploitation, affording them no workers rights at all, as valued members of the workforce who save the UK \u00a3135 billion per year, equivelant to the budgets for the NHS in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland combined.",
        "background": "We the undersigned want the UK Parliament to pass legislation formally classifying unpaid carers as \"workers\" under UK law, just like their private and public sector counterparts and give them the same rights as any other worker.",
