        "additional_details": "This petition is to request the Government, specifically the DfE, to explain if there will be any change to the exams taking place in 2022. As Year 10 and 12 have been struck the most in school closures, as they have lost 6 months of education face-to-face, with now even more being lost with the 3rd national lockdown. If they are to be told about the changes for GCSE exams, it could reduce stress for the pupils and keep them on track in education.",
        "background": "As of January 8th, all students taking their exams in May 2021 have had their exams cancelled and have their grades given by teacher tests, or based on their coursework. As for the students taking part in the exams next year, they\u2019re being left with no word of what\u2019s going to happen.",
