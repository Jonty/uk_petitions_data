        "additional_details": "Because there are lots of overseas trained qualified nurses in the UK who are working in different areas due to being unable to register with the NMC for several reasons. They have been in the country for such a long time and have been working in various areas especially in the area of health care assistants' profession; and without being able to communicate effectively, they will not be able to continue in their roles. It will be wiser if the government takes the initiative to promote them as band 4 associate practitioners which will be a great support for the nurses and eventually they can try to clear the CBT and OSCE exams required to qualify as Registered nurses in this country.",
        "background": "Introduce a new hospital-based adaptation program for nursing associates for overseas trained qualified nurses in the UK who are working in different settings due to being unable to register with the NMC for several reasons. It will help the NHS during the crisis",
