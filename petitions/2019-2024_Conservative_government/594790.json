I\u2019d like the government and parliament to mandate swabbing in the UK because people are dying and the possibility of a match being found and the reason it was not found is because not everyone knows about the stem cell register and it would be great if they did as so many lives would be saved and there would not be any lacking of ethnicity\u2019s that are a minority. This simple strategy can save lives",

Such charities such as Anthony Nolan & DKMS are well known to help cancer patients when in need however the fight again blood cancer can be won easier having it mandated as it is a harmless process",
