        "additional_details": "As someone who is in eating disorder recovery, it has taken a long time for me to avoid counting calories as much as I can. \r\n\r\nCalories can be very triggering, especially to those who have struggled with disordered eating in the past. Things like this could lead to relapses or mental health plummeting as even making it to a restaurant is a big enough challenge for people like me. \r\n\r\nAnorexia is the most fatal mental health condition in young people and should not be taken lightly.",
        "background": "Calorie content should not be placed on menus to order off as absolutely everyone in the restaurant will see this (i.e. children, people in eating disorder recovery). Instead make it more accessible for those interested in reading the calorie content of a food rather than forcing it upon everyone.",
