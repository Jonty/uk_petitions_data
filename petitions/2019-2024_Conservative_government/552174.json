        "additional_details": "The wedding industry is being crushed even more now with the 15 person cap recently announced. Wedding suppliers and venues now face mass cancellations and loss of income. This will lead to wedding related businesses going under. \r\nCouples were just about getting their heads around having only 30 guests and work was slowly picking up for suppliers although it has been massively dented. However only allowing 15 is devastating the industry completely.",
        "background": "Lift the cap on weddings to allow more than 15 people to attend.\r\nPut the limit back up to 30, the same as funerals.",
