        "additional_details": "This pandemic has been a very challenging time for everyone, some more than others. There is already so much stress on students in year 12 when it comes to applications and these examinations should have been cancelled as they are formal exams just like GCSEs and A-levels, which have been cancelled. There is stress for future applicants regarding predicted graded, personal statements, work experience etc. and this adds to the stress and is unfair. Nothing has been put in place to help students.",
        "background": "Get rid of university aptitude examinations in the UK for 2021 entrance (UCAT, BMAT etc.) as it is adding too much stress for students. Aspiring university students are not in the right state of mind to be taking such formal and important exams.",
