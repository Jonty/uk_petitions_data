        "additional_details": "Pedophiles and rapists are mentally ill humans which cannot be rehabilitated. They do not deserve to walk on the face of the earth as they aren\u2019t okay in the head. Punishment for these humans isn\u2019t harsh enough and their sentence should be death. If you do not agree with this you are openly supporting pedophiles and rapists. As for murderers we can all agree that taking someone\u2019s life is extremely wrong and anyone that does it deserves to die themselves.",
