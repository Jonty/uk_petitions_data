        "additional_details": "HMRC have taken an abusive and bullying approach to the IR35 tax regulations. Having been unable to prove that people are flouting tax rules by operating a legitimate limited company providing services, HMRC have decided the end client must determine a scenario which they themselves have been unable to achieve. They have created an ominous threatening approach to the end user which has results in blanket contrived status determinations finding people inside IR35 in contradiction to the CEST tool",
        "background": "Stop the reforms to IR35 implementation to be rolled out on April 6th. Many contractors will now face no work or less work due to the immediate and long term impact on the economy from the  Coronavirus outbreak.\r\nThe assessment process is fatally flawed and results financially crippling.",
