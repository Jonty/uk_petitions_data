As kids are easier to educate we can raise them to be more open minded. In my school I\u2019ve only had one lesson about the community yet it didn\u2019t go into any detail at all. People in schools are transphobic or homophobic I feel because they aren\u2019t as educated and therefore less open minded. If we spread awareness we would able to raise more accepting open minded people.",

In those lessons the sexualities and gender identities that aren\u2019t talked about will be talked about, also the sex education of same sex relationships. How to bind safely and more.",
