        "action": "Make a license to buy fireworks in the UK for the general public.",
        "additional_details": "If a permit or license is needed to gain fireworks, it would ensure the person would be held responsible for any injuries or disturbances that occur as it would link to location. Forcing a license will not only lower the amount of fireworks as they are a disturbance to many people and animals but also stop people setting them off where they please and risk harming others. There have been too many firework related injuries and property destructions for this to have not already been set in place.",
        "background": "Every year there are stories upon stories about animals and people in distress and getting injured because of fireworks. They\u2019re currently too easily accessible to the public without proper guidance. Fireworks should only be sold to those who own a license, so they don\u2019t fall into the wrong hands.",
