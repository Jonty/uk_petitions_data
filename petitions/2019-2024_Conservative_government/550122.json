        "additional_details": "The prophet of Islam, Muhammad saw is highly respected, loved, honoured and valued by every Muslim that exists. As Muslims, we value the prophet saw more than our own lives. We feel disgusted, discriminated and abused that such defaming images of our beloved prophet saw are going to be released under the banner of \"freedom of speech and expression\". We consider this activity extremely offensive to our religion. We must draw a line between freedom of speech and offensive hate speech/abuse.",
        "background": "Parliament must seriously look into the issue of defaming images of the prophet saw due to be released by French magazine charlie hebdo. These images are extremely offensive to the Muslim community. We request that the UK condemns these images and banns them from all domains and viewing platforms.",
