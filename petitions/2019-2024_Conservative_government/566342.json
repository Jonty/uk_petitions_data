        "additional_details": "This would have the consent of the population in these unprecedented times. The Government are in an uneviable predicament with some calling for harsher measures and others now fearing that \"the cure is worse than the virus\". \r\nAllowing people to lockdown by consent but with strict curbs enforced by a tag whilst others got back to normal would allow the Government to compare 2 distinct cohorts and would also resolve the current discontent.",
        "background": "The Government's Tier System has little popular support with a roughly even split between those supporting a \"full lockdown\" and those wanting to get on with things. I propose pay of 110% furlough to lockdown supporters and tag them to ensure compliance whilst others get back to normal.",

For example, it's not clear if you want the Government to just change rules for individuals, so effectively there is a voluntary income replacement scheme for people who do not want to leave their homes to go to work, or if you want all Covid-19 restrictions to be lifted for individuals and businesses unless they opt in to these. You could also start a petition calling for the current rules to be made advisory, rather than have legal force.\r\n                \r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
