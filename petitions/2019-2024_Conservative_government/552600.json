        "additional_details": "Since schools have opened, the COVID cases have almost doubled in number (beginning of September/end of August was around 3000 new cases per day and has increased to almost 7000 per day in only 3 weeks). The current track and trace system is ineffective as students interact outside of classes (break/lunch or on the way to lessons), so telling individual infected students to isolate within their bubbles does not work as they have not only been in contact with their bubbles. Rates will only increase.",

Since schools have began re opening, the COVID stats have significantly increased due to contact between students-this will increase the death/infection rates in the UK; social distancing measures in schools are weak",
