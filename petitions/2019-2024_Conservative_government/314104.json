        "action": "Change the high income child benefit tax to household income and not sole income",
        "additional_details": "I feel that the way this is calculated is unfair.  I have written to my local MP and have received a reply from the treasury saying that to change the way this tax is calculated it will become means tested and will cost more money.  I feel that it is appalling that if you are in a partnership and one person within the household earns greater than \u00a350k that person is required to complete a self assessment and repay some child benefit.  2 people can earn \u00a349999 each and not repay anything",
        "background": "I want the government to change the way in which the high income child benefit is calculated.  Currently it is based on either member of the household earning greater than \u00a350k.  Where as 2 family members can earn \u00a349999.00 without the need for a self assessment tax return and no child benefit tax",
