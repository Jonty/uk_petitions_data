        "additional_details": "The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is on a scale not seen since World War II. The United Nations has estimated that about 100,000 Ukrainians have already been displaced as a result of the Russian invasion, and that number could ultimately grow to 1 to 5 million. The international community is making preparations to meet their humanitarian needs, but the UK has not made special provisions to support those in the most terrifying and desparate circumstances imaginable.",
        "background": "The UK has stopped accepting visa applications from Ukrainians meaning there is no safe and legal route for them to seek asylum in Britain unless they have British relatives. It is predicted that up to 5 million people could be displaced by the conflict. The UK has a role to play in helping.",
