        "additional_details": "In light of what has happening many people have been very appreciative of the NHS workers in the country. You guys get up and go to work everyday only to be poorly paid, poorly treated and better yet you need to PAY to go to work. Surely this isnt right? These people who look after us, treat our wounds and illnesses? I feel that if you work over a certain amount of days per week for the NHS you should be allowed to park for free! Please sign to help this happen for the heroes in this country",
        "background": "I believe that many NHS workers are over worked and under paid. Im sure they appreciate us clapping but honestly what does that do for them? Not a lot. Why should the people who get so poorly paid anyway then be forced to spend more to park and go to work?",
