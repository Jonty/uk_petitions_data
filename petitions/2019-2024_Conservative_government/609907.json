There's still time for the UK government to do the right thing.\r\nIt will mean that we deny protection to refugees forced to take dangerous journeys to find sanctuary for themselves and their families.\r\nOur government has the power to protect people that need aid and has consistently denied them this. We can show ourselves to be welcoming in opposition to the discrimination our country has shown in recent years.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson promised that Britain will receive people fleeing persecution in Ukraine but this government is currently pushing its anti-refugee Nationality & Borders Bill through Parliament. Continue accepting visas from Ukrainians in hope that other countries would do the same for us.",
