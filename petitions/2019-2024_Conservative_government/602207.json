Cannabis can already be prescribed for medicinal use by clinicians listed on the Special Register of the General Medical Council.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about it on the Government website: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/medicinal-cannabis-information-and-resources\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nLegalise cannabis for recreational and medicinal use:\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/598861"
