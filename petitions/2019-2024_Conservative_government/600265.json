        "additional_details": "The move is not backed by any scientific reason and therefore is clearly only discriminatory and coercive towards vaccination. If lateral flow tests are valid and effective in detecting potential spreaders and positive results should be trusted, that's true regardless of the vaccination status of the individual. Natural immunity in the UK unfortunately is treated as not having immunity, but several studies are confirming the opposite. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1",

All travellers regardless of their vaccination status should be allowed to use this cheaper testing method. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-58899612",
