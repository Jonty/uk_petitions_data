        "additional_details": "By telling students that exams will go ahead the government is prioritising children from wealthier families with access of resources like a computer and textbooks at home.  Different levels of Covid-19 across the country has meant that some schools have sent year groups home to self-isolate whilst other areas have been relatively unaffected.  Online learning for in most schools is no replacement for face to face tuition.  This is not equality of opportunity.",
        "background": "GCSEs and A-Levels must be cancelled in order to ensure fairness for students all across the country from different backgrounds.  Private schools, students in areas of the country less affected by Covid-19 and students with adequate resources at home have all had an unfair advantage.",
