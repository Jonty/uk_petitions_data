        "additional_details": "The government needs to increase testing so that the people can return to a semblance of normal life, without continuing the lock down indefinitely. Testing must be increased to reduce the severity of the impact on the future economy and to minimise the poverty that will be a result of such actions if they are continued.",

Fulfil the promise made by Boris Johnson made on 19th March to increase testing to 25,000/day and test all NHS workers.",
