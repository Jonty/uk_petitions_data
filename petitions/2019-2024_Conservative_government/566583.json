        "additional_details": "In Scotland, couples who don\u2019t live together are exempt, and in Wales you can form an \u201cextended household\u201d with your partner. Why not in England? With all the stress, uncertainty and anxiety caused by the coronavirus pandemic it is unfair to push people apart from their partners. Living together may simply not be an option for certain couples, and it should be up to the individual whether they want to meet their partner. After all this time, it is unrealistic to expect people to be apart.",
        "background": "The Government should make couples living apart in established relationships exempt from Covid restrictions. Restrictions have now been in place for nearly a year, putting strain on relationships and causing added anxiety. Couples living apart should be able to form a support bubble.",
