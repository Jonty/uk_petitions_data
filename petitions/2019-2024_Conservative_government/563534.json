We're also not sure whether you'd like this new service to replace existing public service ombudsman services. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking for a new single tribunal service to be set up for public complaints about all public services, if that's what you'd like to happen. "
