        "action": "Automatically upgrade category A2 motorcycle license to category A after 2 years",
        "additional_details": "I believe this will encourage more people to take to riding motorcycles, motorcycles have the benefit of easing congestion in large city\u2019s such as London and they also emit less emissions than a car. \r\n\r\nThe A2 license is often taken on restricted versions of category A compliant bikes. Due to this, it is believed that automatically upgrading the license does not pose any safety risks that would be prevented by taking the same test on a unrestricted bike.",
        "background": "The motorcycle community would like the government to automatically upgrade the category A2 license to the full category A license, 2 years from the date of passing. As per previous law.",
