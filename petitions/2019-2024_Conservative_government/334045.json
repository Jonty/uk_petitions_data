        "additional_details": "It\u2019s the current government policy keeping the GP surgeries closed. It makes no sense because all we do is go to our local 111 service provider instead. Rather than backing up that system the government should re open GP surgeries so patients can go an see their own doctor. This could be done the same way as other practices such as vets, where patients can wait in their cars until their allotted time then if both GP and patient use masks at least most things could be dealt with or referred on.",
        "background": "Currently due to Covid we cannot access GP surgeries and can only have phone appointments. Many patients needs to actually see their doctor for underlying health conditions. I want GP surgeries to accept patients back using all current safety precautions.",
