        "additional_details": "As citizens valuing engagement, we assert that abstention should be a last resort in divisive matters. Without transparent justifications, it breaches their duty, eroding our democratic institutions. We urgently demand a thorough debate on abstention in division votes. Principles and procedures must be examined and revised for transparency and accountability. Members abstaining should publicly state reasons, empowering constituents to scrutinize and hold them accountable.",
        "background": "Many elected officials, including the Prime Minister, have abstained from division votes without adequate explanations. This issue was prominent in Division 258, held on June 19, 2023. We urge each abstaining representative to provide a comprehensive account of their decision.",
