        "additional_details": "The recent move to require the installation of single-sex toilets, and the proposed changes to enforce single-sex spaces as such, has alienated many transgender and non-binary individuals. This change would ensure new regulations accommodate concerns from both sides of the debate. It is important that the support for gender-neutral facilities are not ignored for the sake of single-sex facilities.",
