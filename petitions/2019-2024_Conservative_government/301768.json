This in turn will have a huge affect on the credit ratings of individuals and thus massively reducing any chance of mortgage/credit acceptance in the near future.\r\nA freeze for 2-3 months would ease the burden and make living a bit more bearable.",
        "background": "To consider a freeze on mortgage, rent, credit card/loan, council tax and utility bills for the employed and self employed if the spread of Coronavirus escalates and we either have to self isolate due to contamination or if we are forced not to work.",
