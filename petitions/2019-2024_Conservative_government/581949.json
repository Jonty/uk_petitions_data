        "additional_details": "To help with this, in the US, \u201csafe haven baby boxes\u201d have been added to the exterior walls of hospitals or designated fire stations. Safe haven baby boxes are places where parents can safely and anonymously hand over their child to a place where the parent believes they will be better cared for. In the UK, the government are yet to consider this. While abandonment is illegal in the UK, it continues to happen, so why not help to ensure it is done in a safe way?\r\nI hope you consider helping me in this cause.",
        "background": "In the UK, 1000+ babies are abandoned annually. This may be down to reasons such as the mothers incapability to care for a child (as a result of cryptic pregnancy, living conditions etc).",
