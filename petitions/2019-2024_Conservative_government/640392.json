Manifacturers such as apple, sony have been making moves against 3rd-party repair so they can make more money off customers. These manifacturers have been creating software which actively rejects non-original/oem hardware so they can force customers to come back to them if they have a broken device, they can't go anywhere else, the oems offer unreasonable prices so they can force the customer to buy a new product.",
