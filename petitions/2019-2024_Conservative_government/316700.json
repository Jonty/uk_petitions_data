        "additional_details": "I reluctantly ceased my nursing duties in 2015 due to ill health, after injurying myself doing a job I loved. 4 years later I am still not able to work, I recieved no support financially or otherwise. Disappointingly, this was due to under-staffing. For far too long NHS staff have been overlooked and not rewarded for their heroic work. An NHS Day would undoubtedly lift spirit's, and give an opportunity for recognition of the hard work staff do.",
        "background": "I would like the nation to hold an annual NHS Day  an opportunity to celebrate the hard work NHS staff carry out. A chance to honour keyworkers who have worked relentlessly throughout this pandemic and beforehand. To be recognised for the great work they do.",
