        "additional_details": "Despite all major counselling and psychotherapy bodies in the UK, including the NHS itself, condemning LGBT conversion therapy, it is still legal and LGBT individuals in the UK are still exposed to this psychological and emotional abuse to this day, which has life-long mentally damaging effects.\r\n\r\nConversion therapy is not a complex issue.\r\nMake the act of purposefully trying to change someone\u2019 else\u2019s gender identities or sexuality a criminal offence.\r\nIt sickens us and it needs stopped.",
        "background": "We know the government should:\r\nmake running conversion therapy in the UK a criminal offence \r\n\u2022 forcing people to attend said conversion therapies a criminal offence \r\n\u2022 sending people abroad in order to try to convert them a criminal offence \r\n\u2022 protect individuals from conversion therapy",
