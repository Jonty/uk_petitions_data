        "additional_details": "Please Stop the development of 850 homes! That works out at appx 1700 cars, and appx 3400+ people! This area is already crowded. The hospital is already over flowing and bursting at the seams. The traffic situation is already an issue with the massive number of cars and with Pyms Lane being closed, causes more congestion. This new housing development will do nothing for Leighton, and will only cause issues and spoil \u2018Crewe\u2019s Countryside\u2019.",
        "background": "There will be a new development of 850 homes on ex-farmland. Crewe is already overcrowded, and hasn\u2019t got the capacity to deal with the homes. Also Leighton is known for it\u2019s farm/green land and by building on it is ruining its name.",
