        "action": "Reverse the decision to increase UK nuclear warhead numbers from 180 to 260.",
        "additional_details": "Mr Johnson's desired increase in nuclear armaments will be at the cost of our conventional forces and any hope of seeing properly funded social care, will provide further ammunition to those wishing to see Scotland leave The Union and do nothing to mitigate the consequences of our other, far from insubstantial, current predicaments while providing justification to others seeking to increase their own nuclear stockpiles, having spent decades negotiating the deceleration of the last arms race.",
        "background": "A 2010 agreement was to see the number of UK nuclear warheads fall to 180. As part of his \"Integrated Review\", the PM seeks to reverse that and increase the number to 260. I want the Government to revert to the existing agreement.",
