        "additional_details": "We live in a world where Christianophobia is a growing problem. Here in the U.K., as well as Europe, over several decades successive governments have openly promoted mass-immigration and diversity. The result of such policies has led to a significant surge in anti-Christianism; evidenced directly in the growing intolerance of Saint George - England\u2019s patron saint, damage to churches and planned or actual terrorist acts against Christians (e.g. St Paul\u2019s Cathedral). \r\n\r\nProtect Christianity Now.",
        "background": "We want the Government to recognise Christianophobia as the fear of, hatred of, or prejudice against the Christian religion or Christians generally. \r\n\r\nWe want the Government to consider such phobia as constituting racism towards a defined group.",
