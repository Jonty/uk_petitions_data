        "additional_details": "Prisoners are still people with human rights and basic rights. Prisoners have suffered extremely with their rights taken. Prisoners have not been able to have visits with friends or family for over 2 months, with the most contact being a phone call that\u2019s not allowed to last longer than 15 minutes. Prisoners are locked up for 23.5 hours a day only being allowed half an hour for fresh air OR a shower. Prisons are over populated with 2 and 3 men sharing 1 small cell. Fathers, sons, brothers, mothers, sisters and daughters all unable to see their loved ones. Time is prison is punishment enough, time in prison during the corona virus is torture. Recognition for this must be taken by the small step of reducing sentences by half the time that prisoners have served in lockdown.",
