We're not sure whether you want all of these venues to prepare meals only to a value of 30p in all circumstances, or if you'd like MPs only to be eligible to purchase meals to a value of 30p in catering outlets. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.
