        "additional_details": "The added pressure for women to lose weight in order to proceed with the gruelling and emotionally draining process of IVF is unrealistic and unfair. Two people can be the same height and wear the same size clothes, yet one can be 3 stone lighter than the other. That person will be accepted for IVF but the other would have to lose 3 stone. Being heavier doesn't always mean you're unhealthy. Of course being healthy increases chances but it should be assessed individually. Person-centred care!",
        "background": "At the moment, the NHS determines a 'healthy' BMI as under 30 for IVF treatment. This is extremely outdated and many healthcare professionals in the fertility sector also admit this is outdated. The BMI scale cannot separate fat from muscle. some people are healthy but weigh more",
