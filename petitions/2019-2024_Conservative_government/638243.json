Meaning more gaps, unsafe staffing during a global pandemic, potential of ward closures if  bank staff did not step up and help and cover those gaps. \r\nBank staff although are 0 hours are there to help trusts when they are at critical low staffing levels going above and beyond to fill gaps even last minute when staff phone in sick at short notice! Yet are excluded!",
