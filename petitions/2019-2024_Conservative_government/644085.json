        "additional_details": "I have always had staffies growing up and never had a problem, as they was so loving and gentle. The bread does not matter as any dog can be aggressive as something in them changes. As humans we can learn a lot from dogs as they love unconditionally when in the right environment. Staffies / XL bullies and all dogs are the most loyal, daft and goofy animals and they make this world a better place. It is going to get to the point where we ban all dogs in the UK?",
        "background": "It is so easy to own a dog, when dogs are loved right they are loving and caring, to make life safer for them, and people do it so the owners need to have a license so there is a background check to make sure they are safe and can provide the right environment. Stop the problem where it begins.",
