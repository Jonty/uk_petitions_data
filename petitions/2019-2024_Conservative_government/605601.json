        "additional_details": "Lateral flow tests have been an essential way to test before attending events, visiting vulnerable friends/family and also for work. By making them no longer free, this reduces the accessibility for the British public who are already facing an increase in national insurance, energy prices and more. Cases are still rapidly increasing and with COVID-19 mutating, this couldn\u2019t come at a more inconvenient time.",
        "background": "Government sources have leaked Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to stop Lateral Flow Tests from being free. These plans must be addressed formally by the government and scrapped.",
