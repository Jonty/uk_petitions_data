        "additional_details": "As sole traders earning over \u00a350k, we feel that we should be offered the same financial assistance as those who are employed and furloughed.   \r\n\r\nWe chose not to be a limited company, as we're happy to pay taxes on the income we earn, and not hide behind a minimum salary and dividends.\r\n\r\nMany of us work in the Live Events industry which has been decimated by the necessary measures for coping with the pandemic. \r\n\r\nWe simply don\u2019t understand why this assistance isn't available to all self-employed.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to reconsider the \u00a350,000 eligibility threshold for financial assistance to sole traders, and give them financial support in line with the 95% already covered.  There are many hard working, and currently financially struggling, sole traders that urgently need this help.",
