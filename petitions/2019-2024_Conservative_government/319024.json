        "action": "Allow 2-year leave by Graduate route to 2020 students graduating in the pandemic",
        "additional_details": "It would be unfair to graduating students to be subjected to harsh circumstances and economic hardship during these unprecedented times. While many commenced their course prior to the announcement of new route, they nevertheless face unforeseeable and extraordinary circumstances. While one can work post-study, many graduate level jobs are not available due to a hiring freeze. Also, many have lost their job offers and are unable to benefit from the favourable terms to switch into skilled work.",
        "background": "COVID-19 pandemic has caused uncertainty in the plans of the graduating class with many unable to pursue their projected career path. I strongly urge that 2020 graduates be allowed to avail the benefits of the Graduate route due to be implemented in 2021 in order to mitigate the impact of crisis.",
