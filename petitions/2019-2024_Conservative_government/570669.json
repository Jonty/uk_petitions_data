        "additional_details": "Most people are paid annual salaries on a monthly basis, meaning that their annual salary will be divided by 12 and paid in equal monthly installments.  However, that annual salary is based upon a 365 day year.  Every leap year, employees who are paid a monthly salary effectively work for free that extra day.  They still have their living expenses, but they do not earn an extra day's pay for their extra day's work.  The solution is to make the day a Bank Holiday.  One extra bank holiday every four years will not harm the economy but it will ensure that those who work for other people are treated fairly.",
        "background": "Create an extra bank holiday on or around the end of February every leap year.",
