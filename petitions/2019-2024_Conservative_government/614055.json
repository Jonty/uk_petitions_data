        "additional_details": "There is absolutely no need for the Government to privatise Channel 4 when the broadcaster is so successful already. This needs to stop. We don't want assets being sold off to the highest bidder. The statement that this is so that Channel 4 can compete with Netflix and Amazon is complete nonsense as they are not comparable.",
        "background": "Stop the government from privatising Channel 4 to raise short term funds. Channel 4 has been publicly owned since it's creation 40 years ago and is a world leader for culture, arts, film and independent news broadcasting. The government should be protecting C4 and not asset stripping for profit.",
