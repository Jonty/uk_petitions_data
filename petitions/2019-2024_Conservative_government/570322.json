With the U.K. aiming to champion the transition to a greener economy, the existence of proposals like this will make us a laughing stock in the global community. Post-Brexit; at a time where we need to secure our position as a prominent global figure, we need to innovate the industries of the future and bury the outdated methods of the past.",
        "background": "The government must intervene and stop the creation of the mine. Show the country that the impact of fossil fuels on our planet is not a \u201clocal issue\u201d. Each decision made that will be a detriment to our environment must be scrutinised and evaluated on a national level before it is approved.",
