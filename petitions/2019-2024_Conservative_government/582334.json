There are very few venues where we are allowed to take pictures of our clients without being asked for a permit which ranges from \u00a3120-300 per hour. Often our shoots are unnoticeable and do not obstruct or cause any disturbance. We are also contributing to advertising the UK and generating beautiful images for small bunsinesses to share whcih benefits everyone.",
