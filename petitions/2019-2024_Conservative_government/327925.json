        "additional_details": "People have always been bullied at school, but when you got home as a child, it was your safe spot, but not anymore. \r\n\r\nIn the era of social media, it's almost impossible to stay away from your demons, as its constantly by your side. Suicide and self-harm numbers have grown dramatically, and predominantly in Asian and African households, as unfortunately many migrant parents fail to understand the effect of mental health, on the youth of today. So the schools need to help and step in to help.",
        "background": "The government should make sure mental health is spoken about more and isn't a taboo subject, and to further help this point, every kid should have a meeting with a member of staff or older pupil (6th former) once every 2 weeks, where they can spend 30 min talking about whatever they want.",
