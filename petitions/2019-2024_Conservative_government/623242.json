        "additional_details": "I want to see a leader that's voted in BY THE PEOPLE. \r\nThe General Public vote a party in based on the values and the person leading that part. Liz Truss is not a representation of the people.\r\n\r\nI want to see her OUT and a public election where THE PEOPLE can decide who runs this country based on leader and parties policies especially in these difficult times with the energy crisis.",
        "background": "We don't want Liz Truss running as leader of the Conservatives and want her OUT as Prime Minster. She doesn't have the demeanour to be a leader, she already caused Russia to go on combat alert due to her comments on the Ukraine war, and outspoken attitude has upset the French President Macron.",
