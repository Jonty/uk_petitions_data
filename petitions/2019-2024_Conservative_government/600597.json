        "additional_details": "Throughout the last few years and over lockdown, the number of cases of eating disorders have sky rocketed. There is over a years waiting time for treatment for eating disorders. The idea of including calories on menus will not tackle the problem with obesity. Restaurants like McDonalds, Pret, Starbucks etc already include this information on their menus and this has not reduced the statistics on obesity. There are other ways to do this without harming people\u2019s mental health.",
        "background": "Don\u2019t make it mandatory for cafes and restaurants to include calories on menus as an attempt at tackling obesity. Consider how this would affect people with eating disorders and how it could be a catalyst for more people to develop EDs and encourage a negative relationship with food.",
