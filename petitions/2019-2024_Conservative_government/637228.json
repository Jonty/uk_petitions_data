        "additional_details": "We would like the government to expand their financial support to build more locations for food banks. We would also like them to set up a system where the public can get more involved, this could be things like creating awareness where people donate their uneaten food to local foodbanks. This, in turn would mean the government wouldn't have to aid the foodbanks as much financially, but instead get the public involved. Donating food would also help the huge food waste crisis we are experiencing.",
        "background": "We would like the government to increase the support for foodbanks around the UK, this can range from financial support, to building more foodbanks and/or creating more outlets to make them more accessible to the people who rely.",
