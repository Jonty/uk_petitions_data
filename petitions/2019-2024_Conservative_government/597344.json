        "additional_details": "There are around 250, 000 South Africans living in the United Kingdom. Many South Africans living in the UK, as well as non-South Africans are desperate to visit loved ones living there, or are already in the vicious cycle of holidays booked prior to Covid.\r\nNot only does South Africa being on the red list mean that people are unable to afford the extortionate cost of hotel quarantine, but many are haemorrhaging money as a result of constant re-booking that they are unable to get out of.",
        "background": "South Africa has been on the red list for months whilst other countries with higher cases per 100k, lower vaccine rates, more variants and less restrictions remain on green and amber. \r\nThere is no scientific data that justifies the restrictions in place for those returning from South Africa.",
