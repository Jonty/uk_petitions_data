        "additional_details": "UK participation in the EHIC scheme ensures that British people in the EU, EEA and Switzerland can get medically necessary healthcare, treatment of chronic or pre-existing medical conditions and maternity care, for free or at discounted prices. \r\n\r\nWithout the EHIC, it is likely that their travel insurance costs would increase. \r\n\r\nThe latest draft Brexit agreement does not cover healthcare costs of UK pensioners who move to the EU after the transition period either. This is unacceptable.",
