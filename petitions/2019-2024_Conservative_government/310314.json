        "additional_details": "It is an unprecedented time and I continually see people say \"when this is all over pubs will be full as will restaurants, we will not take little things for granted. The UK gets the least amount of bank holidays in Europe so this would provide some national cheer and show the government want to enrich the lives of people after hardship.",
        "background": "Due to the current UK lockdown the upcoming bank holidays scheduled for 10 & 13th April will effectively be unused. Why not build national spirit and help the economy (people will be in pubs etc if summer) by moving this 2 days to after lockdown is finished.",
