        "action": "Ban the sale of fireworks to the public",
        "additional_details": "The effect fireworks have on animals and people suffering from mental health issues is upsetting and not worth it. Many animals die every year from epileptic fits caused by stress that the sound fireworks make. The intense lights and sudden loud noises can take people suffering from PTSD back to the time of their trauma in a split second. Veterans with wartime trauma and survivors of gun violence are two of the groups worst affected by the displays.",
        "background": "I would like the government to ban the sale of fireworks to the general public and only allow them at professional public displays. While fireworks may make alot of money through sales the effects this has on animals and people suffering from mental health issues isnt worth it.",
