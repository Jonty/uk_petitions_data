        "additional_details": "We all have experienced the challenge of seeing a GP and some people end up going to the local A&E instead. The current system is broken and requires a proactive approach to address it. Therefore, I strongly urge Parliament to change the way GPs are being paid and incentivised. Also, if GPs want to earn more, allow them to sell harmless but controlled medications like Melatonin, which is available throughout Europe without prescription but impossible to get in England.",
        "background": "The NHS pays GPs based on the number of patients they have on their books regardless they see the patients or not. This approach is inefficient and doesn\u2019t motivate GPs to see patients and provide competent care. The NHS should pay GPs based on the number of patients they see in any given month.",
