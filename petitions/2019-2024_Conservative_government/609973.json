        "additional_details": "The current visa system is restrictive with entry only allowed if visiting family, on holiday, on a business trip, for medical reasons, staying with a child, studying, getting married etc. These conditions are unlikely to apply to most Ukranians. There needs to be something quicker, easier and much less restrictive.\r\nUkranians already here need to be able to extend their stay without any requirements, such as the current ones which require them to be a pork butcher, HGV driver, seasonal worker",
        "background": "Enable a quick and easy route for Ukranians who need to come to the UK. Currently the visa process is restrictive, lengthy and potentially costly. It excludes lots of people.\r\nRemove the requirement for Ukranians already here to extend stay by another route i.e. through the seasonal worker scheme",
