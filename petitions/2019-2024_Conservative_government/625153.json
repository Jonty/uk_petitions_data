        "additional_details": "Since the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, announced a raft of economic policies, the sterling has been in free fall, and the government borrowing cost has been rising. \r\n\r\nDespite all that has been happening in the markets - which has real implications for people's finances - the new PM is not willing to change the policies. \r\n\r\nThe new PM is leading the country in the wrong direction, and I am calling parliament to force her to resign and call for a general election immediately.",
        "background": "The new Prime Minister has just been in Power for about 36 days and based on her policies, the Sterling has already hit an all-time low, the cost of borrowing for the UK government is climbing but the Prime Minister is doubling down on her policies even though the numbers don't add up.",
