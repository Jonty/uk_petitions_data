        "additional_details": "We are calling upon the Government to waive the fee for driving theory test resits for learner drivers with certificates that've expired during the pandemic. \r\n\r\nMany learner drivers have experienced multiple test cancellations and now face waits of up to five months to sit driving tests, during which time theory tests have expired/are expiring. The mental health and economic situations of many learner drivers have already been severely impacted; they should not have to pay to resit theory tests.",
        "background": "As of January 2021, 49,543 driving theory test pass certificates were thought to have expired during the pandemic. With theory tests priced at \u00a323, if each certificate is renewed, the DVSA will pocket \u00a31,139,489 million from the misfortune of these learner drivers. Please waive the test resit fee.",
