        "additional_details": "Stop solitary confinement of 23 hours plus a day, as an easy way out. Ensure prisoners have the opportunity to maintain relationships with the outside world by way of letters, emails and visits. Prison officers must be made to process replies to family/friends quickly to prevent breakdown of relationships for both parties. Allow prisoners to basic health care when needed. They have potentially paid their national insurance their entire lives and have the right like anyone else to help quickly.",
        "background": "All Prisoners are being treated like animals or extremely dangerous human beings due to Covid in prisons. Prisoners have the right to basic human rights, deserve more than 30 mins outside of a room a day. Prisoners should not be treated as though they are beyond help. Rehabilitation isn\u2019t happening.",
