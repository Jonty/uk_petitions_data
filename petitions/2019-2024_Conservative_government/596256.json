        "action": "Reduce cutting our roadside verges",
        "additional_details": "Currently, many roadside verges in my home county (Hampshire) are cut 12+ times annually, wasting our taxes, and suppressing a valuable wildlife habitat. If Plantlife's management guide were adopted, these featureless verges would turn into wildflower meadows, growing far slower than the current turfs, and absorbing Carbon 3x faster than Forest. The management guide details exactly how this will be done practically and safely. Please only sign this if you live/work/study in Hampshire.\r\n\r\nThankyou.",
        "background": "Adopt the wildlife-friendly management guidelines jointly coined by Plantlife, the Highways Authorities and other organizations on Hampshire\u2019s roadside verges, to help wildlife and the environment, creating Carbon sinks, saving money, and achieving governmental land and environment targets.",
