        "additional_details": "We, IAL students around the world, are pleading to the UK government to reconsider their decision and make the same call they have for the UK students, as to preserve the interest of students and maintain equal treatment internationally. Many of them will attempt to enter UK universities, and now have an uphill battle against students who, due to not having to sit exams will in most cases be awarded grades they would not necessarily get if they were to sit exams, and as such it puts International students at a competitive disadvantage.",
        "background": "Through this petition, all we are asking for is an equal chance for success, and equal opportunities for students both in the UK and globally, as this mass outbreak of COVID-19 is likely to affect many students sitting these exams internationally, and in many cases worse than the UK\u2019s outbreak.",
