        "action": "Harvest \u00a32.5 trillion UK Onshore Gas with no-frack technology & cut CO2 emission",
        "additional_details": "This immediately allows the UK to produce electricity using hydrocarbons but without any CO2 emissions, which then becomes 100% carbon negative. The UK would not need to rely on inconsistent and expensive wind and solar, or need to import LPG from the US and other countries thereby reducing CO2 emissions and preventing huge funds leaving the UK to pay often unfriendly regimes. New employment opportunities will occur and new investments will grow often in poorer areas of the UK",
        "background": "Drill onshore and recover \u00a32.5 trillion of gas using no-frack technology Fit UK electricity producing gas and oil fired power stations with carbon capture flue gas devices and drill under the power station and sequestrate all flue gas scavenged carbon directly into the drilled hole",
