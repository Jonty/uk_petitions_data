        "additional_details": "This war poses a threat not only to Ukraine, but to western ways too. \r\nIf RF win this war, it will boost the economies of their allies ie Iran, North Korea and China. This not only poses a threat to future terrorism but it will boost the economy of China which is already advanced as a global power and military and cyber threat. \r\nIgnoring this war will allow our oppositions to get stronger while we allow inflation to consume western ways. It needs to be addressed now!!",
        "background": "As a friend of Ukraine. Use diplomatic advantages to put pressure on other countries to help in their challenges both financially and military based. F16's only level up the war, however a strategic advantage is required otherwise the winner of the war will be the one which doesn't run out of money.",
