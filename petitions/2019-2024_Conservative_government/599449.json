        "additional_details": "It needs to be done to keep the rates of men and women being raped, sexually assaulted and theft rates down and to help protect people in night clubs/ bars. The effect of date rape drugs on a person after this has taken place can leave marks for life, mentally and physically. If you can test whilst in a bar/club, whilst on a date or just out for a drink either alone or with someone, and your drink comes out positive, you are already safer, you can report it and have more chance of this person being prosecuted.",
        "background": "Reports of men/woman being spiked in night clubs is rising, especially Brighton where is it happening a lot. Clubs should be offering small testing kits for both men and woman, to help protect women and men and to keep them safe and put a stop to this.",
