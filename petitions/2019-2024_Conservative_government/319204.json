        "additional_details": "The manufacturers and product developers should be the experts in their products, it is not reasonable for the general public to be expected to keep up with specific scientific evidence in certain fields e.g. foods and toiletries. There should be a duty of care/culpability in these industries too.\r\n \r\nHopefully a result may be that companies look for non-carcinogenic alternatives. Also having this tax directly assist the NHS and cancer support agencies will ensure that it is relevant.",

Use this tax to pay for NHS services and groups that support/assist those with cancer.",
