This doesn\u2019t help a child puts it in more poverty line. A household income should be back in to force. Not having the time of there lives when they have a child they don\u2019t want to support",

Also a parent should not expect a parent whom the child resides with the receiving parents to just pay 35 pounds a month with 100\u2019s arrears they have a duty of care too to their child",

The Child Maintenance Service has powers to enforce debts for child maintenance arrears, and we can also accept petitions relating to these powers, but it would need to be clear how you wanted these powers to be changed."
