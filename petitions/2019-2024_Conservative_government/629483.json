        "additional_details": "Deforestation is one of the biggest sources of carbon dioxide. Without the Amazon, defeating climate change will be impossible. We have already cut down 17% of the forest, scientists have predicted that by 2030 it will be 27%. Some of the indigenous people have been killed trying to stop the burning of their home. I demand England help stop this devastating destruction.",
        "background": "Thousands of animals get killed each day by the destruction of the Amazon Forest. People burn it down to make way for cattle and land.\r\nThe new president, Jair Bolsonaro, isn\u2019t helping matters. With the support of the Brazilian government, the fires have been growing. This needs to end.",
