        "additional_details": "A Runnymede and TIDE report from December last year found that there isn\u2019t enough systematic teaching about empire \u2013 despite the fact that the curriculum states young people are supposed to learn about \u2018how Britain has influenced and been influenced by the wider world\u2019. Children in this country are not being taught effectively about the British Empire or Britain\u2019s role in major historical events, and the ramifications of this gap in knowledge can be huge.",
        "background": "A third of people in the UK believe Britain\u2019s colonies were \u2018better off\u2019 for being part of an empire, despite the many atrocities that were committed under British rule.  We need to teach about the realities of the Empire and the lasting effects of colonialism for people of colour in Britain.",
