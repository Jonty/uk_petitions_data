Slowing the spread of covid 19 would also allow life to go back to normal quicker than allowing the spread to continue. Also, less spreading of covid 19 would prevent the NHS from becoming overwhelmed.",
        "background": "Move all schooling online until at least the Easter holidays 2021. Say none essential jobs (such as private house cleaners) should no longer work and instead find an appropriate benefit. Tighten up the lockdown restrictions wherever possible to prevent the spread of covid 19.",
