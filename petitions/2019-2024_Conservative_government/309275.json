PHE advice is putting our health care workers at high risk further limiting their ability to treat others.\r\n\r\nPHE need to change advice back to full PPE for all interactions and provide it in adequate quantities.",
        "background": "At the beginning of the UK Corona virus outbreak, PHE advice was for full PPE for all potential Corona patients. Then this was downgraded to full PPE only for aerosol generating procedures in high risk areas such as ITU. Today\u2019s advice lowers this again to no gowns for high risk areas.",
