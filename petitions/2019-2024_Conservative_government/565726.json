        "additional_details": "Because teachers have worked tirelessly to protect themselves and others from the virus and to educate children about how to protect themselves from the virus. They weren\u2019t allowed to see their families over Christmas but next week they will be allowed to mix with 30 other households? I think it\u2019s time we offered teachers (parents and children!) some respect and reassurance by offering them the vaccination as soon as possible. Let\u2019s give them something back.",
        "background": "I want government to move teachers and teaching staff up the priority list for COVID vaccinations as I believe they are expected to take a big risk in returning to work and mixing with many households.",
