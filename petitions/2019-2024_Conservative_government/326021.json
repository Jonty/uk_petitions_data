        "additional_details": "The UK government has agreed that from 2021 EU citizens will be able to spend 6 continuous months in the UK without requiring a visa. It has agreed that UK citizens travelling to the EU (Schengen Zone) will be limited to half of that.The EU offer of a MINIMUM of 90 days visa-free travel implies a willingness to negotiate but travel is not on the agenda. The Government, despite a global pandemic, is pressing ahead with talks and must address the imbalance in travel mobility before it is too late.",
        "background": "The Government should seek the same terms for UK citizens who travel frequently to the EU, as it is offering EU citizens coming to the UK, namely 180 continuous days visa-free travel in any rolling 360.",
