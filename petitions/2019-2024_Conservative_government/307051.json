Maintenance loans do not cover one semester\u2019s rent, so we have to find jobs to make ends meet. Many of us are on leave from work as companies encourage self-isolation, leaving us in a difficult situation.\r\n\r\nA survey that I conducted from ages 18-60 found that students have an average of \u00a32630.59 left to pay. When asked \u201cIs it fair that students should pay rent if Uni told you to go home?\u201d 90% said \u201cNo\".",
