Many higher earners are facing unemployment or unpaid leave and the potential for mortgage and loan defaults and yet have enough money invested in Pension Plans which they are unable to access due to their age.",

Once this cash has been withdrawn an equivalent amount should be added to the Tax Free allowance for the next 3 Tax Years.",
