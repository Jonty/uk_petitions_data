        "additional_details": "Following the cancellation of the 2020 A-Level and GCSE exams, students were reassured their future was in safe hands;  that a fair algorithm would ensure that they could transition to the next step on their educational or vocational journeys. However 40% of grades are lower than teacher predictions. It is vital that mistakes are rectified for the benefit of this years cohort of students. We are beginning to work toward moving forward from the pandemic, we can\u2019t leave the students behind.",
        "background": "Reassess the system or algorithms that produced the grades this year and make sure that the pandemic won\u2019t leave hundreds-of-thousands of students with lower than expected grades. \u2018Re-marks\u2019 also costly for those who need them, and on top of an already class-biased system, create more unfairness.",
