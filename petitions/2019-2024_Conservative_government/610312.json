The article published by Sky News gives the background but it doesn\u2019t take into account the thousands of Key Workers who also contributed arduous efforts to keep the country going throughout the pandemic. If it wasn\u2019t for the dedication of these unseen and unsung heroes, the country would have ground to a halt within weeks. Show some respect and award them a pay rise of similar proportion too  - NHS Staff, Emergency Services, Civil Servants, Lorry Drivers, etc.",
