        "additional_details": "If shops and public transport remain open during lockdown, the risk of COVID transmission in a gym should be accepted (following hygiene protocols). It should be noted that private gyms in communal building developments should be classified as lower risk than public gyms. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we need to consider the medium to longer term impact that closing gyms has on people reliant on them as a source of exercise and stress release. Do the mental/physical issues outweigh transmission risk?",
