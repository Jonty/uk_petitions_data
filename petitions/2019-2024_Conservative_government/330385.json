        "additional_details": "Many clubs have already been damaged irreparably by the EFL\u2019s bizarre decision making. Tranmere were arbitrarily demoted & suffered multi-million \u00a3 losses. Bury were expelled entirely from the league. Other clubs unfairly benefitted from getting a promotion or extra funding to compete in play offs. Now Wigan are in administration & face a bleak future. This maladministration at the top of the game cannot be allowed to continue or else the the world\u2019s oldest league could be permanently destroyed.",
        "background": "The EFL is out of control: Bury, Bolton, Macclesfield, PPG & now Wigan just to name a few. The current governance of the sport is a fiasco, and it\u2019s only time before other clubs are failed by the EFL. Football needs external help if it is to survive the EFL\u2019s disastrous administration.",
