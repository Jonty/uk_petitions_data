        "action": "Amend the Ban on XL Bullies to Allow Rescues and Shelters to Rehome XL Bullies",
        "additional_details": "No innocent dog should have to die because of their breed. While rescues are currently allowed to keep exempted XL Bullies, they are not allowed to rehome them, and most rescues cannot afford to keep dogs for life.\r\n An amendment should be made to allow the rehoming of XL Bullies by rescues providing that the dogs have been proven to be safe in behavioural tests and providing that all potential adopters are approved by behaviourists, vets and other dog experts.",
        "background": "While safety measures to protect the public and other animals from dog attacks are of utmost importance, we believe that it is unfair that shelters and rescues are now being faced with having to kill XL Bully dogs simply because they now can\u2019t rehome these innocent dogs just because of their breed.",
