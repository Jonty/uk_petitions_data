In both cases the police dismiss the events stating it is only the RSPCA who can prosecute. This is a criminal offence and should NOT be relying  soley on a charity. The police state it is a civil matter, yet the law states its a criminal offence. If the actions of a person directly cause suffering/death to an animal the police AND RSPCA should enforce appropriate penalties as per current legislation",

Yet the police will not get involved and advise it is a civil matter for the RSPCA to investigate. The law should NOT be in the hands of a charity.",

This would cover suffering caused by taking a dog for a walk in excessive heat.\r\n\r\nThe Government's code of practice for the welfare of dogs, which provides owners and keepers with information on how to meet the welfare needs of their animals, and can be used in courts as evidence in cases brought before them relating to poor welfare, specifically highlights the risks of heat stress: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/697953/pb13333-cop-dogs-091204.pdf\r\n\r\nDecisions about investigating alleged animal welfare offences and prosecuting these are a matter for the police and Crown Prosecution Service, not the Government or House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIf you are concerned about how police in your area respond to reports of animal cruelty, you could raise these concerns with your Police and Crime Commissioner, who is responsible for overseeing policing in your area. You can find contact details for your Police and Crime Commissioner here: https://www.apccs.police.uk/find-your-pcc/\r\n\r\n"
