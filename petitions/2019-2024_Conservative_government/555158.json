        "action": "Remove Indoor Tennis from Tier 2 restrictions and allow people to play again",
        "additional_details": "Indoor Tennis should be reinstated immediately as a sport that can be played indoors with people from other households. The distancing on court is at least equal, if not much further than, gym classes.\r\n\r\nMany people rely on tennis for their physical and mental health. As the clocks change in one week, dark evenings will mean outside play may not be an option and thousands of us will see our physical and mental health take a dive. \r\n\r\nAdditionally more coaches and clubs may go into administration.",
        "background": "Tier 2 rules mean that you now cannot play Indoor Tennis with someone not in your household. However you can go to a Spin or Zumba class with 30 people in a room the same size as a tennis court. Tennis is a naturally socially-distanced sport with gaps far wider than between people in a gym class.",
