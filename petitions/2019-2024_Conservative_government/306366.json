        "action": "Close SEN schools, to avoid putting staff and children at risk from Covid-19.",
        "additional_details": "We realize that parents of SEN children need respite but in the case of a global pandemic it is really the wellbeing of BOTH staff and children that should be taken into account. Keeping SEN schools open to provide this respite automatically means that a large number of staff (and other children) are put at grave risk. SEN staff should therefore NOT be forced to go into work against their will under the guise of helping the vulnerable, with the threat of having their contracts terminated.",
        "background": "We want staff who work at SEN schools to be given the same protection as staff of mainstream schools. We demand that they are not made to go to work when all other schools are closed in the UK, NI and the EU having protected their staff and children adequately.",
