        "action": "Stop prepayment electricity and gas charging more, increasing fuel poverty.",
        "additional_details": "If the government does not stop energy providers from charging more for electricity and gas to those whom are already facing a burden this will end up as a catastrophic event at winter. Pre payment meters cost more than direct debit, and those who need a better deal are restricted. Until parliament tries to try live in a 2 bedroom flat, on benefits with pre payment meters over winter to see how many of this country live on the benefits and/or minimum wage, this is just another example.",
        "background": "It seems highly unfair that families or individuals living in rented accommodation and on benefits or tax credits have to chose between paying for gas and electric or food or clothing. The government needs to stop the rich getting richer and stop the poor freezing and starving. George Orwell saw it.",
