However, everyone knows and loves Three Lions. \r\nImagine a packed out stadium with everyone in there singing that song with a smile on their face and passion in their heart.",
        "background": "Whenever it comes to singing the national anthem, God Save The Queen it should be replaced with the Three Lions by David Baddiel, Frank Skinner, and The Lightning Seeds.",
