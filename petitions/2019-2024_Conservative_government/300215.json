        "additional_details": "Families work extremely hard to enable one of the parents to look after their children during their youngest years rather than a stranger but the government seems to want to make this extremely difficult. There is very little public Information to inform you that you lose this when you hit \u00a360k, also that if it is not claimed than the parent staying at home will receive no National Insurance contributions meaning they will receive a reduced if not any state pension when reaching retirement age.",
        "background": "The rules currently in place state that child benefit should be capped at \u00a360k are fundamentally flawed, this cap has not even been increasing with inflation. A single earner of \u00a360k will be on a 40% tax bracket with no child benefit yet parents can earn \u00a350k each at 20% and get full child benefit!",
