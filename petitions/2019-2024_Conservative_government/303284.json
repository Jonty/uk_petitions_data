        "action": "Amend the discriminatory proposal to enforce self-isolation on citizens over 70.",
        "additional_details": "A very large number of citizens in their seventies are fit, healthy and actively working in paid employment or the voluntary sector, including as carers. The Health Secretary's declared intention to force them to stay at home for a period of months is irrational, discriminatory and unenforceable. Those in isolated communities would have difficulty in obtaining basic household supplies. It would cause immense disruption and be hugely expensive.",
        "background": "Government should establish a scheme for voluntary self-isolation by those who consider themselves vulnerable on grounds of age or infirmity, while leaving fit 70-plus year-olds subject to the same rules as others and able to continue playing a part in the community, on their own responsibility.",
