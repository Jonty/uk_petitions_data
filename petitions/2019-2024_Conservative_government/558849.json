Gyms and Swimming Pools provide important solutions to both those issues.\r\nGrouping Health Facilities together with Pubs, Bars and Restaurants is insulting, as it does not take into account the essential nature of what they provide.\r\nIt is unrealistic to expect the public to only exercise outdoors during winter months in the UK.\r\nWith regulations in place to reduce transmission, Gyms and Pools should operate.",
