        "additional_details": "Cannabis is currently perceived as a Class B drug sitting right next to Ketamine, Speed and some amphetamines which I personally think is ludicrous. I feel that cannabis should be legal or the laws at least relaxed so people can consume it personally without fear of being penalised. Many users find that cannabis helps with anxiety, depression and insomnia amongst many other things. Legalising cannabis would free up tons of police time, prevent many drug related crimes and much more",
