I , amongst others , believe that by removing their online outlet ,  it would decrease the amount of pets stolen . Many pets sold through Gumtree , Preloved and other sites , fall into the hands of abusers and dog fighters , and suffer horrendous cruelty at the hands of these abusers . Also to be considered is the emotional trauma caused to the owners of these beloved stolen pets .",
