It\u2019s a complete mistaken error that Boris decided to do and we as a group have decided to take further action by allowing gyms to be open. It will effect everyone\u2019s mood on this and people\u2019s well-being. It\u2019s a way of being stable. So if you was to tell us to stay away from fast food you think people will listen? You creating a second lockdown, you think people want to stay at home feeling stressed. If that\u2019s the case you might as well stop everything that\u2019s going on.",
        "background": "To bear this in mind that gym has nothing to do with this coronavirus. It is a safe place where it allows us to keep our 2 metre distance. Gym is a place where it allows us to be free and get away from stress but right now we we\u2019ll definitely be stressed and there\u2019s nowhere to run to.",
