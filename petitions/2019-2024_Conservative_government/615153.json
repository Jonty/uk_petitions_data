        "additional_details": "It isn't fair for Year 11/13 students to be sitting exams like the world is back to normal because it is not. Not only did they miss 3 months but many missed lots of school time due to quarantining measures. From the 3 months alone they missed a minimum of 33% of school (not including self-isolation) in the beginning of GCSEs or A-levels. Considering this first year of the courses are the most vital (the literal building blocks) it is unfair to give them unhelpful advance info and expect them to cope.",
        "background": "I want the Government to give GCSE and A-level students the option to change one of their subject papers per subject to Teacher Assessed Grades (TAGs). This would mean that e.g. if there were 3 Biology papers students can choose out of the 3, 1 they wish to change for TAGS.",
