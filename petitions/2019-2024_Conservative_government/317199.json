        "additional_details": "Whether a BTEC course involves exams or if a course isn\u2019t exam based, it is unfair for students to be carrying on with assignments and work when they do not have the same levels of support as they would if they were still in school/college. Without the same amount of support from teachers, BTEC students will achieve lower results than their predicted grades, meaning they could be missing out on a chance to be able to attend university, causing them to feel like they haven\u2019t worked hard enough.",
        "background": "With the Covid-19 pandemic causing disruption to many different levels of people\u2019s education, GCSEs, A-Levels and other forms of exams have been cancelled and all candidates are to be given a result based on their predicted grades. So why isn\u2019t the same happening for BTEC students?",
