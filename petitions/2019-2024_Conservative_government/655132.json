        "additional_details": "The dogs themselves are not the problem. A whole dog breed cannot be abolished for a few. They are a kind breed and it is cruel to their owners and them to kill XL bullies. It is not too late to revoke the banning. Please do something, owners are in deep upset and even those who do not own bullies are unsettled by this decision, the number of petitions shows this. It is not what society is used to and has caused genuine upset.",
        "background": "Stop the banning of the xl bully dog breed. Do not kill them, it is unfair and inhumane. Alternative solutions can be found and animal abuse should be investigated and punished more harshly.",
