        "action": "Allocate additional funding for transgender services within the NHS",
        "additional_details": "The waiting times for an initial appointment to start the process of transitioning are currently extremely long, with people waiting around 8 years just for an initial appointment to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. This is very detrimental to the mental health of transgender people, with over 40% having attempted suicide. 82% of transgender people have considered suicide. It is distressing for people to live as the wrong gender so it is crucial that waiting times for services are reduced.",
        "background": "Provide more funding for transgender services e.g for appointments with specialists who can provide an initial diagnosis of gender dysphoria, hormone therapy, and gender reassignment surgery so that waiting times for these services are reduced.",
