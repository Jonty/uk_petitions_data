People could lose their jobs, and be unable to service their debts or pay their rents, or even buy food.\r\n\r\nMany of their employers could also be unable to service their debts. Corporations are now more indebted than they have ever been.\r\n\r\nCash flows will dry up + debt levels crushing + staff laid off.",

This can be financed as Quantitative Easing was financed, without recourse to the Treasury, or taxation.",
