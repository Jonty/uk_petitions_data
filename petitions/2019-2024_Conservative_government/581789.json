        "additional_details": "Non-binary people cannot currently change their legal gender identity to non-binary as there isn\u2019t an option for that. This can be very harmful, as this invalidates them, makes them feel uncared for and writing \u2018female\u2019 or \u2018male\u2019 down simply doesn\u2019t feel right, because that is not there gender. We are in a society where gender shouldn\u2019t be ignored, if someone identifies as something other than \u2018cisgender male\u2019 or \u2018cisgender female\u2019 they should feel accepted.",
        "background": "Non-binary people are not included in the Gender Recognition act, this is very demeaning to people who identify as that gender. We are in a time now, when being non-binary is completely valid, so I think it\u2019s time to be recognised under UK law.",
