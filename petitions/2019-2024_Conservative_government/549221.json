        "additional_details": "It used to be every child's football dream to be a part of the FA Cup final. We all would wake up early, programs on the television would start at 9am, we would watch the buses arrive from 11am and gear ourselves for the 3pm showpiece. This is more than a generational thing. You can be the oldest person on the planet or a youngster. It is an important part of footballing tradition to have this game kick off at 3pm",
        "background": "I don't think there is a football fan in this country that likes, enjoys or understands why the game is on so late. It has lost so much tradition and the best way to bring this back is to return the kick off time to 3pm on the last Saturday.",
