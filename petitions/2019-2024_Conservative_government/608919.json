        "additional_details": "The Code of Practice 2015, stipulates that Quality First Teaching should be and is the most impactful support for learners with SEND. However, the training provided to equip teachers with this is woefully poor across the board. Teachers are then expected to be absolute experts in the classroom, deal with every need, and judged and observed on what the government have failed to equip them with, yet demand they do it. SEND training needs to be in every single strand taught on training.",
        "background": "We are currently experiencing the highest number of children with SEND. The lack of consistency across local authorities and the approach to how SEND is funded and delivered, leaves for a very inconsistent education. Yet, we still see teachers not trained fully to meet needs.",
