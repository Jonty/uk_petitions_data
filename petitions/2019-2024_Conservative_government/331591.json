        "additional_details": "Face coverings on public transport and in shops should be voluntary and up to the individual in question. It is an intrusion on peoples personal freedom and morally wrong in a free country. Not only does this cause great anxiety and distress to a lot of people, it will have long term lasting social effects on society as a whole.  Aside from this, given that the amount of people in England with Covid 19 is now 0.03% and deaths have greatly decreased in the last month it is largely pointless",
