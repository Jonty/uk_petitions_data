        "additional_details": "This year has been hard on the community and especially university students as there's accommodation fees lost, in some cases accommodation terminations. This study year will involve no face to face lectures which is taking away the university experience that is promised and therefore students will be lacking resources provided by university. Students with learning difficultly and poor family life will struggle immensely, 3rd year students are not getting the full support for their dissertations",
