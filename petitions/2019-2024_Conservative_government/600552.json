        "additional_details": "Mortality figures for pancreatic cancer haven\u2019t improved in 50 years. 75% diagnosed with the disease die inside a year and just 6% make it to 5 years. It is the deadliest of the 21 most common cancers. Early detection of Pancreatic Cancer means life-waving surgery is possible. But there are no bio-markers or tests for GPs. Scientists know that 1% of people newly-diagnosed with diabetes has pancreatic cancer. That\u2019s about 4,000 UK people each year whose lives could be saved. We need a Taskforce.",
        "background": "Many campaigners want the government to fast-track the screening of newly diagnosed diabetes patients for pancreatic cancer. There are two stand-out tests available, one in trial phase in the UK, and one licensed this year in the USA. We want the government to make these available to GPs.",
