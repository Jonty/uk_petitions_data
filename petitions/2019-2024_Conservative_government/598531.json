Despite this, the Government has yet to pass overdue legislation that was initially conceptualized in 2016.\r\n \r\nA consultation was held on a draft Bill in 2018, and draft legislation was considered by a Joint Committee in Spring 2019, but legislation has still not been introduced. A timeline for doing so must be set now.",
