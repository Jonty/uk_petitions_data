        "additional_details": "The government should enforce that university students are compensated for their loss of education which detriments their employability. Even with online lectures, there are many fields of study which require practical study, these include: Performing arts, science, sports, doctors and physio therapy as examples. With many universities now closing for the academic year, students have lost valuable practical learning time which was promised as a critical element within their chosen degree.",
        "background": "Students can not successfully practice, perform, study, nor draw data through experiment led research to complete their degree training and therefore, are not receiving the quality to education or teaching the student pays for. The government should make the universities reimburse their students.",
