        "action": "Reduce land ownership and transactions registration transition period to 28 days",
        "additional_details": "I want the Government to take this action because an 18 month transitional period gives too much time for overseas entities to move potentially 'dirty money'. By reducing the time to 28 days it makes it much harder to move. It is time our Government acts and stops dragging their heels. We the people see other countries taking action and putting in sanctions instantly whilst our Government once again appeared scared to take action.",
        "background": "The Government plan to amend land law to require overseas entities to register to buy or sell (or mortgage) land in the UK. However, the Government plans a transitional period of 18 months for overseas entities to register or sell existing property. This should be reduced to 28 days.",
