        "action": "Ban wrapping paper that cannot be recycled",
        "additional_details": "In the UK, at Christmas time alone, we throw away 227,000 miles of wrapping paper each year-enough to wrap the Earth 8 times!\r\nFor a product that has paper in its name, it's ironic that it can't be recycled with conventional paper.\r\nMany kinds of wrapping paper are laminated with plastic or contain foil or glitter. None which is recyclable.\r\nThis has led to some councils banning all wrapping paper from their collection services. This is causing consumer confusion and leading to more waste.",
        "background": "The Government should create new requirements that all wrapping paper be made of 100% paper (with a minimum percentage of recycled content) and be widely recycled at councils' recycling collections. The aim of this is to tackle consumer waste, reduce landfill use and the resultant carbon emissions.",
