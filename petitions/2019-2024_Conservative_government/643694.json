        "action": "Introduce a \u00a349-a-month ticket for all regional public transport",
        "additional_details": "The Deutschlandticket has been a great success in Germany, raising passenger numbers on regional services by 25% since its May 2023 introduction, (http://bit.ly/euronews-dticket) and France will launch its own version next year (http://bit.ly/euronews-france-ticket). This model has been proven to work, and there is no reason its success could not be replicated in the UK.",
        "background": "We believe the introduction of a \u00a349-a-month ticket for all non-long-distance public transport, like the German Deutschlandticket, is the best way to meet the government goal of net zero by 2050. Public transport is prohibitively expensive in the UK, and this ticket would greatly widen access to it.",
