        "additional_details": "For many people without complex conditions, who are over the age of 18 and need to wear glasses, they are not available for free despite being necessary to see. They can cost as much as \u00a370 for basic glasses, and this is made even worse by the fact the eye test itself is also paid for.\r\n\r\nIt's simply not right nor fair for people who need to wear glasses to have to fork out their own money to be able to see. The eye test and prescription glasses should be free once every 2 years for those who need them.",
        "background": "Many people across Britain require the wearing of glasses to correct eyesight. They may not have any complex conditions, but without some form of optical aid, they are unable to see clearly. It is also recommended to visit an optician every 2 years if this is the case.",
