        "additional_details": "I remember our soldiers going to numerous armed conflicts in the 1990s without gaining a great deal of public attention. In the 2000s wars in Afghanistan & Iraq in particular rightfully garnered public attention. The Forces gained huge admiration, high profile events & respect at all times. Similarly our police for running towards danger & other public servants for the work they do. Nurses & carers have left their families at home to work long hours in the pandemic knowing they catch the virus.",

I want the profession to gain public stature and recognition for the selfless work that they do. From awards to media to government, we must show our pride in them all of the time, not just during a pandemic.",
