Low income families are at a disadvantage as the price of holidays in peak times makes these experiences unavailable to them. (Uk or abroad holidays are affected by price rises)",
        "background": "England should stop unfair school fines and allow a 5 day grace period.\r\nParents should be allowed to choose when to take a holiday with their child rather than being penalised. Family time and mental health is just as important as school attendance.",
