        "additional_details": "In this time of need, people should be puling together hellping one another, not grabbing what they can to make a quick profit. The eBay site is riddled with people doing just that and it is time it stopped. Babies need this formula, they have no choice and selling to highest bidder makes me sick. Profiteering during times of struggle is disgraceful and the is should be stopped immediately.",
        "background": "I want our government to stop the exploitation of its citizens via eBay. Baby milk is not a luxury and should not be sold to the highest bidder, I believe this practice should be stopped with immediate affect. Supply and demand is one thing, but this is sheer exploitation.",
