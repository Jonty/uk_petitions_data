        "additional_details": "The Rwanda migrant scheme goes against who we are as a country that stands up for those less fortunate than us and for the values of compassion, fairness, and humanity. The government should be focusing on creating a functioning asylum system that allows people who seek safety in the UK a fair hearing on our soil and provides safe routes so they don\u2019t have to take dangerous journeys.",
        "background": "On November 15, 2023, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld an appeal court ruling that found there was a real risk of deported refugees having their claims in Rwanda wrongly assessed or being returned to their country of origin to face persecution.",
