If you or your children, your spouse or your parents, had cancer, wouldn\u2019t you want increased funding for research to help them? If you or are a loved one were to get cancer after your time in power, and they died and you could\u2019ve saved them, wouldn\u2019t you wish you had done it?\r\n We demand an increase in funds for existing animal-free cancer research AND an increase in funds for further research into more animal-free alternatives!",
        "background": "Cancer Research UK still believe we CAN cure cancer. However, animals are no less important than us, and we need to put money into both finding more, new alternatives to the use of animals in research and existing animal-free cancer research itself.",
