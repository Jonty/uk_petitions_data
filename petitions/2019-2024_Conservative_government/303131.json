        "additional_details": "Now is not the time for party politics. Matt Hancock on Sunday 15 March confirmed on TV what Robert Peston of ITV foreshadowed yesterday - the government are considering wartime type measures to fight coronavirus. Including isolating the over 70s for up to 4mths.  He said this will affect every one of us. A government of national unity would unite our politicians for a common goal, yes coalition governments can seem indecisive, but we need to put differences aside to survive.",
        "background": "We are entering an unprecedented time of strain on national and local resources at a time when our divisions have been exposed and deepened in the last decade. The Government and our politicians need to show leadership and unprecedented co-operation to encourage us all to act for the community.",
