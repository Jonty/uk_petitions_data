        "additional_details": "This should be considered because the current year 10\u2019s education has been overlooked and schools are only bothered about the current year 11\u2019s getting their education. However year 10 have missed 6 whole months of learning last year and many more months this year, does the government really think we are learning as much during home learning and are going to gain more during our last year? The rush of packing in all of the missed education next year is causing stress and anxiety upon students.",
        "background": "The government should cancel the current year 10\u2019s GCSE\u2019s next year due to all of the missed education and opportunities caused by covid.",
