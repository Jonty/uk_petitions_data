        "additional_details": "Families who are already living on the bread line are being driven further into poverty because of this policy. Claimants often have to turn to these organisation for day to day help, while they deduct substantial amount of money from their benefit. This cycle not only drives people further into poverty it is also pushing people further into debt as borrowing increases from energy companies and people rely further on the welfare state for support just to survive from week to week.",
        "background": "This policy is allowing companies and local authorities to drive low income families and single claimants further into poverty. The current system allows these organisations and corporations to deduct substantial amounts of money from claimants. The DWP allow up to 3 deductions from third parties",
