Yet we are trying to provide care for those frontline staff, doctors, nurses, retail staff who need us, we too are putting ourselves on the frontline, we cannot stay at home.  However, we will be forced to close if I cannot recoup additional money to cover my staff wages, but where will these children go? Please recognise the wonderful work early years are doing!",

Although allowed to keep funding this does not cover staff wages & bills. We rely on fee paying parents to cover these costs. Please give us flexibility to access the government retention scheme.",
