        "action": "More funding of food for Children in Poverty",
        "additional_details": "Post 2008 there was austerity which led to a lack of funding for certain welfare and community projects. Post Covid we have seen UNICEF begin food handouts in London, as well as 52% of children in Newham below the poverty line.\r\n\r\nIf we can afford the furlough scheme and the other covid spending policies then we can implement a scheme for more food for those in poverty. At a fraction of the cost and something with a clear return on investment.",
        "background": "We would like funding for food and deliveries for such food in certain communities. Funding should be in the \u00a3100,000's per annum for each local authortiy as well as volunteers for the distribution. Hunger should be eliminated in the UK as well as the strain on Food Banks.",
