        "additional_details": "we want the government to rethink its stance on tackling obesity, to consult with eating disorder specialists and funding more into the NHS for eating disorders, in additon to lowering the price of \"healthy\" foods in supermarkets and not pricing those in poverty (who rely on cheaper, \"unhealthy\" foods). the government cannot logically demonise 'obese' people and also promote dining out Monday-Wednesday to the public in order to help the economy",
        "background": "showing calories on a menu will not help with obesity, but rather will hinder those already suffering from anorexia, orthorexia, bulimia and binge-eating disorder. obesity has been linked to trauma disorders and has a direct link to people in poverty",
