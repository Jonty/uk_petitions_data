        "action": "Immediately grant British citizenship to all residents of Hong Kong.",
        "additional_details": "Actions taken this week by the Chinese Regime are in direct breach of international law, fundamental human rights and the Sino-British Declaration. These acts demonstrate a fundamental disregard for democracy and for international treaties made with Britain. \r\n\r\nThe People of Hong Kong should be extended British Citizenship immediately to protect their rights as guaranteed under the Sino-British Declaration. We ask the Government to go further and impose a trade embargo on Hong Kong itself with the aim of forcing the Chinese Government to respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong.",
        "background": "Parliament should immediately legislate to extend British citizenship and legal protections to all residents of Hong Kong and impose sanctions to ban all commerce between Britain, her allies and Hong Kong until such time as the Chinese Government revokes recent dictates imposed on Hong Kong.",
