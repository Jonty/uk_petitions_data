        "additional_details": "Vapes are included in UK tobacco legislation, yet do not have to adhere to tobacco marketing rules and regulations. This has enabled products to be marketed at children, with enticing flavours and packaging, which are advertised and displayed within children's reach. Vapes are not included in tobacco track and trace, enabling products containing illegal levels of nicotine to enter the market. No other \"medicine\" or smoking cessation aid is marketed at children. It is unnecessary and dangerous.",
        "background": "Vapes are jeopardising children's health. They should not be medicines or endorsed by the NHS. Unlike nicotine patches and gum, vapes entice children, creating new addicts. Vapes should be flavourless, have plain packaging, be hidden behind counters/shutters, and included in tobacco track and trace.",
