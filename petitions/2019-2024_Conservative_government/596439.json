Equality!!\r\nI would also like the government to prevent the no overnight sleeping in such facilities without implementing fines as we are encouraged to rest if we are tired from driving, but invariably fined ourselves financially penalised by local authorities for doing so. Perhaps a stay for 24hr and no return law within 48hrs",
