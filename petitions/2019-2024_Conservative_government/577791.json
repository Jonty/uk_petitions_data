        "additional_details": "We are in the midst of a pandemic and in national lockdown. The May 2021 elections are fast approaching, but many people, especially those shielding, do not feel safe to go to a polling station this year.\r\n\r\nIf you want to apply for a postal vote, you need to print off a form, fill it out and post it. We are in the 21st century! What if we don\u2019t currently have access to a printer or stamps? Why can\u2019t we save paper and apply electronically? Please introduce an online system for those able to use it",
        "background": "We are asking the Government to introduce an online application process to apply for a postal vote for the May 2021 elections, that does not require you to print off a form to fill in and post to your local authority. Make it easier for us to apply for a postal vote so we can vote safely this year.",
