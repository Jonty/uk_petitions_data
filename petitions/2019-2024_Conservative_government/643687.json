        "action": "Abolish BSL and prosecute irresponsible dog owners instead",
        "additional_details": "Until irresponsible owners are addressed and dealt with nothing will change. I want neutering and spaying of dogs to be mandatory to prevent over breeding of dogs and certain breeds which will also tackle the problem of breed trends and also prevent another breed being replaced and the cycle to continue. I honestly believe that it is about time people were blamed instead of certain breeds of dogs, dog breeds have been banned before and all it has achieved is another breed becoming a trend and the problem arises again. BSL needs to be abolished and new ways of tackling the problem implemented in its place.",
        "background": "I want BSL to be abolished and instead of banning specific breeds I want irresponsible owners to be accountable and given higher fines and longer prison sentences and banned from keeping dogs.",
