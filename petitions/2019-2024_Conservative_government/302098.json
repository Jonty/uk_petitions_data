        "additional_details": "The levels of child hunger and deprivation in the UK are among the highest and many children rely on school meals for their nutrition and health. Many parents and guardians are already struggling financially, and the school and nursery closures will increase the burden substantially. \r\n\r\nIncreasing child benefit temporarily is the easiest, cost-effective, most straightforward pragmatic solution as the system is already in place to help all affected.\r\n\r\nThis will also help the local economy.",
        "background": "The government should double child benefit for all children so they do not suffer any child hunger or deprivation if the schools and nurseries are to close because of coronavirus Covid 19.",
