        "additional_details": "Lockdowns and authoritarian restrictions have decimated the UK economy and the personal lives of millions of people in this country. Now that the vast majority are fully vaccinated, there is no correlation between infections rates and hospitalisations & deaths. The people should be allowed to make their own choices as to how to protect themselves from COVID-19. Fining those who wish to live a normal life should be stopped immediately. The Coronavirus Act 2020 should be repealed immediately.",
        "background": "The government has controlled the people for far too long. We have tried and tested the theory of using lockdowns, facemasks and business closures 3 times and we know it does not work. The government should let people to choose how to protect themselves and not criminalise those who don't wish to.",
