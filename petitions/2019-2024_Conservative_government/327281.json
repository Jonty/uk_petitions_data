        "action": "Don't scrap laws allowing trans people to change gender via self-identification",
        "additional_details": "The new legislation was proposed after a nation wide survey in 2018, where 70% of people said they were in favour of trans people's rights to legally change their gender more easily. \r\n\r\nThe current requirements to change gender are too long, invasive and inaccessible. This contributes to misconceptions that lead to discrimination and abuse towards trans people, more than any other group. \r\n\r\nThe Government's U-Turn on this legislation is opposed by human rights charity Amnesty International.",
        "background": "This petition is to stop the Government from scrapping potential legislation allowing trans people to change the gender on their birth certificate, without needing a medical diagnosis. If passed, this would be huge progress for trans rights in the UK and should not be stopped.",
