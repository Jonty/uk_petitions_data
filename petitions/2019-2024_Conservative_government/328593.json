        "additional_details": "If this is unacceptable for them, then at least request they charge a reduced amount. Thousands of pensioners have only their TV's for company. It's a very sad state of affairs indeed that the BBC find it necessary to take so much money from the very people who often fight to make ends meet. Please will they have some compassion, they will be old themselves one day.",
        "background": "We would like Parliament to please inform the BBC that elderly people with only a Government pension for income and little or no savings cannot afford to pay the extortionate TV licence fee.",
