        "additional_details": "I believe Parliament should close or limit construction work across the UK.\r\nWith schools, retail, personal care, all shutting. And offices now working from home aswell as No household mixing no sports I think its time the government look at shutting construction aswell or atleast restricting sites to only workers from that area as the risk of covid is just as high there as it is anywhere else so why should we be expected to go to work and risk ourselves and family's. This needs to be looked at",
        "background": "The government should look at either shutting down construction while lockdown is in place for the country.\r\nOr limit construction to the area you live in so no area mixing. The construction industry has people from different areas mixing on different sites then going home and spreading the disease.",
