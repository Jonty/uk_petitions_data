        "additional_details": "Ive contacted the NHS with no joy to get these survivors the treatment they rightfully deserve funded. I have many ladies come to my clinic that I fund myself with faded, un even, unrealistic areola tattoos. I\u2019m so busy helping these ladies which I won\u2019t stop doing however it is effecting my income as it seems it\u2019s becoming much more frequent for ladies to visit our clinics as apposed to nurses due to the results being so unprofessional. If we are funded by the NHS this will not be a problem.",
        "background": "To discuss the fact that nurses are tattooing with semi permanent pigments that simply do not last Therefor the patient is having to relive the final steps of a traumatic journey time after time.",
