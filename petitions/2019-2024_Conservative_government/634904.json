So myself and millions of other people in this very same position will have had no benefit from this whatsoever. This should be rolled out much much sooner so people in said position can feel the immediate benefit NOW during this horrific cost of living crisis. We need the help NOW!",
        "background": "Earlier implementation of the new childcare funding for children aged 9 months onwards. April 2024 is too far away for those struggling right now with childcare costs and people need the help right NOW! This is shameful and very upsetting news for those who will feel absolutely no benefit of this.",
