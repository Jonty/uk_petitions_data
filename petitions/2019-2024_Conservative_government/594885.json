I\u2019ve never visited Afghanistan nor do I know anyone who lives there, my only connection is that I am British and our identities as British citizens mean we are inseparably linked with the unravelling of Afghanistan today. Loss of government control to the Taliban, loss of rights for women and children, is as a direct result of our abrupt retreat, our interventions, our choices.",
        "background": "Are we Global Britain? We must take action against the Taliban in Afghanistan. There is spiraling loss of life and devastating loss of freedom. Parliament should be recalled, we should support an emergency session of the UN security council, we should use our military capability to protect Afghans.",
