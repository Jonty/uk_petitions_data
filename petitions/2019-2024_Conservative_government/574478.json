During the Covid crisis this has meant that many treatments designated as \u2018non-urgent\u2019 have been postponed. Proposals to give temporary additional support to staff during the Covid pandemic is just tinkering around the edges and is not sufficient. The NHS requires funds to enable it to recruit and train the optimum number of staff, working reasonable fulltime hours, in order to provide the health support that people need. *Any argument that additional funds are currently in place during the Covid crisis would be a fallacy because these additional funds would still have had to be allocated if the UK had not left the EU",

You can find out more here: https://services.parliament.uk/Bills/2019-21/nhsfunding.html. We're therefore not exactly sure what further action you'd like the Government or Parliament to take. \r\n\t\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking for the Government to increase NHS funding by an additional 33.9 billion, if that's something that you'd like to see. \r\n\r\nYou may wish to sign this petition instead: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/564512"
