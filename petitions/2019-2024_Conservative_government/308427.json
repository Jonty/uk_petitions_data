        "additional_details": "Education establishments were primarily established to educate and provide knowledge. They have now become commercial enterprises where teaching and education have taken a back step and financial gain has become the prerogative of universities. The government has a moral duty to protect students from being treated as commodities and provide financial support and stability. By paying for only what teaching and facilities a student receives would make university education a much fairer system.",

As teaching has been cancelled for the rest of the year I would like the government to enforce fees refunds, paid or to be paid for the third term/instalment for all students.",
