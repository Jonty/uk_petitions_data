        "additional_details": "The general population has a way to hurl abuse at others from behind a protective screen created by social media platforms. This can lead to further abuse, mental health problems and even suicide. To call it trolling is to minimise it. What they deliver on these platforms is hate speech and by verifying who they are they can be deterred from posting for face consequences if they do.",
        "background": "The online abuse of other people has gone too far. Social media platforms give users an anonymity that allows them to post hate speech and hide from the consequences and repercussions. Verifying their identity allows them to feel the full force of the law if needed.",
