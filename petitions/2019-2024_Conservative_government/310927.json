        "additional_details": "The UK encountered the coronavirus pandemic with a deficit in its establishment of healthcare workers. Many workers are willing to work (even volunteer) extended hours. However, they are hindered by the impact of paying increased income tax. The government can remove this counterproductive obstacle to the Government strategy for effectively supporting the NHS. \r\n\r\nTemporary suspension of Income Tax will demonstrate meaningful and measurable action that has immediate and long-term benefit for the industry. This will encourage more individuals to work in the healthcare sector, future proofing problems caused by under resourcing in the industry. The Conservative Government can evidence its \u201congoing commitment to care\u201d.",
        "background": "The Government has powers to ensure all taxpayers are treated fairly. Covid-19 is set to impose unprecedented pressures on NHS/care workers, resulting in requirement for extra hours. \r\n\r\nEarnings from work/support to combat the proliferation of coronavirus, ought not to be taxed.",
