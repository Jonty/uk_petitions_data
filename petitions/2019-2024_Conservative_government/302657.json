Now that only those that are severely ill are being tested the line on the chart will falsely level out as it shows a small percentage of those that are infected. Giving people a false sense of security which could and more than likely will end fatally for a big portion of the public. People NEED to know the truth of where the virus is and how many are infected in each area. If you want people to trust the government you need to be straight with them.",

People could take unnecessary risks and the fatalities will rise more than predicted.",
