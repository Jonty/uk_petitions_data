Wearing uncomfortable masks along with the uncomfortable uniform, can result in students feeling ill, or too hot and then that can lead to fainting and students having to go home. If we wear our own clothes, we can dress appropriately for the weather meaning nobody is too hot / cold. Wearing both at the same time it also going to limit focus as if a student is uncomfortable they are not going to be able to learn at their full potential.",
