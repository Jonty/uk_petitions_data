        "additional_details": "The Honours System is broken and not fit for purpose. It has been abused for so long that it has degenerated into a murky, backroom trading currency that politicians use to square off unidentifiable favours, or for unalloyed, sycophantic allegiance. Honours should be a source of pride, even aspiration. They should represent a \"loyalty rewards programme\" built on integrity and honesty. Instead, the system has been devalued to the extent that it is an embarrassment. Stop the abuse.",
        "background": "I want the Government to completely cleanse and overhaul the Honours system. Awards should ONLY be granted on merit to people for exemplary service. Honours should NOT be used as payback for political favours, gifted to old pals, or dished out to staff for simply doing the job they were PAID to do.",
