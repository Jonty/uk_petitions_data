        "additional_details": "The quickly escalating situation is a clear reminder of the need to uphold the right to asylum. The UK government must be prepared to protect Ukrainian refugees and to ensure their safety. The truth is that for most Ukrainians there are no official legal routes by which to seek asylum in the UK. With the scale of exodus now clear it is imperative that the UK acts to mitigate the potentially devastating consequences of war and to protect civilians.",
        "background": "As the crisis in Ukraine unfolds, we believe that the UK government must step up to protect Ukrainian refugees by creating officially safe and viable routes to travel to the UK. We urge the immediate lifting of visa restrictions for arrivals from the conflict to allow Ukrainians to travel legally.",
