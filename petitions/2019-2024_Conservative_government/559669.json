        "action": "Give every disadvantaged pupil a laptop to access online lessons at home.",
        "additional_details": "Online lessons at home need to be accessed by those students who are isolating. Providing a laptop to those who are living in Digital Poverty will enable them to keep up with the classmates and not fall behind. As the education system tries to jump start, more and more students will inevitably have to self-isolate and therefore require laptops and an internet connection at home. Ensuring every child has a consistent education is the Government's responsibility - this issue needs to be addressed.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to provide a simple laptop to every student who comes from a financially poor background. These students normally claim free school meals and are the most vulnerable in our society. This laptop can then be used by the pupils to access online lessons at home if need be.",
