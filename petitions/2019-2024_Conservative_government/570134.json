If keyworkers become carriers and infect the members of their family, the family members are not covered by any workplace insurance or form of insurance.\r\n \r\nThe Government has established a Life Assurance Scheme for health and social care workers, and should make similar provision for their families.",

These workers risk their lives and their families to rid the UK of Coronavirus, and the Government should create a Life Assurance Scheme for family members of health and social care workers.",
