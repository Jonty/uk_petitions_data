        "additional_details": "Services, skills training, benefits, job applications, counselling and support services are all moving online. Not being able to afford a broadband connection will create a section of society that is completely isolated and then unable to break back in to regular society. \r\nA means tested allowance must be provided to low income households so that their ability to access critical digital services is supported and their chances to obtain employment, support or training is not extinguished.",
        "background": "More and more services being pushed online, yet a report today suggests that some households can't afford what has become a human right. Once the Covid pandemic is over, we want the Government to maintain the \u00a320 benefit uplift as a broadband subsidy for those who can't afford any service at all.",
