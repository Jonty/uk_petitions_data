        "additional_details": "Our children have missed out on so much during this pandemic, continuing to miss school will exacerbate the detrimental effect on children's mental, physical and social development. \r\n\r\nHundreds of thousands of students a week are self-isolating as a result of a potential or close contact, missing out on school, sports clubs, part time work and much more. \r\n\r\nIt is acceptable for someone to return from overseas with a negative test however this testing principle isn't enough to return to classrooms.",
        "background": "We want the Government to commit to keeping schools open and students in school in the new academic year. Vaccines have proven to be effective and the majority of adults are now vaccinated. Our children deserve a different approach to testing and quarantining students that puts their needs first.",
