        "action": "A public inquiry into the vetting and recruitment of police officers",
        "additional_details": "Recent tragic events have left women with a lack of trust in serving police officers.  This builds on other well established institutional discrimination by the police. Only by ensuring that there is a full review of vetting, screening and recruitment of police officers will public trust be restored.  Historic poor practice needs to be corrected.  Police authorities have shown themselves incapable of responding to these issues of trust and there is a need for independent review and challenge.",
        "background": "Establish an independent public inquiry into the vetting and recruitment of police officers given the recent offences committed by serving police officers against women.  The inquiry should look at whether adequate vetting and screening checks take place at recruitment and during employment.",
