        "additional_details": "For people with brown skin especially darker brown, the way an infection can present on their skin is different from those with white skin. Currently, the guidance does not recognise this difference. \r\nFor example Thrombosis UK state that thrombosis is a major cause of death in the UK, however, their guidance follows the UK gov guidance of recognising signs and symptoms. Healthcare professionals being appropriately trained to recognise these differences could save lives and be cost-saving to the NHS.",
        "background": "Current guidance says to assess for infection look for symptoms and signs of pain or tenderness, localised swelling, redness and heat. We propose the wording changes around the colour due to this presenting differently in people with brown skin. For example redness/ browning or purpling.",
