If they are then successful in their benefit claim through appeal or MR, meaning they were entitled to the relevant benefit throughout, they receive their benefits, but often these monies have to then be spent on paying off additional expenses incurred as a result of not being in receipt of benefits, rather than on the things it was intended for.",
