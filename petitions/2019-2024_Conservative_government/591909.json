        "additional_details": "So much of modern-day racism is carried out via online platforms using methods such as social media and online messaging. These offenders can be tracked down easily by their IP address and should be punished for their actions. Using CCTV and other digital materials, there should also be more of a drive behind tracking down individuals who have committed physical and verbal acts of racism. Introducing an Official Racial Offender Registry would actively deter people from committing racist acts.",
        "background": "Similar to how the Sex Offender Registry works, the UK Government and Parliament should create an Official Racial Offender Registry which records any racist behaviour from an individual, so that this information can be disclosed to potential employers and other relevant organisations.",
