        "additional_details": "When people own animals they have a responsibility to act in that animals best interests. Some people do not care about the animals in their care enough to do this. This license would help animals be more likely to go to owners who do care and keep animals away from the people who do not have the licence/ have the license revoked.",
        "background": "There are certain people who should not own animals for example people who fight or abuse their dogs. A legally required license would make it that much harder for people to do this. I believe this is also the best course of action for the XL bully situation as it is bad owners at fault not the dogs",
