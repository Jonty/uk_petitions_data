        "additional_details": "We are now nearly a year on from the outbreak of COVID-19 and still continuing to keep our boarders open with potential cases and new strains coming into the country. Take what happened in September for example when 2 people travelled from South Africa to the UK with a new strain of COVID which has now travelled around the UK.\r\nThe UK is now in a nation wide lockdown, we must close the boarders until we have our own country under control. Please don't allow us to get more cases.",
        "background": "We call on the Government to close the borders of the United Kingdom for all but essential travel excluding imports of supplies and medical equipment.\r\nThe UK are repeating the same mistakes we've seen the UK Government make throughout this crisis & now we have a new strain of COVID-19 as a result.",
