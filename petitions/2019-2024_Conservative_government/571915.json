There are I.T and infrastructure problems, lack of customs agents, delays with the issuing of CCGs, severe lack of companies offering T1 customs services and a huge fall in the number of EU drivers coming to the UK causing prices to increase sharply. The EU customers we send our goods to are already loosing faith in their UK suppliers' ability to deliver goods to them in a timely and cost-effective manner.",
