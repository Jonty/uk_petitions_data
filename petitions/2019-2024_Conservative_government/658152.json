        "action": "End the barbaric practice of ritual slaughter of animals for food in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "UK law prioritises animal welfare in its meat procurement activities and requires pre-stunning before slaughter.  Religious exemptions allow non-stunning. This prioritizes religious practices over animal welfare and unnecessary suffering, which is unacceptable and in contradiction of scientific evidence. The UK wouldn't allow unnecessary suffering elsewhere in the food chain and humane treatment should be consistent across the entire process.",
        "background": "Follow in the footsteps of Iceland, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Belgium, Austria and Hungary in ensuring that animals are slaughtered for meat in the most respectful and humane way possible.",
