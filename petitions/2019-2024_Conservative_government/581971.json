        "additional_details": "Across every town and city in the UK, there are insufficient levels of policing, making some groups of society vulnerable to sexual assault, violent attacks, hate crimes etc. At a time where people are not allowed to travel in groups, this is more harrowing. An increase in levels of policing is wholly necessary, as evidenced by the rise in hate crimes and sexual attacks.",
        "background": "Please increase the numbers of police on patrol - it is crucial for the vulnerable people in society. Do this by using some of the funding which is currently being over-allocated to disband groups of people breaching covid regulations.",
