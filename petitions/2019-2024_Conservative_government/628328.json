        "action": "Extend remit of Ofgem to regulate the sale of all energy products in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "The Government must do more to protect consumers from unscrupulous profiteering or even the perception of profiteering. The sale of refined products (e.g. petrol, diesel) is currently unregulated and needs oversight. Furthermore, Ofgem pricing caps make no account of price volatility and do not mandate suppliers to pass on cost savings when prices fall back. Ofgem therefore needs a wider remit, better powers and more sophisticated control mechanisms to protect all energy consumers.",
        "background": "Revise the role and scope of Ofgem to regulate the sale of all energy products in the UK. This must include all hydrocarbons (raw & refined) as well as all renewables. Ofgem must also adopt an agile pricing cap model that has a fixed cap and also falls back in line with market prices.",
