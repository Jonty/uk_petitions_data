If someone has to quarantine because they have travelled knowingly, then they have to accept the consequences, but the Red List has been imposed at short notice on several occasions, making it very difficult to return home in time, particularly on the last occasion. In addition there is evidence that people in quarantine have actually tested positive from contact with \"guards\" in the quarantine hotel.",
