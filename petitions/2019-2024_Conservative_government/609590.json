        "additional_details": "The unprovoked attack on Ukraine by the Russian Federation is the largest invasion in Europe since the WW2, during which we allowed refugees from Nazi occupied countries into the UK, we must stand by our traditions, our democratic values and do the right thing, in taking in fellow Europeans in their time of need. A democratic country has been invaded by an authoritarian regime, whilst the government is doing work in forms of sanctions, we must provide support for those most vulnerable.",
