        "action": "Suspend student accommodation rent payments during the COVID-19 outbreak.",
        "additional_details": "Therefore, this has resulted in students having to return home from tightly populated student accommodation buildings to reduce their risk of infection. Universities have also been urging students to stay off campus during the outbreak and many, if not all, have cancelled teaching for the rest of the academic year, which would show absolutely no need for students to stay at their University. In this case, should it be fair for students to pay rent for halls they are forced to no longer live in?",
        "background": "COVID-19 has resulted in a worldwide pandemic, and this petition highlights how we want to resolve an important issue to all university students living in accommodation. The U.K. government has advised people to socially distance and remain at home to lower the likelihood of spreading the virus.",
