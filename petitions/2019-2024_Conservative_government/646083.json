        "additional_details": "This effects young people who have mental health issues or physical issues who have been in inpatient care.Many young people find it difficult with changes which could cause them to not seek out for help. Speaking from experience I find it difficult mostly because I didn\u2019t have enough time to grow mentally. It\u2019s a jurassic change from having help from others to all of a sudden having to do it all on your own without being taught how. Don\u2019t take away all our innocence that has already been taken.",
        "background": "I believe that at sixteen you are still classed as a child therefore shouldn\u2019t be forced to go into adult services. I also believe that a young person should be allowed to have time before they fully leave the services they are at. So they can fully transition into the services they\u2019ll be going too.",
