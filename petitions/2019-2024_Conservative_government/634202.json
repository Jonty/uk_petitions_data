We need to introduce an insurance based funding perhaps along the lines of the German or possibly the French system where specialist insurance companies are used to fund care by employment deductions and reasonable charges for appointments and some routine services. If we don\u2019t bring more guaranteed regular funding and take politics largely out of our health care we can no longer get the care we all need.",

People are suffering and dying and we cannot claim to be cared for. We need to look at a German or French system partly funded by specialist insurance.",

For example, we could accept a petition calling on the Government to introduce obligatory social security contributions for the NHS, paid by employees, their employers, and self-employed workers, along the lines of French system."
