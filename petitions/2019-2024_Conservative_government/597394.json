Like many others here in Dubai we want to go home to see our family\u2019s, but many are restricted with the current costs of many tests required, plus pay cuts from the whole pandemic anyway. Personally I want to move back to the Uk but I\u2019m not willing to pay for numerous pcr tests (even though I\u2019m double jabbed) to go back and fourth to bring my things, plus having to home quarantine also. Makes me not want to move back to the Uk at all.",
