Lots of self employed people have not been able to work since the lockdown started in January and are having to survive on no or little income. We have all been waiting patiently for the budget and many of us thought the grant would be open after that was announced. It is so unfair on self employed that we have to wait till the middle of April when we have been forced to stop working. People are struggling to put food on the table and cover there bills. These grants are a lifeline to thousands. Employed people haven\u2019t had to wait for there furlough. Please reconsider the date as many are struggling.",
