        "additional_details": "I want the Government to do this because a child\u2019s life is more important than a child\u2019s education. The government says you cannot mingle with people outside your home, however in schools where everyone sits next to each other it\u2019s ok. Really? That is not the way things should go during these harsh times. Life is more important than education.",
        "background": "The Government should learn from the past lockdown, keeping schools open will just cause things to get worse. I would like the Government to close down schools so that there can be a future.",
