        "additional_details": "I myself and many others that I know have experienced a mental health issue and yet haven't felt accepted or got the support that we need both due to the misunderstanding of mental health by ourselves and others. Therefore we believe that if people are better educated on mental health then we can change the way it is viewed in this country thus changing people's lives for the better.",
        "background": "We would like a revolution in mental health education in schools. 1 in 4 people will experience a mental health problem at some point in their lifetime yet despite this mental health problems are still massively understood and so we would like children in schools to be better educated on the matter.",
