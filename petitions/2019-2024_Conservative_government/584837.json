        "additional_details": "On 2/5/2021, the season finale of Line of duty was aired by the BBC. Shortly after the episode finished, it came under extreme public scrutiny for failing to meet expectations and failing to uphold the level of thrill and anticipation that the public have so often come to expect from the programme. As such, the hope is that a new series will provide a satisfying end to an otherwise thrilling saga and that any dissatisfaction caused by the season 6 finale can be overridden.\r\nAdditionally, the DCMS Minister is the one person in government with the authority to make this happen and therefore his intervention is necessary.",
        "background": "The Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport should request that the BBC (a public agency in his department) produce a 7th season of \u2018Line of Duty\u2019. If he fails to do so, an early day motion should be published in the House of Commons calling for a 7th season.",
