        "background": "The 2022 rule change, giving pedestrians a right of way on the road, over a vehicle, especially at junctions, should be scrapped.\r\nThe pedestrian is an untrained user of the highway.\r\nNo other countries use the roads in this way.\r\nForeign drivers will not be aware of these rules.",
