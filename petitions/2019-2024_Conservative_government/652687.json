        "additional_details": "The new salary requirements will cause a chain of events which will put already struggling systems through more difficult times. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I have always aspired to write for British TV. I have saved up for years to come and study here, and I intend to put my degree into good use. But it will be exceptionally hard to find a TV writers job which will pay \u00a338.700 per year, two years into the market. Many students will struggle the same way, and all aspects of British society will be affected.",
        "background": "The new requirements will cause a rip in many families for one, as published by parliament on February 2023, and will harm any industry which relies on migrant workers. It will additionally harm international students, such as myself.",
