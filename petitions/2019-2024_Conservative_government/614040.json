        "additional_details": "An asset that runs itself successfully at profit, has no agenda, creates jobs.\r\n\r\nIn the era of fake news owned by one old austrailan bloke quality independent news is even more important.\r\n\r\nThe sale can't guarantee who will buy channel 4 or their agenda. Much like football clubs our media industty could become a play thing of oligarchs, look how that's working out now. \r\n\r\nAny profit will not be invested back into programmes but into owners pockets at a detriment to the UK audience.",
        "background": "The Tory sale of yet another national asset needs to stop. It is publicly owned then it should be for the public to decide. \r\n\r\nThe Government have no mandate for this. They act on our wishes, not the other way around\r\n\r\nIf we don't state now not to do it the BBC will be next.",
