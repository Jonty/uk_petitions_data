        "additional_details": "As a year 11 student, I have seen first hand the ways in which the pandemic has effected our nation's schools, teachers, and above all, the pupils of all ages who the education system serves. COVID has left the majority of students, particularly those who were already most vulnerable, behind and struggling with their studies. Furthermore, there isnt a child in this country who wouldn't benefit from the aid which educational charities and volunteers could provide, with support from the government",
        "background": "Following the governments plan to fund the recovery of the education system from COVID its evident that there is an issue with funding such relief effort. To tackle this I feel that support from the government for charities supporting the UK's education system would be of great benefit to such plans",
