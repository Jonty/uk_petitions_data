        "action": "Exclude the promotion of calorie labelling in DHSC\u2019s new health strategy",
        "additional_details": "Not only is calorie counting inefficient and unnecessary for weight loss, it perpetuates unhealthy diet culture and reinforces the societal pressures on individuals to look a certain way. Calorie labelling on menus and in shops is harmful and potentially triggering for those suffering with eating disorders and/or body image issues. An NHS analysis suggests that calorie counting is damaging and can\u2019t substitute for a balanced diet and exercise, and this strategy blatantly ignores that advice.",
        "background": "We call on the UK Government to oppose the inclusion of calorie labelling/counting in the DHSC\u2019s new health strategy. We would ask that the Government/Parliament instead support other healthy weight loss options such as active transport, better health education and reduced prices on healthier foods.",
