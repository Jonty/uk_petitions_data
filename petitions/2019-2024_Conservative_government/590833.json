        "action": "Do not lift legal requirements for mask wearing on 19th July 2021.",
        "additional_details": "Cases of the coronavirus delta variant are rising significantly and not all UK adults (over 18 years old) have received two doses of a vaccine (many are yet to receive one). It would therefore be inappropriate to remove the legal requirement for people to wear masks, particularly in indoor settings, on 19th July. Masks are the most effective way to prevent the spread of coronavirus, which has been shown to be predominantly transmitted by airborne and droplet routes.",
        "background": "The government should continue to enforce the current legal requirements for mask wearing, at least until everyone over the age of 18 has been fully vaccinated and the coronavirus cases have decreased to a sufficiently low level that the R0 number is below 1.",
