I fully appreciate school attendance is important but so is children\u2019s happiness, quality of life, time with loved ones, life experiences, less stress and debt on parents because they want to provide for their children. The cost of living is extremely high, so why not make a change where it hits us the most.",

It is not affordable for most and it\u2019s very unfair that fines are being introduced when it is actually the travel companies that should be held responsible. Why do prices increase so much within a short space of time?",
