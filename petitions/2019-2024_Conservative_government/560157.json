        "additional_details": "We are calling on the secretary of state for education The Rt Hon Gavin Williamson CBE MP to follow the decision of Wales in regard to GCSE examinations being taken in 2021.\r\n\r\nBy taking children out of school for many months in 2020 it is totally unfair, unjust and unacceptable to only push back examinations by three weeks, this creates an uneven playing field for the future of the children effected in compassions with Scotland and Wales and of those taken GCSE examinations in other years. This discriminates against English children set to sit GCSE exams in 2021 and infringes their human rights. We need to bring England in line with wales and cancel GCSE examinations in 2021 and grading should be carried out by coursework and class work",
