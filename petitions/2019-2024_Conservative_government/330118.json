        "action": "Stop the initiative to give British citizenship to Chinese Hong Kong citizens.",
        "additional_details": "We want to stop this change of the law because there has been no national referendum on giving 3 million Hong Kong citizens a path to British citizenship and there is no clear evidence of overwhelming support for this action to be taken. One of the main reasons for the Brexit was to stop mass migration to the UK, and under this proposed change in the law there would be a huge influx of Hong Kong migrants, thus undermining the democratic will of the nation.",
        "background": "We demand that the government refrain from granting a path to British citizenship for the approximately 3 million Chinese Hong Kong citizens eligible per the proposed changes in the nationality law for British National (Overseas) passport holders.",
