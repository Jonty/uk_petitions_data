        "additional_details": "At the moment, people only have to walk into a polling station and give their name and address to vote. 3.5 million British citizens do not have a photo ID. This is a cynical and ugly attempt to rig the system to disempower the poorest and most marginalised groups.\r\n\r\nVoting is safe and secure in the UK, which means the policy is just an unnecessary barrier to democratic participation. Ministers need to listen to these concerns and drop these costly plans.",
        "background": "Instead of creating more barriers to voting, ministers should focus on making it easier for everyone to vote, and ensuring we can all have an equal say in our democratic process.\r\n\r\nThese proposals are nothing more than an attack on the rights of some of the most marginalised people in society.",
