        "additional_details": "Although the suffering to both businesses and individuals cant be undone, the government could acknowledge the importance of this industry and the people within it by supporting and creating a bank holiday on Friday 25th of June 2021. The benefits of this could be huge - not only to hospitality, and therefore the economy - but could enable families and friends who were unable to meet over Christmas to finally get together. As social animals we need to have things such as this to look forward to.",
        "background": "Christmas 2020 has been cancelled, for hospitality this is the final nail in the coffin. The hospitality industry has suffered for half of 2020 because of restrictions by the government due to Covid-19. The restrictions in December mean that many businesses and individuals won't recover.",
