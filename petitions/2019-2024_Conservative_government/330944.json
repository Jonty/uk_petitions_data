        "additional_details": "The conscientious majority are making absolutely no headway against the inconsiderate and filthy minority who discard picnic leftovers, drink bottles and cans, disposable face masks and gloves, don't pick up after their dogs, unwrap, drop wrapper and eat when they leave a shop and many more.  This shows zero consideration for other people, livestock, wildlife or the environment. The Government must  take this seriously and bring in harsher penalties, then recruit more people to enforce them.",
        "background": "There has been a large increase of street waste due to the inconsiderate minority not picking up dog waste and discarding their face coverings and gloves.  Harsher penalties which are more strictly enforced are needed.  Increase the penalties and recruit more wardens to police and enforce them.",
