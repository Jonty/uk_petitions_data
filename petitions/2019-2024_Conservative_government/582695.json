        "additional_details": "It is unfair on animals, babies & young children who are frightened to death when fireworks are set off without warning in residential areas. The use of fireworks should only be allowed on 'special occasions' agreed, or at organized events, so the general public know when to expect fireworks going off, rather than them being set off on any night throughout the year unexpectedly. The pandemic has made this issue worse, with families and friends currently only allowed to meet in gardens.",
