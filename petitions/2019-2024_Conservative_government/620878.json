You can find out more about Motability here: https://www.motability.org.uk/charitable-grants/scheme-related-grant-programmes/grants-for-cars-and-vehicle-adaptations/\r\n\r\nIf there are specific changes you want to see to the support the Government provides to people with disabilities, you could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
