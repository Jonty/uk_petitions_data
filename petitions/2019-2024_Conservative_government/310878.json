        "additional_details": "The Government announced on 26/03/20 a package of financial support for many self employed people. Whilst a great start, it doesn\u2019t yet go far enough.\r\nMany people became self employed during the past 18 months, and are mostly ineligible for this help.\r\nIt seems catastrophically unjust that someone who has worked hard and earned money in self employment for up to 18 months is currently not eligible for anything other than Universal Credit.\r\nThis is desperate. People need help and assurance now.",
        "background": "For those newly self employed (18 months or less) who don\u2019t have a full 2019 Self Employed tax return to calculate a figure of financial aid from, we request that they be allowed to submit their 2020 return as evidence and be guaranteed the same level of help as other self employed people.",
