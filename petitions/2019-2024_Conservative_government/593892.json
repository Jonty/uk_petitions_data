Section 1 of the Dangerous Dogs Act relates to dogs bred for fighting, and it's not clear what if any changes you want to this section of this Act.\r\n\r\nSection 3 of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 makes it an offence for an owner to let their dog get dangerously out of control, and we have published the following petitions calling for changes to these rules, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nIncrease penalties for the owners of dangerously out of control dogs: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/581140\r\n\r\nExtend Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act 1953 protections to all Wildlife: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/574020\r\n\r\nIf you wan the Government to do something different to the above petitions you could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
