        "additional_details": "The need for strong leadership is paramount at all levels and this crisis has outlined that it is not present within the dental profession. There seems to be no self assessment of the CDO to recognise any failings towards the profession and likely no personal inclination to resign without being asked to do so.",

No discernible effort was made to engage with the workforce and the CDO showed utter disconnect from the situation, its severity and its impact on the dental profession.",
