        "action": "Relocation of Hanbury Grove Play Park due to antisocial behaviour",
        "additional_details": "The park is now regularly used as a congregation point for older teens who are swearing, using illicit substances, playing loud music and excessive consumption of alcohol.  This has resulted in the younger children not being able to use as was intended, and causing distress to the residents in the locale.  The park has also been vandalised and the fear of young children hearing the swearing, witnessing aggressive behaviour and finding drug paraphernalia is always a concern for local residents.",
        "background": "We are petitioning for Torfaen Borough Council to relocate Hanbury Grove Play Park due to the antisocial behaviour that is causing residents in the local area distress.  Although it is understood that the park is an asset to the community, it is no longer utilised in the way it was intended.",
