        "additional_details": "It has been estimated only 5% of infections came from the hospitality sector the extension of business hours would aid economic recovery while still safeguarding citizens. Prior to the 10PM curfew the public would exit premises and venture home while following the appropriate guidelines, the reduction in civil liberties coupled with the lack of scientific evidence to back it up has created an uncontrolled drinking culture (often in public) past the 10PM curfew.",
        "background": "Reinstate the 12AM closing time for bars, pubs, restaurants, and other parts of the hospitality sector. The detrimental effect this has had on the sector is trumped only by the initial lockdown itself. This has also had a server effect on the public stamina and resilience to this current epidemic.",
