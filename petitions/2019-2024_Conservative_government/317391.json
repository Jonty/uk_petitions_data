        "additional_details": "The Government, and Boris Johnson personally, owe the NHS and health and social care sector an immeasurable debt. Boris Johnson owes them his life. That debt must be repaid - in full. Once this crisis has abated, the Government must fully rebuild the NHS and health and social care sector - bigger and better than it has ever been before. And it must be genuinely rebuilt, not just dishonestly lip-serviced. Now is the time for honesty, and respect. \r\n\r\nReplace the losses. Restore the NHS. Save lives.",
        "background": "The Government must fully restore all losses accrued within the NHS and health and social care sector since 2010 - in terms of budget and financial cuts, and staffing, services and resources cut or lost. The NHS must be fully restored, and then subsequently maintained and improved upon every year.",
