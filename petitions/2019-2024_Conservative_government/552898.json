        "additional_details": "The Government must commit to reversing the inflation on Bipolar medication and put in a process of accountability wherein no prices will change without a proper voting process and justification. The NHS was established in 1945 to accommodate war heroes and veterans from working class backgrounds. This is a service for all people, not just the wealthy.",
        "background": "The NHS is moving in the direction of privatisation. For instance, Lithium Tablets (the treatment for Bipolar Disorder) have been raised from \u00a33 to \u00a387 a packet just this week! This is not gradual inflation, this is exploitation. Medication must be fixed at an affordable price for all. Please sign.",
