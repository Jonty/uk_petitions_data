        "additional_details": "With Covid-19 infections rising rapidly and evidence that the delta variant can infect double vaccinees, now is NOT the right time to abandon ALL infection control measures - indeed WHO has called this idea at this time 'epidemiological stupidity'.  \r\nThis measure costs nothing, will not affect businesses and could save lives. A YouGov poll conducted on 5 July found 71% of those surveyed said they think face masks should continue to be mandatory on public transport for a further period of time",
        "background": "On July 12th, the government is set to make a decision about allowing  the infection control measures we have all be bound by in law, to end. This petition calls for a legal extension to the period for the wearing of facemasks on public transport for a further 6-12 months",
