        "additional_details": "I would like the Government or Parliament to establish a public inquiry to establish the reasons for the failings by the UK Government, the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the reasons as to why the Prime Minister skipped five Cobra meetings on the Covid-19 virus. Why calls to order PPE were ignored, why scientists' warnings fell on deaf ears and whether such failings in early 2020 may have cost thousands of lives? The inquiry should engage the public, report findings and  make recommendations.",
        "background": "It has been reported that the PM Mr Boris Johnson skipped five Cobra meetings on the Covid-19 virus, that calls to order PPE were ignored, scientists' warnings fell on deaf ears and failings in early 2020 may have cost thousands of lives. There must be a public inquiry to establish the truth.",
