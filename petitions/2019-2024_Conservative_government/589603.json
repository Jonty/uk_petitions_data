After being faced with a terrifying situation where my son needed to be taken to hospital via ambulance and his father wasn\u2019t allowed to come anywhere near the hospital, I really feel something needs to change here. You can go to the pub, meet 30 people outside, but you can\u2019t have the support of your partner when there\u2019s a seriously poorly child. Parents need the support of each other at these times!",
