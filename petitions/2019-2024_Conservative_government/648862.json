Every time we entered the UK to return home, we wasted a lot of waiting time because we were not allowed to use the electronic gate and could not queue for British passports, which was very embarrassing.\r\nIt is unreasonable that electronic gates can be used by nationals of other countries (such as EU countries, Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, Liechtenstein, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland or the United States), but BNOs issued by the British government cannot.",
