        "additional_details": "According to the latest figures Children under 16 made up just 1% of coronavirus cases in the first peak of the virus in England, despite accounting for around 19% of the population. Its also be said that transmission from children is almost none existant. Children have a right to be comfortable and safe while at school, mental health is on the rise and I fear this will impact greatly on our childrens state of mind. Children have already missed a great chunk of thier education and do not need the added pressure of having to attend school with a face covering, there just isn't enough evidence out there that face coverings actually work and in actual fact more evidence that they add to illnesses and transmission. I urge the government to review the use of masks in schools",
