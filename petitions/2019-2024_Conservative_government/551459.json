        "additional_details": "What is also so entirely frustrating is that these rules are NOT consistent around the country. Some hospitals allow partners for the whole birth, for scans&appointments& it\u2019s just NOT right. With all shops, hairdressers, pubs open how on earth is it justifiable to keep partners from labour, appointments and births& to risk mental health issues such as post natal depression.\r\nWe mothers NEED OUR PARTNERS WITH US. With the correct PPE there is no reason why this isn\u2019t possible now.",
