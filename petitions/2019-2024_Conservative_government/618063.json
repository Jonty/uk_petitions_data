People have to fill up maybe once or twice a week for work and other commitments but it\u2019s just going to get harder when we are putting more in our tank than we earn a day. We need to do something as a country as I feel enough is enough. We have the power to use our voices to tell the government want they are doing is wrong and need to change. We need to strike and take action now",

We\u2019ve already suffering with higher electricity and gas bills and now we\u2019re expected to tolerate petrol going up to \u00a32+ a litre. It\u2019s ridiculous. This is benefiting no one apart from the government",
