        "additional_details": "We ask the Governement to enter into discussions with GPs to end this practice. Urgent appointments could be kept in reserve. Many people are happy to make an appointment one week in advance or even longer. Perhaps GP pactices can oppeate a system where people see a nurse who can deal with minor issues, or make refeals to hospital specialists. There are many options that would be a better alternative than what is available at present.",
        "background": "Twenty years ago GP's began refusing to issue appointments once that day's allotment had been given. People were asked to phone back the following day and start the process over again. This is an unacceptable procedure that leads to missed opportunities for early diagnosis.",
