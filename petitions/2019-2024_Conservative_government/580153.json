        "additional_details": "I would like the government to take into consideration the plight of young people who have had to be confined to their houses or local areas in spite of the fact that our immune systems are stronger than those who are now receiving the vaccine  and wouldn't have experienced the worst of symptoms if we had gone out and caught. But, it is well known that the reason for this was to keep those aforementioned groups who were at risk safe. So in solidarity now, I hope that this would be noted for this",
