        "additional_details": "It is completely incomprehensible that ministers, who have complete disregard for laws that they themselves made, and demanded the British public adhere to, should remain in office in British parliament. They should be held to the highest accountability standards and scrutiny. \r\nIt completely undermines the confidence of the British public for these senior ministers to remain in office. I believe I speak for the majority of the British populace. End corruption at the head of government!",

I call for their immediate suspension, and that their suitability to hold positions of responsibility and power be reviewed as a matter of urgency.",
