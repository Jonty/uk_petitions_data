A 34% increase in March 2022 on offences involving knife or sharp objects from 2010/2011 highlights the need to change in order to restore the safety of the streets. Education and guidance are a must but not enough. Offenders need to be captured and punished before the weapon is used. Deterrent punishments must be made.",
