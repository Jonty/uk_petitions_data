        "additional_details": "This will allow prosecution of those who \u2018groom and wait\u2019 for victims to reach the age of consent.\r\nOften it is a family friend trusted by the parents, who had access to the child from as early as an infant. They can admit to this behaviour and it is acceptable in the eyes of the law.\r\nThis activity affects many young people and the law must be changed to ensure it is illegal grooming behaviour. It is an abuse of trust and conducted to knowingly circumvent the law on sexual activity with children.",
        "background": "Implement a law to limit the age of consent to within 24 months of a minor's age to ensure that they are not taken advantage of by someone older who may coerce consent.\r\nAbusers can groom a child for years and use the defence that they waited until the child was 16 before engaging in sexual activity",
