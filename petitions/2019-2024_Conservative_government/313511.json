        "additional_details": "State owned  industry which is properly funded and run has to benefit the whole country. We are more and more reliant on imports and foreign owned businesses which can close factories at the drop of a hat in favour of factories in their own countries.  We once were the second biggest manufacturer in the world and our wealth is being slowly eroded by profits going abroad.  British owned businesses would pay taxes directly to the government and the workers would have security almost guaranteed.",
