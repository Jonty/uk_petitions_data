        "additional_details": "These recommendations leave a lot of uncertainly for us all. If we as the hospitality sector, need to close to ensure public safety and to lessen the spread of the coronavirus, then let\u2019s do so, but with enforced closures, clear timelines and a plan for financial support, so that we can at least have a chance of survival after this is all over. The government need to take responsibility for what they are imposing and show some support for what is the third largest employment sector in the UK.",
        "background": "Government have called for everyone to avoid unnecessary social interaction, this includes visiting pubs, restaurants and theatres in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. They have however not done so with enforced closures, leaving the onus on the public and business owners to make the right choice.",
