The proceeds from this fund will be accessed directly by energy companies enabling them to include a credit on each bill issued to sme's much in the same way as the climate change levy is currently added to energy invoices.\r\n3. The total effect of the above action should be that sme's energy costs are not impacted by more than 10% this year and not more than the inflation rate from next year.\r\nTaking the above action is necessary and will ensure the survival of many small businesses.",
