        "action": "Allow schoolchildren to go to the toilet when they need, during the pandemic",
        "additional_details": "The social distancing deployed to fight the pandemic has effectively reduced the capacity of the school toilets, making it even harder to go the toilet during breaks. This is creating needless anxiety and creating time pressures that compromise hand hygiene. Children who are desperate for the toilet are not able to learn effectively and are likely to misbehave. Additionally, some children are now limiting their water intake to try to avoid the situation, which makes learning even harder.",
        "background": "I'd like the Department of Education to issue a new policy that gives schoolchildren the right to go to the toilet, during lessons, at least once in the morning and once in the afternoon.",
