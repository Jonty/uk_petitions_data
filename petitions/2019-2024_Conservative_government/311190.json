        "additional_details": "During this recent crisis, it has become quickly apparent who the really essential people that our entire civilisation depends on for its existence are.  They are not the media, the celebrities and the self important but the people who have kept the medicines, food, and needed supplies getting to their intended destinations. Living in their cabs away from family for days and even weeks, risking their health to keep us all going. \r\n\r\nIt should even go International. October 4.. can I get a 10-4?",
        "background": "Declare October 4 of every year as Truckers Appreciation Day. October 4 is 10/4... and significant to many who move the goods and keep the country functioning. \r\n\r\nThey are seldom home, they get no recognition and plenty of abuse but people forget that they only bought it because Truckers brought it",
