Stricter laws should be in place to protect our children at all costs. \r\n\r\nAt present child molesters can walk free from prison within a few months to a few years, this is ultimately a disgrace, to say these people can molest a child and cause significant mental and or physical damage to a child for the rest of their live. This sentence should always be a minimum of life imprisonment.",
        "background": "Paedophilia and Child Abuse is rife across the world and we need to put a stop to this and PROTECT OUR CHILDREN. \r\n\r\nWe need to stop giving plea bargains to convicted Paedophiles and Child abusers, increase the minimum prison term to life, once a threat always a threat to children.",
