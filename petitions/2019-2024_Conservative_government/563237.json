(Covid deaths 56,000).\u00a0Stop the course of action causing them. 2:Government regulations are contradictory, with no sense of cause and effect eg pubs/bubbles. 3:Tiers until Easter will devastate lives, businesses, and future generations - almost \u00a31 billion a day. 4:Pressure on the NHS is no reason to make it\u00a0illegal\u00a0for people to pursue their lives. We have 7 unused Nightingale hospitals and capacity in regular hospitals. Excess deaths are barely above the annual average. 5:We have very real anxieties with the state arrogating itself the power to impose such stringent measures on its population when the data upon which this is based is chancy and uncertain, taking away our liberty.",
