        "additional_details": "If the bridal industry, and business within it and not supported, it is inevitable that many companies will close, causing huge job losses and unemployment. Weddings are an integral part of the UK culture, with the sector worth around \u00a310 billion (Evening Standard 2018). It is already set to lose \u00a35.6 billion this year as an industry. You cannot afford to let these businesses go unsupported and the industry collapse.",
        "background": "Weddings have been cancelled and the guest count repeatedly lowered at little or no notice. This has caused massive financial difficulties for businesses working in the bridal industry, but no support or acknowledgement of this has been given.",
