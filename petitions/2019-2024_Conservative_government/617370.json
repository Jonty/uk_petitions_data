This will limit the increase\r\n\r\nAND/OR\r\n\r\nStop automatic renewals when the renewal price exceeds a given percentage (%) of the original price.\r\n\r\nMy bill was due to renew with an 89% increase whilst new customers were able to join at a rate that was 4% below my current rate for the exact same product.\r\n\r\nThese practices punish the vulnerable.",
        "background": "Providers of internet and television services inflate the true value of their services before providing hefty upfront discounts. They then take advantage of the automatic renewal process which requires no input from the customer to roll-over onto the heavily inflated undiscounted price.",
