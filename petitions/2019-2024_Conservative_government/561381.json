        "action": "Give international graduates of 2020 access to the 2021 post-study work visa",
        "additional_details": "We urge the government to give us the chance to apply for the post-study work visa which will launch in 2021 even though we graduated in 2020. We ask that we have the option to return to the UK for this visa to try and get a job. A chance that we all lost this year to the pandemic. This would give us a much-needed chance that we lost this year. \r\n\r\nIt would also send a clear message to the world that the UK takes care of the wellbeing of its students and that it stands with international students.",
        "background": "Many international students who graduated this year were forced to return home and were unable to make use of the 4 months post-graduation to look for work. Many of us lost the job opportunities we had lined up due to the pandemic and job cuts. Thus we have faced great sadness, stress and pressure.",
