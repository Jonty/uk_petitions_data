        "additional_details": "Endometriosis is a debilitating illness for thousands of Women. Many suffer with extreme chronic or recurring pain, chronic fatigue, digestive problems, fertility problems and many have to undergo multiple surgeries, intense hormonal medication (with many side effects) or find ways of coping and fitting their lives around the intense pain they are subjected to. If endometriosis can be recognised as a disability in many other countries, it should be recognised in the UK also. Help is needed.",
        "background": "To date Endometriosis does not have the same rights as other disabiling illnesses, yet impacts so many lives across the UK from as young as 17 years old. A time has now come where Endometriosis should formally be recognised as a disability, and covered under the Disability Discrimination Act.",
