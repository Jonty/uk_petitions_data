        "additional_details": "Increasing this limit will be a huge advantage for the vaping community. One of the main reasons being the price. It is much better value for money to purchase a higher puff disposable than it is to purchase a 600 puff one. This means that more people are likely to quit smoking due to the fact it is a much cheaper option.",
        "background": "In the UK we are currently following TPD regulations which means that a disposable can't contain over 2ml of eliquid nor contain more than 2% (20mg) of nicotine. However, in the UK you can still purchase 10ml 2% refills for pod devices, so why can't disposables have a limit of 10ml?",
