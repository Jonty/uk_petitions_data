        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to make it mandatory for nightclubs or other similar settings to clearly present their drink prices so that no person is surprised what they they have to pay on the till. Often prices are not displayed, and can even change over the course of a night, meaning people do not know what they will pay for a drink.",
        "background": "Especially for youth, pubs, bars and nightclubs are a crucial part of the entertainment industry. Many nightclubs and bars adjust their prices throughout the night making it impossible to tell how much people are paying for drinks, meaning people pay for drinks which are often too expensive.",
