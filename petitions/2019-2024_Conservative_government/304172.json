        "additional_details": "We would like the Government or Parliament to enforce this action due to the growing fear among parents and students that attend school. The ability to focus or concentrate is affected in addition to the growing fears of the Corona-virus. In our view, the government and health officials around the world are more 'reactive' rather than 'proactive'. This will result in more spread as time is given for the virus to do so. We hope to come to an agreement as soon as possible in a timely manner.",
        "background": "We would like the government to at least consider lock down the country in the coming weeks or as soon as possible, in addition to taking necessary actions to prevent further spread, using World Health Organization line, following UE countries.",
