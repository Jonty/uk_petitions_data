        "action": "Write off all student loans incurred during university terms impacted by COVID19",
        "additional_details": "Students incur substantial debts to secure their degrees and have not received full value for their investment during COVID-19. The jobs many do to supplement their income have not been available during lockdowns. There is no consistency in the financial compensation provided by universities or landlords, which in any case have their own fixed costs to cover. Writing off student loans for the affected terms would ensure all students are not unfairly penalised for events outside their control.",
        "background": "The quality of tuition and support received by students during coronavirus has been compromised yet many paid full tuition fees and rent while being prevented from using university facilities or live in their accommodation. Writing off loans would be the fairest way to ensure they are compensated.",
