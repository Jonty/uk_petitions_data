Take the information from China they tested everyone who has symptoms and even though there numbers where high, they were able to contain cases by lockdown.\r\nItaly, according to figures, are 2 to 4 weeks ahead of us. We should be testing the members of the people who show signs of the virus, not stopping to keep figures low.\r\nWe are do NOT want to lose those we love because the gov won't test people.",
        "background": "The Gov are letting the ball slip on the Pandemic that is sweeping the world. Our country is not testing anyone but hospitalised member of the public, for the virius. In the new advice, we have to brace ourselves to lose our loved ones. If we don't, people could turn up in A&E and spread it further.",
