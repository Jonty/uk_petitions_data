        "additional_details": "During the 1st national lockdown, Britain\u2019s 40,000 driving instructors had faced an immense mental & financial hardship, until they managed to resume training and effectively adopted to a new way of using PPEs whilst delivering driving lessons.\r\nMoreover, a 2nd round of suspension of driving tuition would inevitably means that learners would also be fatigued and somewhat traumatised by this unnecessary measure.\r\nPlease alleviate this dilemma by returning driving instructors to work without delay.",
        "background": "Our working environment is COVID-secure, as we are strictly PPEs compliants. Our training is educational and of vital importance for those whom are in need of a driving licence, in order to avoid using public transport.",
