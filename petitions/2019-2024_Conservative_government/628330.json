        "additional_details": "For lack of suitable facilities, too many people end up fending for themselves on the streets, where their addiction impacts all aspects of their existence and that of their families. Many get involved in crime and some pay the ultimate price of death because they can't find a way out of the vicious cycle caused by their addiction.\r\n \r\nWe believe specialised centres are needed to help break what can be a downward spiral and to assist these people in becoming active, healthy and productive members of society again.\r\n",
        "background": "Thousands of people require treatment for substance abuse each year. Some are treated successfully in the community, but many would benefit from specialised rehab centres to detox and to rebuild their lives away from negative influences. The Government should provide funding for such facilities.",
