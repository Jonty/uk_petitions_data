If two people are isolating together I cant see why there unable to attend appointments together with precaution. I understand other pregnant women attending scans and midwives and health care workers who work on maternity wards need protecting but this is unfair.",

However partners already feel pushed out at times as they are not the individual carrying the child and will feel not part of the pregnancy.",
