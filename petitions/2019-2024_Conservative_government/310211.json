        "additional_details": "University assessments should be suspended due to the fact that students are not getting access to vital resources needed to work at their best. We don't believe it's ethical that we have to continue to hit multiple deadlines as normal & have online exams despite having lost jobs, little guidance and personal worries.\r\nGCSE's & A Levels have been cancelled, so we believe degree students should have the same leniency given to them, OR a middle ground met to reduce stress in an already hard time.",
        "background": "This academic year has seen unprecedented changes due the COVID-19 pandemic we are currently suffering from. We want all universities across the country to suspend academic assessments for Term 3 (Easter-Summer), so we are all on an even playing field (as some universities already have done so).",
