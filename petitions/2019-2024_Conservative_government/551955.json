The Government should review the amount of homework schools set and issue guidance limiting this to a reasonable level, which should be substantially lower than what is currently set by many schools.",
        "background": "I\u2019ve seen the amount of homework students are set and this needs to be reduced. Students have enough stress with their own lives and school to be doing additional work at home when they should be able to relax and see their friends. It's not fair on them.",
