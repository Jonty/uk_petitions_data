        "additional_details": "Whilst searching for a second hand bicycle I've seen countless dubious advertisements. Anybody wishing to sell a stolen bicycle can create an account on a sales site, agree to meet at any location and ask for payment in cash. Bicycle theft is rife (including, now, jacking). If serial numbers were required to be stated in all listings, they could be checked by buyers on sites listing stolen bicycles, and also by people who have had a bike stolen, hopefully aiding both prevention and recovery.",
        "background": "I want a law to be passed stating that any private or non-authorised business sellers of bicycles must state (and include a photograph) of the serial number of any bicycle being sold (where a serial number exists), in any form of advert or sales listing.",
