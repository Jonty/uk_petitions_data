The majority of students have traveled home to their primary address to be with their families in this difficult time, with many international students returning to other countries. With restrictions on travel, we cannot access our term-time housing.\r\n3. Many students have lost their income due to zero-hour contracts in bar work/waiting/hospitality.",
