        "additional_details": "However, unlike schools and a levels university exams are still forecast to go ahead. This seems rather unfair due to the nature of university, the education we are paying for, again unlike schools and a levels, we are not receiving the same quality of learning but are expected to deliver in exams. While GCSES and A-LEVEL exams, who don\u2019t pay for there education, exams have been cancelled. As you can imagine the frustration I feel the government need to consider university assessments as well.",
        "background": "Regarding the current climate we all are facing each day, COVID 19, normality, as you would agree has been flipped on its head. This includes the teaching of university. University teaching like schools and a levels have taken the online approach.",
