        "additional_details": "Having a required calorie count display on all menus is extremely harmful to people with eating disorders and mental health surrounding people who suffer with disordered eating. The government should take into account the harm that comes with this law. This law is meant part of a plan to \u2018tackle obesity\u2019 in the UK, however putting calorie counts beside options will have little to no effect on obesity in the UK. I urge the UK government to learn more about eating disorders and remove this law.",
        "background": "Scrap the recent and harmful law that restaurants and menus must display a calorie count, and have further research done about it\u2019s effect on people with eating disorders.",
