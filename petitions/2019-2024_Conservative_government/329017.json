        "additional_details": "By not allowing professional establishments to open (many of which operate under strict licensing regulations) it pushes the public into the hands of opportunists willing to operate outside of the law,where the opportunity to trace contact is lost. It is inconsistent that our industry is considered high risk when people are allowed inside pubs, cinemas & bingo halls with few restrictions & no opportunity for tracing. We are highly trained, qualified, with strict procedures & are being dismissed.",
        "background": "Allow beauty salons, spas and allied businesses to open on the 4th July 2020.We are an industry which is largely or can solely be by appointment only, has GDPR compliant data collection already in place for traceability of consumers, worth \u00a38billion to the economy with inherently sanitary procedures",
