        "additional_details": "The government should order the universities to either provide an option for students to study on campus or online. If they cannot do that for all the students at least those students who have to waste their precious student lives studying online should be reimbursed in some way.",
        "background": "Due to Covid 19 most universities have decided to make the academic year 100% online. It is unfair for students to pay such a high fee, specially international students who are paying an average of \u00a318000 fee. Considering how much cost will be saved universities should reduce the fee by at least 40%",
