        "action": "Ban so-called \u2018conversion therapy\u2019 for transgender individuals",
        "additional_details": "The government had plans to ban \u2018conversion therapy\u2019 for both sexuality and gender identity. However in the space of a day it cancelled those plans entirely, and then decided to only ban \u2018conversion therapy\u2019 relating to sexual orientation, completely ignoring gender identity. This is transphobic and harmful to all people who fit under the transgender umbrella.\r\n\r\nThis petition aims to bring the government back in line with the promises it made in 2018 and reaffirmed in the Queen\u2019s speech in 2021.",
        "background": "The government\u2019s own study shows that \u2018conversion therapy\u2019 does not work, and furthermore, individuals who undergo \u2018conversion therapy\u2019 have significantly increased odds of self-harming. The government should ensure the safety of transgender people and ban this unethical and harmful practice.",
