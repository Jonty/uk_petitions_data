        "additional_details": "By signing this petition you will help ALL sales people across ALL industries who rely on their sales commissions to support their homes and families.\r\nOn average, a lot of sales staff end up being paid below minimum wage if you remove their commission from their monthly wage. This is why during this time, we need support. If we make a lot of commission, we pay a lot of tax therefore we pay our part like everyone else in the UK. Now is a time for us to be supported.",
        "background": "We want the government to pay 80% of average earnings to employees across the commission based sales industry that are on Furlough Leave due to the Covid-19 crisis. Average earnings can be worked out based on the last 3 or 6 months of pay slips.",
