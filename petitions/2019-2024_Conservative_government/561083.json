A lot of young families who have have more than 1 child will not be able to live in the smaller houses that are within the price cap. The government should seriously look at how feasible this is before it creates more poverty in regions outside of London. The price cap needs to be increased in those regions. A lot of new build development prices in the NW for example start at \u00a3238k.",
