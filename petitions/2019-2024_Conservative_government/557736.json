Taking these facilities away from the public who rely on them for their physical & mental well-being will decrease the overall health of the nation, which will lead to an increased strain on the NHS & more lives will be unnecessarily lost. \r\nGyms are safe to open. Your nation needs its gyms. Keep them open. Keep your nation healthy.",
