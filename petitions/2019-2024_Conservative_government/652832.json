        "additional_details": "There's countless religious arguments as this law states against those. If someone were to get married abroad they can't start a family in the UK even though they are citizens themselves! It's going to push people away from the UK and settle outside the country. Especially those educated who are able to move abroad with their partner and start a family. The salary requirments need paying attention to. If the government believe its too low then they should increase it in increments not 50%!",
        "background": "Rever the spouse visa conditions back to how it was as \u00a338,700 is above the national average wage. These conditions break families and don't allow majority of people to get married to anyone from a different nationality! Absurd!",
