        "additional_details": "By closing the schools earlier, it guarantees a 2 week isolation period for all children and staff to ensure they are clear for Christmas celebrations for families. Some bubbles will have to isolate and the effect on people\u2019s well being knowing, after the difficult year we have had, they won\u2019t be able to mix with anyone over Christmas is heart breaking. Schools could work remotely in this period so children will not be missing out learning",
        "background": "Schools are open right up until Christmas however, if a bubble has to isolate in the last week of term, this will result in the child and teacher not being able to spend Christmas with their family when government are allowing.",
