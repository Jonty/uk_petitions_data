        "additional_details": "To mark the 75th Anniversary of VE Day and the end of WW2, the 2020 Early May Bank Holiday was moved to Friday 8th May. On this day, it struck me as odd that we do not celebrate this historic date properly every year. I have often thought that, as a nation, we are missing a national holiday that gives us the chance to celebrate our unity in a truly positive way and it seems like VE Day is the perfect opportunity for that.",
        "background": "We propose that the Early May Bank Holiday is permanently moved to the closest Friday to the 8th of May each year in order to create the annual national holiday of VE Day Weekend.",
