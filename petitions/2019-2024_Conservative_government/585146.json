        "additional_details": "It is time for complete parity between unpaid and NHS carers. I am calling upon parliament to match the wages of unpaid carers to those in the NHS, by paying unpaid carers \u00a39-an-hour. The fact they are expected to live off just under \u00a3500 a year, for work carried out every single day, at every single hour as and when they're needed is unacceptable.",
        "background": "Unpaid carers are paid \u00a367.60 a week via carers allowance. Living with someone that is an unpaid carer for their parents, I have seen first-hand that a carer's job is not an average 9-to-5. It is a 24/7, 365-days-a-year occupation to care for loved ones and ensure their quality of life.",

If you want the Government to change Carer's Allowance in a way different to the above petition, you could start a new petition explaining clearly how you would like this allowance to be changed."
