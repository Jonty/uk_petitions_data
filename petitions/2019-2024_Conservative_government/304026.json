        "additional_details": "The Spanish public spontaneously recognised the work of their medical profession by a collective outbreak of applause.  The leadership role of the Chief Medical Officer for England should receive public recognition.  The work of the Government Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, has already been recognised.  The nation will be particularly reliant on and indebted to those individuals in the weeks and months to come.  Public recognition now will show the nation's support.",
        "background": "The Chief Medical Officer is shouldering an enormous burden.  Doing so, he is providing clear, considered, advice to the Government and to the public at large.  He commands public respect, and that respect can most evidently be demonstrated by the immediate conferment of a knighthood.",
