        "additional_details": "Hospitals workers, teaching staff, armed forces, scientists, etc. are now being asked to jump through hoops in order to make up for the inadequate planning and funding of processes that should have already been in place to tackle this pandemic. We knew it was coming at some point. This cannot continue. Governments MUST prioritise those public services that are there to help and protect THE WHOLE population and future generations. This will not be done by building a new train line. Prioritise.",
        "background": "Cancel the ludicrously expensive hs2 project and spend our money more wisely. Covid 19 has highlighted the inadequate investment into health, education, and science and this is now costing lives.  Bill Gates warned of such a virus 5 years ago and you have done nothing to prepare. Things must change.",
