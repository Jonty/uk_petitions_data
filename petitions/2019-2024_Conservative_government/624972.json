        "additional_details": "Rabbits and parrots are highly intelligent animals that don't do well in these environments. They aren't good children's pets which most people are purchasing for when going to a pet shop. Parrots can live for 90 years and need an experienced owner. Rabbits need a lot of care and large areas to roam they shouldn't be caged. All of this information we now know hence why still selling them in pet shops is wrong. Also most shop owners/workers have no animal care knowledge experience either.",
