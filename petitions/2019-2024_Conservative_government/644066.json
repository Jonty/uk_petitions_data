Adding more dogs to the list will only increase demand for certain breeds and will never stop the breeding happening. Time has come to introduce a license structure so that the hopeful owner(s) can prove that they have the correct needs to own a dog, and this would become a blanket system across every breed that exists, from Pugs to Caucasian Shepherds.",
