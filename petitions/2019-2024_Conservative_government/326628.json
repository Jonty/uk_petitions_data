        "action": "Remove statues of all racist figures from public platforms.",
        "additional_details": "Remove and replace these statues with inspirational figures who have fought for equality and/ or demanded radical change. Philis Wheatley,  Mary Seacole, Bernie Grant, and Olaudah Equiano are just a few black people who have radically changed Britain\u2019s social dynamic. They are great candidates to replace that of racist white men, and they will serve to educate the British population on its racist, colonising past, while also showing support for the Black Lives Matter movement.",
        "background": "The statue of Edward Colston was removed from its pedestal, it\u2019s time all other racist figures are removed from theirs. There is no need for these figures to be towering over society any longer. They do not serve as educational- if education is the intent they should be moved to a museum.",
