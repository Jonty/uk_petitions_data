        "action": "Legalise Cannabis for medicinal and recreational use.",
        "additional_details": "Regulating the market could bring in billions of pounds in sales tax boosting the economy especially after the coronavirus pandemic. Neumerous studies show that cannabis is much less damaging as alcohol and tobacco and it can genuinely help people. When the government legalised CBD it was great helping thousands, but legalising it with the THC content could help thousands more with chronic pain, migraines etc, instead of relying on pharmaceutical medicines that could do more harm than good.",
        "background": "I would like the government to learn from canada, and the numerous states that has legalised cannabis. I would like the government to look at new evidence to suggest it\u2019s not as harmful as once thought. Make it legal for recreational and medical use and if possible regulate the market.",
