It is therefore not clear how a digital Blue Badge could be used to identify people that are authorized to park in designated on-street parking spaces.\r\n\r\nOff-street car park operators should provide parking spaces for disabled people. However, it is up to the car park owner to decide whether Blue Badge holders can park free of charge. Where off-street parking is not free of charge to Blue Badge holders, they can pay for off-street parking in the same way as other car park users."
