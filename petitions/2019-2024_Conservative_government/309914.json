Most people have now filled their green bins so it will be there to rot instead of being recycled. The next lot of green waste will go in black bins with household waste which costs about 4 times more for the council to process. Heavier for bin men too. This is not economical or environmentally friendly. Action needs to be taken as soon as possible.",
        "background": "Green waste has increased since this virus as people are doing their gardens. It will end up in black bins so this is not good for the environment.",
