        "additional_details": "The Government needs to think out of the box. If the number of Covid-19 cases have stopped rising by June,then it would be sensible to reopen schools in July & August. This would reduce the impact of losing 3 months of education due to the untimely closures. The cancelled GCSEs could also be held during the summer holidays. This would avoid the unfairness that would come from unorthodox methods for awarding grades to pupils who have been preparing for years for to sit these exams.",
        "background": "Schools have closed due to the Covid-19 Pandemic and the expectation is that they will stay closed till the end of the Spring term.The action taken is understandable.Given the students would have missed more than 3 months of classes,the Government should cancel summer holidays to claw back lost time",
