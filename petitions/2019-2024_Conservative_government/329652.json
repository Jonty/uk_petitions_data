        "additional_details": "No school sets a child up for something they cannot achieve. Uni places hang in the balance too. You\u2019ve already u-turned on the date results will be available. Kids\u2019 mental health is suffering. A* students with top uni offers face not getting their places. Students with conditional offers have their futures at risk. This is wrong. Bright, deserving, hard-working kids having their futures ripped away that we gave everything for. Please help pass this petition, before more kids\u2019 lives are ruined.",
        "background": "A-level and GCSE results will be handed out in August this year on the date expected, with results based on work so far: mocks, teacher assessments, and more. Each school has someone to sign them off, but you\u2019ve decided to reduce grades by up to 33%.\r\nWe call on you to intervene now and stop this.",
