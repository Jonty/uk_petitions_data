Your petition refers to reducing all taxes on citizens from 20% to 7%, but many taxes are not currently at 20%.\r\n\r\nBecause MPs make up a very small proportion of taxpayers the change you have suggested would result in a significant reduction in public revenue, and therefore the public services the Government would be able to afford to provide, and it is not clear if this is what you intend.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
