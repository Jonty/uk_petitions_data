        "additional_details": "The Health Survey for England (2017) reported that 28.7% of adults in England are obese and a further 35.6% are overweight and Boris was quoted as saying that we should try and get fit in the wake of COVID-19. The government should support this by offering vouchers that give cheaper access to venues such as climbing walls, gyms, dance studios or others that promote exercise and movement. This would support spending whilst also encouraging us to get moving and improve wellbeing through exercise.",
        "background": "As a nation that are increasingly overweight, it is not beneficial to just encourage spending on eating out. Offer the same \u00a310 voucher to promote and encourage spending in the fitness and wellbeing sectors such as gyms or climbing walls to get the UK population moving again.",
