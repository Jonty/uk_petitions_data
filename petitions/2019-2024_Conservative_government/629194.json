        "additional_details": "Our four year old asked about a brutal murder, based on what they\u2019d heard in a shop, on daytime news, from BBC radio - we couldn\u2019t have avoided them hearing this.  If parents want to educate their children on such things they should be able to do so in a controlled way, without preventing businesses from broadcasting radio.  Considering most news is about war, murder, suicide, & all sorts of other crises, it would be shrewd to increase protection given to children.  At least require a warning.",
        "background": "Radio, particularly news broadcasts, should have watershed restrictions on content.  Radio is most commonly consumed in cars/vehicles/businesses.  It\u2019s often difficult to avoid children suddenly hearing news about war, suicide, murder, & other such mature topics.  It should be better controlled.",
