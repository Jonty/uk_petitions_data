        "background": "Make the CJRS mandatory and rehire employees that were made redundant due to Covid-19 and furlough them. Otherwise thousands of employees are at risk of zero income, no job opportunities in this uncertain economy, mounting bills and emotional distress, despite being eligible for the CJRS fund.",
