        "action": "Raise India's farm laws adverse effect on justice and rights",
        "additional_details": "We are asking the Government through the Foreign Secretary to raise issues of breach of international human rights law by the Indian Government which is a signatory to UDHR and the 2018 UN Declaration on Rights of Peasants (UNDROP). The new Indian Farm Laws, deny small farmers access to independent justice in contractual disputes, fail to provide an independent evaluation of produce in relation to costs and in contravention of its responsibility under UNDROP, failed to consult farmers and their leaders before enacting legislation. Every country is obliged to conform to international treaties and it is the responsibility of countries like UK to remind abrogating countries about that.",
        "background": "We ask the UK Government to raise concerns with the Indian Government about breaches of international norms in the new Farm Laws, such as lack of consultation, denial of recourse to independent courts in case of disputes and failure to ensure independent evaluation of produce.",
