        "additional_details": "People who purchase cannabis from the black market help fund organised crime gangs that target our youth and turn them into mules. We can stop that by legalising it, taxing it and educating on it. Cannabis is already becoming decriminalized/ or legalised in Western Countries, most recently Germany. If someone wants to use it, they will do it regardless of its legality status; offering the opportunity to do it in a safe and controlled manner is important for our health and wellbeing.",
        "background": "Creating a transparent and taxable market will help close a section to the black market where the products are often tampered with and can be dangerous for the user. By creating a similar approach to Germany, more police resources can be utilized in areas that matter and help educate citizens",
