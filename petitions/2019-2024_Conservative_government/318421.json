        "additional_details": "Universal income offers everyone a set-standard of living, ensuring that the basic needs of society are met. The scheme would ensure that each and every individual within the UK has, at the very least, the bare essentials to survive in a period of increased financial uncertainty and instability. The payments could either be distributed on a weekly or monthly basis directly into a bank account/from a governmental agency. This would ensure EVERYONE within society is taken care of.",
