        "additional_details": "When a country\u2019s COVID rate is between 20-25 the government considers it for the red list . When Pakistan was put in,the rate was 20 +, so it was acceptable for the UK government to take such action . However , currently Pakistan\u2019s rate has dipped to approximately 11.\r\n Citizens who travel due to emergency reasons could be left with debts which could result in lots of stress . Stress can then cause devastating effects such as mental breakdowns . \r\n\r\n We hope the [GOV] takes equitable action ASAP",
        "background": "Evidence shows that Pakistan\u2019s COVID-19 rate has decreased drastically and that the curve has been flattened . \r\nI, along with all British/Overseas Pakistani\u2019s request the UK government to remove Pakistan from the red list .",
