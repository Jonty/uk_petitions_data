        "additional_details": "At present, someone can write a \"mirror will\" with someone else and if one party dies, the other person can make a new will cutting out the deceased person's family, or making any other changes they want. This goes against the deceased person's wishes and they are unable to defend it. It means that their wishes can be totally ignored and the inheritance rights of their family can be totally removed.",
        "background": "The Government should ensure that \"mirror wills\" - where two people agree identical wills - cannot be changed after one party to these wills has died. A beneficiary of a \"mirror will\" can subsequently change their will. This should not be allowed.",
