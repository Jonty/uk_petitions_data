        "action": "Extend the EU transition period expiry by one year until  31 Dec 2021.",
        "additional_details": "The Coronavirus (CV) emergency is rightly receiving the full attention of governments in the UK, EU and around the world. As a result it is not possible for governments and businesses to meet and discuss the complex issues that will need to be negotiated. Also, the economic impacts of CV on economies around the world will have a profound effect on any future negotiations. To extend the transition period for one year seems a sensible and prudent approach in this time of massive challenges.",
        "background": "Debate and vote on a motion brought before Parliament to approach the European Union to request an extension to the 'transition' or 'implementation' period for leaving the EU. Negotiate in good faith with the EU to amend the expiry date to 31 December 2021.",
