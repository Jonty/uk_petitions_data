        "additional_details": "It is clear the NHS has been underfunded for a long period of time. By not paying in their fair share of tax, it can be argued that companies operating in the UK but registered in tax havens are indirectly responsible for the deaths of people suffering with Coronavirus. A number of other EU countries (France, Denmark and Poland) have already announced similar policies. It it time the UK government did the same and takes a stand against tax avoidance schemes that are detrimental to the UK.",
        "background": "For a long time companies have registered offices in Tax Havens in order to avoid paying tax. These companies, some of the largest multinationals with huge profit margins have routinely not paid their fair share of tax. They should now not be able to benefit from any financial aid related to Covid19",
