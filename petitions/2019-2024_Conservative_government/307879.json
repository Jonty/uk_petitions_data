        "additional_details": "There is a real problem getting supplies in to the supermarkets currently. Bus companies are overstaffed. Use these drivers who are used to driving 12 meter long rigid body vehicles to ease the pressure on the truck drivers by giving all category D license holders the Category C entitlement. This will also help keep the country going should some truckers go down with the virus and cannot work, by giving a much larger safety net.",
        "background": "To get the stock to the supermarkets in a more efficient time period during the outbreak crisis of Covid-19, the government could use the overstaffed bus companies drivers to drive non articulated trucks by supplying them with the Cat C entitlement on their license.",
