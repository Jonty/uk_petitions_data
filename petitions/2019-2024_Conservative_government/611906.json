Simply inhumane to expect families living in basements in Ukraine, under curfew & with little means, to travel to a 3rd country for biometrics for a child.",
        "background": "Children travelling with one of their parents (who has valid, international passport), should be able to enter the UK with just a birth certificate. Remove the need for families to attend a biometric appointment prior to completing application. Biometrics for children should happen once in the UK.",
