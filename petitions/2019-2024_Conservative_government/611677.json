        "additional_details": "During the COVID restrictions there was guidance and encouragement from the Government for people to pay by debit/credit card wherever possible to reduce possible COVID transmission. Now that all COVID restrictions have been lifted. it should be incumbent on all traders in face to face situations to accept cash given that a 'card only' system discriminates against the 4 million people in this country who do not have a bank account and rely on cash for making payments.",
        "background": "I want the Government to either legislate or publish mandatory guidance ensuring that traders must accept cash in payment from face to face customers who choose to pay that way and who may not have access to debit/credit cards.",
