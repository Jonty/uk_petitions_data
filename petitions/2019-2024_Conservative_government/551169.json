        "additional_details": "At 14, a child can be assessed to be Gilick Competent which means that they are capable, mature and have a level of understanding which enables that child to have a say about their care plans/orders. If the child wishes to, they should be given the opportunity to attend the court room or to speak with the judge in person about their true wishes and feelings and so that judge can make an informed decision about the child\u2019s best interests based on their competence and level of understanding.",
        "background": "CAFCASS are not sharing the child\u2019s true wishes in the family court, they often side with Social Services stating that \u201cin their view this is what is best for the child\u201d. That is not seeking the views of the child. Judges are not seeking any evidence (wishes and feelings work) to show evidence.",
