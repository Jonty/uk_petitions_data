Parents have planned their lives & schools invested millions into the change from a 3 tier school system to a 2 tier system like the rest of the county and country. Other areas of the county are continuing their plans for this despite having planned for less time and is only the Stotfold and Shefford cluster being paused. What has gone wrong and who is responsible? It\u2019s not believed it cannot now be funded",
        "background": "We need the government/parliament to help unpause the CBC\u2019s schools for the future program in the Stotfold and Shefford area which has been promised and planned for the past 3 years. It is claimed the last admin did not plan its funding. This needs investigating and the program funded, true or not.",
