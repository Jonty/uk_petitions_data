        "additional_details": "1) Return all illegal migrants the same day to discourage them to return.\r\n2) Publicly refuse asylum via law.\r\n3) Setup a migrant prison to hold them in advance of departure, and stop using hotels as the expense of the tax payer. \r\n4) Sack Priti Patel effective immediately.\r\n\r\nYou give these non-economic contributing people more benefits and protection than our pensioners and ex servicemen. You should be ashamed",
        "background": "The government must return all illegal migrants crossing daily back to the shores of France from which they came. The U.K. has no obligation to those passing through a \u201csafe\u201d country. The U.K. cannot afford the economic costs of these people, whom are put up in 4* hotels and treated like royalty.",
