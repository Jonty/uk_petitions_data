        "additional_details": "Many countries now offer 'X' as an option on passports and the UK recognizes these as valid; including Australia, Canada, Iceland, and New Zealand.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, a judge ruled \"if the international trend towards more widespread official recognition of \u201cnon-binary\u201d identity continues, then at some future date, denial could constitute a breach of human rights.\"\r\n\r\nRights are always rights, regardless of 'international trends'. We should be setting an example, not following behind everyone else.",
        "background": "UK passports only offer the choice of male or female, but many UK residents do not identify with either of these. This petition calls on the UK government to offer an 'X' gender marker to indicate indeterminate gender, in the case where someone does not feel comfortable choosing 'M' or 'F'.",
