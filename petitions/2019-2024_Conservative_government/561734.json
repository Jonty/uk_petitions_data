        "additional_details": "Students are all at a different point in their learning. Some students don't have the resources to learn from home which suddenly gives them a disadvantage compared to others. Schools and colleges teach things in different orders meaning cutting the course will only stress and pressurise students to quickly catch up with the content that has not been cut. Students have missed almost 6 months of compulsory learning required for their exams and due to self isolating measures are now missing more.",
        "background": "To cancel the exams in 2021 and predict results the same way as 2020 exams using teacher assessed grades and predicted grades. The majority of students in the south have not been affected by COVID and self isolating where as in the North students have had a bigger impact due to the high numbers.",
