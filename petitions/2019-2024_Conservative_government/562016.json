        "additional_details": "The Hospitality industry has been devasted by the Covid Pandemic. The August Eat Out Campaign was hugely popular with the Hospitility Industry as well as the public. Following the previous lockdown hospitality was largely responsible for the record quarterly increase in GDP from July to September. Restauants continued to be busy throughout September. Moral is now at an all time low. Introducing an annual campaign at the end of January would be a boost for the industry and kickstart Spring",
        "background": "As soon as it is safe, introduce another Eat Out To Help Out Campaign and include other sectors of hospitality devasted by the pandemic such as cinemas, hotel rooms etc. Make this new Eat Out To Help Out an annual event for the last 2 weeks of January as a legacy of Covid.",
