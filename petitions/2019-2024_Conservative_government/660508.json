        "action": "Recognise St. George's Day as a Bank Holiday in England",
        "additional_details": "The patron saint of England, St. George, has symbolised English heritage since the 14th century. St. George\u2019s emblem is our national flag and this recognition would not only honour England's rich history and cultural identity, but also foster unity and pride across the nation. We call on the government to declare St. George\u2019s Day a public holiday, allowing English citizens the opportunity to celebrate our cultural heritage and contribute to a strengthened national identity.",
        "background": "We seek the formal recognition of St. George's Day, April 23rd, as a national bank holiday in England. This action would align England with the other nations within the UK, as St. Andrew's Day in Scotland and St. Patrick's Day in Northern Ireland are both public holidays.",
