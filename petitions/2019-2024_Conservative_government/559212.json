        "additional_details": "Between October and January, people let fireworks off. Even during daylight hours. Bangs and pops go off at all hours.\r\nThe fire service and hospitals are always over run with burns.\r\nAnd the meaning behind them is long forgotten.\r\nBut I guess the government just see the \u00a3's from VAT.\r\nIt's time to do the right thing for people who care about animals and not out for themselves.",
        "background": "Ban the sale of fireworks that bang to the general public.\r\nIt doesn't make then anymore enjoyable and for people with certain disabilities, it makes them jump. \r\nAlso for people with pets, it's unfair. \r\nWe are supposed to be a nation of dog lovers, yet we put them through the turma of fireworks.",
