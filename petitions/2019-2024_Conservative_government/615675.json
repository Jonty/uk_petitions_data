        "additional_details": "My 6 year old son faces not joining 20 family members & friends on a holiday of a lifetime due to the poor service provided by the passport office. I have spent \u00a3200&hours on the phone trying to renew his passport in time just to be constantly let down. I started the process before the 10week deadline & I am still no closer to receiving the passport. Extending the expiry date by 6months would allow my son & others in the same situation to travel whilst the passport office sorts out their issues",
        "background": "Extend the expiry date on UK passports to allow UK citizens to travel abroad this year without disappointment. The passport office has huge delays&inadequate systems which are leaving 1,000s of families out of pocket & unable to travel abroad as planned, despite applying for renewals in enough time",
