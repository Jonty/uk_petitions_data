Allowing businesses to profit from the symbols of atrocity should not be condoned. The amount of pain and harassment that is caused to minority communities is huge and it is mostly ignored. \u00a0\r\nDuring WW2, 10 million people, mainly of Asian descent, were killed under the Rising Sun flag. Nazi Germany and Japan were allies and this flag was flown alongside the Swastika. This emblem is a reminder of Japanese fascism, torture, live experimentation and sexual slavery. Much like the atrocities committed by the Nazis in Europe, the horror of the Imperial Japanese regime was a terrible period that has left scars in the hearts of many.",
        "background": "We want the government to instruct local councils to monitor the advertising materials of businesses to make sure they do not use symbols of fascism and far-right hate for financial gain. For example, the Swastika flag or the Rising Sun flag, the Confederate flag.",
