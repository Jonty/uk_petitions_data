        "additional_details": "There have been many examples where people reported how prayer made a big difference in getting through the previous lockdown.\r\nAlso, please consider that over the last few months churches invested a lot of effort into measures to protect worshipers \u2013 stewards and cleaners, attendance lists, social distancing and much more \u2013 and so they're much safer places than many other, like schools or shops which remain open.\r\nWe understand the lockdown decision wasn't easy to make, but it's still very difficult for us to understand why the current restrictions have to affect our communities. Please reconsider the rules and allow churches and places of worship to open for communal prayer.",
        "background": "Following the latest restrictions due to the pandemic, we'd like to ask the Government to allow communal prayer in churches and places of worship. In these very difficult times the banning of communal worship will have profound consequences on many, as prayer supports our spiritual and mental health",
