        "action": "Change the MOD ruling that classes pets as a possession.",
        "additional_details": "The reason it's so difficult is because the military class pets as a possession so offer no help, financial support or advice. The ruling that pets are a possession is archaic and no longer an excuse. The military provides support for other possessions such as houses and vehicles. Both of which are a choice too. Many people have pets because they cannot have children. They also provide a great emotional relief whilst living overseas, especially if the spouse is on exercise or away from the home.",
        "background": "Many families are hit by extreme stress and have to pay large sums to transport their pets abroad for overseas postings. They are hit with stress again and costs again when they are returning to the UK. Some military families make the hard decision to abandon or give up their pets because of this.",
