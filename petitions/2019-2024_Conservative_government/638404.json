If anyone in front reclines, even in an extra legroom space, that person is bracing on my knees. In both cases, not only am I in pain but I am locked in which could lead to DVT, o have had to walk aisles for hours for relief and blood flow on many flights because of this even though I\u2019ve paid like everyone else (most times paid more). Our complaints go unheard.",

Paying is an inequity as tall people will most need it. \r\nReform airline policy regarding when/how/if/should passengers recline seats. \r\nEducate staff on suffering tall people may face.",
