        "additional_details": "Right now the Child Maintenance Service is the reason for over 50% of children living in poverty.  Not just for a month or a few months but for YEARS!!!! The child maintenance service policy and procedures DO NOT WORK.  It\u2019s a huge miss carriage of justice for these children and their primary careers to live in such destitution for years on end.  The time it takes for the CMS to implement amendments , enforcements, liability orders, bailiff action etc needs to be reduced to weeks NOT YEARS!!!",
        "background": "I want the failings of the child maintenance service to be addressed in House of Commons with the intention to change policy and procedures to be more efficient and effective so children do not go without essential funds for any longer than 3 months!",
