        "additional_details": "Many people in the UK are now struggling to afford essential services. The situation is predicted to worsen towards the autumn, when heating will be most needed. The government is currently benefiting from rising costs as they receive extra revenue from VAT. Reducing costs by 20% by abolishing VAT would go some way to helping reduce costs to consumers for whom this expenditure is a huge part of their household budgets.",
