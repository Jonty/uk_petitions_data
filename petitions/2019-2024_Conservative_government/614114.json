The right to shelter is being denied and we, as members of society, must take action. With 1 in 96 people living in Birmingham being homeless, we need to recognise the numbers are too high. These people are vulnerable with 44% of them having unsupported mental health issues and many having physical health issues. Rough sleepers die 30 years earlier on average - this can not continue.",
        "background": "We want government to fund pop up health clinics to provide the care homeless people have been deprived of for so long and to decrease their incessant physical and mental suffering. The \u00a330 million in NHS Long Term Plan is simply not enough in the current circumstances -more must be done.",
