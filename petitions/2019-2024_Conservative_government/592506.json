        "additional_details": "As of now, the Government has waived the quarantine requirement and one of the two COVID tests for people \"fully vaccinated\" through the NHS. However, this does not extend to people who have received the vaccine abroad - outside the NHS. This is not fair since if someone has already received the vaccine abroad, there is no indication that they can be fully vaccinated again in the UK. It is not known whether doing so is safe or permitted. Hence, such people remain in vaccination limbo.",
        "background": "The Government should recognize people who have received the vaccine abroad - not through the NHS - as fully vaccinated for travel purposes. If it is proven that not all vaccines in other countries are equal, then a list of valid foreign vaccinations should be drafted.",
