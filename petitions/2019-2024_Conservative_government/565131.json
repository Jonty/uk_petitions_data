        "additional_details": "Many sex offenders are released from prison after serving a short amount of time and many go on to repeat the same acts. They are given new places to live and new identities. A sexual assault can ruin a victims life, and some of the sentencing times I have seen span to no more than 10 years, this is not justice. It should also be considered that if a person repeats such crimes, then they should not be released because they can clearly not learn from their actions, therefore are still a threat.",
        "background": "I would like the government to consider the current charges in place for sex offenders, as I feel and many people would agree that the length of them does not give any justice for victims of sexual abuse and assault.",
