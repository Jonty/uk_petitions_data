        "additional_details": "We welcome the financial measures that the councillor of the exchequer announced today (17/03/20), but there was nothing in that set of measures for the self-employed trading in the entertainment or events industry. The entertainment industry heavily relies on the self-employed as the main way for contracting professionals and to secure their valuable skills. There is a very high risk that this outbreak will cause an irreparable damage to an industry worth in excess of \u00a360 billions to the UK economy.",
        "background": "With the spread of Covid-19 the entertainment and events industry has come to a standstill. At present, there are no means for determining the length of this crisis. We ask the government to cancel the July tax payment for those operating as self-employed in this sector.",
