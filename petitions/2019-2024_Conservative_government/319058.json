        "action": "Cancel SATs exams-academic yr 20-21 to allow children to catch up after covid 19",
        "additional_details": "When children finally return to school post lockdown there is likely to be a period of readjustment for many after the extended time at home. It will take time to re-establish routines and learning, and there is already speculation that the return will be staggered or part time to start with. Children will need time to physically and emotionally adjust to all the changes. To add  additional pressure onto the children due to sit their SATs next year is unreasonable and unnecessary.",
        "background": "I'd like the government to consider cancelling SATs exams for children due to sit them in the academic year 20/21. These children are likely to miss an entire term or more of education and their return to school would be better focussed on catching up on content rather than preparing for these exams",
