In this case, we believe that the officers involved failed to uphold this basic principle, and that their actions resulted in the unnecessary loss of life.\r\n\r\nAn independent inquiry should focus on determining whether the use of firearms was necessary and proportionate, and whether there were any alternatives that could have been pursued.\r\n\r\nViewer Caution:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/yZAVsebV5Eg",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, are deeply concerned about the recent incident in which two dogs were fatally shot by police officers using firearms. We believe that this use of force was excessive and unjustified, and we call for an independent inquiry into the matter.",
