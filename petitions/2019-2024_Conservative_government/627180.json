Preference Voting allows you to vote in any which way suits you and still ultimately make your vote count.",
        "background": "UK\u2019s elections are flawed and outdated. In order to install more faith in the election process the UK needs to reform its election process. Implementing a Preference voting system will raise voting turnout and interest in the election process.",
