        "additional_details": "Whilst I acknowledge the importance of STEM being given priority, thousands of young people (at least) both from the UK and abroad have invested time and money in a creative career path and an imperative part of so many creative courses is the practical element and on site teaching. As students, we ask that we are given the same priority as academic courses that also require a practical element to their teaching.",
        "background": "Under the new lockdown, almost all university teaching will be going online, including creative degrees. However, academic courses that have a practical element have been allowed to continue with on site teaching. Meanwhile, creative degrees that require a practical element are forced to go online.",
