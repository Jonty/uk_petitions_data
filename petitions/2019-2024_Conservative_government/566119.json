        "action": "Extend COVID-19 vaccine rollout to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week across the UK.",
        "additional_details": "The effects of the pandemic are crippling, and the vaccination program is the key weapon to avoiding more damage to everyone in society at all levels - health, education, economy, wellbeing. We now have the antidote and with vaccination offered 24/7, the timing of rollout could be halved, based on the currently proposed approx. 12 hours a day basis. Any inconvenience of a night-time appointment is negligible  compared with the alternative.",
        "background": "This government investment in additional resources required to operate extended hours will mean more of the population are vaccinated more quickly, and the NHS will be under less strain, deaths will fall, education will resume and business will recover.",
