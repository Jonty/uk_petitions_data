They are also deliberately misinterpreting the law in chapter 5 of the flushing and stalking out section of the Hunting Act, where they use different pairs of dogs over the course of the hunt. The deaths can be long-drawn-out affairs in which the animals can suffer greatly. There are no repercussions currently for them providing faux excuses, no research or evidence is needed to be provided",
        "background": "The government must amend Schedule 1.9 and the \u2018stalking and flushing out\u2019 exemption of the Hunting Act to protect deer and other wildlife from being hunted using vague unsubstantiated reasons as excuses, and demand that evidence must be provided either pre or post-death of the animal for validity.",
