        "additional_details": "With the greatest volume of traffic ever on UK roads it is important that we reduce the number of people seriously injured or killed on the roads. By introducing this new law these signs could be placed anywhere that mobile traffic cameras currently monitor without the need for a mobile speed camera to follow it. This would help motorists become more conscious of the speed they are travelling at, therefore helping to reduce the number of people seriously injured or killed on the roads.",
        "background": "Before a mobile speed camera becomes visible a sign indicating it\u2019s presence must be visible to motorists travelling in the direction the camera is observing. This would be similar to how stationary speed cameras are currently signed.",
