        "additional_details": "I would like this to change because it shows a divide between the government and the public. There are people everyday struggling to provide food for their families and make ends meet, yet as a country we provide free food to people who don't need it. The government voted against providing free school meals to school children during half term, while staff under this government are using our money to pay for their food. This is simply unacceptable and unfair.",
        "background": "Stop spending tax payers money on free food for parliamentary staff as this is a waste of money which can be used on more pressing matters. As I understand parliamentary staff are given a salary, which they can use to buy food with.",
