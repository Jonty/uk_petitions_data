        "additional_details": "By discussing the problems with being overweight and ignoring issues with being underweight, eating disorders such as bulimia, anorexia, AFRID and orthorexia could be triggered, and cause serious issues including death. Being over- or underweight should not be glamourised, especially not by the government! This problem has worsened during lockdown, cases of eating disorders have increased by 20% in young people, raising awareness about these mental illnesses could save lives and NHS resources.",
        "background": "When studying mental health, talk about all types of mental illness! Most schools focus on sport helping mental health and stopping us from being overweight. Sport and a \"healthy\" diet can make us feel good, but it can also become part of an eating disorder and becoming dangerously underweight.",
