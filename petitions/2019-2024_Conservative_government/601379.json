        "additional_details": "This road has taken too many lives. It is a death trap and the surface is uneven. The vehicles end up in ditches either side of the road.\r\nMy daughter 12 weeks ago was another innocent victim of this road, she is laying in Addenbrooks with life changing injuries. The drivers sadly passed away. This road has always been known for the poor condition and accidents are becoming more frequent. This road requires government attention to change the speed and see about resurfacing the uneven area's that motorists may not see in bad or poor visibility weather.\r\nI am unsure of how many fatalities this road has taken but it has taken too many.\r\nAppreciate the government to review this road as a matter of urgency.",
        "background": "Speed of the road needs to be drastically reduced due to numerous accidents. The road is very uneven and requires attention. Numerous accidents occur and end up fatal. Even a camera to reduce speeding. This road requires maintenance.",
