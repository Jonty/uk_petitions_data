        "additional_details": "We are faced with a generation of children overwhelmingly disadvantaged by the education they have missed during the pandemic. Whilst all pupils will suffer the hardest hit will inevitably be disadvantaged children. If we don\u2019t repeat the 2020/2021 year we are setting up an entire generation to fail and for most pupils this impact will be felt throughout their whole life. Due to these extraordinary times we implore the government to take the unprecedented measures to repeat this academic year.",
        "background": "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic there has been an immeasurable impact on the amount of education either missed or interrupted for those currently in full time education. This is a call for the government to take action and enable all pupils to repeat the 2020/2021 academic year across all year groups",
