        "action": "Exclude children under 12 years of age from the coronavirus rule of 6.",
        "additional_details": "Children of pre school & primary school age are being unfairly disadvantaged. At this early time in their lives play is a vitally important element of their learning. Limiting this to time at school or nursery does not allow them the opportunity to grow outside formal childcare settings. The science indicates that it would safer for 2 households with 2 adults & 2 children to meet than 6 adults from different households. The rule is preventing the least at risk from being able to benefit.",
        "background": "As children under 12 are not thought to transmit the virus between themselves or to adults, the rule appears to be putting undue hardship on important familial & friendship relationships without sufficient scientific support. Scotland & Wales have both excluded children under 11/12 from their rules.",
