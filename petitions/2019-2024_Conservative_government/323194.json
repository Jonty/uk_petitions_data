        "additional_details": "This change in standards could allow chlorinated-chicken meat as well as hormone injected beef (among other things). These lowered standards have shown negative health effects on individuals, which could put further strain on an already stressed NHS.\r\n\r\nThis could ruin the British agricultural market which is prided in this country. Especially post-Brexit and post-COVID, this would have an extremely negative economical impact.",
        "background": "A recent bill passed by the Conservative Government allows the decrease in minimum food standards. This bill is to give room for a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. Many proposed standard changes have shown negative health effects on individuals, further straining an already stressed NHS.",
