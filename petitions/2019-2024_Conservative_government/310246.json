        "additional_details": "If there is no financial support made available, countless small family-run businesses and larger operators will go out of business. Besides facing the prospect of losing their income, they may need to face bankruptcy and legal consequences for reasons completely out of their control. Their supply chains and staff employed will also be affected, resulting in thousands of jobs lost all across the country. Faith in the industry will be lost and recovery post pandemic will be very slow.",
