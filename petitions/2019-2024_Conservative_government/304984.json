        "action": "Allow earlier access to pensions due to Corona Virus to aid those in need.",
        "additional_details": "With many individuals worried about their physical and financial health, early access to pensions from the age of say 50 or 45 could alleviate financial pressures and consequent mental health concerns. By definition, casual debt (Overdrafts, credit cards and short term loans) are typically associated with lower paid / working class / less affluent households which will provide a high level of targeted benefit to those in most need at this critical time.",
        "background": "As a result of the current Corona Virus pandemic I wish Parliament to consider exceptional provisions for a period of say 2 years to allow earlier access to pension funds for individuals without penalties at a lower age than the current 55 year limit, e.g.45/50.",
