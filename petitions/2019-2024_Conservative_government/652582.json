        "additional_details": "The Parthenon is the most significant and sacred of all monuments in Greece and a global cultural symbol. It is now actively preserved, and the state-of-the-art Acropolis Museum is nearby. There is no reason for the UK to retain these sculptures which the Greek government and people fervently wish to be returned. In fact, this obduracy reflects badly on the UK as a progressive, modern and collaborative nation. We should do the right thing and return the sculptures back to the Greek people.",
