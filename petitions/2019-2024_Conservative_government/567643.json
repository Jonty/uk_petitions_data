        "additional_details": "The current rules discriminate against children under 11 years. Adults and those old enough to meet alone can do so. However under 11 years who are not at schools can now not see anyone their own age for at least 6 weeks possible even 3 months. No nursery child or child over 11 years or adult is subjected to the same restrictive policy.",
        "background": "Currently one person can meet one other outside during lockdown. Under 11yr olds are not able to meet another child of their age as they must be accompanied. Please change the law to allow them to meet one other child with a parent. The current rules are detrimental to their mental health.",
