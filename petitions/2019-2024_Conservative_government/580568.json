        "action": "Make British Summer Time year-round",
        "additional_details": "Due to the pandemic, home working is now the norm and there are fewer people outdoors before sunrise. In winter, most of us sleep through precious daylight in the mornings; later, much of the country is plunged into darkness by 4pm. \r\nDaylight is important to mental wellbeing. This change would help many Britons who suffer from seasonal depression due to the long nights. Longer, lighter evenings would also make the streets safer and make people more likely to exercise or visit local businesses.",
        "background": "The current system of moving the clocks back to GMT during winter leads to shorter, darker evenings. This exacerbates seasonal depression, reduces trade in local businesses, and makes our streets more dangerous.\r\nInstead, the Government should keep Britain on British Summer Time (GMT+1) all year.",
