        "action": "Make pelvic examinations available to women alongside their cervical screening.",
        "additional_details": "In March 2021, the DHSC launched the government-led Women\u2019s Health Strategy for England. Respondents wanted the DHSC to prioritise gynaecological conditions as their symptoms were not taken seriously or dismissed. By women being able to access a pelvic examination at the same time as their cervical screening, it will give women the opportunity to have any concerns assessed, preventing unnecessary delays, allowing for a quick, early diagnosis and a forward plan of action.",
        "background": "The examination can detect gynaecological issues such as Fibroids & Endometriosis. The 2 examinations take roughly the same amount of time and therefore, can be conducted at 1 appointment. Too many women are suffering with chronic illnesses which can be detected by a simple pelvic examination.",
