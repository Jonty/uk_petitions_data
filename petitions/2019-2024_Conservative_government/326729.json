        "additional_details": "I wish for this to be undertaken because it is presently been a complete whitewash - and I worry there will be no accountability. We cannot lost hundreds of thousands of lives globally; plus unprecedented disruption and financial loss; without fully understanding - and learning from - the true cause / origin. This cannot be \u201cswept under the carpet\u201d and agreed with China. This needs a coalition of countries committed to finding the truth and not a political \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d deal with China.",
        "background": "Fully support Australia\u2019s appeal for a full and frank investigation as to the origin of the coronavirus, exploring fully: when China really knew about it (and whether that was before the Wuhan Games in August); whether it did, in fact, originate in a laboratory; and how transparent China has been.",
