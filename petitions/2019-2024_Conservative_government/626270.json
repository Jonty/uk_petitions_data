        "additional_details": "Referencing the latest UK Prime Minister as an example and setting aside the factual evidence of her poor performance and failure on delivery of policy for the good of the UK, Liz Truss served just 44 days in office as Prime Minister. In any sensible society or working democracy, such a short period in office prior to resignation cannot reasonably be considered as justification for the application of such an allowance. LT as our latest erstwhile PM should not be entitled to this allowance.",
        "background": "Parliament must change the current rules which entitle any Prime Minister to an annual office allowance of up to \u00a3115,000 after serving as PM, regardless of the period of time they served. Introduce a minimum period of 24 months in office.",
