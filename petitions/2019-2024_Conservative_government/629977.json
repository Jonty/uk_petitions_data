        "additional_details": "This would help those in need the most to save on electricity and also generate future income for the government from selling that excess power back to the grid. This extra excess power would take some strain off the UKs current power grid and make things like blackouts less likely in the future.",
        "background": "Look at a scheme to help fund free solar panels for those in very low income houses e.g. council estates. This will ease the pressure of rising electricity bills for those who need money the most and excess power can be sold back to the grid to raise money for the government's future plans.",
