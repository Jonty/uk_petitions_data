        "additional_details": "The current hysteria and pulling down of monuments, memorials, statues, building and place names is paralleled to the book burning dictatorships of the past and is not part of our British democracy. The removal and destruction of these can never be replaced and to press the \u201cpermanent erase\u201d button on much of our history is unforgivable. It appears many councils are siding with mob justice and these matters should be carefully considered with full public consultation before any are removed.",
