        "action": "Make it illegal for venues to impose COVID-19 restrictions on patrons",
        "additional_details": "Restrictions on entry to hospitality and entertainment venues (including outdoor music festivals) are not imposed with regards to other illnesses and conditions, so COVID-19 should not be treated any differently in this respect.  Such venues should not be legally permitted to discriminate against patrons who are unable to - or choose not to - wear masks, have tests or be vaccinated and it should be the case that venues that do so are subject to heavy fines and/or potential closure.",
        "background": "The UK is justifiably known throughout the world for its vibrant social and cultural scene.  However, the debate surrounding COVID-19 vaccine passports has raised the potential for hospitality and entertainment venues to refuse entry to those who are unvaccinated, which would be unacceptable.",
