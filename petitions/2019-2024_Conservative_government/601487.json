        "additional_details": "Covid19 vaccines are being pushed to everyone and freedoms are being taken away and not one government anywhere will recognise the facts emerging that if someone has recovered from Covid19 previously their own immune system has built up enough antibodies to combat further infection and prevent any spread of the disease,yet evidence suggests vaccinated people are catching and spreading Covid19,some without even knowing because the vaccine has suppressed any symptoms from showing.",
        "background": "Give the option to take an antibody test if you have caught and recovered from Covid19 to show natural immunity instead of vaccine mandates as there is growing evidence a person recovered from Covid19 is far less likely to spread the disease thanks to our own immune system.",
