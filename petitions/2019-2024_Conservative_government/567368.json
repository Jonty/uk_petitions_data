        "additional_details": "If women didn\u2019t have periods, mankind would literally vanish. So, I don\u2019t think we would be asking too much to reduce the cost of feminine products or make them free. By making them free, not only are you helping us with something we can't control, you're also helping those in the poverty line/in debt, as they won't have to spend as much.",
        "background": "Periods are biological, it\u2019s not something we can control and we have no choice in the matter. Why do we have to pay all this money (feminine hygiene products are expensive!) for something we didn\u2019t ask for?",
