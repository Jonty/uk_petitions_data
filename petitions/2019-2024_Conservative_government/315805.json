The extraordinary bravery and courage in the face of this terrible virus has saved thousands of lives. HM The Queen's father, King George VI, gave the honour to the whole Island and it is on their national flag. The George Cross could become part of the NHS logo so that all doctors, nurses and auxiliary staff could wear it on their uniforms in memory of their heroism at this time.",
        "background": "I would like HM Government to ask Parliament to petition HM The Queen and ask her to award the NHS The George Cross. After the worst of the virus is past, this could take place at a ceremony in Buckingham Palace or service at St Paul's Cathedral.",
