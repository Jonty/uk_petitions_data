        "additional_details": "Tattoo studios are some of the cleanest and sterile environments in the UK. Whilst we cannot tattoo 2m away from our customers, the studios are cleaned first thing in the morning, multiple times throughout the day and again before closing.\r\n\r\nGloves are worn to prevent cross contamination, work surfaces are wrapped and covered, tattoo chairs are wrapped and covered, and all equipment is wrapped and covered. Everything is cleaned thoroughly after every customer and PPE can be worn during every procedure to minimise the transition of the virus.\r\n\r\nPeople are struggling to survive without work, so if we can open restaurants, cinemas and other non essential stores that are dirtier than studios, why not open studios too?",
