        "additional_details": "Many students during this period have had little to no contact with their teachers. This has greatly affected their mental health during this time, and many Year 10 and 12 students are now suffering from anxiety from the government's decision to go ahead with these exams. The Ofqual consultation decisions have not taken into consideration the mental health of the GCSE, AS and A-Level students. If the government cared about the mental health of young people enough, they would cancel these exams.",
        "background": "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, GCSE and AS and A-Level students have missed 4 months of in-school teaching as a result of school closures. This leaves many students at a disadvantage in preparation for these exams next summer. I am calling on the Government to cancel  the exams next summer.",
