        "additional_details": "It is an insult to victims, that bail conditions seem almost pointless if the victim cannot report breaches and be confident the perpetrator will be arrested for aggravating an ongoing case. \r\nWhen arresting a perpetrator for breaching bail conditions it should be counted as a concurrent offence but also a new one, this protects victims and helps them feel they are getting some kind of justice.",
        "background": "Currently the 24 hour custody rule is included when arresting for breach of bail conditions.\r\nThis means that if the perpetrator was held for 20 hours when first arrested, police would only be permitted to hold them for a further 4 hours if arrested for breaching their bail conditions.",
