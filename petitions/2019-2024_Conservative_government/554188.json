Parents are devastated to know that they cannot bring their Adult children at home in case their children are COVID - 19 positive, it seems that whole agenda was concocted to get the rent instalment which is the highest at first term. Students who wish to study online from home in current situation should be reimbursed with their Fee and Accommodation charges.",

It is unnecessary financial burden on the students which should be avoided where it is possible. Students are practically hostages at the moment and living far away from their homes.",
