        "additional_details": "IMGs who live in the UK receive little to no support with registration. Those who meet the language requirements are required to pass PLAB 1 and PLAB 2 before they have any prospect of earning an income from their profession. Other countries like Germany are favoured by IMGs as they can practice medicine provisionally once they have met the necessary language requirements, while preparing for their medical exams. This change could increase NHS staff numbers and help fight the Covid-19 crisis.",
        "background": "IMGs who meet the language requirements should be able to practice medicine provisionally on a salaried basis while they are preparing for medical exams. The NHS is understaffed and unprepared for the current Covid-19 crisis. There are many IMGs in the country who could help but are not allowed to.",
