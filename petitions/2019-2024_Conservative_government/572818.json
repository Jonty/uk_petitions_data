        "action": "Send COVID vaccines overseas once UK vulnerable groups are fully vaccinated.",
        "additional_details": "The UK vaccination programme is ahead of other large, wealthy countries and far ahead of less wealthy countries.  This gives us a unique opportunity to show global leadership that will be remembered for many years to come.  This is the right thing to do, but also in our interest both as we find our place in the world and because in a connected world we are not safe until everyone is safe.",
        "background": "Once the 9 priority groups are fully vaccinated, those UK vaccines that can be stored in a refrigerator should be diverted to countries with a GDP/capita in the lowest 50 globally.  The UK could then continue vaccination at a slower pace using the vaccines that require storage at lower temperatures.",
