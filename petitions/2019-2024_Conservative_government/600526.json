        "action": "Scrap GCSE and Alevel exams in 2022",
        "additional_details": "Adaptations to exams have been made, but they are still insufficient to address the loss of learning caused by COVID and self-isolation. Covid's absence has left crucial exam year classes without specialist teachers. Therefore, I urge the government to cancel GCSE and A Level exams and replace them with predicted grades that accurately reflect the genuine performance of students across the country, as the disruption to learning and damage to mental health due to COVID can not be neglected.",
        "background": "Exams would be unfair with so many pupils and staff off for Covid related reasons. Year 13 students have not had a typical academic year since year 10. Ineffective schooling and skill regression have occurred. How much harm is being done to the mental health and wellbeing of this generation?",
