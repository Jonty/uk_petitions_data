        "additional_details": "Carbon Neutral fuels will use standard petrol / diesel pumps, so much less environment damage for it to be viable vs EV chargers.\r\nIt can be made in your own country.\r\nA change to a modern road fuel is more realistic for those on low income.\r\nClassic cars can safely run on Efuel as Porsche has proven.\r\nElectrofuel and biofuels are more sustainable and ethical than making 500kg+ of batteries per electric car, currently 5% recycled.\r\nLiquid fuel is convenient to refuel with better rural driving range.",
        "background": "Parliament should legislate to allow new car and van sales from 2030 on that use cleaner CO2 Neutral fuel.\r\nElectrofuels/Efuels, Bioethanol from sustainable sources and Biomethane (Carbon Negative - made from waste products!), should be included to clean up waste and reduce overall emissions faster.",
