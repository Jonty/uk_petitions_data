        "additional_details": "Recent news reports have shown many of the country's much treasured beauty spots being desecrated by people leaving beer bottles, takeaway wrappers, disposable barbecues and general waste behind.\r\n\r\nThese spaces are slowly being spoilt, and currently there does not appear to be a big enough deterrent as far as fixed penalty notices, fines and prosecution.\r\n\r\nWe should all be able to enjoy outdoor spaces whilst respecting the environment and those who seek to damage it should face harsher penalties.",
        "background": "Help to preserve and protect our beautiful outdoor spaces, National Parks, and beaches by imposing higher fixed penalty fines for those dropping litter, and lighting barbecues on grass/moorland.\r\n\r\nFixed penalty notices should start at \u00a31000 and be issued more readily, frequently and proactively.",
