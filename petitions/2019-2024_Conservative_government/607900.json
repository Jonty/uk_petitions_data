        "action": "Review the legislation surrounding disrepair claims to prevent exploitation",
        "additional_details": "To prevent exploitation of Local Authorities and depriving Local Authority tenants of funding towards repairs and programmed works, I propose that the legislation surrounding Disrepair Claims be reviewed. Similarly to 'crash-for-cash' car insurance claims, caps on legal fees should be put in situ to prevent legal firms capitalising on Housing Revenue Account funds. The Government should instead work with LAs to encourage programs of maintenance to prevent Disrepair and improve stock quality.",
        "background": "The number of Disrepair Claims being filed against Local Authorities is increasing dramatically across the county, with some Councils reported to be spending millions on legal fees. The funds spent on settling claims could instead be invested in improving housing stock for Local Authority tenants.",
