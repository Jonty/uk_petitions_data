        "action": "Maintain Foreign Aid budget spend at current level of 0.7% GDP",
        "additional_details": "The World Bank estimates that the Covid-19 pandemic will push an extra 88-115 million people into extreme poverty this year alone, rolling back years of progress that UK aid has helped contribute to. While there is room for debate about the best way to set aid budgets, there are no grounds for breaking legal commitments or for turning our backs on countries and people at a time of great need (Hickey et al, The Guardian, 2020).",
        "background": "The Treasury is considering temporarily cutting foreign aid to 0.5% GDP, just as extreme poverty is increasing globally as a result of Covid-19.  The Government should maintain its commitment to 0.7%, as stated by the Foreign Office in July 2020 (see https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/300662).",
