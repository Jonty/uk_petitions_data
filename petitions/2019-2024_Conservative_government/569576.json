        "additional_details": "If the vaccines are given 24 hours a day then the categories can be got through quicker (more people will be vaccinated) and we can hopefully put an end to this pandemic\r\n\r\nIf the UK can get enough supply of the vaccines and people are vaccinated 24 hours a day then the people that are going to receive their first dose of the vaccine by the middle of February can receive their second dose sooner meaning they\u2019ll have more immunity sooner than they currently will do",
        "background": "After the Coronavirus Briefing today (11/01/21) when the question was asked if the vaccine could be given 24/7, Matt Hancock said if both the person doing the vaccine and the person receiving the vaccine would prefer for it to be offered 24 hours a day then then they\u2019ll consider it",
