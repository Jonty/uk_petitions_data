        "additional_details": "Hammond, May, and Clarkson have tested the outdated Highway Code on stopping distance as a justification for the impractical 70mph speed limit. They found that most cars have that safe and effective stopping power at 113 mph. 78.9% of Britons surveyed on DriveTube also agree the speed limit's too slow.\r\n\r\nWhat is the point of having a fifth gear on a car? By travelling at 100mph, fuel consumption will be maximised, fewer emission will be emitted & journey times will be shortened!\r\n\r\nWin-win!",
        "background": "70 mph on motorways are too slow. In Germany, they have no speed limits whatsoever on the Autobahn.\r\nThe Highway Code here in the UK states that a car need 240 feet to stop from travelling at 60 mph in order to be considered safe.\r\n\r\nMost cars have that safe and effective stopping power at 113 mph.",
