        "additional_details": "It is a common belief: humans are more than mere physical entities.  We have physical, social, psychological and spiritual needs.  Spiritual needs often surface during crises and, particularly, at end of life; UK and international palliative care guidelines indicate this.  Unmet spiritual needs cause spiritual distress and unnecessary suffering.  Many distressed humans desire to pray; by opening churches for 'lighting candles' and for prayer can greatly ease the burden of isolation and lockdown.",
