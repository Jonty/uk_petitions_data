By stating that Covid-19 vaccination will be mandatory to access nightclubs in England, and by reserving the right to implement this in other sectors, the government has stepped away from democracy and into dictatorship. It is not and will never be correct to remove someone's right to self-determine what medical procedures they undergo, including vaccination.",
