        "additional_details": "People aged 20-29 have recently been the group with the most cases of COVID-19 but are one of the lowest on the list for vaccines. This age group is the most common age group for university students and due to them attempting to carry out their studies by living away in accommodation or travelling to university they are at very high risk of catching the virus so should have priority for a vaccine in order to be able to safely continue their studies and get what they are paying for.",
        "background": "Prioritise University students (and lecturers) for the COVID-19 vaccine so that students can return to university and university accommodation safely. Most university students have had little to no face to face teaching this year but are still paying full tuition so should be a priority.",
