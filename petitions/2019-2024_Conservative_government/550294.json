        "additional_details": "Due to Covid 19 students nationally had to quarantine meaning they were restricted from attending lessons and covering content. Not only have we been set back but we have also been neglected by the government. As a year 12 now a year 13 student in September it has been difficult for me to carry on with my work and cover all the content. On top of that we have more stress of completing UCAS applications, finding the right universities and preparing for exams in May which is extremely near.",
        "background": "We need some support from the government and some empathy. My request, as well as thousands of other a levels students nationally, is to reduce the content for our exams and to forward our exams from May to June at least.\r\nI hope you deeply consider my worries and help us all.",
