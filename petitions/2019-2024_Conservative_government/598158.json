        "additional_details": "Because there are people out there who have ability and driving experience and love to drive be on the road but because of all the test you have to do puts them off to do a hgv licence. I believe if theory was scraped for the people who already hold pcv licence we would not be short of the hgv drivers as the driving test would be the only one test they have to give.",
        "background": "Scrap the theory test for pcv drivers because they hold a pcv licence done theory regarding weight length bridge heights in the u.k Wales. Theory test for pcv drivers and hgv is similar roads signs weight restrictions bridges height all same in u.k as hgv theory questions.",
