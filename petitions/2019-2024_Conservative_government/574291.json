        "action": "The UK should rejoin the EU single market and customs union.",
        "additional_details": "As part of the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) between Ireland and the UK, both governments agreed in 1998 that the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland (NI) should be invisible - no cameras, no border posts. This was easy when both countries were in the EU and people and goods could move freely between the two. After Brexit the Northern Ireland Protocol (NIP) came into effect to avoid checks along the land border between NI and Ireland. The NIP does not work and is jeopardising the GFA.",
        "background": "The Good Friday Agreement (GFA) is under threat from the Northern Ireland Protocol which has proven not to be fit for purpose. In order to protect the GFA, the Government must reapply for membership of the EU single market and customs union, thereby making the Northern Ireland Protocol unnecessary.",
