        "action": "Extend Theory Test Certificates for those whose driving test has been postponed",
        "additional_details": "On average over 400,000 driving tests are taken every 3 months in the UK. Those learners, who have had their test postponed and will see their Theory Test certificate expire will be facing the additional cost and inconvenience of having to re-take their Theory Test due to no fault of their own. This is why we're proposing a 3-month extension of Theory Test Certificates once practical tests resume. This gives learners time to take their practical driving test with a valid Theory Test Certificate.",
        "background": "Practical UK driving tests are currently suspended meaning those who had tests due after 17th March 2020 may need to re-take their Theory Test if their certificate expires. We propose a 3-month extension to the certificate for these candidates from when driving test centres reopen.",
