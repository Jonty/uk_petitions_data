        "additional_details": "Many self employed people have had to close their businesses to aid in slowing the spread of Covid-19. \r\nThe only financial help they have been offered is Universal credit, the maximum monthly allowance (per person) is just over \u00a3250. \r\nEmployment Support Allowance (ESA) has also been offered, however this at least \u00a320 - \u00a340 less per week than SSP. \r\nFor the vast majority of people this is simply not enough to pay their mortgage and provide for their families.",
        "background": "Self employed people are currently only allowed to claim Universal Credit due to loss of income related to Covid-19. They are also not eligible for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP). \r\nI am proposing that the U.K. government include self employed people in the Corona Virus job retention scheme.",
