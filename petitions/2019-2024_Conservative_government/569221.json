        "additional_details": "I want you to lobby the tech companies to do their part - Technology is their area of expertise and they have the resources and money to make a difference. Every day of learning is vital and if a large section of school children miss out because they can\u2019t afford a computer, that cannot be right. Can Apple, Google and other tech firms help bridge the gap and prevent the academic shortcomings of 1.5 million children across the UK. When history is written, will the question be, did they help?",
        "background": "I am proposing tech companies give any old, used, or unused devices to schools. In this time of crisis everyone is doing their bit but the tech companies response to COVID seems weak for businesses of their size/wealth.  How difficult is it for a tech company to give a child a second hand computer?",
