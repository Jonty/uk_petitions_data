        "action": "Increase funding for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) treatment",
        "additional_details": "Borderline Personality Disorder is a serious, debilitating medical condition with serious life-affecting symptoms. Suicide is a particular risk, with up to one in 10 people with BPD committing suicide. Patients need ongoing support to help them manage their symptoms, and assess medication and therapy needs. It is essential that more funding is allocated to services across the UK treating people living with Borderline Personality Disorder.",
        "background": "Mental health services in the UK need more funding to improve treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder patients. Lack of funding has led to a vast difference in available treatment - in some areas patients receive ongoing psychiatric care, and in others they are offered 12 weeks of therapy.",
