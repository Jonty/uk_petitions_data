        "additional_details": "In a time when we are being told things will be tough I feel Parliament should practice what it preaches and lead by example.\r\nWe have a very over inflated House of Lords which is unnecessary and costly as through the lords do not pick up a salary they do claim expenses which at a time when we all have to cut back it\u2019s time for the lords to cut and cap it\u2019s numbers. \r\nThe commons seats can be merged together to cut back which again would give Parliament the opportunity to show it\u2019s cutting back.",
        "background": "I want the government to put into law a reduction and cap on how many members the House of Lords can seat firstly and secondly reduce the number of sitting MPs from 650 to 625-600 members of Parliament. \r\nAnd the cap on the lords should be the same or less than the commons.",
