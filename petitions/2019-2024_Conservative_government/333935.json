I paid \u00a3300 to do this and was given the option of paying and extra \u00a360 (which i had to decline due to funds) so he'd be sleeping when he went into the building, only to find out that i had already paid for this injection in the cost of the euthanasia. Nobody should have to say goodbye to their loyal pet in a carpark and then have them taken away to be put to sleep because of cost",
