        "action": "Make extended childcare arrangements exempt from covid restrictions for under 3s",
        "additional_details": "Parents in the poorest families who can\u2019t afford to pay for a nanny, a nursery place or any other kind of registered care, are being forced to choose between work, staying home with their children or breaking the rules which would incur a fine. This is especially hard for parents with children under 3 who aren\u2019t entitled to any free childcare.\r\nInformal childcare must be made exempt for parents to stay in work and provide for for their children. Not all of us can afford registered childcare.",
        "background": "As tighter restrictions are being bought into place in certain areas of the country, it is becoming illegal again for households to mix indoors or in gardens. This is making it impossible for parents who rely on informal childcare, such as grandparents looking after grandkids, to go to work.",
