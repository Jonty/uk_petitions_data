        "additional_details": "The hospitality industry is the third largest industry in the UK with many jobs at stake. In choosing to not officially close restaurants, bars, hotels and other venues and instead putting the onus on consumers and business owners is both a dangerous and cowardly decision. \r\n\r\nWe are petitioning for the government to take responsibility and formally close venues if that is what is actually required, instead of effectively doing so without taking ownership.",
        "background": "We are calling for support, financial and practical, by the government for both staff and business owners alike.\r\n\r\nA decision from the government because if we choose to close any form of insurance is no longer an option.\r\n\r\nTransparency on timeline so we can prepare logistically for times ahead.",
