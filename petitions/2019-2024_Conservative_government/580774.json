        "additional_details": "It will prevent a third wave that the prime minister has clearly stated that he does not want. The 2 week quarantine period is a good idea and does seem to be working but as other countries around Europe are having a third spike of the virus it is too risky to allow anyone in and out of the country! The borders should be closed completely until the virus has almost gone. With our amazing vaccine programme we do not want to mess it up by letting others potentially spreading the virus into the UK.",
        "background": "I'd like the Government or parliament to close all the borders completely, coming in and out of the country to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, to prevent new variants, and to make sure the chance of a third wave of the virus is next to nothing.",
