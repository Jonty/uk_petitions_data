        "additional_details": "Banning the XL Bully is not the answer. Withint 10 years, there'll be another new breed to ban, then the next 10, then the next 10. Banning breeds isn't answer. Training and education is.\r\n\r\nCOVID saw dog ownership rise exponentially, and due to COVID restrictions dog training wasn't available. COVID brought on 'supply and demand'. People went walking everyday, and wanted dogs to walk with.\r\n\r\nThis would save thousands of dogs and families from being ripped apart and destroyed.",
        "background": "By the government offering state-run training and licensing, they create new jobs for dog trainers and dog handlers, they make revenue from licences and also it stops the wrong people owning the wrong dogs. Also, it weeds out all the bad dog trainers.",
