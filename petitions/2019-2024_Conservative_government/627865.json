        "action": "Make period products free and end period poverty!",
        "additional_details": "Menstrual hygiene is a public health and human rights issue. I and many others believe that everyone should manage their period, especially during the cost of living crisis. No one should miss out on their education or working duties because they cannot afford/access sanitary products. These products are as essential as toilet paper and soap. Scotland's the first country to provide free period products, meanwhile, the number of girls affected by poverty in the UK tripled during the pandemic.",
        "background": "In 2019, the UK government pledged to end period poverty by 2030. There is great demand for sanitary products due to the living crisis but there\u2019s currently no government strategy to tackle this. Call legislators to banish taxes on menstrual products and make them freely accessible",
