        "action": "Ban All Single-Use Plastic Bags in the UK",
        "additional_details": "By banning the single use plastic bag, the UK can send a powerful message that it can be a global environmental leader and inspire other countries to follow our lead. Retailers should offer recycled paper bags for 10p fee or offer reusable bags made out of sustainable materials such as hemp, linen, bamboo, etc. \r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition and once you are done share it with everyone you know who cares about the environment and their future on this planet.",
        "background": "It\u2019s estimated that by the year 2050 there will be more plastic in the oceans than fish. Most single use plastic bags are non-recyclable and will end up in our environment as well as our oceans, polluting and ruining the ocean\u2019s ecosystems. We want the Government to ban all single use plastic bags.",
