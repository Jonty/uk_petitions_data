        "background": "Government should make PCR test free for every one..and why you have to self isolated ten days when coming from no red list country and have to have two PCR test on day 2 and 8 ... but if you pay for an Extra test on day 5 and is negative you don't have to finish your 10 day's of quarantine.",
