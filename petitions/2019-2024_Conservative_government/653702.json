Children aren\u2019t getting the education and support they require from staff with the expertise. Numbers are on the rise as always and this is becoming a crisis for schools, children and their families.",
        "background": "I would like the government/parliament to firstly increase the annual wage of 1:1 assistance and TA\u2019s. All staff are trained to meet diverse needs. More support for families when children can\u2019t attend mainstream. All schools to have an inclusion unit for all ages. Build a new school.",
