        "additional_details": "Food accounts for 26% of greenhouse gas emissions globally. \r\n\r\nLack of easily accessible and understandable information prevents people from making informed choices, and leads to confusion around the environmental impacts of consumer's food choices.\r\n\r\nAn informed consumer, choosing a low carbon product, would encourage systematic change and promote locally grown food.\r\n\r\nEg, importing 1kg of asparagus from Peru produces 11kg of CO2 compared to 2.1kg of CO2 when produced in the UK.",
        "background": "Make it mandatory to display kg CO2 equivalent emissions produced in the manufacturing and shipping of food products on packaging when possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim is to increase awareness of the issue and to help consumers make informed choices.",
