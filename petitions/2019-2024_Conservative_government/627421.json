        "additional_details": "The removal of these protections only makes the UK a more unsafe place for trans people and Sunak has no justification for removing these protections. If these protections are removed, trans people will not be able to access single-sex spaces such as shelters, bathrooms and hospital wards without obtaining a gender recognition certificate, which can be very difficult to do.",
        "background": "Under the Equality Act currently, the law protects all trans people regardless of whether they have a gender recognition certificate affirming their gender and there is no requirement to have undergone medical transition. We would like Rishi Sunak to keep these protections in place for trans people.",

We understand that you are concerned about the possibility of legal rights for trans people being reduced, but the Government has not announced any plans to change the Equality Act, or remove legal protections for trans people.\r\n\r\nIt has been reported that the Government may look to amend the Equality Act to make it clear that sex means biological sex rather than gender, and we could accept a petition calling on the Government to commit not to making this change."
