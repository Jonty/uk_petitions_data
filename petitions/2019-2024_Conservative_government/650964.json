        "additional_details": "Smaller villages such as Rosliston, Coton in the Elms currently have a bus that runs every 2 hours. 2 hours isn\u2019t enough. We need one every hour to help get to places more frequently and help boost the income for places the bus stops at. We have had a petition before suggesting it stayed at 2 hours because no one got on the bus. But I have been using the bus for 5 years and it\u2019s constantly full. It also suggests it runs every 2 hours but at the end of the day it is a 3 hour gap, leaving people constantly stranded.",
