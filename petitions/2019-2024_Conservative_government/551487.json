        "additional_details": "Me and my husband could become homeless as a result of this. I am part of a community called Brighton Girl and Brighton and Hove houses and flats for rent and several others are complaining of the same issue. We are excellent tenants who always pay on time and feel penalised for having pets. There are many people especially in the Sussex area in this position and to feel desperate especially when you have the money to pay the rent but to be penalised because you have pets is horrendous.",
        "background": "There are a limited amount of rental properties available since the pandemic. The majority of landlords and letting agents don\u2019t accept pets. I have rented for 11 years and this is the first time ever landlords have continuously said no to pets. I want all landlords and agencies to consider pets.",
