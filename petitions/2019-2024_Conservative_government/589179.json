        "additional_details": "The Government bodies + committees need to realise the huge impact that COVID had on our education. Home learning wasn\u2019t possible in some cases despite the \u00a3700 million plans to recover education. The \u00a3700million doesn\u2019t help with all the stress the students are going through. 74% of teachers and staff agreed that schools being closed to most students over the period of lockdown has had a negative impact on the mental health of young people. Hence the reduction in content would reduce stress.",
        "background": "The Government + ofqual need to think about the upcoming 2022 Exams. The reason why I call for this reduced content is due to amount we need to cover in order to complete full exams. Students like myself around the country have major gaps in knowledge due to COVID disruptions.",
