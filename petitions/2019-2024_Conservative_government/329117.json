        "action": "Due to the Corona pandemic, postpone the EU Brexit fee status for one year",
        "additional_details": "It is estimated that with these changes in the EU fee status, there will be a drop of 60% in EU applicants. However, this estimate does not take into consideration the pandemic, and how it is already a factor that is encouraging students not to study abroad. Furthermore, many countries have released laws permitting the decrease of salaries, thus making it increasingly difficult for EU students to apply to the UK.",
        "background": "People are struggling as it is during this time of the pandemic. Informing EU students that they have one year to raise up to 6 times the amount they expected to pay while there is a pandemic is absurd. Especially since the pandemic is cutting down various salaries of employees, making it harder.",
