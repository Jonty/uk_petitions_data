        "additional_details": "Unpaid carers work an incredible number of hours, often more than 100 hours a week, with no minimum wage & no employment rights. \r\nIt\u2019s not acceptable that unpaid carers can work these hours with no breaks, no sick leave, no annual leave, with no thought as to their safety, their health, & the safety of the person they are caring for. The Government needs to recognise carers as workers giving them rest periods & leave as other workers are entitled to and pay them accordingly for the work they do",
        "background": "Unpaid carers need to be recognised as workers. They should be paid & given employment rights as other workers are. Being an unpaid carer is a job with many having to sacrifice their career to care for a relative. They are skilled workers, they should be recognised as such rather than exploited.",
