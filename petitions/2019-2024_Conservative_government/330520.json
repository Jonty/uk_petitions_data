        "additional_details": "Without funding there are warnings that 70% of theatres will run out of money by the end of this year. The Nuffield in Southampton have already gone bust along with others. Sonia Friedman who is a West End producer said performing arts face \"the real possibility of complete obliteration\" without substantial government support. The Scottish government have announced a \u00a310 million fund to support performing arts venues. We need to show the same support for our performing arts venues.",
        "background": "Help to fund and bring forward the re-opening of theatres. Theatre is a place to be celebrated. It brings joy to so many people's lives. I grew up watching and performing in theatres and I think it would be a huge loss if this art wasn't able to continue due to lack of support.",
