        "additional_details": "Every day we have dealt with suspected and confirmed cases of covid-19, we are the forgotten services that would benefit from the vaccination. Yes the NHS are doing an amazing job,but not all NHS workers save lives, some have the luxury to work from home and haven\u2019t set foot inside a hospital, but because they work for the NHS they are eligible to receive the vaccination. The prison service, courts, firefighters etc would never refuse to help anyone if they were tested positive to covid. This vaccination would/could give us some protection in an already stressful and sometimes volatile environment",
