        "additional_details": "Mocks are produced individually by schools therefore there is no standardisation. Some schools may do hard mocks others may do easy mocks, depending on whether they want to encourage students or give them a kick up the arse. There is no formal data of mock results and teachers could easily change pupils mocks now to make them higher. Many students also don\u2019t work hard for their mocks as they\u2019re \u2018mocks\u2019 and not supposed to be the real thing, if they were they wouldn\u2019t be mocks.",
        "background": "Remove the choice of using mock results as an appeal system for A Levels and use data in grades given by teachers. Teacher grades are produced by teachers who know how the student learns and their previous work, this is fairer than mocks which many students don\u2019t revise for.",
