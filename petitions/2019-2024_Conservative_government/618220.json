        "action": "Stop energy companies forcing people to pay direct debit pcm for energy bills.",
        "additional_details": "Energy companies are forcing direct debits to intimidate the consumers by high price increases knowing people can\u2019t easily object. The energy companies have no direct route for consumers to complain, ie. British Gas gives no telephone number, no e mail and its chat service or call back is via South Africa cheap labour representatives who have no knowledge or solutions. Brit Gas told me they couldn\u2019t do anything to help. The gov must stop them forcing Debit charges and explain bills clearly.",
        "background": "We want the goverment to stop energy companies from forcing consumers into monthly direct debit payments. Which are kept in the energy companies accounts making millions of pounds interest daily. This money is benefitting shareholders and used to run business. It drains consumers pockets.",
