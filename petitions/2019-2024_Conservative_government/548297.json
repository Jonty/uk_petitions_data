        "action": "End the weighing of children in Primary and Secondary schools after Lockdown",
        "additional_details": "We want this occurrence to be prevented as it can be extremely detrimental to a student\u2019s mental health, which should be the most important factor when bringing in new rules to a school\u2019s environment. Another issue which may be caused is a relapse or increase in eating disorders, as students may grow to become self conscious about their weight and may compare themselves to other pupils, which will create an unhealthy learning environment.",
        "background": "We want the Government and Parliament to no longer endorse the idea of weighing primary and secondary school students after the end of the Corona Virus Lockdown, which has recently been brought to the attention of the media and has rightfully received backlash.",
