        "additional_details": "COVID 19 is not going away. The only sensible solution to this is to keep a track of it. Keeping the sites open provides vital data about COVID spikes that are occurring up and down the country. \r\nThe general public will be reluctant to purchase tests due to the financial crisis that citizens of this country are facing. With people not being test the situation in this country could get worse.",
        "background": "With COVID 19 on the increase and in order to keep up with how many people are getting infected by this virus the government should keep the test sites open. I would suggest one in each town and two in cities in UK.. I would also suggest that the sites should be run by DHSC to save money.",
