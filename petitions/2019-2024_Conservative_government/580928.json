        "additional_details": "We would like the government to allow the use of Shisha outdoors with disposable pipes. Not only is this having a detrimental impact on our business, staff and the community but also the people who depend on smoking Shisha. I believe that smoking Shisha outdoors can affectively be managed adhering to the government guidelines just like drinking and eating food. The rising number of mental health cases are a concern for us as a nation, community and businesses.",
        "background": "The Government have announced as of 12 April 2021 outdoor attractions will be open, this will include venues being able to provide food, beverages and also allow people to smoke cigarettes outside. I would like the government to allow the use of Shisha outdoors with disposable pipes to avoid sharing",
