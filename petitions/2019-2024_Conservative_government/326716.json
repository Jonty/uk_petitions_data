        "additional_details": "It is imperative for this country to protect its cultural features so as to ensure that we have a legacy for the future. Our disgraceful imperial past must be confronted, not in the form of emotional and retrograde thinking but in the form of education and historical context. \r\nThe rule of law and the future of our democratic institutions rests upon this moment. Parliament must reject the advances of a noisy minority and should wield authority on behalf of the outright majority.",
        "background": "Ensure the protection of all British cultural landmarks and determine their future by way of a democratic Parliamentary decision. Instead of allowing mob rule to prevail over the rule of law, a national consensus must be reached in order to decide upon the future of Britain's past and future.",
