The ICB is cutting corners & also not giving people what life they have left, to be able to live normally & go out what ever day of the week & do things that none disabled people do. This is Not Happening in community care. Healthcare has not changed really in over 33 years. Family members should not have to deal with their loved ones healthcare specially when they are Eligible for CHC funds",

ICB have legal duties to do their job correctly & 34 years of healthcare & it\u2019s still not correct",

If you are unhappy with health provisions in your area you could contact your local ICB: https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/find-your-local-integrated-care-board/\r\n\r\nYou could also raise your concerns with your local MP.
