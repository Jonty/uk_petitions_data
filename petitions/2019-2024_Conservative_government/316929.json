        "additional_details": "It would be a great move to re-open household waste centres. Stop the bin men having to go out and collect waste. Allow the public to (within rules and reason) attend the centres to dispose of their waste. If a fish and chip shop (not essential) can be open still, which there are 3 of in my town still open, why can we not keep control of the waste? Take bin men off the streets and re open waste centres.",
        "background": "A rising issue with this is the household waste centres closing. Bin men are at greater risk collecting rubbish from houses than we are going to the local \"tip\". The issue at hand is that the health risk rises by stopping tips being open, due to peoples waste building up.",
