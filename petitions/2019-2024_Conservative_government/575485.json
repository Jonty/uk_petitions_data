The government prioritised\r\nother industries (e.g. takeaways) and population demographics (e.g. currently vulnerable), preventing us from living fit & healthy lives and increasing a future vulnerable population. Our sport is desperately needed NOW to avoid a long term crisis of the physical & mental well being of our children & adults. And the timing is right now to get it started again.",
