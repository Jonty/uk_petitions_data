I live with my husband who has the lung condition Broniecess and has shielded since the beginning of the pandemic, I consider myself his unpaid carer and feel he is at greater risk of covid the longer I have to wait to be vaccinated, which also puts myself at risk of not being able to look after him, to add to this his son who is a key worker is currently living with us, his younger son who is 26 and lives elsewhere was born with asthma and carries an EpiPen, has not been put on the shielding list.",
