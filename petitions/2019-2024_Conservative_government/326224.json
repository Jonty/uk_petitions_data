        "additional_details": "Covid-19 has highlighted the need for good hand hygiene for both our own health and for that of our communities. It's nonsensical to have to wash your hands and then touch door handles etc afterwards, especially in high throughput areas. Install doors which can be pushed open to exit, hands free.",
        "background": "Switch the way in which push/pull doors are used in public buildings. Instead of pushing doors to enter toilet facilities and pulling on a shared use handle to exit, switch it round so you can pull to enter, wash your hands thoroughly and not risk re-contaminating your hands to get back out.",
