        "additional_details": "My 3 year old daughter swallowed 28 magnetic beads in a freak accident in March 2021. She was rushed to Great Ormond Street Hospital where she spent 10 days and had to have emergency bowel surgery to remove them. She is not alone. Many children and families have been affected by these magnets, those surviving all needing highly complex surgery of which the effects are potentially life altering.",
        "background": "We are calling for the Government to ban in their entirety, these highly dangerous and life threatening magnetic beads that are sold as toys or stress busters but provide zero recreational or educational benefit but pose maximum risk to the health of both children and adults if swallowed.",
