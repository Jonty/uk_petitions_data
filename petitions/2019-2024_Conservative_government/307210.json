        "action": "Include Self Employed in Governments 80% income guarantee for COVID-19 crisis",
        "additional_details": "It's simply not fair to segregate employees from the self employed. Self employed individuals are not a burden on the economy. They, too, pay taxes, often in advance, pay national insurance, VAT and provide services that allow others to work to support their families. For example cleaners, driving instructors, carers, councillors and many trades people. Excluding them from the same support that employees and small businesses are being offered is victimisation during the COVID-19 crisis.",
        "background": "The Government are doing a great service to Businesses and Employees but, as yet, have not put the self employed on an equal footing. The self employed pay taxes, NI and provide vital services to others to contribute toward the overall economy. They, too, should qualify for the 80% income guarantee.",
