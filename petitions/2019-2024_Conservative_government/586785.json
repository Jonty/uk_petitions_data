        "additional_details": "Rates of suicide and self-harm have grown exponentially in the last 15 months due to social isolation and COVID restrictions. At the moment patients are being forced to wait long periods of time or approach private services to receive treatment. There is a rising tide of mental health issues that are bubbling under the surface and will cause a significant drain on the already overstretched services if the Government doesn't support this petition.",
        "background": "The Government needs to increase spending in Mental Health services to increase and improve resources to treat patients in a timely manner. It also means that they can hire staff to represent a variety of backgrounds, demographics and orientations to provide holistic care in a timely manner.",
