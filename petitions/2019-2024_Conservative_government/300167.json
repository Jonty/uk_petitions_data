        "additional_details": "It is within the right of Parliament to withdraw devolved powers to the London Mayor and the Greater London Authority (GLA) so that the most important tasks of these offices can be held with greater accountability. The Mayoralty and the GLA are an expensive and superfluous layer of government that provides little value for taxpayers. The GLA introduced a 9% increase in taxes in 2019, without any discernible improvement in any key areas, such as transport, housing and crime.",
        "background": "Have the powers devolved to the Mayor & Greater London Authority abolished with their functions assumed by a mix of: a Cabinet minister responsible for London, local authorities, other central government departments, and a professional board of appointed to manage TfL and the police",
