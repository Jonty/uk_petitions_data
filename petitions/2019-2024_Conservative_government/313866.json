This will improve their morale and encourage them to do extra work if their colleagues go off sick.",
        "background": "All NHS workers should have tax free pay for the months they fight COVID-19. They should get full pay in their pocket as an appreciation for their service in these testing times. On one hand this will improve the morale and on the other, encourage staff to fill in the gaps in the rotas.",
