However due to teacher strikes caused by the governments inability to resolve the issues lecturer\u2019s face at work, the students miss out on key content and teaching. This means that they are having to pay for less than half of the education they should be receiving, leaving them struggling to pass their courses and having to teach themselves. This is not what going to university should be.",

The government must either resolve this issue with the university\u2019s or compensate the students affected by the situation caused",
