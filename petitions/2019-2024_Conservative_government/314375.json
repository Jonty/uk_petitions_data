        "additional_details": "In these times it is clear we desperately need more nurses to staff our hospitals and to treat patients in the community. Yet nursing bursaries have been scrapped meaning nursing students finish university with a large debt which discourages many from joining the profession. Nursing students contribute to the workforce by undertaking some nursing tasks such as performing observations on a patient or an ECG, they should be recognised as a valuable asset and not have to pay tuition fees.",
