        "additional_details": "By making mental health services more accessible, I believe that the UK would hugely benefit in terms of economic productivity and quality of life. I understand that mental illness is becoming more prevalent and recognised, especially regarding the COVID-19 outbreak, and I think that the values of the NHS should reflect this. I think that more needs to be done when it comes to the system in place.",
        "background": "I believe that mental health is not entirely recognised or understood by the Government. The current system, in my eyes, is poor. An individual is placed on an indefinite waiting list to speak to a professional, yet the nature of these problems often requires urgent attention.",
