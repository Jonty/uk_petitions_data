        "action": "Immediate closure of UK Universities to reduce the risk of coronavirus spread",
        "additional_details": "To limit the spread of coronavirus amongst UK university students, which will then spread amongst their families, thus putting the students lives and their families at risk. As disruptive this measure is, it will save lives and reduce the spread of the coronavirus in the community.\r\nOnline teaching and online exams can be applied for the time being in these circumstances. This is a proactive measure to reduce the spread of the coronavirus rather than a reactive measure when it is too late",
        "background": "Close UK universities especially in London, revert to online teaching and online exams for the time being. Many students use crowded public transportation, especially the overcrowded tube trains in London thus risk being infected with the coronavirus & spreading it to their families unintentionally",
