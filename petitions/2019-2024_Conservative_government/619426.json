This, as you can see, is not fair because for the last 100 years women have been working very hard through the Suffragettes movement in the early 1900s, just to be treated equally and are still not in 2022. We have heard stories where women have been fired for wanting equal pay, which shouldn't be happening. *statistics-https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/uk-gender-pay-gap-women-paid-90p-for-1-earned-by-men",

You can find out more about this here: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/gender-pay-gap-reporting.\r\n\r\nYou could have a petition calling for gender pay gap reporting rules to be changed, so more employers are required to publish their gender pay gap, if that is something you'd like to see happen."
