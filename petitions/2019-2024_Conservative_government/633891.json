        "additional_details": "Uncontrolled fast fashion only accelerates climate disaster. \r\n\r\nVast volumes of water are used in cotton production and dyeing, and water use is unregulated in many areas due to scarcity, and more to come due to global warming. Vast amounts of textiles are landfilled or burned as brands destroy stock considered \u201cout of season\u201d. \r\n\r\nSynthetic fibres are made from processed fossil fuels, and clothing treatments including domestic washing releases microplastics into the water systems and oceans.",
        "background": "Primark has just announced the brutal expansion of its already huge store in Westfield Stratford in early 2024, doubling its size from 45,100sq to 81,000sq. Bigger than the West Ham London Stadium.\u00a0 The fashion industry as a whole is a big polluter and continues fuelling UK's throwaway culture.",
