        "additional_details": "50% of mental health problems develop before the age of 14 and 75% develop before the age of 18. But studies have shown that these young people do not get the help they need. More than 380,000 children were referred to CAMHS in 2017, but less than a third received treatment within a year. Around 75% of adolescents experiencing mental health problems were forced to wait so long that their condition got worse or they were unable to access any treatment at all.",
        "background": "I want the Government to take this issue more seriously. We need more funding dedicated to helping young people and children get the help they need with the NHS.",
