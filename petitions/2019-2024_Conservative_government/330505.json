        "additional_details": "In 2018-19 the Government spent \u00a328.8bn on the criminal justice system. This is more than we spend on primary education, the environment or social care. 750 youth centres have closed since 2012 according to Unite, leading to a loss of 4,500 workers. Black people are 9.7 times more likely to be stopped and searched according to official figures. In 2017-18 the police used force 62,000 times, more than a third of those incidents involved Black people, according to the London Datastore.",
        "background": "For many, 'Defund the Police' can come across as radical. However, taking a look beyond the surface shows a promising initiative that could transform the UK for the better. The police are used for all manner of problems, even ones that would benefit from more specialised assistance.",
