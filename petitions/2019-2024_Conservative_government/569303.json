        "additional_details": "The government needs to take urgent action and give students full clarity in receiving qualifications that will heavily affect the rest of their lives. Students have been left in the dark for too long, negatively affecting their mental health and giving them additional stress/pressure on top of studying. Students deserve the freedom to pick what's best for them in this unprecedented situation, instead of having their futures damaged due to circumstances out of their control.",
        "background": "Students due to take exams this year have suffered much disruption. Students should be given the option to be given their predicted grades or if they feel they can achieve better, to sit remote exams. No exams should be held in school, as this defeats the purpose of cancelling exams altogether.",
