        "additional_details": "Avenue road is a busy fast moving road, with the fire station, town hall, police station and car parks adjacent to it. It\u2019s also the main route around the town so traffic is steady and main lorries trucks are sent along it. For the safety of families and children crossing in and out of school hours we believe a zebra crossing would reduce the danger of a collision happening, keeping our children safe  - Pennington and Brockenhurst school both have zebra crossings.",
