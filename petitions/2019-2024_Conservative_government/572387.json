        "additional_details": "The COVID-19 Pandemic resulted in millions of job losses through no fault of the peoples'. Companies closed down. Some can't work due to school closures and no childcare. Some can't work due to shielding/self-isolating for themselves/for vulnerable people around them. My job closed in April and for months afterwards I couldn't work as I live with my 75-year-old, vulnerable, grandmother. The government's response to the situation has been atrocious. Don't punish us for something we can't control.",
        "background": "Realise that those on benefits lost our jobs due to circumstances out of our control. Realise the many reasons that people can't work right now; the main one being we are in the midst of a pandemic. Do not lower the Universal Credit payments and offer more support to those struggling financially.",
