        "additional_details": "The Crime Statistics for England and Wales reports that 7.6% of domestic abuse impacts women (1.6 million) for 2019 yet for men is 3.8% (786,000) for the same period, yet there are only 4 centers showing on Google maps thru out the entire UK that support men, vs 17 centers for women just between Wolverhampton to Birmingham alone, there is a gap and failure that needs filling, statistically the samaritans reports men are 3 times more likely to commit suicide, a statistic shared thru out the world",
        "background": "This is not a petition to alter funding for female centers, but rather to bridge the gap in available support for men. the CSEW reported that by march 2019, men suffer domestic abuse half as much as women, yet the number of support centers do not reflect the statistics",
