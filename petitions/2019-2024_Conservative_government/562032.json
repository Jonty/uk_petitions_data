Women can't choose to not have periods, therefore, help and products to help them should not be charged. It is unfair they must have an extra mandatory payment in their life, to exist more 'comfortably' solely because they are women. Period products are not a luxury, they should be seen as a living need, so provided for free. So nobody goes without access.",
