        "additional_details": "Langstone is a picturesque waterfront village, keen to retain heritage & have flood defences.\r\nIn building a wall around a waterfront pub, there is risk that a beautiful old Pub could lose trade.\r\nA wooden boardwalk is also proposed over a flag stoned path, this would be totally out of keeping with the environment, have short life span due to sea damage, and be dangerously slippery.\r\nHelp stop a wall around the Pub, stop a wooden path & ensure West Langstone is also defended with a flood plan.",
        "background": "We would like Government to request that Havant Borough Council via its subsidiary ESCP, do not build a flood wall around the Royal Oak, and instead look at alternative viable proposals that have been suggested.",
