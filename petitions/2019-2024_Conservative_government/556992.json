        "additional_details": "First Past the Post is an archaic system, one that creates minority governments ruling a majority and in a modern democracy this is not acceptable.  Under the current FPTP system smaller parties have no voice; the seats a party gets do not reflect the number of votes.  PR would give greater voter choice, would make every vote count, instead of wasting millions of votes, and ensure that everyone in the UK had their voice say.  PR is more democratic than FPTP",
        "background": "Proportional Representation would mean that the number of seats matches the number of votes, and creates greater voter choice, and gives a voice to more parties. In a modern democracy PR is far more representative of the people than First Past the Post.",
