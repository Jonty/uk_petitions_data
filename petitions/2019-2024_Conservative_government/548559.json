        "action": "Reverse unfair A level and GCSE downgrading by honouring centre assessed grades",
        "additional_details": "Grades should not be downgraded based on the capabilities of a 10 - 11 year old where there is clear evidence from schools of exceeding predictions. \r\nHigh performing students in lower performing schools will also be adversely impacted by the downgrading system. \r\n\r\nThe triple lock offer is inadequate. Mocks are taken and marked inconsistently across institutions. \r\n\r\nLikewise the option to resist after 6 plus months of no education is not a fair alternative. \r\n\r\nStop the glaring inequalities.",
        "background": "The system for downgrading 2020 exam results in England is inaccurate and unfair. The data suggests disadvantaged students are and will be disproportionately impacted as well as those at GCSE level who have made significant achievements in exceeding predicted grades based on primary education.",
