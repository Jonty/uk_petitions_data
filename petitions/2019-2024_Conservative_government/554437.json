        "additional_details": "It is essential that we enter a temporary lockdown before cases rise far more. If we continue this way we will see thousands more cases and should we enter a lockdown in the later future the economic impact will be far worse than if we act now. The clear picture unfortunately is that far too many people in the UK are not acting responsibly and unfortunately the NHS is going to be completely overhwhelmed as a result with other vital health services being put at risk of significant delay.",
        "background": "The incerease in cases is extremely concerning and the new tier system is simply not enough to curb the spread of this DEADLY virus. The government should act decisively and put the welfare of people first above all. We should enter a temporary lockdown to get covid cases down to a managable level.",
