        "action": "Cancel all BTEC exams in January 2021 for year 11 and 13 students.",
        "additional_details": "As a BTEC level 3 student I know I don't have a fair opportunity to reach the grades predicted in these exams due to the lack of face-to-face teaching in school this year.  Not all the exam conductions are equal, for example GCSE and A-level exams in summer are cancelled yet BTEC exams are suspected to still continue. Furthermore, not all students had equal learning opportunities over lockdown if they didn't have access to a computer/learning materials or had to isolate on multiple occasions.",
        "background": "With GCSE and A-Level exams being cancelled in the summer, giving BTEC students the equal opportunity and a fair chance at achieving their target grades would relieve stress for teachers and students.  A combination of coursework and teacher assessment is more appropriate and fair.",
