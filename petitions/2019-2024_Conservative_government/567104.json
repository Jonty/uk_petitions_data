But they\u2019re being put in a difficult situations, and this is causing added stress. Raise the salary. Just because they don\u2019t have time out of the class to plan and attend meetings after school they however still perform the same as teachers-marking, assessing covering & most times robbed of just how much they do.\r\nCovid has taught us that schools would be closed without them.",
        "background": "TA\u2019s filled the gaps during the 1st lockdown. It was a crisis and they stepped up. Often teachers were working at home but the TAs were still in schools keeping schools running. \u201cNow they\u2019re being asked to step up again and do a teacher\u2019s job \u2013 yet on a TA\u2019s pay. It\u2019s shocking.",
