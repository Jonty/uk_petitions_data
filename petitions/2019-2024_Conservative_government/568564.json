I also feel as though this is vital since there are many families who have half living in England and half living in a European country who can no-longer meet due to brexit meaning that many families will not be able to live together for more than 90 days",
        "background": "I would like to be able to have freedom of movement exactly like before brexit or something similar since me and many others feel as though our rights have been taken from us. I would like to be able to go and work / study and live in our neighbouring countries such as France",
