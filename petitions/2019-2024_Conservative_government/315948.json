        "additional_details": "The government bailed UK banks out using taxpayers money in the financial crisis of 2008. The banks should be more flexible in terms of their required criteria - especially when there is little risk as the government guarantees 80%. When applications have been successful, they have been hit with high interest rates, above the current UK interest rate. As taxpayers, we bailed the likes of Natwest and RBS during the crash. In our time of need, the banks are refusing us and are not stepping up.",
        "background": "The CBILS scheme was setup to support small to medium size businesses in the UK who have been affected by the COVID-19 crisis. \r\nThe banks have imposed criteria that is near impossible to meet resulting in only 1.4% of applications (at time of creating this petition)  to be granted.",
