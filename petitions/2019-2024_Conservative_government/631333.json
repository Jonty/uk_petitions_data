We also need to change the law so lawyers can't challenge illegal immigrant deportation using the Modern Slavery Act. NOBODY has a problem with GENUINE refugees. Most illegals are healthy young single men from safe countries. If their situations were so dangerous they'd bring their wives & children but they don't!

However, we are still signatories to the 1951 Geneva Convention on Refugees & it is grossly open to abuse by lawyers. We need to withdraw from it.",
