        "action": "Prevent EVERY Business From Failure During The Coronavirus Pandemic",
        "additional_details": "I want the Government to implement speedy measures to support British Businesses. Despite the Chancellors commitment to back bank loans with 80% Government/Public money, the banks still retain a risk adverse approach where they seek to secure against assets. For many British Businesses, there is no assets or retained reserves to secure against. I am petitioning to the Government to issue urgent cashflow bonds to those businesses who are at risk of rapid failure, with repayments frozen for 1 years and recouped through a local government business rates levy, payable in installments over 5 years (60 months)",
        "background": "Although in the early stages of an inevitable \"lockdown\" throughout the UK, small, medium and large businesses are already beginning to suffer. These businesses are the lifeblood of our economy and the catalyst for growth once the Coronavirus pandemic is over. It is time to save British Business.",
