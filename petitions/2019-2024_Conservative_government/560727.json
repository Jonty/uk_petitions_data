I pay \u00a3310 road tax a year followed by a further \u00a31231 car insurance why can\u2019t there be a charge for these bicycles also a set fee so they can ride on the roads myself and a lot of other people don\u2019t agree they can ride our roads free of charge!!! road tax was for repairs to roads for car users bikes are definitely taking over our roads and causing more accidents",

Vehicle excise duty needs to be paid in respect of certain vehicles, and there is also an HGV Road User Levy for vehicles weighing 12 tonnes or over, but these are taxes on motor vehicles, rather than road use.\r\n\r\nIf you want cyclists to be required to pay vehicle excise duty we could accept a petition requesting this.\r\n\r\nWe have already published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nRequire all cyclists to have third party liability insurance: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/553542\r\n\r\nEnsure all bicycles and cyclists are registered, traceable and insured: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/553916\r\n\r\nWe also couldn't accept a petition that contained unsubstantiated statements about cyclists causing more accidens on the roads."
