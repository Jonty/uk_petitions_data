        "action": "Stop putting the clocks back so that it is dark at 4pm.",
        "additional_details": "During the Winter months and with the diminishing light, those with mental health issues suffer more than ever. So adding an extra hour of darkness at the end of the day only exacerbates the situation. It is also scientifically proven that a lack of daylight promotes anxiety, depression, and SAD to name but a few side effects of light deficiency. It also puts our young people at more risk as many walk home alone through dimly lit areas after school, or after attending after school  activities.",
        "background": "Stop the changing of the clocks twice a year. When the clocks are changed in October/November it means that it is dark at 4pm. There is absolutely no good reason for this action to be taken twice a year. It is a pointless activity that disrupts the whole countries sleep patterns.",
