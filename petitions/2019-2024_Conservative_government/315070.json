        "additional_details": "I fall into this category - I started self-employment in May 2019, so I do not meet the requirements. I am fortunate that my work hasn't dried up, but there are thousands of others less fortunate. My bills are around \u00a31,000 a month, no 'rent holiday', no wages covered, nothing. This is the most vulnerable category of all, and with people falling into financial turmoil, I ask - where is the assistance? Even with SSP, I'd receive \u00a395 a week - I'd be homeless in a month! Something needs to be done.",

Those who are recently self-employed are the most vulnerable of all, yet they are receiving nothing. Come up with a financial plan for these people, as \u00a395 a week won't buy anything!",
