        "additional_details": "This is a very serious matter. Football clubs are an integral part of local communities, and without the magic of the FA Cup, some of them might not survive. Please discuss this in Parliament, because the beautiful game is like the Arkenstone- it unites us all, regardless of who we are.",
        "background": "The FA Cup has been magical since the first ever inauguration of the tournament. It is what keeps some non league and lower league clubs alive financially and the scrapping of replays destroys this. Some clubs rely on that profit so much, and it\u2019s so unfair that they\u2019re being robbed of it.",
