        "additional_details": "Mr. Johnson stated himself that schools are safe (despite no social distancing measures in place)  and that the real risk to kids/young children is very very low. \r\n\r\nTherefore we feel it would be beneficial for children to be able to attend their dance lessons where social distancing measures have been in place since July last year and numbers limited to 15.  Physical activities are proven invaluable to the immune system and are proven to promote both mental and physical health in youngsters",
        "background": "Following boris Johnson s interview on Sunday 3rd January 2021 on the BBCs The Andrew Marr Show we would like the governement to reconsider the decision to keep dance schools shut to children who are allowed to attend school.",
