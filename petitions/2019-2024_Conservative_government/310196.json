        "additional_details": "NHS staff are putting their lives at risk and returning to their vehicles after long shifts to find they have been ticketed. Individuals are still receiving intimidating letters and court summons in the post, causing undue stress in these uncertain times. Many people have been made redundant or had hours cut, the last thing they need is a county court judgement over a parking fine. Also, if private car parks were forced to drop all parking charges it may relieve some stress from public transport",
        "background": "All private parking company operations should be halted immediately. The \"services\" they offer can surely not be deemed essential in these times. They should not be allowed to ticket any vehicles or pursue existing tickets.",
