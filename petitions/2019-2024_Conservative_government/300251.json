        "additional_details": "Vending machines do not accept the pence, neither laundry machines, nor toll booths, nor parking meters, or anything else because the pence is not worth the time to count, sort or transport them. The difficulty to spend the pence is the reason why they end up in jars, dead to the economy, after a short, useless life after failing in it's only job. They are a literally \"dead weight\" to society. \r\nHistory is repeating itself as it did in 1984 with the half-penny, it is time to phase out the coins.",
        "background": "I am coming to you with an appeal to approach parliament with the motion to remove the 1p and 2p coins from circulation as has been done in other countries. They are a drain on the economy and fail to perform their primary function which is to facilitate the exchange of goods and services.",
