        "additional_details": "People have become more reliant on food banks as they continue to suffer. It has caused catastrophe to many businesses and caused strikes amongst most key workers. In December 2022 the inflation rate was 10.5%, this was after it had reached 11.1% in October. It is still projected to increase further. The national living wage increased from \u00a39.50 to \u00a310.42, an increase of 92 pence. Even with this increase people are still unable to afford to turn their heating and feed their families.",
        "background": "Many families across the UK are struggling to buy the basic necessities, such as a loaf of bread or a tin of beans. The cost of living crisis is having an impact on mental health, with the increased cost in food and electricity leaving people feeling stressed.",
