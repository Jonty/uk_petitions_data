        "additional_details": "Recently, countries like the V4 states have decided to close down their borders to slow down the spread of the pandemic. This is proved to be somewhat effective, since there is a small number of increase of the given cases unlike in the Western European nations. There were 72 confirmed cases in the country, unlike in Italy where there were 27,980 cases. The Chinese cases recently proved that people can get re-infected even though they recovered from the virus. Due to the word count limitations I can't include more references. If is possible I would be more than happy to include more references.",

The government must consider closing down borders, institutions and factories which are not producing food for the general population. This can reduce the spread of the pandemic.",
