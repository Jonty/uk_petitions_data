        "additional_details": "It is disturbing for many people but also for children who have set routines. Please stop this unnecessary and very old tradition of changing the clocks back in October. Keep one time throughout the year. In the US and in Europe they have already agreed to abolish this.",
        "background": "It is uncessary to keep changing the clocks back and forward in March and October. Keep the clocks in BST and keep the sunlight in the evening. This leads to better mental health, more light to keep doing activities. People feel safer when it is lighter to be out and about.",
