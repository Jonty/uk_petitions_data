        "additional_details": "Allow taxpayers to have access to Government loans, regardless of credit history. All taxpayers should be entitled. People who pay tax are the ones that keep this country running. I personally think that during the cost of living crisis the Government have been quick to allocate funds to issues and agendas that the general public have no interest in and do not benefit from. We ask the Government in this time of need to allow all who pay tax access to low- or no-interest loans, deductible through income tax.",
