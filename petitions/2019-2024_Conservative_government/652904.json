I believe this needs to be updated.\r\nThousands of people have to give up work to care for a loved one. Saving the government millions on social care. \u00a376 a week is an insult for the 24 hour care we give and needs to be updated to a \"carers wage\" this should however be means tested to the amount of care provided.",

CA is formally an \"income replacement\" benefit it is intended to provide a measure of income maintenance for people unable to do full time paid work because of their caring responsibilities, it is not a payment for care provided or a \"carers wage\"",
