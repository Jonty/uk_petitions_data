        "additional_details": "The practice is outdated, and during the summer, there is still light during very late hours, so there is no \"daylight\" to be saved. In a modern UK, BST doesn't changes opening and closing times, places don't stay open longer because it's light outside. \r\n\r\nThe mental impact it has on many people is avoidable if the clocks stay back. It's unnecessary to wake up an hour earlier. \r\n\r\nThe practice is old fashioned, unnecessary, and mentally draining in a modern society, it shouldn't be a thing anymore.",
        "background": "Absolish putting the clocks forward at the end of every March, and keep the time constantly as GMT to better align with UTC and the rest of the world. Make the next time the clocks go back the final time and keep it that way.",
