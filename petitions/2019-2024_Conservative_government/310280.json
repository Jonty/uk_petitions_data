A pay rise would be difficult to put in place by companies however allowing a tax exemption would potentially give more back to say thank you for your service.",
        "background": "Since the outbreak developed in Febraury 2020, NHS staff, carers, police, fire, cleaners and food retail have stepped up and are working ridiculous amount of hours. \r\n\r\nThey do not get any hazard pay for this, a tax exemption backdated to the start of the year would go some way to repay the debt.",
