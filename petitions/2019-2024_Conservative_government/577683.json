        "additional_details": "It will mean that I will be considerably out of pocket as I will be paying more tax compared to my neighbours from Ireland, Sweden, Germany and Spain.\r\nThe Spanish government will also potentially lose out as UK owners that are reliant on rental income decide either to sell up causing a dip in the property market or choose not to rent out their property and therefore cause a drop in tourist numbers.",
        "background": "Challenge the Spanish authorities over their taxation rules. They used to have what was called a \"sunshine tax\" on foreign property owners and this was ruled as illegal and stopped. \r\nSurely it cannot be legal to charge owners a higher rate of tax just because we are no longer in the EU?",
