        "additional_details": "There are a lot of impoverished communities in highly populated cities in the UK that are reliant on food banks, and especially during national crisis where globalisation has increased dependencies on commercial farms overseas. We are seeing a lot of lands that are being developed, in impoverished areas in highly populated cities, into high rise flats, that when completed, are not benefiting the local community or the UK. Land should be given back to the community to grow food.",
        "background": "There are large plots of land that are being sold to commercial development companies to build flats that most people can't afford to buy that normally get bought by people overseas to park their money, they rarely get lived in. This land could easily be turned into community farms for growing food.",
