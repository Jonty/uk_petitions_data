        "additional_details": "Tuition fees should be reduced this year as most students across the UK are limited to online learning only. Although university staff are working hard to provide a strong level of education, the lack of resources available and online-only teaching is seen by many as sub-par compared to previous years. This makes it difficult to justify the same \u00a39,250 fee to myself and many other students. If we are learning in such an abnormal way why are we still expected to pay the normal fee?",
