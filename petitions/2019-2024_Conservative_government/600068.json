        "additional_details": "The cases of people being spiked in the UK is rising and the government isnt doing much about it. Women and men who are victims to this are sometimes kidnapped and raped. I think that this should come to an end with the government putting in place a law for security at bars and nightclubs to search anyone for needles or drugs. This can help with catching potential rapists and kidnappers before the crime has been committed and would be a huge benefit to those who may not know any signs of being spiked.",
