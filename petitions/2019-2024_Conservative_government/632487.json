        "additional_details": "Since working for long time, I always noticed that this type of condition that woman has each month is hugely avoided and never seen as a sick condition from employers. Also if you work in a company and you call sick for more than 3 days in 3 months then you are going to get disciplinary action until dismissal. Period is a woman condition which we haven't decided to have but that we have to face it every month. I believe it will be much helpful if this law can be introduced in UK.",
        "background": "Introduce and enforce a law where for every women worker, companies must allow day off and pay sick days during the initial 2 or 3 days of period for each month without incurring in Attendance management procedure or dismissal. This could be called Woman Right Day break.",
