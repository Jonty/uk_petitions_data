        "action": "Free parking for mental health nurses working at Queen Elizabeth Hospital A&E",
        "additional_details": "I would like the government/parliament to ensure that front line mental health nurses working for 24hrs/365 days a year; have free parking within Queen Elizabeth Hospital-Woolwich grounds as this will reduce risks associated with their line of work. Driving is essential for most of us as efficiency in reducing A & E waiting times is further improved creating patient care satisfaction. Free parking must NOT end after COVID19 lockdown otherwise, all our efforts appears to have been pointless!",
        "background": "Following the COVID19 lockdown, all nurses/NHS staff were given this \"special treatment\" which included free parking borough wide and at their respective hospital or sites they worked in. Unfortunately,this seems to have ended & parking fines currently enforced at the huge hospital's parking spaces.",
