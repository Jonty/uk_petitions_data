        "additional_details": "Sec 2.9 on the Gov website for covid guidelines for weddings\r\nStates that anyone working is not counted in the limit.\r\nYou pay for the registrars to be there meaning they are working.\r\nI'd like the government to make the guidelines around COVID-19 wedding more clear also to exempt one photographer and the two registrars from being counted in the allowed 15 guests for wedding. \r\nAllowing the Bride and Groom to have 13 Guests at their weddings to include more family members in covid secure venues.",
        "background": "Currently the guidelines are unclear, \r\nVenues are saying that registrars count themselves within the '15 guests' for ceremonies. Even though they are working! Therefore once the bride and groom count themselves and one photographer they actually only have 10 Guests.",
