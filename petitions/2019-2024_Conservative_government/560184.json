        "additional_details": "As schools have opened, Boris stated that schools are cleaned and does not attract Covid-19, but evidence shows that the school he visited a week later has a confirmed coronavirus case, where lots of pupils had to self-isolate and their family members. Also pupils do not keep a two meter distance outside, leading to more pupils from different year groups mixing.",
        "background": "To reclose schools and switch to online teaching, as schools have shown evidence that the spread is caused by pupils connecting with other pupils and then transfering the virus to other family members, which leads to more people having symptoms of Covid-19 and then needing to self-isolate at home.",
