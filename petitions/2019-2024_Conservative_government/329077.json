        "additional_details": "We have already thought through how to be covid safe. Only allowing the customer and artist in the workspace areas. With masks, visors and disposable aprons. We already sterilise and clean all equipment before and after each customer. So we view ourselves as one of the safest trades to allow to be opened at this time. We can refuse work on chest, neck and head and can ensure customers face away from artists during procedures. Tattooing is 100% safer then allowing people to go back to pubs.",
        "background": "Allow tattoo studios to reopen. Under covid safe rules. Were aware piercing is a potential danger. But fail to see how a sterile environment with Above adequate Health & safety as standard cannot commence trading.",
