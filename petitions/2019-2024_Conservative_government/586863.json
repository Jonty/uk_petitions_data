        "additional_details": "In the US the Safe Haven Baby boxes are anonymous and located at fire stations and hospitals. The mother can drop the baby in a safe container box and leave, preventing the baby from harm. As soon as the baby is placed inside emergency services are contacted to collect the baby. This has proven successful in the US. I feel the safe haven box would be successful in save babies in the future.",
        "background": "In the UK, 1000+ babies are abandoned annually, including 3 in the town in Birmingham in the last few weeks. This may be down to reasons such as the mothers incapability to care for a child (as a result of cryptic pregnancy, living conditions etc).",
