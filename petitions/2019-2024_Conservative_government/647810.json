        "action": "Revoke the daily standing charge for the supply of energy using legislation.",
        "additional_details": "We wish the government to help households and businesses with the cost energy supply, we know that when energy prices go up the cost of living goes up and putting food on the table increases because businesses such as bakers have to put up their prices to pay for their energy which is then passed on to the customer, this can be said about most food supply businesses. Removing the standing charge would help cut what companies  charge which would have a knock on effect for households in the UK.",
        "background": "We wish the Government to remove the daily standing charge for the supply of energy (Gas and Electricity). We have seen the supply of energy increase in price regular making it hard for households and companies up and down the UK, we ask the UK Government to revoke the standing charge to help these.",
