        "additional_details": "Self-employed are being disadvantaged in CoVid-19 grants based on a discriminatory small print.\r\n\r\nEx: a furloughed employee earning (ex) \u00a32,500 per month gets 80% of total earnings in CoVid-19 grants without deductions made.\r\n\r\nFor the self-employed 80% is only provided after what is left from business expenses deducted. Meaning, the 80% grant can be as little as 10% of earnings while expenses remain. Both employed / self-employed have expenses and SEISS requirements are therefore discriminatory.",
        "background": "SEISS grant for self-employed is discriminatory compared to furloughed employees. A furloughed employee is not required to deduct expenses from earnings to receive 80% grant while self-employed SEISS is calculated after expenses.",
