        "additional_details": "Consumers are falling more and more in poverty due to energy crisis. We will be buying electricity from suppliers from around 52p/kWh from October 2022, but selling through feed-in-tariffs for 3-7.5p/kWh as of now, this has to be looked at as priority so more can be done. With the right feed-in-tariff rates, consumers would be saving on storage installations, thus raising more interest to install solar panels for example, bringing more realistic savings",
        "background": "Agree rates from feed-in tariffs to be closer to rates we are charged by suppliers to boost interest in renewable energy incentives, this is a key area for future and change is required to benefit both, grid and consumer, otherwise, solar panels for example are becoming less appealing",
