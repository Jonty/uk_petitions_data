It is important that children learn about everyones history as this will help to bring awareness and also educate people from younger ages. I do not remember having lessons on black history but I feel this would have made people understand why the current movement on racism is so important. If we are not taught about why a certain race\u2019s history is so important why would people take the time to care?",

Do you remember the last lesson you had on Black History? Probably not but I am sure you remember the lessons on Henry the VIII. \r\nIT IS TIME FOR CHANGE!",
