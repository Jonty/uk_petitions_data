        "additional_details": "School policies are a breach of human rights and need updating. Humans can develop bowel problems and suffer severe constipation from having to hold their bowels for long periods of time. However, adults are not forced to do this, so it is unfair that children are being forced to do so. Children face public humiliation if they have an accident due to not being able to access a toilet. We need to ensure children have rights to use the toilet whenever they need to, as it is a basic human right.",
        "background": "Review and change toilet policies so that children do not have to hold their bowel and bladder for long periods of time. Individuals being able to hold the power to decide whether a child uses the toilet or not is a breach of trust and a form of abuse, as well as neglecting basic human rights.",
