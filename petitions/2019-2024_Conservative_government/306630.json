In addition to this, mock exams were not meant to decide our final grades and the effort put in preparing for them are often no where near the effort put in for our actual final exams. \r\n\r\nConditional offers from universities and sixth forms will be based on these calculated grades and therefore could result in you being rejected, even though you could\u2019ve done much better in the final exam.",

The decision which will impact thousands of lives was made in days and will only benefit the minority of students. All students should be given grades based on final examinations like all previous years.",
