        "action": "Hold a full judge-led inquiry into Russian interferrence in UK democracy",
        "additional_details": "UK democracy is rightly held as a benchmark globally. We must have confidence it is fair and transparent.\r\n\r\nEstablishing an independent inquiry to look at all allegations of tampering, Russian funding of politics, hacking, misinformation and fake news would give the UK people confidence in the system. \r\n\r\nHaving it run by a judge empowered to compel whatever documents and witnesses they need would mean the findings were impartial and not political.",
        "background": "The Russia report says that the Government had \"actively avoided looking for evidence\" of Russian interferrence in UK votes\r\n\r\nThis must be remedied. An impartial judge-led inquiry, with powers to call the witnesses & evidence it needed show that the issue is being taken seriously",
