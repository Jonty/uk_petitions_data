        "additional_details": "By signing this petition:\r\n1. we expect that the decision-makers acknowledge, following a thorough scientific review, the naturally acquired Covid19 immunity of an increasing percentage of the population thus freeing ourselves from needless waves of restrictions \r\n2. we say NO green pass is required because people are immune either naturally (everyone will meet with the virus eventually) or through vaccination",
        "background": "Natural immunity is how humanity survived and adapted to the environment over millennia. Its efficacy, durability and adaptability is the gold standard to which pharmaceuticals aim to compare with. Historically, NO treatment is offered to a person AFTER they recovered from their illness.",
