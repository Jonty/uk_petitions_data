        "additional_details": "I believe that, allowing a student to experience an official exam is important for their growth & development in school. Exam stress & fear needs to be beaten not ignored. The issue with using predicted grades is that they are not considered as a student\u2019s true ability. Using results from mocks which are a couple months prior to May/June is not sufficient evidence, as many students tend to get a motivation to do far better, and in the end they achieve a genuine grade above their expectation.",
        "background": "I would like the Government & Parliament to not scrap the upcoming GCSEs & A levels for 2022, as cancelling for three years in a row is ridiculous. If COVID-19 remains serious by then, I suggest a full lockdown is implemented, however ONLY exam candidates (Year 11/13) are to attend school as usual.",
