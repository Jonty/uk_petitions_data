They knew the potential consequences and risks and yet willingly came forward to save others\u2019 lives. Those who ultimately paid the price trying to save the lives of their fellow citizens must be given state honours similar to what a soldier would get if he/she died on the battlefield. They deserve this token gesture for the herculean task. The protocol could be named the Hercules Protocol",

We request a new protocol to be set up to honour and show the nation's respect to those who died performing their duty to save the lives of COVID-19 patients.
