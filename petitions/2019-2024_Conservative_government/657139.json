We understand that you are concerned about accountability for injuries and deaths related to covid-19 vaccines, but we're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nThe Government has said that individuals have a right to sue the producers of a vaccine under Part 1 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987, if the safety of the product is not such as people are generally entitled to expect, taking all circumstances into account, and if that defect causes personal injury.\r\n\r\nAmendments to the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 were made to support the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, and we could accept a petition calling on the Government to remove the partial immunity from civil liability that was put in place for vaccines supplied under emergency authorisation."
