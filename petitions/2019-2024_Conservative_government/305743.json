        "action": "Implement rationing at all supermarkets during the COVID-19 crisis.",
        "additional_details": "During these difficult times, many people are experiencing difficulty buying normal everyday items at the supermarkets. The shelves are frequently bare of items like bread, meat, pasta, tea, vegetables, toilet rolls, hand sanitizer, soap and paracetamol, to name just a few items.\r\nThe supermarkets are assuring us that there aren\u2019t any shortages and that they are able to supply all products as normal.\r\nUnfortunately panic and greed seems to be fuelling many individuals to buy far in excess of what they need on a daily or weekly basis. Consequently it is proving difficult for a huge proportion of the population to buy even the essentials.",
        "background": "I would ask the Government to introduce some form of rationing at the supermarkets to prevent the shelves from being stripped bare by selfish individuals, and to allow everybody to buy the things that they need.",
