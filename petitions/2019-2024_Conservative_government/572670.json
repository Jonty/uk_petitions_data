        "additional_details": "The events industry have been plagued by scalpers buying huge volumes of tickets for many years and it\u2019s now spilling into trainers, games consoles and more. These scalpers run a racket to control low stock items and rig the market to set their own price. Because this doesn\u2019t affect the retailers bottom line, the scalpers are getting away with it and it is affecting consumers who can\u2019t afford the sky rocketing costs. Retailers need to be forced to tackle the issue and protect consumers.",
        "background": "Scalpers have been affecting consumers when it comes to high value, low stock items across multiple industries for many years. Retailers are not taking strong action to protect users. Fines should be imposed on retailers who are not using anti automation/bot software to prevent scalpers.",
