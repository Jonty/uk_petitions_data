        "additional_details": "All other national, public exams have been cancelled in the UK except IGCSEs. This is absolutely unfair for those students who take IGCSEs this summer. They lost so much learning time in schools, they cannot be able to taught in person, and with this new lockdown students now even have less of a chance to catch as some students even do not have any suitable devices for online learning which would make it unfair for students who take a different type of exam being unfairly penalised for that.",
