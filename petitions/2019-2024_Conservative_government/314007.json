        "additional_details": "In the midst of a global pandemic many students are being told to 'carry on with work as normal', putting them at a disadvantage compared to those with a 'safety net'. The quality of work produced cannot be expected to be that of a pre-pandemic standard. The policy should apply to every student to ensure fairness in the education system, and should include students of all years to ensure a level playing field in applying for work experience, placements and future careers.",
        "background": "Some UK universities have implemented a 'safety net' policy meaning that students' grades cannot fall below their pre-COVID-19 average. Others have not. The government should ensure that a universal policy is adopted by all universities for all students.",
