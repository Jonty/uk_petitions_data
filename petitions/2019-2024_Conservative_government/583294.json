        "additional_details": "Basic CPR is something that everyone should know how to do as we never know when we might need it. Watching other people on TV performing CPR, even for a few seconds, should be seen as an example as the public absorb health messages & behaviours from TV. \r\nFor example, there is an increase in consulting rates for specific cancers after they are featured in a soap storyline.\r\nEnsuring accurate CPR technique would mean correct behaviours are observed & repeatedly learnt.",
        "background": "Pass legislation to ensure correct/standardised CPR technique is performed on TV shows shown/made in the UK. This would help the public to perform safer, more effective CPR if needed & not pick up \u2018bad habits\u2019 from watching it performed incorrectly.",
