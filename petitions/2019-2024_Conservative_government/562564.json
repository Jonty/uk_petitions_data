        "additional_details": "Health and Social care lives under constant scrutiny yet has become the backbone of this country. Workers have worked tirelessly for 9 months, sacrificing home life, many separated from their families, living in the care homes where they work, at hotels close to their hospitals, and putting themselves at great risk. Throughout both lockdowns the Health and Social Care workers have gone to work each day to keep those they support safe. It's time to reward them for their dedication.",
        "background": "Every year becomes harder and more strenuous for our NHS and Social care workers and 2020 has proved to be the biggest challenge both have faced in living memory. Both Wales and Scotland have provided their NHS and Social Care workers with \u00a3500 reward payments and England's carers deserve the same.",
