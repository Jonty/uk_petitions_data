Many more claims are likely to be made if payouts increase confidence in the system.\r\nUse of public money may cause the government to strongly resist claims as they did with Pandemrix.\r\nVaccine manufactures are responsible for the product & safety trials, therefore should take full liability.",

It is not a compensation scheme. As with other benefits, payments and allowances, the Scheme is funded out of general government spending. We\u2019re therefore not sure what action you want the Government to take to recover the costs of payments made under the Scheme.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for the Government to remove indemnity from the manufacturers of covid-19 vaccines, to allow individuals to pursue claims for compensation against manufacturers, if that\u2019s something you\u2019d like to see happen.\r\n\r\nWe have also published the following petition, calling for a new tax on companies that produce covid-19 vaccines, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nIntroduce a windfall tax on pharmaceutical companies\u2019 Covid-19 related profits\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/617111"
