Should recycling be a legal requirement? Do you want the police to focus more on stopping knife crime or sexual assault? Do you want more CCTV? Choices on the type of relationship we want with the EU? What type of trade deal we want with the US? Should drug addiction be treated as a health issue?",

Let the people have a say in the rules that govern our lives instead of just choosing a small group of people that decide them for everyone else.",
