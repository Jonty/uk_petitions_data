We would like a supportive person who understands education and what teachers do.  After Michael Gove, Justine Greening and now Gavin Williamson, he is now making teachers feel they are worth nothing and no one should be made to feel like that.  We teach children to be accepting and supportive. What is our Education Minister teaching them?",
