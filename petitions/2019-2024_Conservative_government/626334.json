        "additional_details": "Prime Ministers who resign as a result of their mistakes are currently \u2018rewarded\u2019 with a generous taxpayer-funded allowance. This is despite the fact ordinary people are facing rising bills, many of them as a direct result of those very mistakes. Liz Truss was PM for just a few weeks, during which time the economy suffered enormous damage and ordinary people are facing the consequences. She should not receive a generous allowance-for-life for her disastrous rule.",
        "background": "Parliament should pass a law which stops Prime Ministers from receiving generous taxpayer-funded allowances for life, even if their time in office was disastrous and left millions of people worse off and facing rising bills.",
