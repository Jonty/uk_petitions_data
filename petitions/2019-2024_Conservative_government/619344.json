        "additional_details": "I feel it's unfair that if an adult has a juvenile conviction he/she is not allowed to apply for certain jobs like the Police, Civil service and any careers that dislike a conviction. How are we meant to as a country enable those to achieve or rehabilitate if they are not being given a chance to do so? As a juvenile you don't understand life as an adult does and depending on your upbringing this can have a massive influence on you as a child/teenager why should you be punished as an adult too?",
        "background": "Change how minor to moderate Juvenile convictions impact future adult careers that bar the individual from applying for certain jobs due to which prevents those from having a positive future. We need to change the way a Conviction stays on a Juvenile record if no crime has been committed as an adult",
