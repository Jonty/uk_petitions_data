Especially problematic is the call to censor 'misinformation / disinformation' and 'hate speech' where both categories are widely open to interpretation and therefore open the door to mass censorship of any topic the government does not like.\r\n\r\nThe best way for a society to be properly informed and free from prejudice is to have free and open discussion on all topics, not censorship.",
        "background": "Do not pass the Online Safety Bill, specifically do not fine companies for allowing 'misinformaton / disinformation' or 'hate speech' on their platforms as these categories are widely open to interpretation and will result in mass censorship.",
