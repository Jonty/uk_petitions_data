The food banks will help, but there will be nowhere near enough to help all those who need it. These families will not have budgeted for this and will certainly struggle, as will a lot of families.",
        "background": "If the UK schools have to close due to coronavirus, I propose that all families of children who receive free school meals are issued with food/shopping vouchers in order to ensure that they have enough food and other essentials to see them through.",
