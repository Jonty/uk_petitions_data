        "additional_details": "The dolphin massacre was unnecessary and cruel. To slaughter over 1400 dolphins for the sake of it, is beyond belief. The UK should not trade with a nation that has supported such an atrocity. Trade between the two countries should cease. This will send a strong message we will not stand by while these mammals are senselessly slaughtered. Since trade with the Faroes is only a small fraction of overall UK trade it should make much difference. It will however send a strong message. This is not OK",
        "background": "I want the UK to revoke it's current trade agreement with the Faroe Islands after the dolphin massacre on Sunday 12 September 2021.",
