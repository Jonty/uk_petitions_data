The GDC have had a progressively unfair approach to public safety by way of chastising dentists in the public eye but this week and last has been their true test. They have failed this test. \r\n\r\nThe statements that the GDC have made have made no mention yet again on the \u201cstandards\u201d for patients in the protection of the public",
