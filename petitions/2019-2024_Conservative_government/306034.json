        "additional_details": "The reason why we want this to happen is because it is much safer to be at home where there is food and medicine from your parents, incase we get the virus, in addition as university student we don\u2019t have a lot of money to stay stocked up while everyone is bulk buying and there is nothing left. Furthermore some students will have to pay rent back at home while the university rent too while we are not staying there and the accommodation isn\u2019t being used which isn\u2019t fair as this is for our own health and well-being.",
        "background": "We want the government or parliament to get all university that has closed due to COVID-19 pay back the last term accommodation fee to students as they have gone home due to the virus.",
