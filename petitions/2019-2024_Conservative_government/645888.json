        "additional_details": "A four day school week not only benefits the students but also the teachers. Teachers rarely clock off. There's planning and marking and meetings and more planning, so a 4-day school week may help with the work/life balance for them more. Students could benefit through using the Friday for homework. Students spent more time on school sports, on chores, and on spending time with their families, the study found. They also had more time for sleep, and spent more time on hobbies and homework.",
        "background": "Parliament should reduce the school week to four days because there are some surprising benefits. Students spent more time on school sports, on chores, and on spending time with their families, the study found. They also had more time for sleep, and spent more time on hobbies and homework.",
