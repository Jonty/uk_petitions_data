Britain has licensing more than \u00a34.7bn of arms exports to the Saudis since the bombing of Yemen began in March 2015 (BBC). As well as indiscriminate bombing and killings of civilians, there is targeted destruction of infrastructure and blocking of access to humanitarian aid (Amnesty International). 17 Million people are living in a state of crisis with regards to food and there is a real risk of famine (FEWS)\r\nResuming the export of British arms to Saudi Arabia is ethically and legally questionable at this time and must be scrutinised by Parliament.",
