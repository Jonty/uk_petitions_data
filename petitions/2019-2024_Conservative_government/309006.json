        "additional_details": "We being advised now to not go to any gatherings of more than two people. Where call centres are still filling up with up to a hundred people. Which puts everyone at risk, especially when there is a clear option from working at home, it makes you question the company caring about your health and safety. So I think that it would be the best for our nation and it's people if large call offices that have the ability to work from home are made to do this to prevent the spread of the virus from the work and bringing it home.",
        "background": "Most call centres such as Sky, Vodafone and EE could hold the ability to work from home instead of going to the office, so closing down the offices would help out with stopping the spread of the virus.",
