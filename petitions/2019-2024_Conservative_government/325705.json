        "additional_details": "During the lockdown there was a pause in the amount of litter left by inconsiderate persons. Now that there is a movement of people and takeaways have started to operate the litter problem has immediately returned with people just abandoning from their car, on the beach or in the park etc. If the packaging is marked with the purchases details the6 could be easily tracked and dealt with accordingly. Providing a portal to post photos of offenders would also make this easier and a deterrent.",
