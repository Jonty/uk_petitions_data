        "action": "Stop allowing the bee-killing pesticide to be reintroduced",
        "additional_details": "Since the ban on Neonicotinoids in the EU, there has not been any dramatic decrease in crop yield as predicted. This pesticide is lethal to bees and other pollinators which our environment desperately needs to pollinate flora and fauna. Pollinators, according to the Bee Coalition, are responsible for a net \u00a3690 million worth of crops annually in the UK, more than what the Royal Family provide. They are essential for the efficient pollination of crops, such as oilseed rape, tomatoes and apples.",
        "background": "The British government will be allowing EU banned pesticides Neonicotinoid Thiamethoxam to be used on crops during 2021. We must not reintroduce this pesticide, or we will see the heightened decline of a vital species as well as a major loss in profit for the economy.",
