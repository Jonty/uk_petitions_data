        "additional_details": "Why it is, that Western media and particularly the BBC seek to exclude white heterosexual males from any form of positive self-image? \r\n\r\nIn commercial media advertising consider the number of positive images for women and non-white ethnic groups. Why are white men excluded or routinely shown as insignificant, weak, or objects of denigration or derision?\r\n\r\nThe Government should discuss this as an issue and require media organisations to audit and stop the increasingly racist and sexist bias against young white heterosexual men, both within their staff recruitment and the way that they are negatively portrayed in media content.",
