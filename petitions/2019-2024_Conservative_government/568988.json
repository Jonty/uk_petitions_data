        "additional_details": "It is vital for Parliament and is in the public interest that parliamentary scrutinary is allowed to take place. There are substantial legal and economic changes that are a direct result of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement.

This can only be of benefit to the public who must have at least the opportunity to be informed.",
        "background": "The committee scrutinising the new relationship the UK has with the EU was closed down by MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. This means that a planned 6 month enquiry into the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the UK and EU cannot take place.",
