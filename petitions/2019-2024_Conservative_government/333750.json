        "additional_details": "British citizens, including those descended from slaves, were forced to indemnify slave owners until 2015, despite the abolition of slavery in 1803 and the enactment of the abolition act of 1833. Slavery was an immoral privilege that offered financial gain to individuals who engaged in crimes against humanity. Today, it is illegal to benefit from the proceeds of crime. This petition urges the Government and Parliament to correct this political and financial injustice.",
