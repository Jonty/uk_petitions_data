Each day between 5 of us we will be travelling 160miles plus  round trip! That\u2019s an additional 41k + miles per year of unnecessary driving just between 5 people ! This alone should be a reason to keep people working from home. As a single parent I\u2019ve been able to care for my child around work in school holidays and saves thousands in child care too!",

Pros less cars on the road, less stress, better mental health, being a single working mum it\u2019s totally changed my life for the better working from home the last 14months!",
