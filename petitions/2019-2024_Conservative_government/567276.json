        "additional_details": "If universities thrived off 3,000 per year in 2006, why can\u2019t they now. \r\nAdditionally, the development proposals at bird for facilities will potentially not be in use for years due to the pandemic, meaning it is an unnecessary investment for now. \r\nthe new coronavirus strain might be resistant to the vaccine, who is to say this won\u2019t go on for over 3 years or more? \r\nWhy should we pay 9,000 a year for an intensive practical course when this is not the case due to the pandemic. \r\nSave our education.",
        "background": "Due to the pandemic, we are not getting the  face to face teaching that is necessary for our practical course. This has been discussed in parliament, and they concluded it is up to the individual universities to reimburse students. \r\nReduce to 3,000 until back to full face to face teaching.",
