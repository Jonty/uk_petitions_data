        "action": "Ban the sale & use of pesticides in the domestic domain to save bee populations!",
        "additional_details": "Firstly I want for this to be acknowledged as a potential public health & safety issue due to inadequate training for safe use in our domestic domain and for reading ages of adult populations to be considered in the scrutiny of this issue.\r\n\r\nSecondly, like tobacco, for all pesticide branded packaging made plain.\r\n\r\nUltimately I want those in power to ban the sale of domestic pesticide products and promote the education of alternate holistic methods to better improve public knowledge and safety.",
        "background": "I am turning 27 years old May 29th 2020 & every year of my life for as long as I can remember approx 23yrs, when spring comes so does our fight against nature. Curious I've never intervened in natures process & any boom such as ants, quickly retreat out from my living area without poison methods.",
