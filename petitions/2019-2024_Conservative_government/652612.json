        "action": "Reduce the minimum income required for family members to join  British citizens",
        "additional_details": "This increase is significant and it will leave thousands of British citizens who have a foreign spouse unable to live with them in the UK. This will negatively impact families who will be left with the choice of living in separate countries, or having to live in a foreign country with little hope of returning to the UK with their spouse. For families with children, this will be highly detrimental and could cause significant problems for hardworking families and their children.",
        "background": "Following the announcement from the Home Secretary to increase the minimum income required for British Citizens and those settled in the UK who want their family members to join them from \u00a318,600 to \u00a338,700, we want the threshold to be reduced so that hardworking families do not have to be separated",
