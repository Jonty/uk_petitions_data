        "additional_details": "People choose to home educate because that suits them, freedom of choice is not cause for concern. 9 million adults leave school illiterate, these figures show the school way does not suit every child. School admissions are struggling to meet the demand for school places, home educating families help with this problem. Home educators learn in a way that suits them without compulsory curriculum, standardised tests and registers.  These children benefit greatly by education suited to them.",
        "background": "Home education improves the mental health of many children as well as giving these children more support. There have been mentions of hidden children, the only place many of these children end up hidden is in school. Registers, curriculum and testing is not needed.",
