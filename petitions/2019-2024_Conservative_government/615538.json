        "action": "Every government official fined due to lockdown parties should resign.",
        "additional_details": "By breaking these rules (enforced by them) during times of extreme emotional, physical and mental distress, these officials have shown a blatant disregard for the people they are serving. It is disrespectful to their voters, constituents and the politics of this country. All government officials that have been fined for socialising during lockdown should be removed from their positions, as allowing them to stay sets a precedent that all officials may openly corrupt with no consequences.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to hold itself accountable and force all officials involved in breaking the COVID-19 rules to resign, or be fired. They should not be allowed to retain power over people, when they clearly believe they do not need to follow the same rules as the rest of us.",
