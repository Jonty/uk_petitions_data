        "additional_details": "The reimposition of parking charged for NHS staff is a very public show of contempt for the sacrifices made by staff during this pandemic. It mocks years of dedicated service. It reveals a complete lack of respect for our NHS. Demand that the government immediately orders the companies that manage hospital car parks to cease charging staff to park their vehicles. Demand that no NHS health board charges staff for the right to park.",
        "background": "Free parking for NHS staff was introduced for the Covid-19 outbreak. Without it, NHS staff faced paying at least \u00a33.50 an hour. Now the government plans to reintroduce the charge.",
