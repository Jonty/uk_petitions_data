        "additional_details": "Thousands of residents have been negatively impacted, majority for driving in the same road they have for many years. Croydon council has in stealth mode placed signs as you enter the road, many are difficult to see (Hailing Park) due to traffic, pedestrians and so on, even when you spot the signs, reading all the information whilst the vehicle is moving is practically impossible. Similar story on Parsons Mead - driving in poor conditions, rain, during darkness it is very difficult to see.",
        "background": "We would like to government to ask Croydon Council to cancel all PCNs issued on roads such as Parsons Mead, Hailing Park Road and similar PCNs issued where new signs have been put up, without prior warning and in areas where it would be reckless to do a U-turn.",
