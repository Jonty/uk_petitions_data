        "additional_details": "Every year around Guy Fawkes night, Diwali, New Years Eve and other celebrations that call for the use of fireworks thousands of pets are terrified by the bang made by fireworks, this is animal cruelty and I believe any person using this type of firework and any government allowing their use is guilty of animal cruelty which is a punishable offence in England. Quite apart from the intense fear it causes the shock of the noise is well known to have caused death to animals. Silent fireworks are readily available and should be the only type allowed. Removing the bang would not remove the enjoyment of fireworks by humans but it would prevent distress to animals.",
