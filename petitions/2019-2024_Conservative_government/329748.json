It\u2019s often shaken off as if one is making a fuss - we shouldn\u2019t have to justify why we don\u2019t want our legs pressed against the underside of a desk, or our feet hanging down to the ground.",

This includes, but is not limited to, making adjustments for disabilities, and includes preventing and managing musculoskeletal disorders: https://www.hse.gov.uk/msd/index.htm\r\n\r\nThere are also specific requirements to carry out DSE assessments for working with display equipment at desks, which includes the suitability of workstations.
