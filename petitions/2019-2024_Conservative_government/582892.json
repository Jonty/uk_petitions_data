        "additional_details": "Professional lobbyists are people whose business is trying to influence legislation, regulation, or other government decisions, actions, or policies on behalf of a group or individual who hires them. This is essentially an undemocratic process that benefits a powerful and wealthy elite by attempting to influence individuals who have been elected to make decisions that benefit the country as a whole. There must be an urgent reform of the lobbying process by a 'non-political' body that includes representatives from the main political parties, business and the general public.",
