        "additional_details": "The Department for Transport have stated they are investigating flexible ticketing options for customers yet with the return for office workers anticipated to be next month (June '21) rail operators have not issued any information on this.\r\n\r\nA recent survey by the BBC states almost all of the UK's largest employers do not plan to bring office workers back full-time yet pricing on train lines is out of sync with this trend inhibiting the UK from fully embracing the benefits of flexible working.",
        "background": "The rail service must adapt to reflect that millions of people across the UK will not be commuting into the office 5 days a week any longer.\r\n\r\nThe government must enforce new train fare solutions to support employers and employees in enabling more flexibility within the working week.",
