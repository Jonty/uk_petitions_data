To ensure that they fulfill their promises to the people. \r\nThis is rapidly failing. No matter who runs to lead, the lives of so many should not be in so few hands. The government should allow us to decentralise our local areas. To decide what happens, between us all. I believe things will improve very rapidly",

The people's voices will finally be heard and no longer ignored.\r\n\r\nThis would ensure real change.",

It's therefore not clear how what you're proposing would work in practice.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to hold a referendum on replacing existing forms of government with a decentralised autonomous organisation, if that's what you want to happen."
