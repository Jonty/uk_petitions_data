        "additional_details": "New legislation on protests passed its final hurdle in April 2022 with a last-minute concession that the Home Secretary will report to Parliament on the way new police powers are used to limit freedom of assembly. However, we have little faith a minister\u2019s report is ever sufficiently independent. Instead, one year on, we want the Joint Committee on Human Rights to seek evidence and testimony from campaigners and movements most affected by the new Act, on the impact new police powers have had.",
        "background": "The new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act has committed the Home Secretary to \u201cprepare and publish a report\u201d within two years on the way new powers for policing protests are used. We call instead on the Joint Committee on Human Rights to hold its own investigation and hearings in spring 2023",
