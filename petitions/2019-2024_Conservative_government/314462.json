        "additional_details": "The virus that causes COVID-19 is transmitted largely through droplets, which can be created as people speak. Carriers may show no symptoms but still spread the virus. Even simple cloth facemasks  can substantially inhibit the escape of droplets, and so reduce transmission of the virus from the mask-wearer.\r\n\r\nEvery country to successfully control COVID-19 to date has employed mass-masking. Many countries (US, France, Austria) have recently embraced masks in light of the pandemic. We should too.",
        "background": "The government should organise the production of sufficient cloth masks for the entire UK population, distribute them, and then encourage the wearing of masks in public places.",
