        "additional_details": "Every citizen within the UK has made sacrifices, followed the rules and guidance to support the governments approach in fighting COVID 19. We are still being forced to lockdown, close businesses and wear masks, indicating these methods never worked before. Small businesses are being made to suffer as a result of this as the financial help provided from the government is not enough to survive through these lockdowns. This is simply causing serious mental health problems for those under pressure.",
        "background": "No more lockdowns, no more members of the public made to wear masks and no more business closures across the UK.\r\n\r\nI ask that a change to the method of saving lives from Covid 19 is to protect the vulnerable. Those who have pre existing health conditions and the elderly to receive more support.",
