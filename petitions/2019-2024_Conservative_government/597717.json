This change in law will protect families by allowing parents to make financial sacrifices to help their children and will encourage individuals to further their education, careers & business without fear of later loss.

Currently there is no automatic recognition of an individual's financial situation prior to marriage or civil partnership; prenuptial agreements are not commonplace and the Courts are not obliged to follow them.",
