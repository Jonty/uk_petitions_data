This would cover suffering caused by not properly caring for an animal in excessive heat.\r\n\r\nThe Government's code of practice for the welfare of dogs, which provides owners and keepers with information on how to meet the welfare needs of their animals, and can be used in courts as evidence in cases brought before them relating to poor welfare, specifically highlights the risks of heat stress: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/697953/pb13333-cop-dogs-091204.pdf\r\n\r\nDecisions about investigating and prosecuting alleged animal welfare crimes are a matter for the police and Crown Prosecution Service, not the Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nIf you think that a crime has been committed, you should contact the police here: https://www.police.uk/contact/\r\n\r\nIf you're concerned about a specific incident, you may wish to report it directly to the RSPCA: https://www.rspca.org.uk/utilities/contactus/reportcruelty"
