        "action": "Legalise the harvest, processing, and sale of low-THC hemp leaves and flowers",
        "additional_details": "Flowers and leaves harvested from low-THC hemp possess minimal quantities of the psychoactive cannabinoid. Countries throughout the EU allow for low-THC products to contain between 0.3%\u20131% THC. Setting a legal THC threshold will help to unlock a \u00a31 billion market and assist an ailing economy by enabling farmers to sell UK-grown hemp flowers and leaves to businesses that manufacture CBD products including oils and cosmetics. The legalisation hemp leaf will also support local niche businesses.",
        "background": "We're calling upon the UK government to legalise the harvesting, processing, and sale of low-THC hemp leaves and flowers. Currently, hemp farmers in the country are limited to harvesting mature stems and seeds, and missing out on a potential \u00a31 billion domestic market surrounding leaves and flowers.",
