        "additional_details": "We have historically been world leaders in industry yet have let other countries take the lead in regards to the legal production of cannabis. If the UK government really cared about the people which it served- it would not let criminals control this 'gateway' drug that a large proportion of the population either has tried, or uses on a daily basis. Which puts more strain on the NHS and cost the taxpayer more? Alcohol abuse, or someone who smokes a few joints a days? Time for reform.",
        "background": "Open the legal UK cannabis market to help pay off coronavirus deficit and bridge the gap in the current economic climate, as opposed to raising taxes in other struggling areas.",
