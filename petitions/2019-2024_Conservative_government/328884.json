        "additional_details": "Due to prolonged closure, many studios will not survive; as debts for rent, fees, taxes and wages continue to build. \r\n\r\nWe are trained and certified in blood borne pathogens and cross contamination and by law, keep a record of every client. In addition, we undergo Environmental Health inspections from our local councils annually.\r\n\r\nOur suggestion would be to open studios with restrictions such as one client per artist a day, full PPE for artists and client and appointment only.",
        "background": "With many businesses and artists struggling with the prolonged closure, we ask the government to re-consider including the Tattoo industry in phase 3 of their plan. \r\n\r\nThe Tattoo industry supports almost 600,000 jobs in the UK and contributes over \u00a327 billion to the economy every year.",
