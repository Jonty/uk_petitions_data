        "action": "Moped drivers working in London have to complete a road safety driving course",
        "additional_details": "A course could be ran for those wishing to use their mopeds in the city for working/delivery use which focuses on safe road positioning, overtaking and stopping distances to name a few. All too often a drive though central London will reveal mopeds driving dangerously unsafe, too focused on where they want to get to as fast as possible without considering their safety and the safety of other road users and pedestrians. It is essential to tackle this problem to reduce fatal accidents in London",
        "background": "Moped riders can currently attend a only a single days driving course and be out on the road, working with their vehicle. This is unsafe and contributes to many accidents in London with riders having limited knowledge of safe driving. They should be given a mandatory safety course to increase safety",
