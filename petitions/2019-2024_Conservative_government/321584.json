These PPEs are what will determine the grades that will be sent to universities when we apply. Naturally, the majority of us feel exceedingly underprepared - many of us having been advised that these exams would not even take place.\r\nWe feel that by taking these exams with so little preparation it will jeopardise our future prospects.",
