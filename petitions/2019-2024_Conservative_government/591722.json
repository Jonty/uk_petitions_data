This is not the first time and I don\u2019t think it will be the last. The racist tweets and posts is absolutely disgusting behaviour, these athletes should be praised for there hard work and dedication, racism needs to be kicked out and we have to start with social media as that is where athletes sadly get targeted. I am hoping we can stand together and kick racism out!",
        "background": "If it\u2019s at all possible I would like the Government/Parliament to check the regulations/procedures imposed by these social media platforms towards racism online. It is getting out of hand especially towards sports athletes, the remarks they are receiving online is absolutely disgusting.",
