Protest and campaigning are vital parts of democracy. Young people cannot vote yet, it is the only way to have their voices heard.  We must not allow the Government to take away schools\u2019 freedom to teach their pupils what they need to know about the political system, including all the ways in which they can engage with it.",
        "background": "The Department for Education has produced a draft strategy paper on climate education stating it is inappropriate for teachers to encourage students to join campaigns or protests in order to tackle the climate crisis. We call on the government to remove this undemocratic prohibition.",
