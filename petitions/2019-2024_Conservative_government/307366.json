        "additional_details": "Some families have now lost one income due to self employed partners not being covered under new plans to pay staff. Families who have workers for NHS, Police, Fire, Military, Prisons, Schools etc. Will be at a stretch. Social distancing has caused custom to drop and other types businesses to close. Families will now slip into rent arrears and possibly default on payments to credit companies. The universal credit for the self employed who are now out of work, will not suffice in most cases.",
        "background": "Help provide financial stability by not paying tax on wages for families of key workers who's partners are not working due to being self employed or people not covered under the policy to cover wages. Even for 1 month would assist dramatically.",
