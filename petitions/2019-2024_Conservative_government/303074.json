        "additional_details": "We need help IMMEDIATELY! Not as a loan, but as a subsidy for sales and income that suddenly disappeared within days.The UK is a rich country. What would help the country is the introduction of an unconditional basic income of \u00a3 800-1200 per person for 6 months. Fast, unbureaucratic, limited in time. THIS would prevent the social crash of thousands while maintaining purchasing power in the country. There is no better way to test the basic income concept - the greatest chance lies in the crisis.",
