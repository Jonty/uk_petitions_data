        "additional_details": "Mothers have no incentive to go back to work because the cost of most nurseries are more than a day\u2019s wage. The government need to reinstate childcare voucher schemes or provide low costing or free nurseries for working mothers. Women who desperately need to go back to work due to financial struggles or want to regain some independence after having a child, should not be put in the position of struggling to pay nursery fees. A mother\u2019s mental health is critical and work is a huge part of this.",
        "background": "Working mothers should be given access to free childcare or be given help towards childcare costs. We should not be penalised for going back to work and helping the economy, by paying ridiculous childcare fees and losing out on other crucial benefits (especially when living as a single parent)",
