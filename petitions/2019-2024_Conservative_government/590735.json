        "action": "Allow two NHS tests PCR/Antigen per annum to be used for travel purposes.",
        "additional_details": "During these unprecedented times, some people might be allergic to the COVID-19 vaccine, therefore the government should allow up to two NHS tests to be used for travel purposes. This could potentially help to reunite split families over the pandemic as not everybody can afford such high prices possibly one of the highest across Europe, especially people who\u2019s jobs/incomes have been affected by COVID-19, but they should still be given a chance to meet the family twice a year.",
        "background": "Allow up to two NHS Rapid antigen tests to be used for travelling abroad and it is materially discriminatory to those with less income to pay so much for the tests in order to visit/reunite with family abroad.",
