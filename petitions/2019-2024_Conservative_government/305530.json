        "additional_details": "I have run a small holiday cottage cleaning business since 2002. I employ one person and pay taxes.I do not pay business rates as whilst my business is registered to my home , I only use my home address , landline , a home PC and printer for the business. I am therefore ineligible to receive the cash grants available to help the smallest of businesses as I can't obtain a business rates exemption certificate. We  usually clean 7 cottages a week but that will soon be none due to cancellations",
        "background": "Make grants available for the self employed and freelancers to cover their losses due to Covid - 19 because asking them to take out a bank loan ( if possible ) just kicks the can down the road for those that represent an important part of our economy",
