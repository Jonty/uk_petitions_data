It would protect the rights of the person and their family and friends in the decision of a DNACPR order. The fact a DNACPR order can be given to you only for having a diagnosis of a learning disability is clear discrimination and against everything taught in the NHS and discrimination and discriminative practice should not be accepted in the National Health Service.",
        "background": "Many people in our society have intellectual disabilities, there are 1 million people living with learning disabilities across England and Wales alone. A learning disability is NOT a valid reason for someone to not be resuscitated & yet many people are being given DNACPR orders for just that reason",
