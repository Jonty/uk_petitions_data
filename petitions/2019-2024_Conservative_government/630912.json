        "additional_details": "Whilst students are supposed to be an \"addition\" to the healthcare service - they are exposed to the same frontline pressures as the rest of the NHS workforce. Students work a variety of days, nights, and weekends; playing a vital role in ensuring the needs of patients are met.",
        "background": "To attract more nurses to the understaffed NHS, students should be paid for the full-time hours they work. It costs \u00a327,500 to complete a nursing degree and students are often funding a living through working additional shifts as healthcare assistants alongside their studies.",
