The Events Industry Forum conducted a recent survey and found that 60% of the UK\u2019s event industry\u2019s supplier base is facing collapse within 3 months unless event businesses receive additional support from the Government.",

This change would mean businesses in the events industry could access the Retail, Hospitality & Leisure Grant and receive Business Rates relief for 2020-2021",
