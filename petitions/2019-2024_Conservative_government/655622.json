You can find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them, by entering your post code here: https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to require local authorities to share more detailed information about local spending with residents, if that's what you want to happen."
