        "additional_details": "Students have suffered immensely during the Covid-19 pandemic. We have not been able to prepare sufficiently to sit exams in 2021 by a long shot. We have had months of \u2018online education\u2019, although only the most fortunate students have been able to access online education. The mental health of students should be prioritised, but this is not the case, students are being forced to try and repair the mess they where plunged into while our voices are being ignored by the government.",
        "background": "Cancel all 2021 examinations for year 11 and year 13 students and replace them with small amounts of coursework and teacher assessed grades. This would be the most accurate way to achieve our deserved grades while ensuring student\u2019s mental health and motivation are not further depleted.",
