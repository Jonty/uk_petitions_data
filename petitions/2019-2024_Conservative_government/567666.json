        "action": "Increase mental health funding for young people",
        "additional_details": "In the last three years the likelihood of a young person developing a mental illness has increased by 50%. As well as this studies have shown that 1 in 5 people Covid-19 patients were diagnosed with a mental illness for the first time within three months of contracting the virus. Young people are having the biggest impact on their lives due Covid-19 and yet there still seems to be a lack of support for them. Waiting until they are at crisis to be taken seriously is not enough.",
        "background": "Young people are constantly afraid to seek help for their mental health due to the lack of support and long NHS waiting lists they face. Many do not get support until they are in crisis but this is too late. More money needs to be spent on mental health services so everybody can access them.",
