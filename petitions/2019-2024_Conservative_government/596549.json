        "action": "Exempt NHS staff from paying the proposed increase in national insurance",
        "additional_details": "The NHS has yet to recover from the emotional, psychological, financial and socio-economic strain meted out to them by the ongoing fight against coronavirus. The NHS have continued to decry the UK's Government's unfair treatment, political hypocrisy and insensitivity to the welfare of NHS staff. This increase in NI could therefore be perceived by the NHS as a Trojan Horse with which the UK Government is attempting to recoup or reverse the increase in NHS pay. It is therefore unacceptable.",
        "background": "The Government has recently moved to increase national insurance in the UK with effect from April 2022. Recently too, Government has had to succumb, following pressures from various sources, to granting a 3% increase of NHS pay, a gesture that continues to leave steaming controversies in its trail.",
