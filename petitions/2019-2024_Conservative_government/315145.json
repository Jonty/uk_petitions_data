Most of us are working an average of 48-60 hours per week to cover shortages. However, we will be expected to pay the taxman ridiculous amount of money for doing \"overtime.\" Realistically, I know my colleagues would rather be at home than risking their lives front lining the fight for Covid. Yet, we are still here.",
