        "additional_details": "NHS staff and carers are risking their lives to fight COVID19. Applause is nice. But  PPE, sufficient staff and proper salaries are what are needed. We ask Parliament to agree a cross-party model for the NHS, including: (i) all resourcing and salaries; (ii) an annual budget to fund it; and (iii) a funding model that will prevent its erosion. We ask that this is written into law in an appropriate manner to ensure the NHS is depoliticised and removed from the discretionary annual budget cycle.",
        "background": "Our NHS is badly under-resourced as governments strive to meet low-tax electoral promises. We want our political parties together with  external experts, like the Kings Fund, to agree a structure & funding for the NHS that is written into law to form a non-political funding obligation going forward.",
