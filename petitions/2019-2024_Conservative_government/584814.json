No band, no dj, no dancing, no fun. After a lot of couples have complied, cancelled and rearranged their special day this is a bit of a slap in the face, not to mention the wedding industry has been one of the hardest hit during the covid19 pandemic. \r\nIts time to let people live their lives and stop the nonsensical rules.",
