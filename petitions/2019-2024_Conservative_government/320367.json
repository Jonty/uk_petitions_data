The House of Commons has agreed that Members who are unable to attend Westminster for medical or public health reasons related to the pandemic can attend proceedings virtually.\r\n\r\nArrangements for the House of Lords is a matter for that House, and not the Government or House of Commons, and decisions about attendance is a matter for individual Members and Peers.\r\n\r\nYou might be interested to know that the Government has said that it strongly encourages children and young people in the eligible year groups and priority groups to attend, as requested by their school or college, unless they are self-isolating or there are other reasons for absence. However, the Government has also said that parents will not be fined for non-attendance at this time.\r\n\r\nIf you want the Government to delay opening schools, you might like to sign some of the following petitions:\r\n\r\nKeep schools closed until Covid 19 is no longer a threat: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/316404\r\n\r\nHalt the reopening of schools until the NEU's 5 tests are met: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/321101\r\n\r\nDelay the reopening of schools to September: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/318206 \r\n\r\nReopen schools in August with shorter summer holidays for a transition period: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/320459\r\n\r\nKeep schools closed in the UK until an effective Cov-19 vaccine is available: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/319292  \r\n\r\nDelay opening of schools until Test Track and Trace for Covid 19 is working: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/320891\r\n\r\nShut schools completely to stop putting teachers, TAs and pupils at risk: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/308013\r\n"
