        "action": "Make cashless society illegal and make it illegal for shops only accept cards.",
        "additional_details": "1) Cashless society is inherently fascist; it gives banks too much control over the population, and allows for every movement a person takes to be tracked, which is an extreme violation of privacy. This is problematic for victims of domestic abuse particularly as their partner's could cut off their account or could work out where they are by tracking where payments were made.\r\n2) Cashless society is anti-homeless. You need an address to open a bank account, homeless people do not have an address.",
        "background": "1) Make it illegal for shops to deny customers the option to pay with cash - cash is legal tender and should remain as such.\r\n2) Make sure that safe and sanitary cash points/ ATMs are available in all town centres.",
