        "action": "No charges for those who removed and sunk the statue of Edward Colston",
        "additional_details": "The continued subjection of Bristol's black community to the glorifying of a man responsible for the trade and deaths of many thousands of black lives, amounts to a continued oppression of this community, as would any charges brought against those responsible for the statue's demise.\r\n\r\nThe City of Bristol failed to recognise and act on previous requests for the statue's removal. To provide a truly equal society, the continued oppression, through proposed charges, cannot be tolerated.",
        "background": "We seek to have all charges waived against those identified as responsible for the removal and disposal of the Edward Colston statue during the BLM Protest in Bristol on 7June 2020. This statue was a constant and painful reminder of the suffering caused by Colston to many thousands of black people.",
