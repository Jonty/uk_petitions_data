        "additional_details": "England is entering the deepest recession on record and the younger generation will be hit the hardest. Downgrading thousands places more barriers and hinders the future of a generation who have already suffered enough. An increase in overall results caused by the original teacher predictions is a negligible impact as opposed to the impact on the mental health and futures of students. The Scottish Government realised teachers knew students better than an algorithm why can the UK Government not?",
        "background": "On the 13th of August 39% of all A-Level grades were downgraded from the teacher assessed grades that were submitted. These downgrades have seemingly been made from a place of prejudice based on postcodes and the type of institution. We want all downgrading removed of the 2020 A-Level results.",
