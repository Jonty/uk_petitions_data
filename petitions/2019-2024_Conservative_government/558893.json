However, we need to pay for a sanitary product in public restrooms which we don\u2019t always have spare change for. There are also some shops that will not be selling them as they aren\u2019t classed as essential which is not acceptable. At the end of the day, these products do happen to be a necessity to us girls and women. What would you do if you couldn\u2019t afford a sanitary product? What would you do if you couldn\u2019t buy one?",
        "background": "We would like you to consider our query and if it isn\u2019t possible to do exactly what we are asking maybe modify it slightly.",
