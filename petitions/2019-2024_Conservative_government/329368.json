        "additional_details": "A school is unlikely to give a student a grade they would absolutely be unable to achieve, it weakens their relationships with colleges and unis. This year thousands of students have had the power over their futures ripped away by coronavirus, and then again by the government deciding to change any grades.\r\nThe government cannot decide on a whim which students will suffer. There is no guarantee they will not take away the place of an A* student simply because things are not 'average' this year.",
        "background": "The Government has decided it may be necessary to reduce 1/3rd of the grades predicted for GCSE and A-Level students this year. This should not occur - teachers who have known students for years are likely to give more accurate predictions compared to the government.",
