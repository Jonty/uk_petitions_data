        "additional_details": "Diesel has less carbon footprint than petrol and diesel vehicles are more efficient than petrol. It is petrol which has an extra stage and extra cost to its manufacture not diesel.  Thus there is no justification for the present lack of parity with diesel at the pumps averaging some 15p more than petrol! Thus forcing fuel retailers to bring back parity between diesel and petrol prices will lighten the blow of cost of living increases for motorists and reduce food transportation costs.  All essential  with so many people facing post-pandemic poverty.",
