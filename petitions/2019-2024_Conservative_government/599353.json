        "action": "Ban plastic greenwashing in the homecare category",
        "additional_details": "The UK\u2019s 27.8 million households each use an average of 25 cleaning bottles a year, that\u2019s 50,000 tonnes of plastic. Although the government claims that almost half of UK\u2019s plastic packaging gets recycled, in reality it's less than 10%. Meanwhile, consumers are unaware that most of their 'recyclable' plastic packing will end up in incinerators and landfills. A ban on plastic greenwashing and more transparency around recycling is needed to enable consumers to make better informed, green choices.",
        "background": "Many homecare brands promote their refillable products as eco-friendly, but omit that they are packaged in plastic that will likely not be recycled. We want a ban on this greenwashing and a mandate for brands to disclose what really happens to their packaging & what they do to minimise plastic usage",
