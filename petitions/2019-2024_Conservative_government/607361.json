Rectifying judicial mistakes is vital to upholding the credibility of the justice system. For each unrepresented spouse, ask whether he/she was: a) told what the other spouse claimed; b) given the evidence in time; c) told what laws apply (including case law); and d) informed of the process and told when to attend court. The answer \u2018no\u2019 to any one of these questions indicates a miscarriage of justice.",
