        "action": "Offer 'front-line workers' at the testing centres Covid-19 vaccinations.",
        "additional_details": "Many staff who work at the drive through testing centres are leaning into cars and swabbing people. We have not been offered the vaccine because we have 'sufficient PPE' and are not in close contact with patients. However, most centres see hundreds of possible Covid positive patients a day. If we can reach 10,000 signatures the government will be able to persuade the companies that hire the testing staff to look into offering a vaccine for these key workers.",
        "background": "Front line key-workers at testing centres are not being offered the vaccine despite the fact they are putting themselves at risk of exposure on a daily basis. \r\n'Many people applaud us for our efforts but yet we are not treated as the 'key-workers' that we are perceived to be.'",
