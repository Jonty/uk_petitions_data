The is now recognition that in time of need, our expert medical and support staff are there for the nation without thought for their own safety. The Armed Forces have a day dedicated to them and it is now time to consider the commitment made, which is equally heroic, by an NHS which has often been taken for granted.",
        "background": "The Government should move to create a National Health Service Day, by means of a public holiday (or on an existing Bank Holiday). This is to recognise the daily sacrifice of those frontline & support staff who risk their own health for the sake of others. Let\u2019s celebrate those who make up the NHS.",
