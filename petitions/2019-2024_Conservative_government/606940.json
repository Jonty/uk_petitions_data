        "additional_details": "Searching for an affordable home in Devon & Cornwall, the majority of properties have a restriction that they cannot be lived in or have to be a 2nd home. This is unfair on locals who cannot even afford a 1st home. Please help local people have a chance to own their own homes. open up more opportunities for local communities to thrive due to continuous occupancy, thus securing local jobs. Rental prices have spiked & even this option is expensive. Help low earners to buy their own homes.",
        "background": "Lots of affordable properties in Devon and Cornwall are restricted to holiday use only or have to be second homes. This is making it almost impossible for local people to afford a property in their country.",
