These animals are wild - fighting and breeding out of control. \r\n\r\nRescues are seeing their vets bills and food/litter and medicine costs are increasing while they try to help these cats.\r\n\r\nIts time to give rescues funding to help them try control the issue of stray cats - its time to make neutering/spaying and chipping cats compulsary. Its time to educate people more on pet care.",

Rescues rely on these events to give them money for food/litter/vets and medicines. The amount of cats needing help has increased tenfold.",
