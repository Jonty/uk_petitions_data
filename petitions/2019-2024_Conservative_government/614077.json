        "additional_details": "Channel 4 isn't there to complete against Amazon and Netflix. It is there to provide universal content that reflects the diversity of the UK. It already commissions shows from a wide range of creatives across the UK and does not need to be privatised for this to continue.\r\n\r\nChannel 4 should remain publicly owned so that it can continue to service the UK public.",
        "background": "The government should not privatise Channel 4. The channel is not publicly funded, receiving all its income through advertising and sales, and is therefore no drain on finances.\r\n\r\nGovernment ownership does not hold it back as evidenced through its excellent schedule and streaming services.",
