The UK citizens are unable to self isolate with commitment while their covid status remains unknown. This presents problems for alerting contacts, attending work and assessing risk.\r\nMany presentations are now emerging without history of travel/ with other flu symptoms, excluding these people from testing while claiming to increase test capacity is disingenuous & poor epidemiological rationale. The NHS needs accurate figures.",

The government needs to mandate testing of those who need to self isolate as well as those admitted. It must relax travel criteria for tests",
