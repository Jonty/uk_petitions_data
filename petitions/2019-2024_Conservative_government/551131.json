        "additional_details": "The cost of a full UBI for the United Kingdom is \u00a367 billion per year.\r\nThis figure is the net cost of a UBI scheme of \u00a37,706 for adults and \u00a33,853 for children. According to the Guardian in 2015, the UK currently spends over \u00a393 billion per year on corporate subsidies and tax breaks. The UK could entirely fund a UBI by eliminating corporate subsidies and tax loopholes. No increase in taxes would be necessary, and the government would still have \u00a326 billion available for subsidies.",
        "background": "Introduce a Universal Basic Income within the UK, this will exist to stop child poverty, the reliance on food banks, and the ability to meet payments for rent. This should be for every family, as these things should be seen as a right.",
