It is of great concern that privately owned businesses would be and are able to request bailouts from the Government, and such businesses can be funded by taxpayers without public consultation or consent. It is not acceptable for the UK Government to make decisions that have far reaching financial impacts on taxpayers without public approval and consultation.",
