        "action": "Immediately approve NHS Covid tests tor all purposes including travel.",
        "additional_details": "The NHS is a world class service and offers free tests for Covid. But these tests are not approved for travel by our very own government. Government websites are not clear enough so families trying to reconnect after so long apart and who, in good faith, get an NHS test are being turned away at airports. They lose money? Have to pay exorbitant fees for private tests and pay more to book new travel tickets. COVID is tough enough. Government should help, not add to the burden.",
        "background": "We urge the government to immediately approve the free NHS Covid tests for all needs including travel, work and care home visits. Further, government must stop, with immediate effect, the scandal of private charging for tests. Add a donate option to NHS tests instead.",
