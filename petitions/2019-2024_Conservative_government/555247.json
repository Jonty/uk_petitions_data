        "additional_details": "Speaking to the venues & suppliers, everyone is using the same excuse, that due to the government guidelines we are not issuing any refunds. We understand that weddings of 15 people can happen, but the cost will still be in the thousands rather than the \u00a3100s where a hall could just be hired out for a smaller wedding. Many do not want to get married anymore due to covid-19 and just to the civil(legal) marriage, however venues/suppliers keeping the deposits is leaving everyone with no choice.",
        "background": "Issue a refund to everyone that has made a deposit for wedding, venues, food, decorations and other suppliers related to wedding. Due to Covid-19 a lot of wedding have been cancelled but venues and suppliers are refusing to refund the deposit back even though no service as been provided as promised.",
