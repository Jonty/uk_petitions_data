Yet people who we owe money too on a monthly basis are still expecting 100% of the money to be paid, for most of us that 80% just isn\u2019t enough to cover all 100% of the bills each month. A reduction in outgoings will help the citizens of the United Kingdom keep a little bit more in control of finances.",
