Candidates should be considered for entry-level positions upon education and personal skills.",
        "background": "Make new legalizations to safeguard graduates and potential employees with little or no previous employment experience when applying for entry-level positions. To protect those, the government must establish a legal framework that businesses can follow when applying for jobs.",
