        "action": "Provide post-study work visas to international graduates of 2020 due to COVID-19",
        "additional_details": "All students come to universities with dreams to become professionals in various fields. School fees is expensive and is even more expensive for foreign students, paying around double to get the same education. However, foreign students are regarded merely as a source of income whose value expires as their visa expires. We are in desperate need to be given an equal opportunity to continue pursuing career paths after graduation. COVID-19 and its impact on the economy is a real threat to thousands of graduates this year and international students, among them, should not be unfairly penalized in this unprecedented event. Please allow international graduates more time to look for a job after graduation in 2020.",
        "background": "International graduates of this year should also be included in the government\u2019s policy to grant two-year post-study work visas. Finding a job within the current 4-months\u2019 allowance is extremely difficult with COVID-19 severely affecting the economy and the time required for its recovery is unknown.",
