        "additional_details": "Schools in China have been closed since January. In other countries such as Italy, Spain and the Middle East, schools have been closed for a while.  In the UK, schools have just now closed, and exams have been cancelled for them, yet are still scheduled to be sat by international students. Students are competing for the same places at university, and forcing one group of pupils who have had a far worse educational journey to sit exams while another does not have to, is not fair, or consistent.",
        "background": "The government should make the education system fair for everyone.  Exam boards should cancel exams in countries where schools have been closed for a period of time that is the same as, or more than, the UK. International GCSE and A levels planned to take place in the UK should also be cancelled.",
