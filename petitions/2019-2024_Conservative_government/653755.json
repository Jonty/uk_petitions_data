        "additional_details": "I would like to make period products  free for women across the uk.  With a third of women and girls who don\u2019t have access to menstrual products, it is important and more sanitary for women to have access to these products. It also helps with gender equality by forcing girls to pay for these hygienic products, it is a monthly commitment that men across the country do not have to pay for. This is all without even addressing period poverty which effects 21% of women across the country.",
        "background": "I would like the government to make period products free across the uk.I feel that this is important for manger reason but the main two which are gender inequality and period poverty. With forcing women to have to pay this monthly fee that they have to pay to be sanitary it takes money from women",
