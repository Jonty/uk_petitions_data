        "additional_details": "The UK government should treat the IGCSE exams as they have the GCSE exams and cancel them for the current year 11. This will bring peace to those who have not had much time spent inside schools and out students at a greater disadvantage than those from other countries, thus lower grades.",
        "background": "The IGCSE examinations are set to carry on as normal this school year.These need to be cancelled due to our lack of education this year as well as many students take both IGCSE and GCSE so would make no sense for them to only take half their examinations.",
