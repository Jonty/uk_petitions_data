        "additional_details": "I have a lease on an apartment sold to me and many investors across the globe on the pretence of a guaranteed net income of 8 to 10%. The scheme failed leaving us to pay extortionate charges on the development one of which is ground rent of \u00a3750 p.a. We believe the developer colluded with the new freeholder to sell the freehold at a grossly inflated price thus saddling leaseholders with unaffordable ground rents. This practice is rife, as is extortionate inflation clauses in some leases.",
        "background": "Some freeholders are deliberately inflating freehold values when selling existing freeholds resulting in excessively high ground rents.\r\nSome freeholders impose draconian inflation clauses into leases resulting in unaffordable rises in ground rents.\r\nBoth these practices must be abolished.",
