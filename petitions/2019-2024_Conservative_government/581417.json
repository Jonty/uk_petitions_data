        "additional_details": "Single-use plastics, like ice cream spoons, account for over 40% of plastic waste. Single-use plastic ice cream spoons are like plastic straws. They end up binned or littering our towns and seafronts. These spoons then contribute to marine plastic pollution. One of the best ways to reduce marine plastic is to reduce single-use plastics. Ice cream sellers can provide a reusable spoon or wooden spoon for take-aways, still offering customers a choice for how they eat their ice cream.",
        "background": "Ban anywhere selling ice creams (including cafes, ice cream vans, take-aways, restaurants, pubs, shops, cinemas, theatres and events) from supplying them with a single-use plastic spoon. Instead, they can only supply a reusable spoon or a wooden spoon that is biodegradable.",
