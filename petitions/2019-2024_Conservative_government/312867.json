        "additional_details": "Transport for London (TFL) have massively reduced the number of tubes running during the coronavirus pandemic causing overcrowding on their networks despite the fact that there are a lot fewer commuters. This is putting our essential workers including NHS Doctors and Nurses at a much higher risk of infection. This is likely to be one of the biggest contributors to the spread of Covid-19 in the UK at the present time and therefore it is paramount that it is resolved as soon as possible.",

If this is not possible the government must ensure more staff are brought in.",
