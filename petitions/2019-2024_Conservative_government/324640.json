        "action": "Replace all flammable cladding on buildings in the UK",
        "additional_details": "We can never again let another tragedy like Grenfell happen. The Government not taking action on this issue will cost more lives. The compatible cladding ban was welcomed but there is no plan in place to replace the cladding on many remaining unsafe buildings and landlords are not taking the required action. \r\n\r\nThe former housing secretary said that all private sector buildings with ACM cladding would be fixed by June 2020. It is June 2020 and we are a long way away. This needs to be prioritised.",
        "background": "The Grenfell Tower fire occurred as a result of flammable cladding and inadequate safety measures. Three years on the problem still remains with thousands across the country living in unsafe buildings. Banning cladding is not enough, we call on the Government to replace all flammable cladding.",
