As proven vaccinated people can spread it too, so why they don't have to do pre- dep test and unvaccinated people do.We don't want to be punished for our choices. Vaccine passports do not prevent spreading the virus. Many studies proved that vaccinated people have the same viral load as unvaccinated so based on that they should not be segregated",

We want to be treated the same as people that have been vaccinated as having vaccine doesn't stop them from spreading or catching as proven.",
