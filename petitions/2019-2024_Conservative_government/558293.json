        "additional_details": "After the backlog caused by the last ban on driving tests, those who have a test booked in will most likely be pushed back for months, resulting in possible job losses and more risk of covid cases by using public transport. Allowing tests to go ahead would be the practical route, reducing transmission from around 50 people on a tube to 2 people in a car. And if this isn\u2019t possible, those who had theirs booked in November should be the first priority to get booked in ASAP when lockdown is lifted",
        "background": "During the 2nd lockdown, those who have an appointment and especially key workers should be allowed to take practical driving tests. Many people are relying on passing these tests for their jobs and families.",
