        "additional_details": "If the government suspends normal life to control the corona virus spread, the cost of this decision must be shared by everyone. Not just more credit given or payment holidays. The impact on certain sections of the population of not being able to operate will be massive and very potentially irrecoverable. By taking this action we will reduce business failures and encourage the compliance of everyone with the requirements, so we can all get back to work when it is over.",
        "background": "No-one should be paid for the duration; politicians, banks, employees, directors, energy companies, banks, doctors, self employed, benefits, hotels, investors, teachers, mechanics etc etc etc. That way everyone pays for the cost of corona virus and everyone is equally committed to eliminating it.",
