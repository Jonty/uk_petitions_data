        "action": "Require mental health support in schools and more funding in community services",
        "additional_details": "It is common for people to have wait times exceeding several months for beds in appropriate hospitals and years for support in the community. I waited months for a hospital to accept me and it was over 220 miles away from my home. I am very grateful for the treatment I have had and continue to receive, however, better community services and more rapid access may have prevented my need for hospitalization. There are many issues in the system I want to bring attention to and hope you recognize the need for improvement.",
        "background": "Funding for inpatient mental health services is lacking and prevention is better than cure. Early intervention is vital for reducing suicide as a leading cause of death in teenagers. If mental health support in schools improved, the number of people in hospitals would reduce.",
