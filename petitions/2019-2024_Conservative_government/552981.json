        "additional_details": "Field trips have also been cancelled which our tuition fee was to pay for. Online learning can lead students experience signs of social isolation, lack of concentration, and is very limited on the amount of personal feedback you can receive for each assignment. There has been little, if any information provided by tutors since COVID-19 and has made many students feel as if they do not want to return. Overall, university quality is poor this year and certainly not worth up to \u00a39,250.",
        "background": "All students should be reimbursed or given a reduction of this years tuition fees as universities are now online only due to COVID-19, with only online powerpoints, podcasts and zoom lives for learning materials which is not worthy of \u00a39,250.",
