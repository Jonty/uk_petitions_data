        "action": "Cancel GCSE and A-Level Examinations In England",
        "additional_details": "Most students in the UK suffered from no face to face teaching from March-September. This coupled with the inequity of the amount of face to face teaching in Schools and Sixth forms from September-December with some operating a rotation of being in school one week and at home the other. Furthermore, expecting A-Level students in England to compete with those from Scotland who have been given Teacher Assessed Grades to get places for the September 2021 intake for Universities is not just.",
        "background": "Due to the disruption caused by COVID-19, Scotland have scrapped exams entirely and are judging their year 11 and 13 students with teacher assessed grades. Wales have also cancelled examinations as we know them. \r\nStudents usually would have under 2 years of uninterrupted face to face teaching.",
