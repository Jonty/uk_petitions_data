        "additional_details": "This may sound small to some people but to a large number of people if effects, it is such an inconvenience having to produce ID to buy an energy drink if you look under 25.\u00a0\r\nYou can legally buy them at 16 so proving your age unless you look over 25 seems extremely excessive. Refusing service to someone who\u2019s 16 because of this is understandable, but refusing people 18+ for an energy drink because of no ID is not only over the top, but it is demeaning to be IDd for this when you are over 18.",
        "background": "This policy needs to be removed so that stores are unable to implement this. Not everyone has ID/always carries it round with them. Aside from this; It can cause a lot of distress for people with disabilities like Autism who are clearly of age but may not look it nor have their ID on them.",
