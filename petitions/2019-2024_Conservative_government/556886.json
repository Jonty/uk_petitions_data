        "additional_details": "Anyone that wants cannabis in the UK can have it. Making cannabis illegal has not worked. Legalisation in Canada saw no increase in recriational use and a reduction in alcohol consumption. A regulated market will create jobs & tax revenue from this \u00a31 Billion industry. Cannabis consumes a considerable amount of police time which can be better used elsewhere. Ask any police officer, and they will never have dealt with anyone causing trouble while high on cannabis. Same cant be said for alcohol.",
        "background": "Legalise the recreational use of cannabis in the UK. Regulate the market so that the potency can be controlled, divert money away from organised crime and crackdown on cannabis use amonsct minors. Use the tax revinue for community projects and to create jobs.",
