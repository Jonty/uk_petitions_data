        "additional_details": "At 16 in the UK, a person has full medical autonomy equal to that of an adult under the NHS. If 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds are in full control of their own medical decisions, why can't getting the vaccine be one of these decisions that 16 and 17-year-olds allowed to make? \r\nFurthermore, this incredibly mobile age group is well educated on the subject, more so than any other age group, as the age group would have all recently studied vaccines in a science or biology class.",
        "background": "The uptake in COVID-19 vaccinations is down in the UK but we have the resources and infrastructure to deliver more vaccines. With the case rise under the more deadly Delta variant as well as the Gamma variant beginning to enter into the UK, we need to do more to protect the population.",
