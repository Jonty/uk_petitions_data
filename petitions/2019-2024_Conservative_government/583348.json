When really it is us, the fans, who built the sport to what it has become. So many of us pay our hard earned money to watch our team play in the premier league and champions and for that to be taken away by greedy businessmen is not right. \r\nIt\u2019ll destroy our sport and before we know there will be no \u2018football\u2019 and grassroots sports will be nonexistent",

The Culture Secretary said that the Government would back the football authorities to stop this move, and if the football authorities couldn\u2019t act, the Government would. The Culture Secretary said the Government would \"put everything on the table to prevent this from happening.\"\r\n\r\nYou can read the Culture Secretary's full statement on the European Super League here: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-by-oliver-dowden-on-the-european-super-league\r\n\r\nYou can read a report about the English clubs' withdrawal from the European Super League here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/56823501.\r\n\r\nFurther, on 19 April the Government announced a 'Fan-led review of football governance', which will explore ways of improving the governance, ownership and financial sustainability of clubs in English football, building on the strengths of the football pyramid.
