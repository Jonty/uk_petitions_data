However, isolating classes during an outbreak is harmful: the vulnerable children and those without access to online lessons also isolate so are being denied safety and education. Children feel insecure because life is unpredictable, parents have to find ways of delivering and collecting siblings when one child isolates. We need to be pro active.",
