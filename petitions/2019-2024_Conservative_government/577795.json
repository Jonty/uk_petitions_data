        "additional_details": "How are we expected to pay bills and buy food without any money coming in? People on furlough get their money every month so why do self employed people have to wait 3 months without money.\r\nThe last grant was paid in November for November - December - January. We can not afford to be without money for this long.\r\nPlease sign this petition if you need the 4th grant now not 3 months in arrears.",
        "background": "We would like the government to pay out the 4th grant earlier as it is planned to pay out at the end of April for February- March- April which is 3 months in arrears we can not afford to be without any money coming in for 3 months.",
