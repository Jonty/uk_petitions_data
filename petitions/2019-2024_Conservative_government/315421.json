        "additional_details": "More specifically I am referring to the people who continue to gather in large groups for parties/bbqs/outdoor or indoor activities with people out with their household. The regulations have been put in place to protect the entire country and the people who are flouting the rules are not taking this into consideration and it is slowing down the whole process of flattening the curve. Everyone wants the lockdown to end but it can't unless everybody is on board, it isn't fair to the people abiding.",
        "background": "I propose higher on the spot fines are given to those found to be breaching these rules (one for each member of the gathering) with this money going to the NHS. \u00a360 (reduced to \u00a330 if paid in 14 days) is not that much money to some people and clearly not enough to deter them from breaking the rules.",
