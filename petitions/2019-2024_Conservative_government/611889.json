        "additional_details": "The statistical evidence I have researched is 22/23 the minimum hourly rate for care visit should be roughly \u00a330 to ensure NMW of \u00a39.50, travel time and running costs. Funding from Hampshire county council and WHCCG is below this amount, which means care companies are going to struggle financially and will not be able to put hourly rates up much above NMW to compete for workers. Already there are immense shortages across the sector and to attract workers we need to offer something unique to us.",
        "background": "By Tax exempt, I mean to give those affected by funding restrictions an alternative incentive for workers by giving them either a reduced tax allowance or exempt from paying tax due to the profession they are in which is limited by government funding preventing pay increases comparable to workload.",
