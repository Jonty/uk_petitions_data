        "additional_details": "2017-2019 intakes of student nurses will have between \u00a330-70k debt hanging over their heads for the next 30 years. These student nurses struggle financially and mentally trying to survive on an extremely low income with no extra help from the government. \r\n\r\nIt is unfair and unjust to forget about the 1000\u2019s of student nurses in these intakes who have missed out immensely on funding and have to pay back tuition fees and received no NHS bursary yet students from 2020 will receive \u00a35,000pa funding.",
        "background": "We would like the government to scrap the tuition fees for nurses starting their course in 2017-19 or back pay student nurses \u00a35,000 non repayable funding due to new government funding for student nurses commencing their course after 2020.",
