SAGE, teaching unions, and teaching staff, are all advising that sending children to school is not safe in the current climate. We do not know enough about how the new variant affects children to be sure that schools are safe environments. Many parents and guardians want to ensure the safety of their children by homeschooling them. It is unfair that these parents may be fined for unauthorised absences.",
