        "action": "Do not open fully secondary schools from September",
        "additional_details": "Over 1,000 students plus staff wouldn\u2019t be safe for absolutely everyone to attend. A survey conducted by Kings College and Ipsos Mori have revealed that less than half of parents are comfortable of sending their children back to school in September. With a 2nd wave being widely reported, we believe that there should be a rota so that students still get an education and also for the risk of the virus to be lowered.",
        "background": "We request that the Department of Education only partially reopen secondary schools via a rota meaning that only certain year groups come in on certain days. Y7, 10 and 12 for 3 days a week and Y8 and 9 for the other 2. For Y11 and Y13 give calculated grades for their qualifications.",
