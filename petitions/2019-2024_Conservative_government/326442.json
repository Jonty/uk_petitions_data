        "additional_details": "After seeing the London protests on the 6/6/2020 and seeing the dangers involved when using police horses to gain control, it has compelled me to start this petition for the welfare of horses and others. It isn\u2019t just horses that are at risk. It is also the police officers themselves and the general public. As you are most likely aware a police officer came off her horse when it bolted due to the protesters becoming aggressive and violent in their actions.",
        "background": "I would like the government to put into force that police horses are no longer used in protests/riots/events/public order incidents/crowd control or any other activity that may cause harm and distress to police horses. Horses should not be used as a tool to aid human needs.",
