        "additional_details": "The Clipstone Army Cadets Detachment has been there for over 60 years and provides a safe and productive place for the young people of Clipstone and the surrounding areas to go. It gives them self confidence and opens them up to opportunities they may not have been able to have. The majority of the cadets who parade walk to the detachment and moving the detachment to to another area (as is planned) would mean that they would not be able to continue.",
        "background": "We want the MOD or whoever has chosen Clipstone Detachment to be closed in September 2022 to reverse the decison and keep it open. We want to be able to persue other options of keeping it within Clipstone either in the same building or a different one.",
