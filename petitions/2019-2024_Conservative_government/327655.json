Persecuting trans people will not protect a single survivor or reopen one of the many refuges shut by this same government.Trans women are already being systematically excluded from the domestic and sexual violence support they need, and we are committed to speaking up for our trans siblings.",
        "background": "We want the government to stand by the 70% of people who responded to the GRA reform consultation in support of greater rights for trans people, and to refuse to continue the persecution of trans people through blocking their right to self-identify their gender and exclusion from same-sex spaces.",
