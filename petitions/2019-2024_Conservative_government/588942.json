        "additional_details": "Many new build estates have large open areas of lawn and other poorly designed gardens that could be much better used to engage people and improve the environment. I propose a rethink in the way that spaces are used and designed. Rather than continuing to use monoculture and planting areas of little ecological value, principles of rewilding, permaculture and mycology can be bought into an urban design setting to improve the land over time rather than continue the trend of nutrient removal.",
        "background": "Land on new build housing estates is usually turfed or has minimal landscaping that is not conducive to ecological best practices. Open public areas and other landscaped areas should be designed for communal human use alongside ecological use to rewild land and improve biodiversity.",
