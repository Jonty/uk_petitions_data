        "additional_details": "The hospitality industry is the third largest industry in the UK with many thousands of jobs at stake. Choosing not to officially close restaurants, bars, hotels and other venues and instead putting the onus on consumers and business owners is both a dangerous and unfair decision. Businesses cannot make insurance claims for business interruption in this situation. Other countries have declared large sums for support of SMEs including in hospitality, the UK Government must do the same.",
        "background": "We need:\r\n\r\nFunding (VAT payment holidays, contributions to cover wages and fixed costs, legislation to defer rent and utilities) while businesses are affected.\r\n\r\nAn order to close rather than advice to the public not to go out, so customers have clarity and businesses can claim against insurance.",
