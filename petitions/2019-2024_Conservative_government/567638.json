        "additional_details": "In the Prime Ministers announcement of the third national lockdown he announced that GCSES and A-levels can not take place this year with the continued disruption to education. I would like to ask how university students are expected to complete exams and assessments in similar conditions to that of GCSE and A-level students. There has been no support this year or acknowledgment that online learning does negatively impact some students grades.",
        "background": "A fair decision needs to be made and reinforced across all universities. University students deserve to have the fairest grades awarded to them as has been introduced for GCSE and A-level students. Whether this would mean introducing a safety net or lowering the Grade Boundaries.",
