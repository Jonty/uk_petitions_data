The village has no street lights, a small oversubscribed doctors surgery, limited public transport that does not run in the evenings or weekends and a small oversubscribed primary school. Due to the incompetence of our local authority in now producing a 5 year plan, us residents are now at the mercy of developers who use this loophole to line their pockets.",
