Imposing a National Insurance increase equally makes it feel like key workers that worked throughout the pandemic are having to pay for the furlough scheme for those who did not work during the pandemic.\r\n \r\nI believe key workers should at least have their National Insurance fixed at the previous rate for at least a few years.",
        "background": "I want the Government to reverse the new National Insurance increase for key workers who put their life on the line during the pandemic. Instead these key workers should only have to pay the same rate of National Insurance as prior to the recent increase.",
