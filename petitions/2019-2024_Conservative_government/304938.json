        "additional_details": "Previous generations have, at times of war, celebrated the valour, service and sacrifice of those who fought to defend the nation through the awarding of campaign medals.\r\n\r\nCovid-19 is a national emergency which has placed the UK on a war-like footing.\r\n\r\nA thankful nation wishes to celebrate and recognise all the NHS workers, including those who have come out of retirement, who have tended the sick under such challenging conditions.\r\n\r\nA medal would be a permanent reminder of the nation's gratitude.",
        "background": "A nationwide competition should be launched to design a new medal that will be awarded to all NHS staff - from surgeons, GPs and nurses through to lab technicians and porters - who, collectively, worked with such dedication, compassion and skill to see the nation through the Covid-19 crisis in 2020.",
