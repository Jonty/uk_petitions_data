AD 900-1300' listed as an example.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about the national curriculum for history at Key Stages 1 and 2 here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/239035/PRIMARY_national_curriculum_-_History.pdf\r\n\r\nYou could have a petition calling for specific content to be added to the curriculum for KS1 and 2, so long as it was clear what content you wanted to be added or what change you wanted to be made. If you do choose to start a new petition, please be sure to include your real name, as we can't accept petitions started using a fake name, or the name of an organisation.\r\n\r\nYou might like to sign this petition which calls for a related action:\r\n\r\nIncrease diversity of the history curriculum: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/601718"
