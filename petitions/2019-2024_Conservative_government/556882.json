That comment is invalidating our industry and is not a medical reason for shutting us all down, a health pandemic, is about HEALTH, and how clean a business is, and the likelihood of cross contamination. It\u2019s preposterous to close such a business for a health reason. We adhere to the highest standard of cleanliness and have a vast knowledge of cross contamination.
