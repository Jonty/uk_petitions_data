        "additional_details": "More benefits and valuable housing are being give to immigrants who should not even be in our country. We urge the government to put more money into protecting our borders and to expand sea patrols in the channel to stop crossings\r\n\r\nThis will prevent more illegal's from crossing the channel and entering our country illegally. In 2021 28,526 illegal immigrants were caught coming across the channel and rising even more to over 40,000 in 2022 so far. This will keep rising if no action will occur.",
        "background": "Thousands upon thousands of illegal immigrants are coming into our country illegally every day. This number will keep rising unless action is taken. With our home secretary signing another deal with the French it begs the question of where this money will really go.",
