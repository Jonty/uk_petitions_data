        "additional_details": "The treatment is being trialled on 400 plus patients in our group/ with the team. So far 100% of them report improvements and some have gone on to make a full recovery. We have seen people recover in as little as 8 weeks (fully recovered) and people get back to work full or part time within as little as 3,5 weeks. Will save DWP & Government money and reduce the existing burden on the NHS & get patients better. It is a viable option for patients: low impact & cheap & taken with careful management",
        "background": "This treatment has been sat on Matt Hancock's desk unresponded to. We would like it debated in the Commons as it is showing very promising results (full recovery/improvements) and given the 1.1 million people now suffering the debilitating effects, it is currently the only treatment on offer.",
