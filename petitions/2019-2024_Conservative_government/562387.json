        "additional_details": "The government rules brought mane benefits for the citizens, but caused tremendous financial difficulties to driving learners. Learners were unable to book practical driving tests during lockdowns, despite spending huge money on driving lessons which are very costly. Now most learners have forgotten their driving skills and have to retake these expensive driving lessons which cost between \u00a320 -\u00a335 per hour. In addition, an extra \u00a342 needs to be spent for expired theory certificates.",
        "background": "The government decided not to extend the expiry dates of the theory certificates\r\nLearners spent big money on taking driving lessons, but unable to book a practical driving test due to the lockdown, therefore all the spent money were wasted and driving skills forgotten.",
