        "additional_details": "No help has been given to the travel and hospitality sector. Airlines are crying out for help and emptying cash reserves. If help is not given this Christmas, many airlines will not be around next summer, putting thousands of people out of work. Most pilots are on average \u00a3100k in debt, watching their hard own careers disappear in front of them. Testing on arrival has been adopted across the globe, proven safe and is backed by the world health organization. Heathrow is ready for it.",
        "background": "The travel and hospitality sector has been completely destroyed by quarantines. Multiple countries around the world have began to help the travel sector by providing free or affordable testing on arrival into their countries. The UK travel sector can not recover until we adopt this approach.",
