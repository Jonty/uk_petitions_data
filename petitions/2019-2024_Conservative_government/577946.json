        "additional_details": "Many studies suggested that antibody positive individuals are far less likely to get and transmit SARS CoV2 - the virus causing COVID19. \r\nLimited travel within the country, as well as the mandatory quarantine after entering the UK following international travel, restrict the ability of  this group of people to work efficiently. These measures would lift the restrictions for big part of the population and accelerate the economic recovery of the United Kingdom.",
        "background": "The government and the parliament must review and debate all options to ease the Coronavirus restrictions as soon as possible. Medical, research and economic professionals should be consulted and all risks and benefits evaluated.",
