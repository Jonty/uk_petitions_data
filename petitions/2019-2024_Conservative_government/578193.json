        "additional_details": "Ebay profits from all sales made by its sellers. EBay should therefore be held accountable for their part in scamming its customers out hundreds of pounds by allowing its sellers to hoard and profit from other people's misery, from its customers desperate attempts to get their hands on the PS5 and Xbox S.\r\n\r\nSome consoles are selling for over \u00a31000, no warranty and no shop bought guarantee, yet more than double their actual worth, and Ebay takes 10% of each sale. \r\n\r\nThis is disgusting and wrong.",
        "background": "Ebay currently has 2599 PS5 consoles for sale at highly over inflated prices.\r\nI want the government to make it illegal for websites such as Ebay and their sellers from profiting in this way.\r\n\r\nIt's a disgusting way to treat their customers and is contributing to the shortage of next gen consoles.",
