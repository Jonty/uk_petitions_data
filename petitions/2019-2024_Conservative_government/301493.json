In China alone there has been 80,790 cases and 3,158 deaths. It is increasing all around the world. The only way of stopping this virus is not through medicine like antibiotics as thats only for bacteria, but to stay at home until it naturally disappears. It is becoming a global epidemic. If one student was ill then pass on to the rest of class who would then spread & go home pass on.",
        "background": "The UK government should call for an immediate shutdown of Schools, Colleges and places of work. It will only keep on spreading if we are continuing to have contact with people.\r\n\r\nMore deaths will increase, as a result as people are not isolating. So, far there has been 8 deaths and 382 cases alone",
