        "additional_details": "Currently, the only required Citizenship education a school has to teach is lessons that are done during form time. Voter apathy in the UK is rising, and education is one of the best ways to combat an issue such as it. In 2021, just under 0.5% of students in the UK had a GCSE Citizenship Studies entry. For such an important subject that could change the nation, schools should absolutely have more access to it.",
        "background": "In most UK schools, Citizenship is only taught during form time. It should be taught through KS3 just like many other subjects (e.g. French, Mathematics, English) and possibly as an option for GCSEs.",
