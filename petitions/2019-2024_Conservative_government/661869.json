        "additional_details": "Set up in 1948, the British Youth Council has allowed many young people (11-18) to become advocates for change in their local communities. With over 500,000 young people voting on issues they want to tackle, they have been left feeling silenced and unable to partake in changing their communities for the better. We want the Government to set up a funded a Youth Parliament that allows the youth to learn important life skills, educate themselves and become advocates for change and we need your help",
        "background": "After the closing of the British Youth Council due to financial issues, many young people have been left without a voice, we want to change that. We want the Government to set up a funded Youth Parliament that allows the youth of today to get involved in politics, not having to worry about funding",
