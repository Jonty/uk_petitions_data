        "additional_details": "Looking back on world war 2 and nazi concentration camps, as a country and as individuals we agreed we would not sit by and let it happen again; however, this has the capacity to grow into a situation equally or more severe.\r\nMuslims are being put in 're-education' centres to try and convert them. This is a clear breach of human rights and one can only imagine the rates of illness, death and neglect in these camps.\r\nThe government has a moral duty as a leading world power to make a difference",
        "background": "The British government should become a leading foreign power in the denouncement of muslim concentration camps in China, this includes:\r\n - Publicly denouncing what is happening\r\n - Become a leading voice in international parliaments\r\n - Issue appropriate sanctions and punishments",
