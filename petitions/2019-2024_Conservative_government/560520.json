        "additional_details": "To have a number of unelected people approving or rejecting laws based on either their hereditary titles or through their achievements which have zero bearing on public policy is completely undemocratic.\r\nAppointments to the house which represent only the ruling party are also undemocratic. \r\nThere should be an upper and lower house is any functioning democracy however both should be made up of wholly elected members. This will allow the ruling part of the day to be held to account fairly.",
        "background": "The House of Lords as a policy approving body should be changed from its current state as a wholly unelected body and replaced with a fully elected set of members. This election cycle should run in line with the general election cycle.",
