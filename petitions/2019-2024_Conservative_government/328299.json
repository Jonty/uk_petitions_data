        "additional_details": "The Gender Recognition Act is clearly inaccessible - an estimated 12% of trans people have legally changed gender, whilst the National LGBT Survey showed that 92% of trans people were interested in doing so. To address this we need a reform that allows people over the age of 16 to self declare their identity, and for under 16\u2019s to do so with their guardians consent. We also need Non-binary identities to be recognised under the act, and for the Spousal Vesto to be removed.",
        "background": "The Gender Recognition Act is outdated and very inaccessible for transgender people due to its many unfair restrictions, high cost and long waiting times. Despite a poll winning a 70% majority agreement for these reforms, the government has still decided to not go forward with them.",
