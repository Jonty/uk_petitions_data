        "additional_details": "Blood clotting cases for the 30-39 age band are at a rate of 0.8/100,000. This compares to the 2.7/100,000 of intensive care admittances. Given the UK\u2019s low infection rate, the above data indicates there is too much risk associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine when compared to ICU admittance rates. Following the guidelines of EU countries, the UK government should reconsider the health and safety of its population above 30 years, offering an alternative jab to reduce further clotting cases.",
