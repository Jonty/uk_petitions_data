If we went on lockdown this wouldn\u2019t be a problem because people wouldn\u2019t be able to leave their house and spread COVID-19.  There also wouldn\u2019t be a massive food shortage as people couldn\u2019t get out unnecessarily. It is also putting a huge strain on the NHS and the workers which is terrible for us and also them.",

Especially the vulnerable and elderly.The fact the government isn\u2019t actually doing enough is disgusting.Look at all the measures other countries are taking and compare it to the UK",
