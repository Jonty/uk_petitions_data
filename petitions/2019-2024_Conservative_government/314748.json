        "additional_details": "If we reduce the work week to 4 days, people will be happier with their lives, their families and their jobs. \r\n\r\nRight now, people are generally unhappy in the UK. \r\n\r\nWe have seen an increase in mental health issues such as depression and stress, lack of important family time, which is vital to societal development.\r\n\r\nIf people are overworked and not well-rested, this creates a hostile setting for society. \r\n\r\nWe currently have an unhealthy system, which is having a detrimental effect on society.",
        "background": "Legislate and reduce the Work Week to 4 days. \r\n\r\nThe current 5 day work week system does not work. \r\n\r\nWe want the Government/Parliament to take example modelling from other countries that have this and benefit from it first and foremost by having a happier society.",
