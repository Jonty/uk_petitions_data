        "additional_details": "As it stands the broad rules around closure of childcare and schools means that individual small setting childcare providers such as childminders won't be able to remain open except for the children of key workers, hurting their income. Childminders are there to support our economy. The Minister has said that schools will open for children of key worker and vulnerable children and this is an acceptable risk because of the smaller of classes. Therefore it must be that small settings are safe?",
