I do not mind this but I do mind them pushing their staff to the limit unnecessarily. \r\nArea managers are imposing higher targets on stores and even cutting the staff hours at the same time: this is greed.\r\nStaff have worked through the scary early days, not knowing how to stay safe and have continued to provide us with our groceries throughout. Staff have endured abuse for simply asking customers to wear a mask! Let's reward them.",
