        "action": "Reinstate the \u00a3200 million aid package to Yemen as pledged in 2019/2020",
        "additional_details": "Yemen is the site of the world's worst humanitarian crisis. After six years of war the people of Yemen are at the brink of famine, suffering the impacts of climate change, and facing the global pandemic with ever diminishing international support. While the US has announced an end 'for all offensive operations' in the war in Yemen including the sale of arms, Britain has made no such pledge. Continuing to supply arms to the Saudis while cutting aid to Yemen is barbaric and unconscionable.",
        "background": "The government should reinstate the ambitious and essential target of providing Yemen with a \u00a3200 million aid package as delivered in 2019/202. This money is vital for famine relief and the provision of basic medical care in a country experiencing full state collapse.",
