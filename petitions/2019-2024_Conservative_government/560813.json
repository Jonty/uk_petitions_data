        "additional_details": "People around me with disabled family members, diabetic parents, elderly in their bubbles are terrified. Me included. My nana ticks all the boxes for being at high of getting this virus and I am at high risk of giving it to her from being at school, mixing with over 200 other students each day. There are others like me who fear going to school as the cases rise exceedingly. By closing schools, online work can be done. Students without access to online can be mailed worksheets by the school.",
        "background": "Rate of infection has rapidly increased in school students from the age of 12-16. This is because we are still in school. We as students have a right to participate in this lockdown to protect one another. Shutting the schools for only a few weeks would help minimise the cases drastically.",
