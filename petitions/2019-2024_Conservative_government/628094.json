        "action": "Stop ticket companies purchasing tickets and then selling at extortionate amount",
        "additional_details": "I want the government to do this so the general public can freely go and see the people they love in concerts gigs whatever. Seeing performances that bring them joy in an extremely tough time in the world. This would also stop people being forced to lending money to pay these extortionate prices for these tickets from companies who can only be described as ticket touts. What may seem small to you means a hell of alot to others",
        "background": "I want them to stop big ticket companies being able to purchase thousands and thousands of tickets for gigs, concerts and then selling them for 7, 8x the price. Thousands of people queuing up for hours for venues that hold 8000+ but only have 1000 tickets on sale because the rest go to companies",
