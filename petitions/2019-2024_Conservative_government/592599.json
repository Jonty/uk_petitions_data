        "additional_details": "It is essential now that accountability is placed on those making hateful comments online. It is not an intrusion on freedom of speech or expression, merely a measure to ensure that people realise the gravity of their comments. Aliases/usernames can remain but police bodies should be able to identify the user making illegal comments, as in person. Social media owners will not enforce this without pressure from the public and moreover the Government, as it doesn\u2019t suit their greed driven agendas.",

Not to detract from anonymity from other users, but as a measure for policing bodies to identify users that make hateful/illegal messages online.",
