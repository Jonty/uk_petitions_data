        "additional_details": "I have seen and have heard a lot of stories of my friends and other minorities getting physically, and emotionally abused by bouncers and getting kicked out for absolutely no reason. Bearing in mind, these people would not retaliate on bouncers but for the bouncers to hit and pin them on the ground when the victim has not assaulted them is out of order. Bouncers are civilians and have the same laws as civilians and should only get aggressive when the other is assaulting them as an act of self-defence.",
        "background": "I want these bouncers to get questioned and to put CCTV cameras outside of clubs to see what they do. I also want these bouncers to have body cameras on them mandatory so that so that we can hear what they say and see what they do.",
