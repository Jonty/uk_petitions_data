        "additional_details": "Due to COVID-19, students missed a considerable amount of teaching from March 2020. It is impossible for the students to catch up on all the study they have missed. Students who received results based on predicted grades in August had studied but were unable to sit exams. 2021 results will impact on the futures of these young people who don't deserve to be disadvantaged. An extra 3 weeks to prepare for exams isn't enough. Awarding exams results based on predicted grades is the fairest solution.",
        "background": "Please can Government recognise that these students have missed out on months of teaching and award GCSE and A-Level results based on predicted grades. Although teachers, schools and colleges are working hard, there continues to be disruption due to self-isolation and the pandemic itself.",
