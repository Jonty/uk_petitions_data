        "action": "Increase the bursary allowance for N.Ireland student nurses to match inflation",
        "additional_details": "Student nurses must also complete 2300 unpaid placement hours, equating between 37.5-48 hours per week. This leaves little to no time to undertake paid employment to fund travelling to placement or put food on the table. This is in turn leading to many students quitting their courses which is in turn discouraging more people from taking up the profession. The government, in the absence of a Northern Ireland Executive should allow for a bursary and mileage allowance increase to encourage uptake.",
        "background": "Northern Ireland's nursing students are entitled to a bursary that does not have to be repaid, however the allowance has remained at \u00a3430 for the last 10+ years. This small fee does not take into account inflation or the current cost of living crisis.",
