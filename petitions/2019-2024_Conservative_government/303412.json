        "additional_details": "I want The government/parliament to introduce it during COVID-19 as the shops are empty due to people panicking and stockpiling up on loo rolls pasta and other foods, people who cant afford to do this or people who are unable to do this like the elderly, if we introduce a rationing system we can be sure that everyone across the country is being fed and has the supplies and no one is left with out food or essential items",
        "background": "Introduce a Rationing System into the UK, to stop people stockpiling food this will mean that people who need it (elderly and Vunerble People) are Able to Get the Supplies they need Instead of walking down empty isles in the shops",
