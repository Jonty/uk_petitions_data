        "additional_details": "Physical self defense unfortunately does not compare to the strength advantage of males, therefore let women carry pepper-spray. Teach young women and women to use them safely and punish any males heavily for commandeering them. \r\n\r\n\u2018Approximately 85,000 women\u2019... \u2018experience rape, attempted rape or sexual assault by penetration in England and Wales alone every year; that's roughly 11 of the most serious sexual offences (of adults alone) EVERY HOUR.\u2019 - (MoJ), (ONS) and Home Office, revealed",
        "background": "Women shouldn\u2019t feel unsafe late at night. If they were exclusively able to carry pepper spray they would regain some control for themselves. Men are undeniably stronger than women, and male on female crime is rife, therefore we should be able to protect ourselves, effectively.",
