        "additional_details": "Gavin Williamson has given little clarity and accuracy in his handling of schools during the pandemic. Last year, he oversaw a scandalous grading algorithm which would have made any decent politician to resign, and now, in 2021, he has provided no concrete plan for the re-opening of schools- providing no light at the end of the tunnel for children suffering from mental health conditions as a result lockdown. We call for him to resign as he has put the future of millions of children in jeopardy.",
        "background": "The cabinet should pressure Mr Williamson to resign his position as Secretary of Sate for Education. And if he fails to resign of his own accord, the prime minister should discharge Mr Williamson from his duties.",
