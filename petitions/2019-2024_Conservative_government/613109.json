The questions can be rephrased for things that are binary, such as simply writing \u201chow many are not male\u201d. \r\nIn the past, consciously including ethnically  diverse names and a mix of traditionally male and female names has successfully led to a more inclusive set of questions and the time is right to do this again.",
        "background": "Often on maths exams, there are questions of the form \u201cIn a class of 30 students, 14 students are male. How many are female?\u201d These questions are based on the assumption that all people are either make or female. National exam boards should not be permitted to include questions of this form.",
