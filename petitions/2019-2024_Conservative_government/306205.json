        "additional_details": "Prisoners in jail are at higher risk of catching and passing on Covid-19. The prisoners with underlying health issues are at risk just by where they are located, so protection for that population from potential exposure is paramount. \r\n\r\nPrisons are overcrowded & unhygienic so self isolation is impossible. Simply put, it\u2019s impossible to do social distancing as advised. The USA have released low risk prisoners this week. This was approved by the judiciary and medical experts.",
        "background": "Due to the outbreak of Coronavirus and how rapidly it seems to be spreading, those who have underlying health issues are at high risk of the virus. Prisoners who are low risk need to be released on curfew/tag and can also put a security bond in place",
