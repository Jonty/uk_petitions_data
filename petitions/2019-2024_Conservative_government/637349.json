        "additional_details": "My son was recently awarded Personal transport budget with no one to take him to school. He is 10 years old with th mental capacity of a 6-36 month old. Travel assust justified this by saying they are trying to make children independent. When i tried to argue my case i could only phone the helpline or the email off the website. Tickets are made on every phone call but no reply is made from these. i over turned this decision by fighting but not all parents are like me. This is a constant problem",
        "background": "Our children of school age in Birmingham are having to go to appeal for the transport they need and deserve. We have to apply online that regardless of the fact if it\u2019s urgent or for september only gets looked at within the 15/20 day threshold. Which leaves children at home out of school.",
