People sitting with candles lit no heating as can\u2019t pay for energy. Mental health is already a shambles thanks to covid and this is far worse. Children should not have to worry about parents paying bills and eating. The government has a duty of care to its nation. These companies are making profits beyond belief while we are back to a 1940s standard of living. We need help",
