        "additional_details": "MPs are being given a payrise when everyone else is having their wages squeezed, this is ridiculous especially given the increased lack of trust in parliament. By reducing MPs wages we can ensure that they are better able to understand the issues facing working people. This would also reduce government spending by \u00a327 million a year, money that could be much better spent.",
        "background": "MPs make \u00a381,932 a year which is almost 3 times the average wage in the UK (\u00a329,009). Their wages should be more in line with the people they represent.",
