Most tickets are now mobile or app based anyway and I feel there should be a cap or a complete ban on what fees can be charged when purchasing online.\r\n\r\nI recently brought tickets for an event and I was charged \u00a311.10 in fees per ticket, I brought 4 in total and the fees came to \u00a344.40 making each ticket \u00a367.30 when the original face value was \u00a356.20.",
