        "additional_details": "We are a democratic country. Residents of the United Kingdom deserve a right to make their views known on the current failure of the British government to successfully negotiate a trade deal with the EU. Thus I urge the UK government to hold a referendum in 2021 asking the British public to vote on what they want about Brexit and what should be done about the failure of the UK government to negotiate a UK trade deal. Without a deal, UK businesses & jobs will suffer. Is this what we all want?",
        "background": "The failure of the British government to successfully negotiate a deal with the European Union (EU) is unacceptable. Is the current debacle what the public GENUINELY wanted when they voted in the June 2016 referendum? To solve the current impasse, the UK government should hold a referendum in 2021",
