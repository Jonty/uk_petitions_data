This could reduce the number of people being made redundant in the future and more importantly, it may save the government a lot of money if these people do not have to claim benefits. It will also give the people to option to claim their private pension and go part time, which again help employers and thus the economy.",

In the current climate, this would give workers an additional option particularly if there job/industry is currently at severe risk.",
