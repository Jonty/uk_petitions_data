        "additional_details": "The UK has a moral duty to help resolve this dispute which is a legacy of the British Empire. Tensions are high since India abolished Jammu & Kashmir\u2019s special constitutional status without any consultation. Many human rights violations have been reported. \r\nIndia and Pakistan have shown that they cannot resolve it by themselves so the UN must be involved. A nuclear war between India and Pakistan would be a global catastrophe. Over 3 million Britons trace their ancestry to the Indian subcontinent, and conflict in Kashmir risks harming community cohesion in Britain. Accordingly, the UK cannot afford to ignore this issue.",
        "background": "UN Security Council has previously resolved on a referendum in Kashmir to finalise its future. India has not held it. Wars have occurred and bilateral talks have failed between Pakistan and India, Under Article 35 of the UN charter, the UK can bring this matter to the UNSC.",
