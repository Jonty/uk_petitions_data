        "additional_details": "All supermarket employees are keeping the nation going through this pandemic, and I feel are as much on the front line as care workers etc.. I am a merchandiser and am horrified how shoppers are still not following the 2 metre rule guidance. Without these valuable employees working as hard as they do, there will be no supermarkets to shop in. They are indeed putting themselves at risk every day, and deserve to be protected as much as front line workers. I implore the government to prioritise these employees who have worked tirelessly over the last 10 months.",
