        "additional_details": "Rather than only given us the option of borrowing more money which in a very uncertain future is daunting to take on, we need other options available to us now to help keep the self employed in business.\r\nWith social distancing looking more and more likely for the rest of this year, the wedding industry has been hit massively, and any business working within that, or any other Self employed in other industries, during the coming months/year face a very uncertain future, and more needs to be done.",
        "background": "Consider more help for Self employed not just loans. \r\nHaving watched the chancellor's speech it was glaringly obvious there is no help for self-employed people in those packages at all.\r\nThere are five million self-employed people in the UK, who right now are facing an uncertain future.",
