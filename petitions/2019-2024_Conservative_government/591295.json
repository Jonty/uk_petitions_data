Between 2015-16 there were 7,520 attacks, but between 2019-20 there were a shocking 18,375. Nothing has been done to address or tackle this issue, leaving our community more vulnerable than ever. Boris Johnson has failed to act on many of our issues, this can\u2019t be ignored any longer. There have been too many horrific attacks recently and it\u2019s only getting worse.",
        "background": "Anti LGBTQ+ hate crime has almost trebled since 2015, it\u2019s time for the government to finally do something about it. There\u2019s no quick fix but the government have ignored this for far too long, something needs to be done.",
