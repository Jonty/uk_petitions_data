        "action": "Create a new energy market for renewables that is not linked to gas prices.",
        "additional_details": "The energy price hikes prove that the energy market is broken, out of date, and not fit for purpose. When we choose to have our electricity supplied from a renewable source we should not be paying inflated prices due to it being linked to the price of gas.The government needs to intervene in creating a new renewables only market. This will provide much cheaper electricity prices for consumers, enabling more people to reduce their reliance on gas. It's a win for consumers and the environment.",
        "background": "The energy market needs an overhaul. Renewables and gas pricing should be decoupled from one another. Energy produced by renewables should have its own marketplace and it needs to be done sooner than later.",
