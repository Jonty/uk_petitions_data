        "additional_details": "As a student myself, we are under constant immense pressure that has led to a major deterioration in mental health and wellbeing. The government mention how exams remain the fairest way to assess pupils, and whilst that is true, they are paying the price with copious students being left with uncertainty and stress. There isn't sufficient time to complete content, and the fact that different schools and pupils are isolating at different rates makes a Welsh-Based moderation system more plausible.",
