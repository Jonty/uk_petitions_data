        "additional_details": "ALL prison officers & other outside workers must be imprisoned for minimum of 6 months no matter what they get caught with. If it's illegal they must face a prison sentence. Our prisons need to be safe & healthy places for inmates to serve their sentences and leave rehabilitated. Jailing these prison officers and outside workers will make others think twice & prisons will be a safer environment for both the good and fair officer's & inmates.",
        "background": "Prisoner officers and outside workers are not being punished enough for smuggling drugs, mobile phones , contraband, and other prohibited items into the prison estate. During lockdown due to covit one would think there would be much less of drugs & mobile phones being smuggled in. But it is worse",
