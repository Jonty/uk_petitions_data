        "additional_details": "In order to gain momentum for this idea government backing and the platform it offers could create sufficient pressure on the retailers to do the right thing and help contain this pandemic on our shores. The cost to the retailer would be negligible versus the cost to the NHS and human mortality. Government financial support could ease this burden on the retailers too. Crucially, it would mitigate the impact the selfish are having on our most needy.",
        "background": "With elderly and at risk individuals having less access to transport to obtain vital products such as sanitising products their jeopardy of COVID 19 is magnified. On gaining access often shelves are empty. Stores could pick these items first and deliver them free of charge to those groups.",
