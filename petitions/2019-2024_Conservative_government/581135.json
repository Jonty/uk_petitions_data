        "additional_details": "As Citizen of the UK on visiting the Acropolis Museum in Athens I was upset and incensed that as you walked around the museum the marbles from the Parthenon were represented by plaster casts of the Originals in the British Museum.\r\nThis made the visit a hollow experience and I left ashamed that there was so much intransigence over the return of the \u201cElgin Marbles\u201d to their rightful home.\r\nIf even some of the friezes were returned on a long term loan then this would be a wonderful gesture to Greece.",
        "background": "On the 200th Anniversary of independence tomorrow and due to longstanding relationship with Greece it seems obvious that this would be the perfect opportunity to show solidarity with Greece and with the EU to allow the Elgin Marbles to be provided on a long term loan to the Acropolis Museum.",
