        "additional_details": "There have been no cases of Covid-19 contracted through gyms. Gyms are one of the safest places as the number of people can be controlled, social distance can be maintained, spaces are generally well ventilated, cleaning is high, there can be booked slots and generally people are likely to not attend a session while sick. \r\n\r\nIt therefore makes logical sense to keep gyms open to help with people's mental and physical health.",
        "background": "Exercise is hugely beneficial for people's physical and mental health. Health and fitness will help the UK not only fight against Covid-19 but a range of health conditions. That is beside the fact that exercise helps with mental health which has already been placed under pressure due to lockdowns.",
