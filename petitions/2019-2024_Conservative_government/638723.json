        "additional_details": "I am the owner of a partially disabled dog. It has become unmanageable expense to support him despite him being otherwise healthy. It has cost over \u00a3400 just to visit the vet and receive a week\u2019s worth of painkillers for him. Surgery will cost thousands and as young, working homeowners we cannot afford it. Surely the cost of medicine and surgery needn\u2019t be so expensive and shouldn\u2019t put loving pet owners in the position we are now in where our pet has to die because we cannot afford surgery?",
        "background": "Please enforce a limit to charges that vets can charge ordinary pet owners for check ups, medicine and surgery. For regular people it can be unmanageable expense to help injured or ill pets when it shouldn\u2019t be. Vets are charging extortionate prices for life saving medicines that can prevent pain.",
