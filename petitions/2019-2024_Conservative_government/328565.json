        "additional_details": "Take long-term strategic action to ensure that the UK poultry industry is environmentally sound, through effective delivery of the Environment Act, Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017, the Well-Being of Future Generations Act and the Water Framework Directive. Conduct urgent research, regulate and monitor IPUs and enforce LPA planning conditions. Regulate the poultry industry and hold it to account for breach of environmental responsibility. Publish public reports on progress.",
        "background": "Intensive poultry units (IPUs) along the River Wye and its tributaries are turning it into a wildlife deathtrap and causing untold damage to one of Britain\u2019s best loved rivers. Runoff from IPUs causes the spread of algal blooms that devastate the river\u2019s ecosystem and turn the water a murky green.",
