        "action": "Change furlough scheme to include people employed after 28th Feb",
        "additional_details": "Many thousands of people will not be paid a penny for the period that businesses are closed due to the lockdown restrictions imposed due to the coronavirus pandemic. This is unfair as the restrictions were not put in place until 25th March. For people employed between 28th Feb and 25th March there is a huge risk that they will not be able to pay mortgages, rent or bills potentially putting more businesses at risk and subsequently those employed by those businesses.",
        "background": "I, and thousands of others have not been included in the furlough scheme simply because we started employment after February 28th, meaning that we will not be paid anything for the period of lockdown restrictions. The current restrictions were not enforced until 25th March",
