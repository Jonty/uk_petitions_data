In order for the Electorate to have faith and trust in our chosen representatives, and for them to fulfill their democratic responsibilities, a review of the MPs Code of Conduct is overdue. Removing the distraction of external employment and consultancy services would allow our MPs more time to focus on the issues that affect their Constituents.",
