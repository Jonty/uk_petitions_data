There is anecdotal evidence that doctors, nurses, paramedics and care assistants are encountering serious difficulties in accessing face masks, aprons, goggles, gloves etc. The decision not to take advantage of the opportunity to bulk buy PPE and ventilators with our European neighbours and partners seems incompatible with tackling the coronavirus pandemic, potentially leading to further loss of life.",
        "background": "We are at the beginning of a national crisis when the NHS needs its doctors, nurses and other staff to have access to the best equipment in order to carry out the battle against Covid-19. The decision seems perverse, illogical and will potentially threaten lives.",
