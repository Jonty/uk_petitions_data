        "additional_details": "Give all BTEC students their predicted grades as BTEC student are affected by this pandemic as much as A-level students and it doesn\u2019t make sense to give one their predicted grade but not the other. I understand that A-level students needs to take exam and so on which you can argue is a lot harder than BTEC but I can assure you BTEC students work just as hard we have more Units to work and we don\u2019t always have the best teachers in essence as a BTEC student we feel neglected",
        "background": "I want the parliament to view BTEC the same way that they\u2019re viewing A-levels and GCSE. \r\nHaving done GCSE a lot of people can all agree that it\u2019s almost pointless as long as you achieve a good grade in Maths English and science all the other subjects were pretty much useless so giving GCSE.",
