        "additional_details": "It is unreasonable to ask for research to be done when there is a lack of academic resources and contact time in universities. I propose that the government allow all students in final year of university no matter what level to graduate with predicted grades or with a standard pass or 2:2. It is not fair to allow a whole year of students to potentially fail because of circumstances beyond their control.",
        "background": "Due to Covid-19 and UCU strikes many students feel they have not had the learning time or support throught this academic year. Due to  lockdown students are finding it hard to acess resources to complete assignments or study for exams. I propose that students should graduate with predicted grades.",
