        "action": "The Government should close nurseries until Feb 2021.",
        "additional_details": "Nurseries should only be open for key workers and vulnerable children. Even after receiving the vaccination nursery workers, like everyone else, will need 2 to 3 weeks to reach even partial immunity.\r\nIt is both frustrating and alarming to see the speed with which the new variant is spreading between 50 and 70 per cent more transmissible. The number of deaths is up by 20 % over the last week and will sadly rise further. My thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones.",
        "background": "Cases of Covid are increasing in nurseries too, as we have seen, and with so much pressure on hospitalisation, the current ruling to stay at home 4/1/2021 should therefore apply to nurseries too. Nursery staff are also at risk and taking a great risk home to their families.",
