        "action": "Cancel GCSE and A level summer exams because of omicron disruption.",
        "additional_details": "Due to the lack of support from online learning during the closure of all schools in the UK , many students don't have the sufficient education to undertake these exams without severe psychological distress. In addition to this, the majority of education establishments in the UK didn't have the capable needs to supply education from a remote learning environment. The overall causality will be a huge amount of failing students whom will not be able to apply to university or find a proper career.",
        "background": "This year Students would like the government and the department for education to cancel all GCSE and A-Level exams for summer 2022 and to have this replaced with the predicted grades, that was successfully operated in the summer of 2021.\r\nInstead of adjustments.",
