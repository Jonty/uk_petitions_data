        "additional_details": "If the Colorado model was introduced, the Treasury could make \u00a32.26bn a year in tax revenues \u2013 more than enough to plug the \u00a32bn estimated NHS deficit for the year 2018. A poll suggested 47% of people in the UK support the selling of cannabis in licensed shops. Health Poverty Action suggests regulating the cannabis market would reduce harm by ensuring that products were monitored, tested, sold within required potency limits. Decriminalisation would reduce pressure on the police and courts.",
        "background": "Legalise cannabis in the UK for recreational and medicinal use for over 18s, using the tax revenue generated to help fund the underfunded NHS. Legalising would open up many business opportunities, giving our economy a much needed financial boost after the COVID - 19 pandemic.",
