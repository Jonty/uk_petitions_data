        "additional_details": "Over the past decade, many Romanians have moved to the UK. The 2021 Census shows 472,000 Romanian speakers in England and Wales. Many Romanians intend to settle in the UK for the foreseeable future, and have their children attending school in the UK. It is only natural to request formal teaching support for the preservation and perfection of the language abilities of these children, encouraging reading, writing, and speaking excellence.",
        "background": "We wish to see the Government advocate for, and encourage, the approval of Romanian Language GCSE and A-Level qualifications. Particularly, the Government should provide support in liaising with schools and exam boards to provide a comprehensive report on the demand for such qualifications.",
