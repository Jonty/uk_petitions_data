        "additional_details": "The greatest scandal of BJ\u2019s government is their lack of care for NHS staff. They are being put at life threatening risks by Coronavirus due to the lack of or inadequate protective clothing.\r\nAt the best of times there is a shortage of doctors and nurses and we still expect them to give us their all. It is quite unacceptable that they should be subjected to such risks with a high risk of contracting Coronavirus and possible death. Several doctors have said they feel just like cannon fodder",
        "background": "Act immediately to provide all hospitals with adequate protective clothing.  Boris Johnson stated that the U.K. has stock piles of protective clothing  - so why is it not being used",
