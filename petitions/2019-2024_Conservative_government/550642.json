        "additional_details": "The HS2 project was conceived pre-Covid 19. Now, as a result of working from home, the use of the Internet for business meetings has become an acceptable alternative to face to face meetings. Therefore travel for business, either commuting or for meetings, has dramatically fallen. The Digital Economy has arrived, and is here to stay. The HS2 project is no longer fit for purpose; it is already obsolete.",
        "background": "Cancel the \u00a3160 billion HS2 infrastructure project, or at least review it in the light of new working practices now widely adopted as a result of Covid-19.",
