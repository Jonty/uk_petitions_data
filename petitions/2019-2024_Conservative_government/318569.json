        "additional_details": "It seems UK border force are in the news almost on a daily basis, escorting illegal immigrants to our ports so they can be processed and possibly deported. But this is costing the UK taxpayer because these people have to be housed and fed while waiting for the deportation process to complete.\r\n\r\nIt would make more sense to escort them to a port in the country they last departed from, and let them deal with the problem and expense.\r\nAlso it would be a much bigger deterrent to others too.",
        "background": "UK Border Force has escorted hundreds+ of illegal immigrants to UK ports over the last few months, which only leads to greater expense for UK taxpayers before we might get to deport them later.\r\n\r\nInstead perhaps escort them to a port in the country they departed from last.",
