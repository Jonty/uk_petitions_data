        "action": "Apply back-dated pro-rata pay rise for NHS staff leavers who worked during 22/23",
        "additional_details": "The principle of equal pay for equal work, which is enshrined in employment law has been pushed aside by the Government in this latest pay deal and is unfair. Those who worked hard alongside colleagues in 22/23 should receive a fair proportion of the non-consolidated pay award (pro-rata) since it is being back-paid for services already rendered. Many have left due to burnout and leaving them out of this element of the pay rise amounts to a punitive measure for leaving.",
        "background": "Government pay award to NHS trusts which includes back-pay for 22/23 completely leaves out colleagues who left prior to the end of the tax year despite work delivered during this period, whether they worked 3 or 11 months of 22/23 alongside colleagues and this amounts to unequal pay.",
