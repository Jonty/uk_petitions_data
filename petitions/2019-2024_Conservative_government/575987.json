        "additional_details": "During our leave we were supposed to engage in activities with our babies and other new mothers, sensory, swimming etc but unable to do so as everything is closed. The past year has been hell, especially for new mothers so I believe we deserve that little extra time to do what we were robbed off. I ask you to please  consider this as it can have a huge impact on our mental health (coming from a first time mother and NHS nurse)",
        "background": "I understand that this petition was already made last year, however, that was before the third lockdown which seems to be going on forever. As much as we appreciate that we are keeping people safe, as new mothers we also feel robbed off our maternity leave.",
