We need to stop vulnerable people from catching the virus. The more of them do, the more will die, the more pressure on the NHS, the more stringent measures put in place and the more danger to the economy. The simplest way is to prevent more deaths is to isolate those at risk. The elderly. Utilise the people losing their jobs to provide for the elderly.",
        "background": "The virus is killing mostly elderly people. We have to do everything to stop it from getting to them. But the elderly are leaving their homes to do their shopping, banking, etc. We need to stop this. Mobilise the people out of work to supply essentials and help with any need that involves going out.",
