        "additional_details": "We want the Government or Parliament to keep schools closed to protect young children so that further child deaths can be prevented and the spread of COVID-19 can be controlled. Only those who have had a COVID-19 immunity test and are shown to be immune should be allowed back in school until a vaccine is available. Our youngest generation can be protected if the Government or Parliament act now.",
        "background": "We would like the Government or Parliament to enforce this action due to the growing child deaths reported with the youngest victim aged only 5. This is espcially worrying for children who have underlying health issues. Another victim with no known underlying health issues died aged 13",
