        "action": "Allow wedding ceremonies and receptions for 15 people by the end of April 2021",
        "additional_details": "The wedding industry has taken a huge hit during the pandemic with many businesses failing. People have rescheduled their wedding several times already due to restrictions which is not only loosing them alot of money but also affecting their mental health. The risk of transmission with responsible adults maintaining social distancing and sitting in their bubbles for a sit down meal is far less than classrooms filled with children. This change will improve mental health and improve our economy.",
        "background": "Allow wedding ceremonies and receptions for at least 15 people regardless of tiers as soon as we are out of national lockdown with measures such as social distancing, bubble seating arrangements, mask use and a sit down meal not buffets.",
