        "background": "Support UK households by lowering the tax on fuel rather than make thousands of people redundant.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, the cost of living is rising due to fuel prices, in my opinion we should look in that sector and see what can be adjusted to ease the financial pressure on the public.",
