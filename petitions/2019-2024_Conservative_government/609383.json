Shared ownership companies in particular are profiting from this change. Social housing should assist vulnerable families, not instead be making them homeless for profit. The system of social housing is failing the most vulnerable. Parliament needs to look at this growing issue immediately before families are displaced and affected further.",
        "background": "For government to discuss the prevention of evicting families for profit only. For vulnerable families to be offered 5 year fixed term tenancy contracts (to provide a family long term home security) and the discussion of regulating shared ownership companies overall. Housing initiatives are failing.",
