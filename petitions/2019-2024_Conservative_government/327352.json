We shouldn't need to aks for an ingredients check every time we order food to know it's safe ot put in out children's mouths.\r\nEven now chemicals banned in baby foods are allowed to be sold as food, which many of us may add to baby foods without knowing : carboxymethylcellulose, as an example.\r\nPlease progress the development of good nutrition in the UK.",

To ensure that our food standards continue to get better, not worse.\r\n\r\nOur population deserves the right to access clean and good quality nutrition.",
