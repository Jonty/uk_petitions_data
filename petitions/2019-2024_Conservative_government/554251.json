        "action": "Reduce curriculum for GCSE and A levels 2021",
        "additional_details": "Many students were unable to access the resources required to support their learning. Some students are without stable internet and technology, while others live in crowded households where working is close to impossible. Some had close family members to care for, others lost family and friends, therefore with circumstances like these we can\u2019t be expected to sit the same exams that most years have done in the past without having experienced a pandemic.",
        "background": "We would like the A level and GCSE curriculum to be reduced for our exams in 2021, in response to the Covid-19 lockdown we have experienced. Some schools are still having to isolate meaning even more learning is missed. Rather than cancelling exams, reducing the curriculum will be more supportive.",
