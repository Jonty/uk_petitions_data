        "additional_details": "I have extensively read the phrases 'we are in a period like no other' and 'we are living in unprecedented times' and as such I strongly reject a return to 'normal' teaching and 'Pre-Covid designed learning'.\r\nWhen children and young people are safely allowed to return to their educational settings I feel the Government should allow an alternative curriculum to be delivered. This curriculum should be a response to the effects of Covid 19 on the mental health & well being of our Next Generation",
        "background": "When children and young people return to their educational settings I would like the Government, with extensive support from other sectors, to create a transitional curriculum that focuses on mental health and well being and supporting children and young people in their re-introduction to learning.",
