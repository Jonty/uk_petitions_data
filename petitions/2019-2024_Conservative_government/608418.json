        "additional_details": "I think people who work and pay tax shouldn\u2019t need struggle with child care and pay outrageous fees, they should get extra help with the free child care early funding for 2 year olds not just when the child turns 3/4. People who claim benefits and are unemployed have more time to care for there children at home so therefore they should only get the free child care when the child turns 3/4 years old.",
        "background": "Child care cost is outrageous for working parents and are struggling to cover this cost aswell as everything else we have to pay for, but If you are unemployed and claim benefits you can start getting free child care from the age of 2. Surely this should be the other way around.",

You can find out more about eligibility here: https://www.gov.uk/help-with-childcare-costs/free-childcare-2-year-olds\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
