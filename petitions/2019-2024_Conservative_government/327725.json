        "additional_details": "Yemen is the largest humanitarian crisis in the world with over 80% of the population needing humanitarian assistance. Unicef states around 2 million children under 5 years old are suffering from acute malnutrition and require treatment. One of the Arab world's poorest countries, Yemen has been devastated by a civil war in which the Saudi-led and British armed coalition is killing and blockading the country leading to the deaths and starvation of innocent civilians all for power politics.",
        "background": "We want the Government to immediately stop the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia and to provide immediate financial aid to Yemen to prevent the extinction of the country. We also urge the government to encourage the US to follow suit and we urge them to raise more international awareness of the crisis.",
