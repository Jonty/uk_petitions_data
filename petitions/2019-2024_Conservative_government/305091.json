        "additional_details": "The over 70's (and those made vulnerable with existing conditions) represent our parents, grandparents and friends - and they should avoid leaving the house \"even to buy food or essentials\" Not everyone has a support network or the finances to afford to stockpile. The current situation is stressful enough so we need to help ensure everyone's friends and relatives in this group can receive regular food deliveries. This will not only help our community, it will help protect the NHS.",
        "background": "Support the high risk group needing to self-isolate by prioritising supermarket delivery slots immediately (even if this means cancelling existing bookings). Help our communities reduce their risk by limiting their need to go out and about safely in the knowledge they will receive supplies.",
