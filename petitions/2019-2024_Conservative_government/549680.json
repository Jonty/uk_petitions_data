        "additional_details": "The government has stated that the long term risks of not returning to school and resuming \u201cnormality\u201d in September far outweigh the risk of Covid-19 on children aged 12+. \r\nHow is this so with children that live with a parent or grandparent that is Clinically Extremely Vulnerable?\r\nThe impact on a child\u2019s mental wellbeing is huge when they are petrified that they could be asymptomatic and bring the virus home. \r\nParents should be supported to home school in this scenario whilst working from home.",
        "background": "The transmission of Covid-19 is still not fully understood by our leading medical professionals. There has been conflicting advice, misinformation and many u-turns. \r\nChildren living with Clinically Extremely Vulnerable family are under tremendous pressure not to \u201cbring the virus home\u201d.",
