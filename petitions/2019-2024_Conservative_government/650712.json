        "additional_details": "As a pet owner and a serving firefighter I have witnessed firsthand the distress and anxiety that fireworks can cause in animals. Each year there is an increasing number of pets being negatively affected by personal firework displays. This is not just about our pets; it\u2019s also about wildlife, who often get frightened and disoriented by these loud explosions. Fireworks are not only harmful to animals but also pose a risk to human safety adding extra strain on our already stretched NHS.",
        "background": "Propose that the sale and use of fireworks be limited strictly to controlled and organised events where safety measures are put into place.",
