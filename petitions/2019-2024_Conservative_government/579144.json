        "additional_details": "Currently, sex and relationship education (SRE) is compulsory from age 11 onwards. It involves teaching children about reproduction, sexuality, and sexual health. \r\n\r\nGiven the findings of the UN Women UK survey, it is clear SRE must now be extended to include discussion and education surrounding consent, rape, and sexual assault.\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to say that failure to act now will only kick the can down the road and we risk another generation of men and women growing up fearful of UK streets.",
        "background": "'Virtually all young women in the UK have been subjected to sexual harassment, according to a survey from UN Women UK'. \u201cThis is a human rights crisis. It\u2019s just not enough for us to keep saying \u2018this is too difficult a problem for us to solve\u2019 \u2013 it needs addressing now,\u201d - Claire Barnett.",
