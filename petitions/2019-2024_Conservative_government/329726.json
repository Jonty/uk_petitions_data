On the beach have made no contact, they only reply to an online messaging service which takes days to come back with an answer. They are also not checking full amounts paid and only offering part refund. We cant get through via telephone or email the service is poor.",

On the beach in particular or as example as we have been waiting months for a reply and are trying to do customers out of their entitled money.
