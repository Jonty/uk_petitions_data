While children go hungry in schools MP's are claiming \u00a312 lunches on a daily basis. This has to stop and that money needs to be filtered to the people that need it most. Local councillors rejected an extra \u00a3660,000 for free school meals just minutes before approving a pay boost to their own allowances. This needs to be filtered down to councillors and councils also.",
