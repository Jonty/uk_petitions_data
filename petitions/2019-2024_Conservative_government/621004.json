        "additional_details": "Animal welfare is not good enough. Under animal welfare, innocent animals are still abused and killed unnecessarily.\r\n Terrified animals are subject to the biggest and most brutal massacre this planet has ever known. They sense fear and death. They are in pain and are brutally killed without ever even knowing why.\r\n Animal agriculture is also devastating to our planet and natural habitats. \r\n We don\u2019t even subject child rapists and murderers to what we put innocent animals through (and we shouldn\u2019t)",
        "background": "Every year, around 77 billion innocent animals are brutally slaughtered for their meat. They are gassed, electrically stunned, shot in the head, hoisted up, hung upside down and have their throats cut. Before that, they are subject to horrific mutilation, abuse and exploitation.",
