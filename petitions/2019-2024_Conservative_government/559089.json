It is unreasonable to expect people who have continued working to fund the furlough scheme through their taxation when they have received no benefit from it.\r\n\r\nBusinesses should be responsible for repayment through corporation tax.",
        "background": "The UK furlough scheme is estimated to cost \u00a314 billion a month. The furlough should be repaid by the businesses through corporation tax not by tax payers, including those key workers who haven\u2019t benefited from the scheme.",
