        "additional_details": "Price is at the forefront of any consumer's mind when selecting a product. Environmentally friendly products are often more expensive that the 'regular' equivalent. Consumers are therefore required to pay extra for the benefit of the environment. \r\nRemoving VAT from environmentally friendly products would reduce the price difference between 'regular' products and their environmentally friendly alternatives. This would encourage consumers to switch to the environmentally friendly product.",
        "background": "Many green products products are relatively new to the market and so cost effective manufacturing processes are not yet available, and so some of this cost is passed on to consumers. In addition, these products are sold in smaller volumes because people are reluctant to switch to a green alternative",
