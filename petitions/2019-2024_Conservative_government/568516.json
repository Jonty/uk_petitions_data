        "additional_details": "Exams are outdated and changes made in 2019 made them more difficult. Surveys show that 81% teachers believe Exams are the main cause of mental health concerns in our young people.\r\nBringing back coursework would allow students to build portfolios of knowledge on GCSE subjects to count towards their grade. A person's grade can be greatly affected on the day of an exam by illness, mental health concerns and symptoms related to health conditions.",
        "background": "I would like to see coursework brought back for GCSE students. Current year 10s have now missed almost a full academic year in school. This is detrimental to their future which at the moment relies on the results of exams only.",
