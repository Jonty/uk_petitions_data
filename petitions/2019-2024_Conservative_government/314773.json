        "additional_details": "Social workers have a vital role during the Covid-19 outbreak. They are still providing protection to vulnerable children and young adults across the country. Without PPE, they cannot go out and directly help children and young adults who may be subject to abuse and neglect. PPE is required to support their vital role in going out and visiting homes. Without the vital PPE, all social workers are unable to fulfill their role to the best potential.",
        "background": "Support to supply social services with PPE seems to have been forgotten during Covid-19. These important key workers are not mentioned on any news conference or breaking news. They are front line staff who protect vulnerable children and young adults in the community.",
