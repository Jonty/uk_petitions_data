        "additional_details": "We need more regulations and standards to help keep animals safe. There are many rescues, in particular rabbit \u201crescues\u201d who are breeding, not neutering or providing essential care (such as vaccinations). These animals are kept in inappropriate set ups and then rehomed to similar situations where standards are not followed (in the case of rabbits they do not follow the RWAF guidelines) which puts the animals at further risk. These \u201crescues\u201d also put further pressures on genuine ethical rescues.",
        "background": "Currently anyone can start set up a rescue which puts animals at risk of neglect, improper care and exploitation; and adds to miseducation in the local community. \r\n\r\nRegulation would allow for rules and guidelines to be issued and inspections; to insure there is no breach of the Animal Welfare Act.",
