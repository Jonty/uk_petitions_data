        "additional_details": "If the UK decriminalised the sales/cultivation of cannabis, the country would be able to pay off the debt we owe to those who helped us throughout the Pandemic, we would also have a new multi billion pound industry.

        "background": "In 2021 we are more equipped with knowledge on cannabis than ever before, we are seeing the beneficial impact cannabis has on hundreds of medical conditions, it is something we need to have on hand and with this I would like a public vote on cannabis consumption and cultivation decriminalisation.",
