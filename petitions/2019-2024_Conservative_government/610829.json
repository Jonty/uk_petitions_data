        "action": "Stop the Fourth Plinth project and take back Trafalgar Square from Sadiq Khan",
        "additional_details": "Since the GLA has owned the Fourth Plinth, a succession of questionable artworks has lowered the quality of one of the UK's most important public spaces. The next scheduled piece is of a man (John Chilembwe) who led a bloody rebellion and the murder of civilians, and who preached beside the decapitated head of one victim. This is hugely inappropriate and offensive and shows that the Mayor has failed in his responsibility to care for this historically and culturally vital site.",
        "background": "We want to reverse the 2003 decision to transfer ownership of Trafalgar Square from Westminster Council to the GLA and to end the Mayor's authority over the Fourth Plinth project, including blocking the planned installation of the John Chilembwe sculpture.",
