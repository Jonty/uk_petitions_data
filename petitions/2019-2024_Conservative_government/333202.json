        "additional_details": "Anorexia nervous has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder & science has proven that being underweight is actually more dangerous than being overweight e.g someone over bmi 35 is 1.3x more likely to die as a result of their weight compared to a healthy person, whereas someone underweight (under bmi 18.5) is at a 1.8x greater risk. Around 1 in 5 people who develop an eating disorder will die as a result, we cannot allow Boris to lazily fight one problem by creating another.",
        "background": "This proposal is aiming to fight obesity in the U.K. however it completely disregards how it will affect the 3 million people who suffer from an eating disorder. Without proper education this \u2018solution\u2019 is ineffective and will only fuel the already growing number of people with eating disorders.",
