        "additional_details": "Boys growing up have toxic traits engrained into them through societal norms: male chauvinism, female objectification, \u201cboys will be boys\u201d mentality, etc. \r\nSchools are the root of education, this is the best place to start addressing systemic issues.\r\n97% of women have been sexually harassed. It\u2019s not all men but a figure that high means that it\u2019s definitely not a small minority of men. \r\nWomen wish they were taught more about their bodies in school.\r\nI am a man who feels safe walking home.",
        "background": "A fortnightly curricular lesson in secondary school.\r\nGreater education on menstruation and toxic masculinity. \r\nClearer definitions and reinforcement on what is sexual harassment, assault and rape. \r\nA class debate discussing systemic sexism from both sides, would raise awareness internally.",
