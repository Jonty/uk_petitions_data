        "additional_details": "Projects that tackle the bullying of LGBTQ students are vital to equip staff with the tools they need to ensure LGBTQ students feel safe, secure, and adequately protected at school. Cutting this funding will impact young LGBTQ people for years to come, with lives changed irreversibly for the worse. Not only will these cuts leave schools unequipped to fight this bullying, but it\u2019ll send the message to LGBTQ young people that the Government is not on their side. Reverse these planned cuts.",
        "background": "The planned cuts to programmes within the Government Equalities Office that support teachers and other staff to fight LGBTQ bullying will detrimentally impact LGBTQ young people throughout the school system. We call for these planned funding cuts to be reversed.",
