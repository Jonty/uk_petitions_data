        "additional_details": "Parents need extra support to help reunite them with their children obviously making sure all safeguarding roots have been explored instead of putting them up for adoption. I have seen an alarming amount of videos and cases recently of mothers going through \u2018forced adoptions\u2019 and the heartbreak that follows. I appreciate the Local\r\nauthorities are there to protect children and in most cases they are correct but not all. Every case is different and should be dealt with differently and not as a \u2018check list\u2019 process. The law needs reviewing as this is peoples lives being effected.",
        "background": "The law regarding children being placed in to care and then parents being forced to consent to their children going up for adoption so Local Authorities can \u2018meet\u2019 their targets is sickening. The process as it is is extremely hard for parents and children - there isn\u2019t enough support.",
