        "additional_details": "To put it simply, teenagers are just too tired and not mentally built for a schedule built around adult life.\r\nThe pressure of exams and getting good grades for the future, staying up late stressing over and doing hours of homework, maintaining jobs, trying to keep relationships from falling apart. These are all examples of what teenagers have to deal with every minute of everyday as well as warring against their internal clock to stay awake in school. The world is ruining our future for what?",
        "background": "I want the average UK school day to be banned from starting before 9:45 AM. It is disgusting that nothing has changed for decades even with the sheer amount of scientific evidence there is proving the mental and physical impact that making children go against their internal clocks.",
