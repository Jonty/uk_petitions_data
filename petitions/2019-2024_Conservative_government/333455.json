        "additional_details": "We have lost well over 60,000 people. When we have a terrorist incident or a big accident, it is usual for the nation to show its respects to the families of those killed. I believe this pandemic requires the same love and respect to be shown to those families and loved ones. \r\n\r\nSince the virus is an ongoing situation this needs to be organised into a regular national event. Even if it's just a minute's silence, we need something.",
        "background": "I would like the government to get together with all heads of state in the UK, mayors, MPs, multi-faith leaders, the BBC, and organise a national weekly memorial/recognition of the dead and their loved ones. Even if it's just a minute's silence.",
