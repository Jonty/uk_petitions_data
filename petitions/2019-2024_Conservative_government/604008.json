        "additional_details": "We hope Government consider the current pandemic and actual difficulties (limited flights, concern of infection during travel) for people to return to their country and not just use whether a country is in UK red list or whether there\u2019s  \u201chard boarder control\u201d to reject exceptional assurance. It\u2019s against human right to force people to choose between unaffordable travelling caused by pandemic or illegal overstay, and to force people who would otherwise be shielding to risk their health to travel",
        "background": "UK has stopped extending exceptional assurance to many who are struggling to return to their home country due to Covid restrictions, which has pushed up the cost of travelling beyond affordable to most and extended transfer time hence higher health risk especially for clinical vulnerable people",
