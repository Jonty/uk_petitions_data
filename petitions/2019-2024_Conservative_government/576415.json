With this full reopening, students will be back in school for 3 weeks, enough time for cases and hospitalisations to rise again, potentially triggering a fourth lockdown. Whereas if schools remained shut, that allows an extra 7 weeks (only missing 3 weeks of in school education) for more of the population to be vaccinated.",
