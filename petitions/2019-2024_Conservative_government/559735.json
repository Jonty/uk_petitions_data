Currently we are in lockdown and people are ignoring the rules for example the demo in Manchester today 09/11/2020. Many of the people I know who have broken the rules now and over the summer have been furloughed. If breaking the rules resulted in them losing their benefit I believe this would make them think more carefully before doing so.",

We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nWe understand that you want people breaking Covid-19 restrictions to be subject to greater penalties, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme provides a grant to employers who furlough their staff due to coronavirus. It does not pay that money directly to the individual.\r\n\r\nFines for committing offences by breaking the restrictions are imposed by the police. You could start a new petition calling for the Government to increase the penalties for breaking these rules."
