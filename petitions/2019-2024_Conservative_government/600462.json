        "additional_details": "There is no help or support for when this happens for people like me who are single mums. I and many others are left without there rent payed and little money to survive for the month or no money at all it\u2019s unfair and it\u2019s cause major stress and struggle to survive. Because of UC I have serious mental health problems and anxiety about money constantly because of this 4 weekly pay rule I rely on UC to help with my rent as it\u2019s just me and my child i don't have any other support.",
        "background": "When you are payed 4 weekly there is 1 month in a year where you get payed twice this is not an extra payment and UC should only take into consideration 1 payment. So single mums like me are not left struggling to survive without rent, food and other essentials for there child for 5 weeks.",
