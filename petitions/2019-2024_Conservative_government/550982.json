        "additional_details": "Parliament have been spreading the message \"don`t kill granny\" a message that is clearly directed at the youth. Yet until recently restaurants, pubs and bars had EOTHO discounts showing once again that to you money is worth more than our lives. Sending mixed signals on what we should and shouldn`t be doing. So if all goes wrong WE choose to go out. Your clearly using young people as a scapegoat to avoid taking any responsibility for your unclear instructions and your own mistakes.",
        "background": "Its compulsory to go back to school, despite the increasingly high risk. My closest friends have been travelling across London through rush hour to get into college. Uni is starting next week but we can not meet up with more than six people? As though public transport and classroom are overcrowded.",
