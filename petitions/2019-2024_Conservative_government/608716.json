Independence from this could easily be reached simply by relicensing fracking. Our own source of natural gas is a far greener option to importing it in tankers from around the world.",
        "background": "Given the current and future problems with energy supplies before we reach net zero, fracking should be started immediately to take advantage of our vast reserves of natural gas. This would smooth out our transition from one power source to another.",
