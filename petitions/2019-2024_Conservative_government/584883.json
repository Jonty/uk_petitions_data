        "additional_details": "Throughout the 2020-2021 academic year, students have had to contend with constant self-isolating and a 3 month period of online school, along with general stress and uncertainty surrounding the global pandemic. Whilst our teachers have tried their hardest to keep our education ongoing and ease worry, our mental health/ability to focus during online lessons has severely affected our education. We\u2019re asking the government to grant exam concessions, reducing stress, uncertainty and lost education.",
        "background": "Students would like the government to grant concessions for exams next year. This could include (but is not exclusive to) having exams being open book, reduced content and prior knowledge of some of the topics that will be present in the exam.",
