        "additional_details": "The British government is making all effort for their nationals to be able to travel on holidays and to see their family while also denying the African nationals the same right to also visit Africa to see their families and their loved ones that they haven't seen for over a year without having to quarantine for 10 days on return.\r\nPlease share and sign this petition among all Africans living in the UK so the British government can debate and explain the rational in their decision making.",
        "background": "The decision the UK gov took by publishing the green zone countries without a single African country in it has an element of discrimination and racism.Even though most of these countries in their green zone has more covid infection and deaths rate compared to most of the countries in Africa.",
