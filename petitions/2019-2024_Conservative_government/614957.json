        "additional_details": "Millions of pounds will be spent so send refugees (asylum seekers and migrants) on a one-way trip to Rwanda. \r\n\r\nThe government claims this will focus on \"men arriving on boats and lorries\" and stop people smuggling. How can this be guaranteed?\r\n\r\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson talks about compassion but his plan will leave vulnerable people under the jurisdiction of a country with a mixed human rights record, including alleged unlawful killings, forced disappearances and torture by its government.",
        "background": "The UK Government recently announced that it plans to send some refugees thousands of miles away to Rwanda for 'processing' if they are deemed to be an 'economic migrant'. \r\n\r\nThe UK should reevaluate how it helps migrants and how it can process them compassionately without risking their lives.",
