        "additional_details": "Getting given homework puts on too much stress for school students. Doing homework can take hours, which decreases the amount of sleep and social time students get. GCSE students especially shouldn't get given homework. They should do revision instead, and having homework on top of revising makes students stressed and anxious, which can lead to mental health problems. Students also has a social life outside of school. There could be problems they are having at home, and if they don't do homework, they get a punishment, which then makes them more stressed than they already are.",
