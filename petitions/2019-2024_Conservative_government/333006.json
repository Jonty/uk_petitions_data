        "action": "Revisit obesity measures to protect those suffering from eating disorders",
        "additional_details": "Eating disorders have the highest mortality rates among psychiatric disorders. Of those surviving, only 50% recover, whereas 30% improve and 20% remain chronically ill. This measure will result in the relapse of many patients and not actually tackle the root cause of obesity. Low calorie content is not synonymous with health or nutritional value. Beat estimates that conditions such as anorexia and bulimia cost the UK economy \u00a315 bn each year, not to mention the impact on families and carers.",
        "background": "The current obesity measures are incredibly detrimental to those suffering from eating disorders and focus more on perpetuating unhelpful calorie-counting habits than getting to the root of the problem - the price of healthy food, lack of education and lack of funding for mental health services.",
