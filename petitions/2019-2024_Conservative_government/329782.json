        "additional_details": "I want the government to this as many students are going to miss out on going to college by getting a worse score. By doing this, this could rise mental health in teens and discourge them for the future. This would also make mass resitings. for many subjects not enough people do them so they wont be able to resit making have to live with that grade which could be really bad for mental health if they had know they could do better.Also many students do really well on the day and teachers know that",
        "background": "The exam boards think that teachers have been too kind and so they are going go degrade every student by 30%. Which isnt fair as many teachers have been fair when grading students making many students get scores worse than they should. I want ofqual to not do this and find a better solution for this",
