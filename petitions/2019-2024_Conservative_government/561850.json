        "additional_details": "Due to COVID-19, most students are attending online lectures, or have most of their lectures online. Due to this, we are not using University resources like normal, apart from their e-library. This should not cost students more than \u00a39250 a year. Furthermore, many universities have issues with online learning, and libraries are yet to resolve licensing issues with much needed e-books. Due to our current financial situation, we would also like to be given a refund via our banks.",
        "background": "To re-evaluate the tuition fee for ALL students, UK/EU as well as international students, and give students a refund via bank transfer to help them with their current financial situations as well as the inconvenience, rather than decreasing the loan with the student loans companies.",
