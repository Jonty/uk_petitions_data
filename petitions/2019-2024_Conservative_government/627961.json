        "action": "Abolish the tiered minimum wage system and give living wage across the board",
        "additional_details": "With the cost of living on the rise, younger people who don\u2019t earn as much are being disproportionately affected compared to older groups. It\u2019s a dangerous time to be living in, considering. Everyone deserves a fair chance at life and having tiered minimum wages flies directly in the face of that.",
        "background": "The tiered minimum wage system puts young people who are out of education or estranged in a very precarious position, financially speaking. Many of us have to just scrape by or work 2 jobs just in order to live comfortably. I want every worker to have a guarantee of a living wage.",
