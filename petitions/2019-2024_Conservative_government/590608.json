Now England have been victorious in their semi-final vs Denmark, this night could be incredibly special for a generation of young people who have endured 16 months of regulations. The current date for Step 4 of the lockdown-easing plan is Monday 19 July, as this is 8 days ahead, this petition seeks a one night exemption for a memorable night in history.",
