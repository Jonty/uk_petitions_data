        "additional_details": "With vaccines rolling out into the New Year, we should consider a bold strategy of \u2018shielding pending vaccination\u2019 for the vulnerable while restrictions are systematically phased out for the population at large. The majority for whom Covid presents minimal risk to life but an existential threat to economic and psychological wellbeing. The needs of the many should not continue to be outweighed by the needs of the few. 2020 is the year we shattered our economy, let 2021 be the year we rebuild it.",
        "background": "The WHO themselves have repeatedly said that \u201clockdowns don\u2019t work\u201d and the hidden, long-term socio-economic costs of our current strategy are barely understood. The NHS\u2019s own stats show that Covid 19 poses little threat to the healthy population at large so we need a new, more thoughtful approach.",
