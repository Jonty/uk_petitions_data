        "action": "Let private candidates get A levels and GCSEs in 2021 by exams this summer.",
        "additional_details": "In 2020, private candidates were left lost without sufficient guidance from the government, exam centres or exam boards. This left many without the results to progress on to further education. The department of education stated last summer that private candidates will have the option to sit exams in autumn 2020 or summer 2021. To cancel exams now will be postponing the future of many hard working students who chose the latter. Therefore, the opportunity for exams must exist this summer for some.",
        "background": "There must be at least an optional exam series this summer for applicants who would not be able to receive calculated grades as they cannot provide adequate evidence to exam centres. The only fair way to judge the ability of private candidates would be through an exam series.",
