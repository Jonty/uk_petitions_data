Its sad to see such hard work input and little reward in pay compared to other graduate working sectors! \r\n\r\nStaff have to choose whether to join a union, not have a pension or to make ends meet which is a sad position to be in when working hard and graduating to have a good job in life.

A Pay freeze on the public sector is not understandable when MPS/Lords are expecting a pay increase in spring. Yet again failing teachers! When will this happen 2024?",
