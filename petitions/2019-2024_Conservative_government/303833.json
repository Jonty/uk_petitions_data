        "action": "Instruct Councils to be fair to those self-isolating who cannot pay council tax",
        "additional_details": "Councils have a notorious reputation for dealing harshly with those that fall behind on Council Tax payments, and in light of the current Coronavirus situation it is possible that many financially hard pressed households who will lose some income may struggle to make their weekly or monthly payments. Councils should be instructed from Central Government to deal fairly and reasonably with these individuals and households as they have advised mortgage lenders.",
        "background": "In the same way that the Government has advised mortgage lenders to use common sense and leniency to those struggling to make mortgage payments due to self-isolating or who are ill because of Coronavirus, the same rules should be applied to local councils re council tax payments.",
