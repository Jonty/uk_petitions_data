        "additional_details": "As pupils have missed out on important academic learning and disruption. It will give poeple time to overcome the academic. Those from poorer backgrounds have missed out on education and not able to catch up. For example those in year 6 now, missed out on all learning in year 5 as year 6 is for recap for tests and same for GCSE levels.",
        "background": "Pupils will be kept back a year. So next September 2021 they will remain in the same year they are now.\r\nSo they can catch up on the year missed at school, as there are still more lockdowns to come.\r\nAs the vaccine probably wont be available to everyone to mid next year.",
