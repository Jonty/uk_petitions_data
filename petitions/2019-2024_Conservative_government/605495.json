Virtually all essential workers have no choice but to travel to their place of work at great expense and commuting time. Those with the option to work from home save on fuel or train fares, less wear and tear and depreciation on their vehicles, cheaper car insurance plus gain far more home time with no commute involved, saving them thousands of pounds.",
