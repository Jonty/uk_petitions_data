Legislation should be introduced where humans are prosecuted for their dogs actions. For example if a dog killer someone, their owner be sentenced to murder! This will stop irresponsible people considering dog ownership if not for the right reasons! This narrative being spread by the media that these dogs are \u201ckillers\u201d is simply untrue. Any dog given love gives love back, no exceptions!",
