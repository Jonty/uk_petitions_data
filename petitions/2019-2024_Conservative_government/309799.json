        "additional_details": "Employers and businesses decide to lay off their staff instead of retaining them because the scheme is not well explained and the fact the employer has to advance the money is a big brick wall ! Most small businesses cannot afford paying upfront and waiting for the government to pay them back at an undisclosed date. It defeats the point of the chancellers plea to employers not to lay off millions of employees.",
        "background": "Currently the scheme is not available to use straight away as HMRC is still working it out. Millions need the money now to pay for bills. Also make the scheme available so employer doesn't have to advance the money waiting to be reimbursed as it is the reason why they're laying off their staff.",
