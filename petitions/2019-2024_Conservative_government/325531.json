        "additional_details": "Samuel Sharpe was a slave and Baptist minister in the then Plantocracy of Jamaica. He organised peaceful protests which led to the Bapist war.\r\n\r\nWe must not erase history or in any way try to blunt it to feign historic innocence or virtuosity, but we must take action to ensure that those who should be commemorated are. We can not take pride for our ancestors abolishing slavery whilst at the same time maintaining statues to honour the slaver traders and owners themselves.",
        "background": "Recent protests against police systemic racism in the UK catalysed by the protest in the USA have resulted in the demolition of the statue of Edward Colston.\r\n\r\nIt is important that we remember our history but we should commemorate heros like Samuel Sharpe who initiated the Bapist War slave revolt.",
