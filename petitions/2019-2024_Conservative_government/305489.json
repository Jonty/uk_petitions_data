Although government policy is changing by the half-day, there is as yet no guarantee that rent or bill freezes will be in place to protect a sharply incremental group of students who will be unable to work or will lack financial support as a result of self-isolation. An early instalment will help alleviate avoidable financial difficulties for a great many.",
