With the addition of allowing communities of people such as the Muslim community have access to University who may have avoided the loans due to the interest rates and their beliefs.",
        "background": "UK student national debt is a crisis waiting to happen, with a current 2.3% interest rate per year for students under 47k, with this rising to 5.3% after 47k, this interest rate is nearly 5x greater than the prior to 2012 interest rates which where fixed at 1.1%, making this loan impossible to pay.",
