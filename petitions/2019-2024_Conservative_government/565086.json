        "additional_details": "Coronavirus restrictions have prevented millions of families from gathering to celebrate birthdays, weddings and even mourn at funerals. With the end of this situation in sight the public should be given a celebration to look forward to. If the government shows a willingness to allow people to recover this could help to improve compliance with the current restrictions and improve the mental well-being of those worst affected by this dire situation.",
        "background": "Due to coronavirus restrictions many people have been confined to their homes, unable to easily meet loved ones. \r\n\r\nWhen it is safe to fully lift restrictions the public should be given the opportunity to relax and heal from this distressing experience through a one off public holiday.",
