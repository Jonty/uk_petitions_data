        "action": "High-speed broadband to be a legal right for UK homes",
        "additional_details": "According to Ofcom, superfast broadband services offering predicted download speeds of at least 30Mbps were available to 95% of UK homes and offices in 2019. By 2020, this had risen to 96%. It is now 2021 and we are in the midst of a global pandemic in which British citizens are legally obliged to 'work from home'. This is impossible with internet speeds that are still as low as 3Mbps in some areas of the UK. This cannot wait any longer, 100% of UK homes deserve superfast broadband this year.",
        "background": "British homes and businesses should have a legal right to high-speed broadband. Broadband providers should have a legal requirement to provide reliable, high-speed broadband to anyone who requests it, no matter where they are in the country.",
