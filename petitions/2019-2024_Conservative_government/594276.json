The management company charged \u00a3350 for their sellers pack which included the annual budget, statement showing our payments, insurance certificate, service charge statements\u2026 this took 10-14 working days to be sent which delayed the property sale. Our statement and the annual budget are sent to us annually and this additional paperwork should be provided for free to tenants to save time and so they are not exploited with these charges",

This can be kept until a sale and passed to the buyer. Annual budgets and updates could be sent throughout the year. Any lost or missing paperwork could be charged to replace.",
