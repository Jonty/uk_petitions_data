There would be more support given by the students if this is sorted. We feel voiceless.\r\nALLOW us to have our voices heard. \r\nStudents are struggling with exams, grades. Students would benefit more if this were sorted.",
        "background": "I would like them to listen to us students for once and cancel the exams. Create an environment where we can prove ourselves without exams. Make grades assessed by teachers with valid evidence submitted. Coronavirus has affected us negatively and no thought has been given to students.",
