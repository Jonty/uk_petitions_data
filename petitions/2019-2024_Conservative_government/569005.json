        "additional_details": "This is the only fair and reasonable way for our young people and university students to receive the education, training and life experience that they deserve and for them to prepare and take exams without prejudice.\r\n\r\nIt will prevent already disadvantaged young people from being further disadvantaged; remove pressure from parents, teachers and young people to cover the same syllabus material as normal and allow exams to be taken without fear of failure.",
        "background": "Covid-19 has massively impacted children's education and exams this year. This petition requests that the Government restart the academic year so each year group will effectively finish their education a year later than normal if young people have been in full time education during the pandemic.",
