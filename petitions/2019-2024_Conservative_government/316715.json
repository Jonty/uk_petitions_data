        "additional_details": "Sky lanterns are dangerous as the cannot be controlled, they can fall anywhere and have been responsible for starting numerous fires. They have also landed on livestock causing serious injuries to animals, meaning some have had to be euthanised. \r\n\r\nThe remains often contain wires which in themselves can cause injuries to wildlife, as well as causing pollution.",
        "background": "We would like the sale and use of sky (Chinese) lanterns banned in the United Kingdom. These small lanterns use naked flames to enable the lantern to float into the sky. They cannot be controlled and as a result can fall anywhere.\r\n\r\nWe would like it to be against the law to sell or use these.",
