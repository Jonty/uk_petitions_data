        "additional_details": "I think the NHS staff feel very undervalued at the moment. They are worried about all kinds of things, and their health is one of those things. Paramedics and other front line staff have been evicted from their houses, some have sacrificed seeing their families for months, and they still do 12-16 hour shifts, helping the sick and vulnerable, risking their lives in an ever changing situation.  They deserve applause and recognition from the country they serve and the people they help.",
        "background": "Once the Covid-19 outbreak is over we are calling on the Government to award those who were on the frontline, those who risked their lives, and made great sacrifice for their work to receive an honour in recognition.",
