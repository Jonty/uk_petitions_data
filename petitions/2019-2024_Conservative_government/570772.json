        "additional_details": "Change policy for all childcare settings so children can attend with conjunctivitis if currently treated with antibiotics or merely home remedies i.e breast milk, frequent cleansing of the eyes with warm water. Children shouldn't have to be prescribed a course of unnecessary antibiotics merely to enable them to return to their childcare setting. Unnecessary trip to the GP, time out of childcare and parents time away from work. This needs to be reviewed urgently.",
        "background": "Change the national childcare settings policy to allow children to attend with conjunctivitis if currently treated or not. A doctor will tell you they only prescribe antibiotics eyedrops in order for you to get your child back into the childcare setting.",
