        "additional_details": "The fact that disabled people account for nearly 60% of recorded UK deaths, highlights the extreme risk that disabled people currently face due to Covid. As the deaths in the report are only those where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, this does not account for potential increase in mortality amongst disabled people that has been caused by broader effects of this crisis. The report also cannot identify one clear causation for this, which is doubly concerning.",
