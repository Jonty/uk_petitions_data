        "additional_details": "People on benefits, pensioners on low income and single people who live alone, find themselves faced with disproportionate amount to pay for their water supply compared to their income. The current system is broken with companies all doing their own schemes. In addition the DWP allows companies to get an attachment to benefits for any water debt a person has. This must not be allowed. Water poverty is making us into a third world country. To have to pay 6% of their income for water is unjust.",
        "background": "Currently all water companies have different schemes to handle water supply debt. Some right off debt, others don\u2019t . Some apply to the DWP to get water debt payments taken directly from  benefits and this practice must be stopped. People on low incomes can no longer afford  to have a water supply.",
