        "action": "Abandon the proposed change to Spouse Visa Income Requirements",
        "additional_details": "The proposals increase the minimum income requirement on the UK dwelling spouse by over \u00a320,000 to \u00a338,700. \r\n\r\nThis will mean 73% of the UK will be too poor to have a foreign spouse live with them and couples already engaged do not have time to adapt their plans. This will particularly impact younger people, women and those who live outside London and is a cruel, uncalled for change. These changes are immoral, heartless and should be stopped. Who we can love should not depend on our paychecks.",
        "background": "On December 4th, the government released a proposal to increase the minimum income requirement for spouse/family visas to \u00a338,700.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will split up families, cause untold pain and make loving who you choose a privilege of the rich. The petition calls to remove this proposed change.",
