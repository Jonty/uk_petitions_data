Scotland at least payed a bonus. Boris Johnson took a IT bed, then says he cannot thank the NHS enough, but then does nothing, he and MP's will take a pay award, probably a big one based on how hard they have worked, NHS has always worked hard and then this government let's the NHS down again.",

Give A bonus, pay award we deserve.",
