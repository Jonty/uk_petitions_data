Those who are Working in a nursing home, As you know we are front line staff in fight against this virus, we do not receive any salary support for all the risks and caring Covid patients.  \r\n\r\nWe look after Covid patients, and we got infected.

As breadwinner of my family of 3 I cannot afford to meet expenses. we are already stretched beyond our limits. If husband and wife working in care home, They cannot meet daily leaving expenses never.\r\nI hope we have a favorable action from Government .",
