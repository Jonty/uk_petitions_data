We believe the government should play its part in helping save public money during this financial uncertainty by cutting the costs of meals provided in the members dining room. This will reduce the overall cost of providing meals to MPs, money which can be used to help poor families struggling to feed themselves and their children.\r\n\r\nMPs could perhaps also be offered lessons on how to cook their own 30p meals or prepare packed lunches.",
