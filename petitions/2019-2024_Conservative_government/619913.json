Nobody has been excluded from the original flag.\r\n\r\nThe new 'pride' flags that have developed since 2018 are influenced by new activist views wanting people to say 'women can produce semen', change language used for a millennia & want to enforce a new belief system. Governments must not allow buildings & streets to use these flags.",
