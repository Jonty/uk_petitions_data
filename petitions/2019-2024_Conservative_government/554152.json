        "additional_details": "A large number of kids will turn 18 during the season which means they qualify to play as U18s. With current restrictions, as they turn 18 they have to stop playing as this violates the rule of 6. This means they can not play and clubs who rely on players might not be able to afford the season, or provide facilities for the rest of the team.  The rule should be if you qualify to be licensed as a junior, you are treated as such for the entire season regardless of age and are exempt.",
        "background": "To allow for players who turn 18 during the course of the basketball season to continue to be exempt as a Junior player so they can continue with their last season of junior basketball, regardless of level of play.",
