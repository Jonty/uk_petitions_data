        "additional_details": "The government need to take action and Johnson needs to resign. He has accepted no responsibility for the hundreds & thousands of lives is wholly responsible for. He shows absolutely no remorse for anything he has done and has the responsibility innate ability to distance himself from all bad decisions made. \r\nHe is clearly not capable of being PM and has only his cronies and friends interests at heart and not the electorate. It is a damning indictment to democracy.",
        "background": "Hundreds of thousands of people have unnecessarily died due to Johnson\u2019s mishandling of the pandemic. He shows no sense of responsibility and no humility and needs to resign with immediate effect. \r\nAt PMQs, Johnson does not answer questions posed to him and believes he is above the law.",
