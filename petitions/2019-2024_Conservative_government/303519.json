        "additional_details": "Without this measure, we risk students avoiding self-isolation because they are conscientious and are subject to the pressures of exams. We risk staff avoiding self-isolation because they feel under pressure to teach their examination classes and make the ratios of invigilation during the exams. Students can't be expected to attain to their highest possible standard during these stressful and uncertain times. Therefore, Public exams should be rescheduled to a more appropriate time.",
        "background": "As a result of the government's response to the Coronavirus outbreak, with the peak expected in May-June, for the safety of schools, invigilators and pulpils taking SATS, GCSEs and A Levels, we ask that the government consider drastic measures to reschedule these Public Exams.",
