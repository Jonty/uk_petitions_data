        "additional_details": "Every year, thousands of women are left depressed, distraught, alone and hurt, after being refused a sterilisation by their GP. \r\n\r\nIt is well known that any man, despite age, background or number of existing children, can walk into a doctors office, ask for sterilisation, and be referred immediately.\r\n\r\nMany women request sterilisation due to knowing they will not want any more children, or maybe they don\u2019t want children at all, or maybe it\u2019s for a medical reason.\r\n\r\nWomen deserve to choose.",
        "background": "Allow women, over the age of 18, the freedom to choose to be sterilised, no matter their age, reasons, or if they already have children.\r\nAllow GP\u2019s to take these matters seriously, to stop saying \u2018no\u2019 to these women, and stop removing their right to choose what happens to their bodies.",
