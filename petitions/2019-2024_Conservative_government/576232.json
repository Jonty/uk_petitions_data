        "additional_details": "its 2021 and many many people in my age group and above stuggle to find affordable, non shared ownership or proper housing to buy. this should not be an issue and all should be able to buy their own house or flat especially with many many buildings these days simply being turned into housing or flats (thats another issue) i wish for the government or parliament to change this and to make it easier for housing to be bought at far more reasonable prices without attachments or paying for life.",
        "background": "Simply put... as a man in his mid to late 20s it is not easy at all to buy your own house or flat. I wish for that to be changed/made easier and for the ludicrous housing prices to be lowered to reasonable levels so that all may be able to live or be safe. Housing should not be a luxury!.",
