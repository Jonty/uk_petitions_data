        "additional_details": "Teachers were instructed to predict grades based on evidence such as mock exams, coursework, class performance and professional judgement. Extensive evidence was used to predict grades as fairly as possible in the unprecedented circumstances. However, a skewed moderation process has seen 40% of A Level results downgraded. Although grades across the board are statistically slightly higher than previous years, the majority of this increase was seen by independent schools. Children from economically deprived areas and schools viewed as \u2018lower attaining\u2019 have taken the brunt of lowered grades. This discrimination determines young futures using factors that are irrelevant to individual performance and accentuates disparity in education. We cannot let students down in this unjust way.",
        "background": "Thoroughly review the integrity of the moderation process used to award final grades to students and ensure that it is completely free of charge for any student to appeal their result if it is lower than predicted.",
