        "additional_details": "Divorcing couples already face a lot of stress, and may be angry with their spouses, but they must live with the consequences of a court\u2019s divorce decision for the rest of their lives. The government should rewrite the divorce procedures to include an obligation to undergo mediation before the court hearing, eliminate perceived behaviour of the parties as a factor in the settlement, and ban cross-examination of the spouses in court.",
        "background": "The traditional British system of adversarialism is inappropriate and immoral in family cases such as divorce. The concept of a \u2018winner\u2019 and a \u2018loser\u2019 is incompatible with parliament\u2019s expressed requirement for a \u2018fair\u2019 settlement. Spouses appearing in court should be treated with respect.",
