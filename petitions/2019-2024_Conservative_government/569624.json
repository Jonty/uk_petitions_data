        "additional_details": "In most cases the social services work against both parents if domestic violence has taken place often removing children despite children have strong attachments to both perpetrators and victim. In many cases children\u2019s law courts have made wrongful decisions and awarded custody to fathers who have used the social services to inflict further pain and control upon their partner. Children often in these outcomes retort to self harm, cptsd, eating disorders, and other destructive behaviours.",

For the social services to not further stunt the speaking out of coercive control by punishing the victim and  often removing children.",

You might find the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman\u2019s guidance on complaining about child social services helpful: https://www.lgo.org.uk/make-a-complaint/fact-sheets/social-care/children-s-care-services\r\n\r\nIf a court has made decisions about the care of your child and you wish to challenge this, you should seek legal advice."
