        "additional_details": "I want the government to do this because so many girls and women live in poverty and sanitary products cost so much when they are a necessity to all women who have periods. So many girls have to miss out on things like education, and socialising because they don't have enough money to pay for period protection and have to use unpleasant alternatives like socks or toilet roll! Nobody should go through this so that's why all period protection in shops and in public places should be free!",
