        "additional_details": "The amplification of breathing difficulties is a long term dehabilitating problem that puts increased strain on the NHS over a sustained period. A simple instruction to bus drivers to switch off engines - or better still companies reduce services or replace engines - would pay for itself and save lives, the environment and prevent related mental health issues. This is not really debatable - it's a simple win win situation.",
        "background": "Amplified by the lack of passengers, buses idling outside residential properties is rapidly increasing respiratory problems. This is a dangerous pattern - \"regulating the service\" is not an excuse as bus companies could easily refine the timetables, reduce services and/or replace older engines",
