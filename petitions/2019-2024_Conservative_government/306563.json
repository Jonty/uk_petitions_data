        "additional_details": "We ask the Government to review its decision and extend its aid package to the Medical Services and other essential service providers who are disproportionally affected at this time. It seems particularly harsh that during a time of a health crisis the Government is not providing aid for medical services.\r\n\r\nPersonally as a healthcare provider who is desperately trying to keep our patients healthy as well as our team employed I implore this review as soon as possible.\u00a0",
        "background": "This morning the Government denied Medical Services (Dentists, Osteopaths, Chiropractors, Doctors, Vets) eligibility for the business rates relief.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely disappointing that at a time of a health emergency Medical Services are penalised when they are needed the most.",
