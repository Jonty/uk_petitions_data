        "additional_details": "Those vaccinated abroad with an MHRA approved vaccines are no different in immunity to those vaccinated in the UK and should be treated the same. For example, currently those vaccinated abroad would still have to self-isolate when they were in close contact to a positive tested person whereas those vaccinated in the UK would not have to. Those vaccinated abroad are also currently not able to obtain an NHS Pass to prove they're vaccinated although they are vaccinated.",
        "background": "Residents and Citizens vaccinated abroad should enjoy the same benefits and follow the same rules as those vaccinated in the UK. The recognition of foreign vaccines should not be limited to just entering the country.",
