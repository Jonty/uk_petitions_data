        "additional_details": "We want England to follow with the Scottish in adding LGBTQ history to the curriculum. Our history is an integral part of modernism, yet it's not taught. With monumental movements such as the Stonewall Riots and people such as Sylvia Rivera, our history deserves justice. With this education, people can become confident within their identities. Knowledge is power and can create systematic change and therefore decrease bullying in schools which is currently an issue facing LGBTQ young people.",
        "background": "We want the government to add LGBTQ+ history to the English national curriculum in both primary and secondary schools. LGBTQ+ history must be present in both the History syllabus and English Syllabus. Include movements, influential people, passing of laws and writers.",
