        "additional_details": "These lanterns are creating massive invisible implications to the environment we call home. We need to take measures to prevent the solid matter pollution throughout our earths habitats. And this can start very simply by banning the sale or fining the users of open flame lanterns that cause multiple livestock, pet and wildlife fatalities and injuries every year. \r\nThey are pointless, gain nothing and potentially damage a lot, so remove them from circulation and punish anybody found using them.",
        "background": "Issue fixed penalty notices for littering under section 87 of the environmental protection act 1990 (preventing persons from depositing litter into environment) to anybody who is found to be releasing open flame lanterns or found in possession of such lanterns.",
