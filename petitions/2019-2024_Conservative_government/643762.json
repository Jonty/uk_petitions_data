        "additional_details": "We need to move forward and stop the unnecessary killing of our dogs, having worked with dogs my whole life I see no bad breed just irresponsible owners an breeders. I feel that banning any breed is wrong and we should be moving towards licensing for dog owner and breeders, harsher punishment for breeders and owners. As well as education on responsibility of a dog owner. No one should just be able to go out and get a dog with having to learn and have knowledge of the breed they are looking at",
        "background": "Dogs are only dangerous in the wrong hand the only way forward is to End the dangerous dogs act, and stop unreasonable people and breeders from owning any dog no matter its size. Xl bully's and bully breeds are being discriminated against when it's infact the owners who are to blame.",
