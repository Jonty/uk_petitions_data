        "action": "Prevent the mayor of London from expanding the ULEZ zone to Greater London.",
        "additional_details": "The proposed ULEZ expansion will cost millions of people at least \u00a34,000 a year. It will cause such hardship to business, residents, visitors from outside London\u2019s perimeter that the overall economy of London will suffer badly.  Those who give or need care may be prevented from giving it or receiving it. Small businesses may have to close. As it will affect more than Londoners it must be a democratic decision by Parliament, not that of the Mayor of London, who has broken his public promise.",
        "background": "To repeal or modify any existing legal power which gives the Mayor of London the power to charge for the use of vehicles on the public roads on the grounds of the exhaust emissions. So that the ULEZ zone expansion would require a bill to be past in the House of Commons.",
