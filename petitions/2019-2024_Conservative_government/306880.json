        "additional_details": "I understand that people are panic buying during these incredibly scary and testing times but I am urging people to be thoughtful of others, especially the elderly who are essentially being left with nothing. I have seen numerous photos on social media of empty shelves and elderly people standing there with nothing. We cannot let this happen. There is enough for everyone if we all work together and help each other through this unprecedented time.",
        "background": "I am urging all supermarkets in the UK to allow a one hour time slot during the first trading house and let the elderly in to get their food shopping safely and securely without panic buyers present. We all need to help each other in any little way we can.",
