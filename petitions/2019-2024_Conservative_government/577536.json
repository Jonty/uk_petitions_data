        "additional_details": "I have worked as a teacher, a careers adviser, a family support worker, a mental health adviser and now I'm a parent. I have supported lots of young people who have been failed by the current system and have seen the effect of this - low self esteem, poor mental health and no ambition. The pandemic showed new ways of learning, which has highlighted the inflexibility of the system. Too many assessments get in the way of actual teaching and supporting children to be the best version of themselves",
