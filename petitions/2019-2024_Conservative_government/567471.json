        "additional_details": "Many students feel unprepared and scared for their GCSE\u2019S and giving them information on the topics in advanced will help with that or letting them have their books and revision as they have been deprived of 1-1 tutor time with their teachers. I feel this has left them completely scarce of learning opportunities they might have had in school that they haven\u2019t had in their homes. \r\nCan the government look at course work and teacher assessment rather than exams as there is  not enough preparation.",
        "background": "To help the teenagers in year 10 with their future. It\u2019s their life based on one paper and they have had months of not knowing what the future is going to look like and there for anxiety about school work. Some have missed lots of their work and are currently missing out on more because of COVID-19",
