        "action": "Criminalise misogynist virginity tests done in UK clinics that dehumanise women.",
        "additional_details": "The concept of virginity itself dehumanises women and is a byproduct of the misogyny still prevailing in society. Over the years and still very prevalent in other cultures, women are shamed for having sex and treated as \"damaged goods\" if they do have sex before marriage. \r\n\r\nThis is not a trait of a progressive society. It also puts women in real danger.\r\n\r\nWe the people of the UK, hereby call on Parliament to make this sexist, dangerous and archaic procedure illegal.",
        "background": "In the wake of the recent BBC investigation which revealed that intrusive virginity tests are being carried out on women by British medical clinics, we ask that this dehumanising unscientific and misogynist practice be made illegal to protect women from abuse.",
