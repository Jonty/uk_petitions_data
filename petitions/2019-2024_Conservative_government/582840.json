        "additional_details": "The statistics are plain to see, not just overfishing and plastic waste in our oceans from discarded fishing equipment, but the humanitarian crisis in the Asian fishing trade and the piracy in African waters. So called marine charities that are supposed to be regulating safe and sustainable fishing only exist to profit from the mass fishing in the first place! If the fishing industry cant support itself then its obviously time for the industry to die, just as you allowed with the coal industry.",
