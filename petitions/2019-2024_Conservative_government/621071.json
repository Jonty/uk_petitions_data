Liability for outstanding joint debts should fall equally and individually \u2013 neither should be liable for the other\u2019s debt. Parties should have first refusal to buy the other party\u2019s share of assets or may enter into a voluntary agreement for joint ownership, but judges should not have the power to order parties to continue joint ownership.",
