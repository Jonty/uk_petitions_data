        "action": "Let zoos, aquariums and wildlife parks open to the public in July 2020.",
        "additional_details": "Opening zoos to the public will enable funding for conservation projects but most importantly the welfare of captive animals. Zoos need income to provide essentials such as food and veterinary care. It also pays staff who are vital for ensuring animal welfare. Zoos cannot survive on donations and previous government financial support which may cause zoo closures. If this happens, captive animals cannot be cared for and many will not be able to be returned to the wild as they will not survive.",
        "background": "Zoos have been told to remain closed whereas attractions like theme parks can open in early July. Without visitor income, zoos cannot effectively care for their animals. As non-essential businesses are allowed to open, zoos should open too as it is essential to the welfare of captive animals.",
