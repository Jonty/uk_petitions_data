Posting pages sourced from google that contain errors is not sufficient. Expecting a child to complete work when they have no idea if that work is correct is not sufficient. I understand this is difficult for everyone but a standard system for all, which already exists but is not available to school aged children, should be made available. These children are already under an enormous amount of stress due to the changes to the GCSE format and now they feel their future is ruined.",
