        "action": "Vaccinate teachers and early years workers as a priority.",
        "additional_details": "Teachers and early years workers are looking after children every day, children who are coming from the homes of frontline workers and therefore could be carrying the virus. The government seem to have taken the stance that teachers do not need the vaccination perhaps because of children being of a lower prevalence for the virus, however they are also in contact with parents everyday and are unable to distance from the children due to the nature of their job. They need the vaccination.",
        "background": "Teachers and early years workers are being turned away from vaccination centres despite being in desperate need of protection against covid-19. The government needs to acknowledge teachers and early years workers as essential frontline workers who should be granted a vaccination as soon as able.",
