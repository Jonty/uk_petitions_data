        "additional_details": "Physical activity is important for many other aspects of physical health, and for mental health.\r\nIt poses no real risk if done responsibly.\r\nA ban would distract attention and police resources away from other, more effective, actions.\r\nIt would be 'collective punishment' of the majority who are doing their best to help with the Covid effort\r\nIt would particulary punish people without a garden to move about or relax in.",
        "background": "On 5/4/2020, Matt Hancock warned that, unless people follow the Covid guidelines on physical distancing, he would consider a total ban on exercising outdoors.\r\nCovid is a shocking disease, causing thousands of early deaths beyond the usual level \u2013 but Hancock's move would make things worse.",
