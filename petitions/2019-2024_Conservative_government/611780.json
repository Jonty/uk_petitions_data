        "action": "Prevent Renewable Energy Providers increasing prices based on Fossil Fuels(Gas)",
        "additional_details": "It is imperative the relationship between Fossil Fuel Prices including Gas are unlinked and the regulation of Electrical Energy supplied from Renewable Sources have separate caps based on the \u201cactual fixed and variable costs\u201d of such projects providing value to state and consumer and a \u201creasonable return\u201d to companies selling Electrical Energy from Renewable Sources. This requires revised Policy and Regulation as the current profiteering is wholly flawed and doesn\u2019t reflect market fairness.",
        "background": "Renewable Energy should be expected to add to our diversity and therefore security to consumers. Not only is it counter-intuitive that companies can raise Electrical Tariffs based on the price of Fossil Fuels including Gas, it is imperative this link is broken and separate caps are applied.",
