        "additional_details": "There is evidence that  selfish people are stockpiling goods, hopeful of profiting from a black market, ignoring  pleas to shop sensibly,  going back in several times to fill new trolleys up, and visiting several supermarkets  to buy up everything they can. Supermarket limits on purchases alone will not stop a food crisis in this country, especially as  drivers and supply-chain workers fall sick.The government has a moral duty to protect all citizens from the selfish actions of this minority.",
        "background": "Introduce a national wartime-style rationing system for basic foodstuffs and essential goods to cover every individual citizen in the UK for the duration of the virus epidemic to stop the selfish actions of some speculators impacting us all and to ensure all citizens get the supplies they need.",
