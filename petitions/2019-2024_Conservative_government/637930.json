People are being forced to attend local A&E departments and still aren\u2019t receiving the medical help they need due to being told they need to see their GP to arrange further tests, even though they can\u2019t get an appt as their GP\u2019s are only offering very limited face to face appts and a limited number of telephone appointments. This is not acceptable.",

The government should be forcing all U.K. GP surgeries to resume full normal services and reduce salaries of NHS GP\u2019s who refuse to comply with immediate effect.",
