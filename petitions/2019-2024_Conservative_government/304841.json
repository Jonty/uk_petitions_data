        "additional_details": "During the COVID-19 crisis, many have taken to panic buying. This has caused national shortages of essential items such as toilet roll, canned food, pasta, rice and hand wash. Supermarkets are barely able to keep up with the increased demand causing many people such as the elderly, the disabled and those who cannot afford to bulk buy to go without and for resellers to profit off of this crisis. Not enough retailers are implementing limits for those in need. We need the government to take action.",
        "background": "We would like the government to take action and implement a rule where supermarkets and online retailers are forced to place limits on the number of household essentials one person can buy. These include toilet roll, canned food, pasta, rice and hand wash.",
