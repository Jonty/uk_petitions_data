        "additional_details": "Wearing of cloth facial protection partially stops inhaling germs, and better stops folks spreading them. With SD they may reduce spreading with a blanket mandate. Much less invasive than lock-down. \r\nUS recommends medics to wear scarves as last resort, and folks to sew masks for hospital donation.\r\nEast Asia is better controlled, mask wearing universal, coincidence?\r\nAdvice needed about protection to use.\r\nAdvisory inadequate and easily undermined (stigmatization, nay sayers) , Enforcement simple.",
        "background": "Mandate the wearing of facial protection by any individual leaving their home. Protection should not be medical grade, as this needs to be reserved for hospitals etc. Protection can be as simple as a scarf or a tea towel, and encourage individuals to sew masks for donation to medical institutions.",
