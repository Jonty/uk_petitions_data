        "additional_details": "Create an additional driving test for motorway driving, to be taken within a year of the main driving test. This will allow drivers to build their experience and confidence on the roads, ready to tackle motorway driving. 'P' plates to be made mandatory until the 2nd test is passed. 'P' plate drivers will not be allowed outside of lane 1 on motorways. The test will focus on lane discipline, correct merging procedure, overtaking etc. Easing congestion at fraction of the cost of new motorway lanes.",
        "background": "Lane discipline on UK motorways is sub-standard. Drivers all too often hog middle lanes, causing traffic to back up. Millions of pounds are spent creating additional lanes or 'smart motorways' in an attempt to ease congestion. But drivers still hog middle lanes, backing up following traffic.",
