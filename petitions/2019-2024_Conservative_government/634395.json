The behaviour of these institutions, however, also has vast systemic financial implications. \r\nShort Selling (SS) is a mechanism institutions use to make money at huge expense to others. Due to its current flagrant use, it now poses great systemic risk. Democratic oversight of the forthcoming revision of UK SS regulation is vital.",
