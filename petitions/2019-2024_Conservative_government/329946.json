        "additional_details": "The Government should not prevent legal citizens of Hong Kong from, if they choose to, living and working in the UK. China clearly shows no concern for the conditions of the handover, essentially making the agreement null and void at the expense of its citizens; many of whom still hold British overseas passports. Those who so chose should be given the right to live and work in the UK, many of whom already work in industries based in or affiliated with the UK economy.",
        "background": "Hong Kong residents, who were British for hundreds of years, have been subject to restrictions and denied human rights by China since the Handover. Most Hong Kong residents do not wish to be a part of China and it is only right they should be able to live and work in the UK if they chose to.",
