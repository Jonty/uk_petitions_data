        "additional_details": "In the nations bid to go greener, cycling is becoming increasingly popular with commuters and recreational users. There is currently no mandatory level of protection for cyclist, they are under no obligation to pass information to a third party in the event of a collision whether they are the responsible party or not. I feel that as we are now in a position where we are 'sharing' the road with many more users, it would be the reponsible thing to do by all users to have a valid insurance policy.",
        "background": "Make it a legal requirement for cyclists using the main highway to pay an insurance premium to protect themselves and motor vehicle users.\r\nAs it stands, cyclists are under no obligation to pass information to a third party in the event of a collision no matter who's at fault.",
