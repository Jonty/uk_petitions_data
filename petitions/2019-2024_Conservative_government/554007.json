        "additional_details": "Austerity is the reason why over the past few years there have been so many news stories on cuts to the amount of doctors and nurses there are in the UK. The covid-19 pandemic has shown the damage that austerity has done to our NHS; overcrowded hospitals, people waiting for beds to be made available are all symptoms of austerity. So please sign this petition and help end austerity, it\u2019s already gone on for too long.",
        "background": "Austerity has been how the UK government has decreased public spending by cutting funds to public services such as schools and medical care. It has stopped these services from being able to help as many people as they can and people\u2019s lives have been drastically effected by this.",

See: \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/nhs-funding-bill-enters-parliament\r\nhttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8798/\r\n\r\nThe Government has also announced a cumulative spending increase of over \u00a314 billion in primary and secondary education between now and 2022/23.
