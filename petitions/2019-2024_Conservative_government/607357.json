We are almost at the point where there is more plastic than fish, and \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 are in the food chain.",

National Highways should be forced to keep the roads safe and clear of such litter, and use their cameras to catch and prosecute those who litter, and use the revenue for clean ups.",
