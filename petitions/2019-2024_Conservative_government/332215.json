        "additional_details": "During the 13 week covid-19 lockdown, house building has not been able to go ahead. This has left a situation where many build completetion dates are having to be extended. This means that people who have already secured a new house are at risk of losing it as build dates are being pushed beyond the help to buy cut off date of decemeber 31st. This essentially means anyone who is trying to buy a home with help to buy has to have their home legally completed before december 31st or their mortgage offer will fall through meaning they will lose their home.",
        "background": "Extend the help to buy scheme to buyers, who have already applied for the scheme, who are at risk of losing their new home due to the 13 week lockdown where house built dates have been extended past the help to buy cut off date.",
