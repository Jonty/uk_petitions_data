        "additional_details": "We find it despicable that the UK Government has underhandedly stripped Ukrainians of the ability to apply for British visas in their hour of greatest need. We believe the Government should back up its words on solidarity with Ukraine with actions, including allowing Ukrainians, a people whose homes are being stolen and destroyed, to enter the UK and providing safety for them. The UK has a proud history of allowing refugees from war-torn Europe a safe haven, and it must set an example now.",
        "background": "The UK should follow the likes of Ireland, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary by opening its borders to Ukrainian refugees for as long as necessary, in the hope that they will one day be able to return. It should waive requirements for the Ukrainian partners and families of British citizens to remain here",
