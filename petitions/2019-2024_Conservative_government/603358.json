        "additional_details": "Current rules only allow current government to decide on when an election is called, which can be as much as four to five years, however this can be a long time and government policy can change rapidly in certain situations. The public should have the option to change governments if enough people feel that the government elected is not carrying out the publics wishes. Parties can also internally change the leader of the country through their own vote of no confidence and appoint an unelected prime minister.",
