        "additional_details": "The British government has already ceased arms sales to Turkey but this isn\u2019t enough, by not speaking out against this injustice is to allow a member of NATO, and a prominent nation in the world stage, to mercilessly attack men, women, the elderly and even children for something as minor as their ethnicity. The crimes being committed are truly disturbing and the lack of discussion about it is even worse.",
        "background": "As a Kurdish teenager myself, I am utterly shocked and mortified at the videos of bombings of innocent Kurds being carried out by the Turkish military, it is a crime against humanity to take innocent lives so discriminatorily, and the British government should not stand for it.",
