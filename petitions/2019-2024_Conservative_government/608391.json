        "additional_details": "My child, who is in reception, is unable to wash up after using the toilet in school. Installing bidet showers will give my child access to a hygiene concept we believe in and follow at home. Installing bidet showers in no way compels anyone who doesn\u2019t want t use them to use them. It only gives children who do clean with water the opportunity to do so. I\u2019m a country as diverse as the the UK, this seems like something that should\u2019ve already been thought of.",
