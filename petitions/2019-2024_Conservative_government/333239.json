        "additional_details": "Many couples that were due to get married have suffered a lot of heartache, stress and expense when they had to be cancel their big day following the government prohibiting them to go ahead during the height of the Coronavirus pandemic. They are also being told that they have to give notice to marry again and pay the charges again, if they are rescheduling their weddings and extending past the 12 month period of when they gave their original notice to marry. This is unfair and should be waived.",
        "background": "Give an extension for those couples who have given notice to marry prior to the pandemic, as many couples have now had to postpone their weddings and are therefore being forced to give notice again and pay the charges for a second time.",
