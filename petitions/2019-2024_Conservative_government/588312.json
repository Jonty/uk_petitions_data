        "additional_details": "Because there is no law against people taking pictures in public places of children this leave parents having pictures of their children taken without consent without the law on their side. If the law that you need parent or guardians permission and if not them police can withhold and remove any photos of children off devices. I think this will protect vulnerable children and decrease child abuse, child exploitation and expose peadophiles.",
        "background": "Change the law of being able to take a picture of children in a public area without consent.\r\nMy children had entered a local shop and a adult male had said they were cute and had taken a photo without consent to show other males. Because it is not illegal I couldn\u2019t have the man to remove the photo",
