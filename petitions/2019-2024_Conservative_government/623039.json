        "additional_details": "1) the government should provide a level of support for the population whereby the consumer is largely protected from increased energy prices \r\n2) it is morally wrong for highly paid ministers to claim expenses while there are members of the population choosing between heating their homes & their families eating \r\n3) having a fund that is dedicated to renewable home-grown sources of energy and contingency for UK energy would safeguard the population against future energy crises",
        "background": "Prohibit ministers from claiming any form of expenses for the duration of the current energy crisis i.e until energy prices equal those of 2021.All saved expenses should go back into supporting consumers or creating a fund for renewable energy sources or emergencies regarding energy throughout UK",
