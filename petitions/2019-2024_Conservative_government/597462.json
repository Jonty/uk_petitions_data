        "additional_details": "I have had 2 doses of Novavax vaccine, but am now disadvantaged because I took part in this trial. I am unable to travel because no other country will accept that I am double jabbed. I am unable to obtain 2 does of an approved vaccine because I have been on this trial, and I am now also unable to obtain information from the trial or my own GP about getting a booster jab. This is very stressful, and makes me certain I will never undertake a clinical trial again.",

Stop trial volunteers being disadvantaged because they took part in a clinical trial, and not discourage others from volunteering.",
