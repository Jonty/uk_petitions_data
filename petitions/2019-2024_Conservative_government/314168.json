        "additional_details": "Most community pharmacists and pharmacy staff work tirelessly long days and 6-7 days to help combat the COVID crisis. Often they have to do overtime to cover for self isolated colleagues and consequently  pay even more tax. It\u2019s only fair to freeze tax for next 12 month for them, as most work for corporates and multiples and getting pay rise is not realistic.",
