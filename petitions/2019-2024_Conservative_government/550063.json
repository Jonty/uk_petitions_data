        "additional_details": "If the Government cut content for all A-Level subjects, this wouldn\u2019t disrupt the time where examinations take place and it will allow for a bit of normalcy for students doing exams in 2021. A-Level students are arguably more stressed about learning the content rather then when the exams will be. We do not want more time to prepare, because we will never feel prepared due to the impact that the virus has had on our education. However, cutting content will make the student\u2019s mental health significantly better in the long run.",
        "background": "The Government should cut content from A-Level Subjects rather than delay the examinations. Delaying the examinations will not benefit us, but cutting content will.",
