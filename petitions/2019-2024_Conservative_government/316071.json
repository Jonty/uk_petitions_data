        "additional_details": "The rationale behind this is that up until now job types have been rewarded on a false set of values, which has only now been exposed due to this crisis.   Whilst those better rewarded are mostly working from home, the people who are currently putting their very lives on the line are generally less well recompensed.   That makes no sense and has to stop.  The change to a 2 tier system would allow both public servants and private employees to know and feel that they are truly valued.",

We are now aware of what these jobs are.",
