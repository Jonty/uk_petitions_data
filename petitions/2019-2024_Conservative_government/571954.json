        "additional_details": "Not being able to drive is really affecting people. It is causing people to drive illegally and yet the people behind the wheel are perfect drivers. Driving instructors are in the car with students more than anyone else. They are probably better people to pass their students than the examiner on the test day. They know exactly how well you can drive and how you react in situations that done come up in the test. This would help so many people if parliament allow this to go ahead.",
        "background": "Many people have had driving tests cancelled (I have had 4 myself) yet I am (like others) perfectly able to drive a car safely. Many people need to be driving for work, and we cannot keep relying on other people. It is unfair that so many can drive but haven\u2019t been given the chance of having a test",
