        "additional_details": "This will prevent property sales falling through due to parties not being able to complete the agreed sale after stamp duty is reintroduced. The stamp duty holiday has caused such a huge backlog of pending property sales that many will not complete in time before the end of the stamp duty holiday due to sales not being able to be processed quick enough.",
        "background": "Opposing the petition to extend the stamp duty relief, this petition is to only enable the completion of the sale of properties that have already had a memorandum of sale prior to 31st March 2021 with the stamp duty relief still applied, as long as completed withing 12 months after 31st March 2021",
