        "additional_details": "Hunts regularly trespass where they\u2019re unwelcome-including on railways & main roads. There have been attacks on pets & livestock. Many people are intimidated into silence. Police claim that the legislation makes the law difficult to enforce & uphold. \r\nWe see no such havoc from bloodhounds genuinely hunting a scent. All the evidence suggests that hunts continue to flout the law, using a combination of exemptions, lies, loopholes & smokescreens. This is untenable & bringing the law into disrepute.",
        "background": "Hunts continue to chase and kill foxes, hares, deer and mink, both by using loopholes in the law & by claiming to lay trails and then claiming hunting of mammals is \u2018accidental\u2019. We are asking for all loopholes to be closed, penalties strengthened & wording amended to prevent cynical subterfuge.",
