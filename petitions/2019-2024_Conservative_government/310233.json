There is a shortage of deliveries leaving these people vulnerable. \r\nCurrently many do not have the medical conditions that the government listed to count these people as vulnerable yet they are some of the most vulnerable people in society and they need help during this pandemic.",

Unfortunately the government didn\u2019t include a large amount of vulnerable people such as disabled and sick who qualify for PIP.",
