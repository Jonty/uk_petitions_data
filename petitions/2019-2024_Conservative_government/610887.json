Decisions about whether to use these rates or use different rates are a matter for individual employers, not the UK Government or Parliament. If employers reimburse employees at a higher rate than the Government's approved Mileage Allowance Payments, they have to report this to HMRC.\r\n\r\nFind out more about Mileage Allowance Payments here: https://www.gov.uk/expenses-and-benefits-business-travel-mileage/rules-for-tax"
