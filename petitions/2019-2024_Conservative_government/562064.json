        "additional_details": "As stated above regarding sports fans, it will be argued that this is because sports stadiums are outdoors, however you can go to a pub and eat indoors and there are more than 15 people in the pub at one time \u2018socially distanced\u2019. There is also no limit on how many can be in an office working as long as you \u2018socially distance\u2019. It should same for weddings based on the capacity, half the guests therefore maintains social distancing with tables and guests.",
        "background": "To be allowed to invite guests at half the capacity of the venue. With the new tier system in place allowing up to 4000 fans to a sports match, but only allowed 15 guests at a wedding is massively unfair.",
