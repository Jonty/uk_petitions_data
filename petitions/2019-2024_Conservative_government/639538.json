        "additional_details": "Our abortion laws are outdated, unfair and need clarification. I am asking our Government to repeal sections 58 and 59 from the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. \r\n\r\nSection 58 reads as: \"A woman is guilty of an offence if she unlawfully procures her own miscarriage\". \r\n\r\nSection 59 reads as: \"Anyone who supplies drugs or instruments to be unlawfully used to procure abortion is guilty of an offence\". \r\n\r\nI am also asking for the repeal of the above sections to include transgender men.",
        "background": "Women and transgender men have a right to bodily autonomy, and this includes abortion. Sections 58 and 59 have been removed from statute in Northern Ireland. Recent events have proved this is now required in England, Scotland and Wales.",
