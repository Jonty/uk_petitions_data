        "additional_details": "This recent law to display calories on menus, comes with no education around what calories are and whether that item is nutritious or not. This will further increase the number of people with eating disorders and body dysmorphia in the UK, which is already on the rise. The mental stress of eating out for those people is further increased by calories being displayed. There is no education on what is nutritious, instead foods are now numbers which in the long run will cause more harm than good.",
