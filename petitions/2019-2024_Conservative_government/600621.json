        "additional_details": "This has been a concern for many years and it\u2019s gone on for to long and has affected more people and animals then ever necessary. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever why a firework should go bang, some of the noises these make can be terrifying. Animals suffer a great deal with the noises and that\u2019s clear when you have pets, they are scared, anxious and fearful and for what? We already have silent fireworks and I want the government to make this law and make sure there is no more suffering.",
        "background": "I want the sale of these fireworks to be made illegal and anyone caught using them to be fined and served with a public nuisance charge and animal cruelty. Anyone caught selling anything other then silent fireworks should be ordered to pay a large fine and also given the same charge",
