        "additional_details": "Until the Government announced the closure of venues at 5pm, 20/03/20, insurance companies were insisting, against social distancing advice, that weddings scheduled 21/03/20 must go ahead. Having spent \u00a320,000+, I had less than 18 hours to cancel suppliers who had incurred their own costs in preparation for the next day. Expenses were non-refundable due to timescales and although assured by insurers at the time that costs would now be covered, underwriters have since rejected our claim.",
        "background": "The government must insist that insurance companies recognise the enforced closure of wedding venues less than 24 hours before the scheduled wedding date, as grounds for claim. Couples are grossly out of pocket due to non-refundable costs paid out to suppliers for services scheduled for the next day",
