At a minimum, the Government must ensure there is:\r\nNo \u201cmarking down\u201d of individual pupils based purely on them having gone to a less good school\r\nA free appeals system open to any pupil\r\nMore weight given to our own teachers\u2019 assessments, as they are better placed that an algorithm to judge us as individuals",
        "background": "Almost 40% of A-level assessments have been downgraded, potentially impacting the futures of thousands of young people. I\u2019m calling on the Government to urgently sort out this injustice. For a lot of pupils, the algorithm doesn\u2019t even consider what our own teachers predicted we\u2019d get.",
