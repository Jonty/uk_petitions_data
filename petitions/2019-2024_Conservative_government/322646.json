        "additional_details": "I firmly believe that lowering the grade boundaries for many (but not all) students is a good option because it creates social justice. Our country should not be able to fail to fully educate these students and still force them to sit the same exams with the same grade boundaries. At this time students should still be able to go to school and improve grades however they are being forced to stay home and educate themselves. If educating ourselves was reasonable then tell us why school exists.",
        "background": "Covid-19 has caused schools across the country to close. Many students are missing out on an important step in their education. In previous years students have struggled to meet grade boundaries and that is without the closure of schools. Students in year 10 and 12 are worried about their grades.",
