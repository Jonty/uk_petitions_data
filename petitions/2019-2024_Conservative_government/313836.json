        "additional_details": "We use our one hour exercise time to walk to and from the cemetery, therefore we don\u2019t make any other journeys apart from this. It helps myself, my mum and my little brother to cope with his loss and mentally gives us a break. \r\nShutting the gates has caused us distress and no doubt other families with relatives inside. \r\nIt makes no sense to have open spaces and parks still open but shut a quiet and peaceful cemetery. Please reopen.",
        "background": "My father passed away last year, and we have visited him everyday since the day of the funeral. They have just shut his cemetery today but parks and open spaces remain open, why? Visiting the cemetery does no harm to anyone, it\u2019s the same as going for a run in the park. Please rethink and reopen.",
