        "additional_details": "The license fee has come under scrutiny recently. I think people need to see better value for money with regard to content and access to the back catalogue. BBC content is of the highest quality, especially with respect to non-fiction programming. It should be available to all fee payers looking for educational content they trust. For example, a Horizon episode Hair Care Secrets from 2017 is unavailable. There's no good reason for this.",
        "background": "There's a wealth of world-class content that I'd like to rewatch with my children, but I can't. It's made unavailable for no good reason. Please investigate the BBC's policy of making its content unavailable for streaming after a short time. In 2020, data storage is no excuse.",
