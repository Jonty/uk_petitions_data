        "additional_details": "In September, our government allowed the rule of six which allowed a group of up to six people to meet indoors. They also specified that while couples should try to distance, provided they distance from all others not in their house hold then being under two metres from your partner in an established relationship would be fine. The current rules in Scotland allow non-cohabiting couples to see each other inside and without distancing. Established couples cannot be expected to not see each other.",
        "background": "I want the Government to allow couples who don't live together, and in established relationships, to see each other indoors without having to stay two metres apart from each other and allowed to stay overnight in each other\u2019s homes. Allowed to join their bubble even if they have already formed one.",
