        "additional_details": "Stopping driving lessons means that we have to get used to driving again, we have to wait longer to get tests booked and done. We have done everything the government has told us, it\u2019s not fair if we aren\u2019t allowed to carry on doing our driving because the government failed US. It is hard for people to commute to work and university with the additional rules in place, it\u2019s not safe for us to get public transport as they\u2019re  packed. Also theory tests last 2 years and theres no support in place.",
        "background": "Let practical driving tests continue whilst this lockdown! It\u2019s not fair that schools are open yet people who actually need a mean of transportation aren\u2019t allowed to go through with it. It\u2019s not like we can learn how to do a practical test online!",
