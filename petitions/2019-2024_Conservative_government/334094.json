        "action": "Introduce a cap on football wages for all professional footballers.",
        "additional_details": "The earnings differential of high salaried players and the people paying to watch them is obscene at the moment and will get worse. Giving the climate and clubs struggling there needs to be a cap implemented as soon as possible. During the pandemic we have seen clubs invest in players salaries while job redundancies nationwide are occurring. The reality is that it does not reflect positively when homelessness is on the rise and people are losing jobs yet seeing footballers wages sky rocket.",
        "background": "Implement a cap on wages earned by a footballer before the amount earned becomes even more ridiculous than presently. Earnings above \u00a3200,000 should be capped to protect grass roots and also reflect society.",
