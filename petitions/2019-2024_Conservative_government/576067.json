        "additional_details": "I feel like this is a petition that has to go to the very top. Beyond the FA. The FA does not represent the people and I feel alienated from the FA's decision-making. As Edmund Burke put it, the government is merely a mouthpiece of the people. We are the people. And these are our wishes.",
        "background": "I want the government to enforce a law that will coerce the FA into advising their commentators that they do not have to apologise every 5 minutes for bad language. It ruins the viewers' matchday experience and it hinders the transmission of insightful commentary.",
