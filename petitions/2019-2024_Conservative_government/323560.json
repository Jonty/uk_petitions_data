Members were allowed up to \u00a310,000 in additional expenses to improve communication infrastructure in their constituencies, so there should not be any technical issues. Democracy is not served by restricting those MPs who are able to participate in discussion and debate. Please continue allowing remote access to present opinions and cast votes.",

Parliament still meets and MPs from all over the country have been able to listen to debate. This must continue.",
