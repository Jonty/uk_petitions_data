        "additional_details": "The Child Benefit payment is a crucial support for families raising their children. It helps them cover the costs of food, clothing, and other necessities for their children. By revising the rule so that the \u00a399.9k limit is per household, not per working person, families will not be unfairly penalized and can receive the support they need. This change will ensure that all families, regardless of their income, have the resources to provide for their children.",
        "background": "A household can earn up to \u00a399.9k and still receive the full benefit. However, if one person in the household makes \u00a350k or more, they start losing it, even if it is a single-income household. This limit needs to be applied per household, not per working person.",
