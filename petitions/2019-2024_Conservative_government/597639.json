        "additional_details": "Price rises on this scale will force many people to choose between heating and eating, coming at the same time as many are already at breaking point thanks to the cut in universal credit, the increase in national insurance and soaring food prices.\r\nThis crisis shows that the privatisation of the energy sector and its regulation has not worked. \r\nWe call on the government to:\r\n- Nationalise the energy sector\r\n- No bailouts for energy companies\r\n- Secure low-price green energy supplies into the future.",
        "background": "We are in the midst of a crisis that has caused many energy suppliers to go bust. The current record increase in prices is set to go up further next year - over \u00a3400 per household in total.\r\nGas prices and electricity prices have increased by 50% and 30% respectively since privatisation in the 1980s",
