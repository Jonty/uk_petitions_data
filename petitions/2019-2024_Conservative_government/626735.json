        "additional_details": "Our Governments entered into private-public partnerships with PPI companies with their \u201cheads in the sand\u201d, the main reason being it would keep the costs off the National Debt (ie off the balance sheet).\r\nPFI should be brought on balance sheet. The Treasury should remove any perverse incentives unrelated to value for money by ensuring that PFI is not used to circumvent departmental budget limits. It should also ask the OBR to include PFI liabilities in future assessments of the fiscal rules.",
        "background": "Introduce a Windfall Tax on Private Finance Initiative (PFI) companies against the massive profits these companies are making from Public Money. And the Government should investigate any activity by PPI companies which could involve offshore tax avoidance activity.",

It would need to be clear from both the title and main text of your petition what you want to happen. We cannot accept petitions where the title makes one request, and the petition goes on to ask for several other things."
