        "action": "The British museum must return the Parthenon marbles back to Greece",
        "additional_details": "From 1801, agents of Thomas Bruce, removed about half of the surviving sculptures of the Parthenon, as well as sculptures from Acropolis in general. Elgin later claimed to have obtained in 1801 an official decree (a firman) from the Sublime Porte, the central government of the Ottoman Empire which at that time ruled Greece. This firman has not been found in the Ottoman archives despite its wealth of documents from the same period and its veracity is disputed. ",
        "background": "The marbles were removed violently and illegally by Thomas Bruce in the 19th century. The marbles of Acropolis need to return where they belong historically, where democracy was born and history was written. The marbles must return back to Greece because if we love history, we ought to respect it",
