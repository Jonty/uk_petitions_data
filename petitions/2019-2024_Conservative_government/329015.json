        "additional_details": "In fact in these factory farms, chickens (who are the main animal farmed using this method) grow four times faster than in the 1950s. From this we can see how artificial their diet is. The chickens legs often can't keep up with the weight of their body and by the end of their very short life (approximately 42 days) they can't even walk. Chickens aren't the only ones to suffer: pigs, cattle and many more animals are also crammed into these horrible factory farms.",
        "background": "Factory farms are a cruel, intensive method of rearing animals for meat. Within them you will find thousands of animals crushed together, barely able to move. They live like this for their entire lives. This market is driven by a hunger for profit without a care for the animals.",
