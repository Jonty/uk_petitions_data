        "action": "We need Asian History to be a part of the school curriculum all over the UK.",
        "additional_details": "This is very important to us as hate crimes towards the Asian race are on the rise, especially in schools. These may start as small words but can grow into huge actions. By teaching this in schools, we aim for students to embrace and respect the history of the Asian race and understand the severe discrimination that is faced on a day to day basis and why it is wrong. This will also create a safe space in schools for all students, creating a more equal and understanding learning environment.",
        "background": "We would like for the Government/Parliament to broaden the school curriculum and teach the history of the Asian race. This would include the roots of the Asian race, the discrimination the Asian race face, the attempts to change this, how we can change, and what happens on day to day life.",
