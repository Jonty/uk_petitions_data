        "action": "The UK government should not impose VAT on private school fees.",
        "additional_details": "If this is to become government policy, has it been thought through? Will removal of VAT exemption for education also apply to closely related school services, e.g. catering, school trips, accommodation etc? How is this going to work? If related services not included in the change, its just parents footing the bill? The IFS says this will raise only \u00a31.7bn. But doubt that because so many parents will have to take their children out of private sector and add more burden to the state sector.",
        "background": "Any proposed policy to apply VAT to school fees would be iniquitous and deeply unfair.  Many parents who have made considerable financial sacrifices to enable their children to go to fee paying schools would be hardest hit.  Fees, already too high and VAT would make fees unmanageable for many.",
