        "additional_details": "The UK government needs to withdraw their support for the Saudi Arabia\u2019s military and publicly condemn their role in the destruction of Yemen. The UK government should also stop supplying Saudi Arabia\u2019s military with arms. Instead the UK should help Yemen tackle the cholera and coronavirus outbreak and intervene to stop corrupted leaders from destroying the country which could lead to the extinction of their population.",
        "background": "The people of Yemen are on the verge of extinction as they are facing a cholera outbreak, coronavirus, famine and a civil war led by Saudi Arabia. Eight million people are facing starvation and are dying from the result of war. There has not been enough action especially from the UK to help Yemen.",
