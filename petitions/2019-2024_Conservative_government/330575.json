        "additional_details": "Every year in the UK, over 40 million chicks are macerated (ground to death), asphyxiated, gassed, etc, for the simple reason that they offer no profit to agricultural industries. The SELEGGT scheme in Germany shows us that investing in in-egg sexing (spectroscopy) is not only more humane but will save the industry time and money in the long term.",
        "background": "We are told that male chick (and duckling) culling is a necessary evil, that there is no other option. This is not the case anymore. New technology such as in-egg sexing has allowed Germany, Switzerland, and France to take steps to ban this inhumane process. Why is the UK falling behind?",
