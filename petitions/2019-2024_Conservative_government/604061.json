The sport is now getting ruined because referees can get away with ludicrous decisions and don\u2019t have the face up to it themselves. So by doing interviews the same way as players and managers, it gives an insight to why they made such choices and if they\u2019re legitimate reasons, stopping the sport being ruined",
        "background": "Football is one of the biggest sports in the world and is now being ruined by awful refereeing decisions. So by getting referees interviewed before and after games, questioning their decisions will bring clarity and whether the individuals are good enough to referee our games.",
