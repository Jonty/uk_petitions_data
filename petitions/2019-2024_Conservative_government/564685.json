        "additional_details": "I want the government to change it because there is currently specialised NHS help so many people from different background cannot get help. People don't know much about ARFID but once they hsve better understanding of it they can help more. The ARFID isn't even't even on the NHS website which further damaging the view people have on the eating disorder ARFID.",
        "background": "I would like the government to make ARFID a known eating disorder. I myself have ARFID and have struggled years with it. However, when help is needed they simply don't know what to do as they don't have understanding of it. There are many risks to that, for example, a boy who went blind from ARFID.",
