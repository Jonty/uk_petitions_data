Expecting people to wait till NEXT YEAR just to get a check up is OUTRAGEOUS! The government must treat this seriously and with some haste. People NEED TREATMENT NOW!

Simply offering endless rounds of antibiotics and pulling out perfectly salvageable teeth is outrageous and a giant leap back to past centuries.",
