        "additional_details": "1 in 10 Women suffer with Endometriosis, Endometriosis is formed in different stages & can be found in other areas of the body not just around the womb. Endometriosis limits women day to day because of the pain being unbearable that it can put a lot of limitations on what women can & can\u2019t do. Therefore the condition can be seen as disabling when it comes to basic tasks like movement.",
        "background": "I believe that this condition should be considered a disability just as much as other debilitating conditions such as diabetes, etc. Being limited by your own body is demotivating and the least these women should have is clarity around their condition.",
