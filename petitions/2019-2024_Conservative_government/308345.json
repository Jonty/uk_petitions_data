        "additional_details": "This is a once in a generation pandemic so the key workers should be not only recognised with kind words but with actually money. They have had to suffer from austerity, pay freezes, etc. So as the government can find money for big company bailouts, they can find the money for these critical underpaid workers.",
        "background": "Ensure that all NHS staff (including the ones who have returned from retirement) receive some sort of Covid-19 bonus, rather than just thank you cards. Bankers get bonus's even after creating the 2008 Financial Crisis and being bailed out by tax payers so why don't the NHS staff after this pandemic.",
