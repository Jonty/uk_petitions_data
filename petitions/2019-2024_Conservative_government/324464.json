        "additional_details": "We, as a nation, can not pride ourselves on racial diversity and democracy - whilst simultaneously ignoring the role we played in making the need for rights-fights to exist. We need to do better and we need to educate people, making this part of mandatory schooling is a small step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nWe can learn from our history and be better in our future, but that won\u2019t happen when we erase what has happened and refuse to educate the younger generations.",
        "background": "The national schooling curriculum is overwhelmingly lacking information regarding Britain\u2019s role in history - including colonialism, the UK\u2019s role in slavery, the Brixton Riots, the London riots, and the Macpherson Report. We need to educate this countries young people so history is not repeated.",
