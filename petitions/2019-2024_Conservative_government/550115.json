        "additional_details": "The pandemic has affected many learners, PDIs & Approved Driving Instructors. The DfT should consider extending PDI/ADI licences to match the extent of the lockdown & consider those who may require more time off. We call on Grant Shapps to urgently cancel all Standard Check Tests for 12 mths due to the financial impact on driving instructors. Some have lost their leased or H.P. vehicles & it will take longer to build up pupils & replace vehicles. A shortage of test centres will cause more delay",
        "background": "Call for the Secretary of State for Transport and Department for Transport to reorganise the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) and prioritise all the long awaited practical driving tests. Stop DVSA closing test centres until the waiting list has dropped due to the disruption of COVID-19",
