When crimes against wildlife are reported processes/resources should be in place to make sure they are investigated fully/consistently and that those who commit such crimes are punished accordingly. Ensuring appropriate signage & more visible policing would serve as a deterrent resulting in fewer attacks on wildlife. Also those who commit such crimes tend to escalate so leaning in will help reduce crime overall.",

Government and the Police must take further action to tackle this endemic behaviour and invest in protecting our wildlife.",
