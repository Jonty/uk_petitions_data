The UK public demand the Coronavirus Bill be debated in the House of Commons on the basis the UK public would like to see this Bill abolished immediately as it has exceeded its \u201ctemporary\u201d basis as we pass 300 days of restrictions. 2021 should have zero restrictions",
        "background": "The UK Coronavirus Bill that was legislated in March proposed that it would include information on the government\u2019s 4-stage strategy: contain, delay, research, mitigate. It sets out advice for how the public should respond in each stage, including what to expect as the outbreak advances.",
