        "additional_details": "There are only 7 Gender Identity Clinics in the UK funded by the NHS. Patients are told that waiting times are 12-18 months, but truthfully, the waiting times exceed this and can be anywhere from 24-48 months just for the first consultation.\r\nThis is detrimental to the mental health of those who are waiting for this help - it is the leading cause of suicide among the transgender community.\r\nIt is crucial that something changes, as there are too many people suffering whilst waiting for this help.",
        "background": "Currently there is a serious lack of support for transgender people. The UK Government should reconsider the way in which these people are helped, perhaps by allocating more money for this, to allow more individuals to get this help faster. \r\n\r\nWe all deserve to feel comfortable in our own skin.",
