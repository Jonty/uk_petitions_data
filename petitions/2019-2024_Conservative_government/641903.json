This is not good enough ! They are under license in the UK for helping control of diabetes not to be sold for over \u00a3300 for someone to lose a few pounds in weight . Please help control this drug because it'll cost lives and more money on the NHS as people are being moved onto insulin which is unnecessary if the had the Ozempic pen !",

Now there's a shortage the NHS can't get them now ! Diabetes People are suffering unnecessarily  !",

Whilst we continue to increase our capacity significantly, our present supply does not always meet this excess demand, which has led to temporary shortages or intermittent supply which is expected to last into 2023.\"\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for the Government to review supply of and access to medications for diabetes, if that's something you'd like to happen."
