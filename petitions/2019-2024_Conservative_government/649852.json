After the war ended, the UK abandoned DST but reintroduced it during World War II in 1940. \r\n\r\nNot only is it unnecessary nowadays it deeply  disrupts infant & adult sleep patterns, negatively impacting health including rises in heart attacks & maternal well-being. There is also a linked rise in car accidents.",
