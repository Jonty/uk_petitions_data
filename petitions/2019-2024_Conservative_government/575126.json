        "additional_details": "Recent studies conducted at the UCLA have shown that any mental issues linked to cannabis are in cases of those who consumed it on a regular basis in their teen years. \r\nIn the growing list of states where cannabis is legal a 25 age limit has been proving effective. \r\n\r\nThe UK economy has been battered by covid. As has people\u2019s mental health. Many have turned to alcohol which has far more serious side affects than cannabis ever could. Legalisation would help both of these issues immensely.",
        "background": "The US & Canada has made huge strides in understanding the psychoactive properties of cannabis. \r\nThis information has proven that cannabis isn\u2019t bad for your health, can actually benefit a number of serious issues and is no where near as bad for you as alcohol or even ibuprofen!",
