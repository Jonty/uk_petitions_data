Childcare is making nannies having to change their careers due to the situation and the cost of living in the economy is effecting everyone and nannies are just as beneficial and some people are requiring them but can\u2019t afford us. The waiting lists are so long on childminders and nurseries as they are the cheaper options but this is so unfair it\u2019s disruptive to the children they\u2019re care for and everyone. Please stop and change this. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",
