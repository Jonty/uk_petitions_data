        "action": "Do not cut funding to Archaeology courses in High Education.",
        "additional_details": "I am a working class person given opportunities by studying Archaeology in Higher Education. The funding cut will close University & College Archaeology departments and courses, destroying our capabilities in Archaeological learning & teaching, which the UK is a world leader. We will lose skills essential in planning, development & heritage tourism. Research into our heritage, for which there's a huge appetite among our public, will end. This fuels the tourism economy & helps community cohesion.",
        "background": "The government plans to cut funding for Archaeology courses at Higher Education level by 50% by creating a group of subjects defined as 'non-strategic.' Reverse this decision for Archaeology and other subjects defined as 'non-strategic.' Recognise Archaeology as important as Sciences.",
