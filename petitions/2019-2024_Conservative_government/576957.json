        "action": "Don't make the wearing of face masks compulsory in classrooms.",
        "additional_details": "The overwhelming majority of children and young people have no symptoms or very mild illness only. Covering the face in school all day will have a huge negative impact on children and young people.\r\nFace masks prevent the mirroring of facial expressions, they impair verbal and non verbal communication, and they block emotional signaling between teachers and pupils. The wearing of face masks potentially leads to a significant increase in socio-psychological stress. Children and young people have suffered enough during the COVID 19 pandemic.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to commit to not making face masks compulsory for pupils in the classroom environment, when they return to school on 8th March.",
