        "additional_details": "I believe this as many colleges throughout the pandemic have shown very little to no support for the apprentices, the main reason for my concern with this is majority or apprentices have all the skills to be qualified and go work on bigger builder sites or start there own company\u2019s, but they will not be able to do this as they won\u2019t have the college work done.  With something as practical based as most trades people should not be getting judged on course work but there ability on site and work",
