        "additional_details": "There are too many cases of motorists found guilty of causing death by careless driving receiving unduly lenient sentences. For example, a defendant was recently given a two year sentence after being found guilty of  two counts of causing death by careless driving. The public deserve the right to appeal such unjust sentences.",
        "background": "At present, it is not possible for people to use the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme to appeal sentences for causing death by careless driving. This should change. Any offence where a defendant's actions take the life of victim should be worthy of a review by the Court of Appeal.",
