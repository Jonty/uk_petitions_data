        "action": "Allow parents to use informal childcare when tighter measures are introduced",
        "additional_details": "A third of parents use informal childcare so that they can work (figures from the ONS). If an exception is not made to allow this to continue it means that many parents will be forced to reduce their work hours, or worse, leave their jobs. This will disproportionately fall on the shoulders of women, increasing the gender pay gap and ultimately increasing child poverty. It makes little sense that children are unable to be cared for by close family members but they can attend a childcare facility",
        "background": "Tighter measures have now been introduced in regions across the UK to prevent the spread of Covid19. As part of these measures the Government is preventing parents from using informal childcare (relatives or friends) yet childcare facilities remain open.",
