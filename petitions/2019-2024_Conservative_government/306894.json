        "additional_details": "I\u2019m sure the vast majority of the clinical community will agree that it is not reasonable or is it advisable to ask retired doctors, most of whom are older and therefore are in a higher risk category compared to the rest of the workforce, to return to work to deal with the unfolding pandemic. This week, it was reported by GIMBE, an Italian public health organisation that 8.3% of all patients in Italy with confirmed COVID-19 respiratory were medical personnel. We should not risk their lives.",
        "background": "The government should revoke its plea to 65,000 retired medical personnel and seek alternative arrangements in trying to raise the workforce required to deal with the current COVID-19 outbreak in the UK. This has provoked strong feelings amongst the current medical workforce.",
