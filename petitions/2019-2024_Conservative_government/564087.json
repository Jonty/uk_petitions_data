        "action": "Abolish the BBC TV License or lower it for households not using BBC services",
        "additional_details": "Ultimately, the correct moral stance would be to abolish the license entirely as it is factual that the wider British population disapprove it. Unfortunately, the BBC and Gov both have a closed-minded view on this and are adamant that the license is essential to the functionality of services (which we do not care about or use enough to justify it). Thus, a solution to this could be to offer various tiers of TV Licensing at differing prices that reflect the needs or income of different households",
        "background": "\"The quality of BBC programmes do not reflect the price of the TV license. It is far too expensive for most people.\" It's clear from previous petitions that the general consensus regarding the TV License scam is that we, the people, are against it. The Gov response doesn't reflect a true democracy",
