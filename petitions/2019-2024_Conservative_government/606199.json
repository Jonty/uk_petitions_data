        "additional_details": "Since the pandemic, demise of Flybe and leaving the EU Licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineer jobs in the UK domestic aircraft maintenance market have drastically reduced. We cannot change the requirement for a visa to work in the EU. Flybe the UK\u2019s biggest domestic carrier left a massive employment hole which is not being filled by the remaining airlines. Recency is the major problem for engineers getting back to work causing many to leave the industry or take early retirement.",
        "background": "Change the requirement for 6 months in 2 years to 6 months in 3 years and certifying on aircraft not on aircraft type. And change the way with which we can re qualify to include acquaint or general familiarity courses. We need refreshing in certifying not physically doing the job.",
