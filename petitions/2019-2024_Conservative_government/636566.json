        "additional_details": "Financial education is on National Curriculum but most schools don\u2019t teach it well/not at all. This is a massive problem as many don\u2019t know the basics which will have dire consequences when they enter the real world.\r\n\r\nI did a questionnaire of UK secondary school students and 64% said they do not think the financial education they are receiving will set them up well for life while 38% say that it is rarely mentioned at their school showing the need for change.",
        "background": "Money is an intrinsic part of modern life as we live in one of the most competitive consumer economies yet most young people have very little understanding of the financial world that surrounds us and are disadvantaged as a result so improving financial education would benefit people everywhere.",
