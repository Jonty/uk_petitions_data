So having windows and doors open is the only way to enjoy fresh air. If people are self isolating with coronavirus, they have been told to do so in a well ventilated room eg windows open should there be a bonfire in the area, a person with respiratory problems will struggle to breathe. People in their homes should not be subjected to breathing in bonfire fumes during enforced lockdown",
