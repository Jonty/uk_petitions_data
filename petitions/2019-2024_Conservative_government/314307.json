        "additional_details": "It is a very simple thing to change. While tips and dumps are closed many people want to burn waste they have cleared out of their homes and outbuildings. However the smoke is very damaging for people with existing lung conditions, symptoms of Coronavirus 19 and children. There is no reason why most people cannot wait for a few weeks. This could reduce hospital admission for sufferers and help people with asthma, COPD and other lung conditions.",
        "background": "During the Corona Virus outbreak thousands of people will be suffering with lung and breathing difficulties at home.\r\n\r\nFirefighters will also potentially be busy helping front line services, and may be off sick.\r\n\r\nPreventing private bonfires is a simple measure.",
