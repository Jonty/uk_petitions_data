        "action": "Change national private hire vehicle policy to a quadruple lock.",
        "additional_details": "Current districts can only enforce policy against licensees in their district. This leads to non area cars coming and breaching legal requirements with no permanent enforcement where they are operating. Equally, the local councils do not have the funding to facilitate checks as the funds went to the issuing district and not their own.\r\nThis is leading to safety concerns and will also make county lines issues more difficult to spot.",
        "background": "Change policy so that the private hire sector has to have 4 conditions met to operate legally.\r\nThat the Job, operator, licensed vehicle and licensed driver are all in the same licensed authority.",
