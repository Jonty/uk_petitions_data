        "additional_details": "My solution is shut down all sites, shut down all running operations and businesses. Allow everyone to go into Isolation to contain COVID-19, after the 14 day period get nurses from hospitals or whoever necessary to go home to home in full protective suites asking if they are showing any symptoms. Spray the streets with disinfectant as China did. If the COVID-19 swabs are running low produce them create more jobs, you have the means to produce them. That way we can continue to run more tests. The steps mentioned should keep COVID-19 contained and controlled. The action needs to be taken NOW not later.",
        "background": "Construction job sites are currently still obligated to stay open. On an average job site  100-300 workers are present. Besides the front line all other retailers, restaurants, malls, schools etc have been shut down",
