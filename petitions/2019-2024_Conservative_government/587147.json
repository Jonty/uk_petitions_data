        "additional_details": "I would like the government to consider helping people with young baby\u2019s when they have to go back to work. People who are unemployed get help with child care. Why not help the people who want to go back to work. I understand we have help when the child is 2. But what about helping people who have no option but to work. I can\u2019t afford to stay at home but I also can\u2019t afford the child care. We need funding for before the age of 2.",
        "background": "I have recently gone back to work after being on maternity leave and I am horrified about how much child care costs. For the hours I work I won\u2019t be able to afford to send my baby to child care. The government are always pushing for people to be employed but never think of how much child care is.",
