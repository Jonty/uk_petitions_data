        "additional_details": "Zoos offer the chance to see and learn about a wide range of amazing creatures, understand more about their habitats and learn how to lower their extinction risk.\r\n\r\nIf these places cannot get income from visitors, the animals have no chance. Zoos can't just stop working. You can't turn the lights off and hope the animals will be OK. \r\n\r\nAdmissions can be limited, social distancing can be enforced & a vital industry can survive. Help us help the animals we care for. They need to get through this too",
        "background": "There is no reason that i see, why an almost entirely outdoor attraction such as a zoo or animal sanctuary should be forced to remain closed, while indoor retail is allowed to open. A crowded high street will be much harder to maintain social distancing in than a visit to the zoo.",
