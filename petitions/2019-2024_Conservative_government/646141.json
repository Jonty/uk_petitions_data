It's not clear whether you want more relaxed immigration arrangements to apply to all non-UK nationals, or only nationals of certain countries. Your petition also refers to British citizenship, and it's not clear if your petition is just about rights to travel to the UK without a visa, or entitlements to apply for British citizenship.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nIf you start a new petition you'd need to provide your full name."
