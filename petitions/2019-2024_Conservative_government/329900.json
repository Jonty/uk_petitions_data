        "additional_details": "Council budgets are being heavily squeezed. By 2019\u201320, the Local Government Association predicts councils will face a \u00a35.8 billion funding gap due to cuts in central government funding and the rising costs of an ageing population. This puts even more pressure on them to collect all the tax they\u2019re owed. In 2016\u201317 councils collected 97.2% of what was owed, and recovered \u00a3627 million of arrears. These high collection rates mean councils routinely pursuing people who often struggle to pay.",
        "background": "Thousands of individuals in full time employment are struggling to make ends meet, council tax and bedroom tax has made renting impossible for single adults in the UK.\r\nI.e the cost of rent, plus energy and council tax can add up to 3/4 of a single persons monthly income.",
