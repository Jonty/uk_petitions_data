        "additional_details": "The government is so far out of touch with the people of the country they should not live an elite status, nor should they earn over twice the average salary in the UK. MPs have a duty to serve the electorate and they are not doing this by taking large sums of public money to fund thier lifestyle and needless expenses. No subsidies for food and drink, no second homes, no non standard / economy travel.",
        "background": "Currently the wages of the members of parliament are outstripping their performance and much higher than the average UK salary. Funding for second homes and additional expenses should also not be approved unless for essential stationary.",
