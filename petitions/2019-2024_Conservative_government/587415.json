        "additional_details": "As a student myself I have experience of the appalling amount of sexism and misogyny in schools. One of the reasons for this is the sheer lack of education on what is and isn\u2019t ok to say, what things (such as the patriarchy, internalised misogyny etc) actually mean and how sexist words and actions can really affect people. Teachers are just not equipped to handle this, as they themselves have little idea on the subject- let alone how to deal with it. None of this is ok and if we want to achieve equality then we have to educate young people on the issues of the world!",
        "background": "Give all school students (both primary and secondary) and teachers mandatory detailed education on sexism, the patriarchy and misogyny, both internalised and in general. And give all teachers mandatory proper training and on how to handle sexism and misogyny in schools.",
