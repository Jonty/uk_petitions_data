This is not an accurate reflection of the death total as someone who has had and recovered from Covid may die of a heart attack etc days after they are Covid negative. This massively inflates the figures and the public have the right to know exactly how many people who died had Covid in their system at time of death. Not those who previously had and recovered from the virus.",
