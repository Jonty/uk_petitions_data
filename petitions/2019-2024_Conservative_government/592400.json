        "additional_details": "Most of us weren't able to see our families because of these COVID measures. It is understandable to have quarantine on arrival if that country is dangerous in terms of covid, however, we can't afford to pay these expenses. Money should never be a barrier in terms of visiting the family, but this has unfortunately become true.",
        "background": "Currently, the charge for COVID tests after you arrive from a foreign country is about 180 GBP and 1850 GBP for quarantine if you arrive from a red country. Those prices are maybe reasonable for people travelling for the purpose of business, but not for international students visiting families.",
