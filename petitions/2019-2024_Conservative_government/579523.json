        "additional_details": "Street harassment is a significant part of the lives of most women, including transwomen and gender-diverse individuals, but anyone can be vulnerable. According to a 2017 CNN report, in the UK 64% of all women have been sexually harassed, but even more have simply never reported their experiences. There wasn't much point. Similar measures have already been successfully implemented, most notably in France, Belgium and Portugal. This indicates that these measures can be genuinely effective.",
        "background": "Criminalise sexist insults, degrading/humiliating comments, or hostile and offensive \u201csexual or sexist\u201d behaviour towards a person in public areas, schools or workplaces. The police need power to hand out instant fines. Sexual harassment has become wrongly normalised and accepted as inevitable.",
