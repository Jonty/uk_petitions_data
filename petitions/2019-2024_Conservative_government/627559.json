        "additional_details": "Sex & gender are co-existing entities, not one binary. There has been much speculation that the GRA & EA relationship has caused uncertainty and \"confusion\" between identity & sex. However, this is simply a trope to extinguish the medical & legal affirmation of transgender people in the u.k. Manipulating the 2010 act contradicts the protection of gender rights, not \"sex based rights\". Contradicts the science of hormonal changes of sex. Contradicting the 2010 act signed by the conservative party.",
        "background": "Allies in solidarity with the trans community want members of parliament to defend and protest against the proposal of transgender rights to be legally \"gutted\" from the equality act under recent anti trans pressure. Members of parliament must act on commitments made in the 2010 equality act.",
