        "action": "Introduce a nationwide bottle deposit scheme for plastic and glass bottles.",
        "additional_details": "A bottle deposit scheme, with small deposits paid on plastic and glass bottles, could positively impact consumer behaviour. It would incentivise shoppers to recycle more to get their deposit back, as refund vouchers for shopping. A larger deposit on plastic bottles would also encourage more recycling, and greater uptake of glass bottles (reusable, and with lower environmental impact). Similar schemes are already well established in several other countries (e.g. Norway, Germany, Netherlands).",
        "background": "Introduce a bottle deposit scheme to encourage recycling of plastic and glass bottles. Charge consumers a small deposit on all drinks sold in plastic and glass bottles, and introduce bottle deposit stations (e.g. at supermarkets) to get their deposit back when the container is recycled.",
