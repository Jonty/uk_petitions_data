        "additional_details": "For years now clubs have been released 1, 2 and sometimes 3 new kits (not including keepers) every season. The cost impact on a families is just getting too much. The prices of these kits are so expensive but the pressure for loved ones to wear what their heroes are wearing makes it tough. You also no longer have classic kits as the change so often so you can't get an ifiliation with them. My son received a Newcastle Away kit and refused to wear it last night as it is now apparently old.",
        "background": "Aye want you to put a limit on how often football clubs in England can change their kits. Home and away kits to be released every two years. This could be done consecutively so that they would still issue a new kit every year but not both home and away.",
