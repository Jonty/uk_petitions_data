        "additional_details": "On 1 January 1914, Lord Lugard proclaimed a new Nigeria government by \u2018fresh Letters Patent and other Instruments\u2019. The governments of North and South Nigeria were amalgamated with oaths of office taken at each capital - Lagos and Zungeru, but only the chiefs from \u2018Sokoto to Chad\u2019, that is, from the Northern Region, swore allegiance to His Majesty. The traditional rulers of Yorubaland did not swear oath of allegiance to Great Britain, and they did not cede or renounce the Yoruba sovereignty.",
        "background": "We want Her Majesty\u2019s government (HMG) to annul the 1914 Amalgamation of Nigeria because the inclusion of Yorubaland was unlawful. Annulment is within the power of HMG as HMG created the legal instruments for the amalgamation. The incorporating jurisdiction of the amalgamation lies in Great Britain.",
