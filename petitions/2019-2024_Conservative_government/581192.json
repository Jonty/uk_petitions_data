        "additional_details": "More and more medical professionals and psychologists emphasise that prolonged wearing of face coverings causes immense psychological damage in children and also contributes to physical malaise and emotional traumas. There is a lack of evidence of the efficiency of face-masks in the reduction of transmission of COVID-19 so there is no justification of enforcing this policy. Finally, not enough research has been done to conclude that masks can be worn safely for months, many hours every day.",
        "background": "The government must:\r\n1. Consider professional experts' warnings of the dangers to children's physical, emotional and psychological well-being as a consequence of enforced mask-wearing in schools. \r\n2. Provide  hard evidence of the efficiency of mask-wearing in suppressing virus transmission.",
