        "action": "Use centre assessed grades with optional examinations for A level 2021.",
        "additional_details": "2020 has been an unfair year to everyone. Students all over the country have missed months of in-school learning. Some more than others (specifically those in the north of England). Some students won't have had internet access at home, some without a computer. Some will have lost family members this year. Many will have had a severe mental health decline due to the isolation caused by COVID-19. It is entirely unfair to force students to sit exams as if nothing has happened this year.",
        "background": "The A level examinations to be sat in 2021 should be optional for people who feel they haven't met their academic potential enough to be graded a centre assessed grade. Otherwise, centre assessed grades should be the main system for awarding grades this academic year in order for it to be fair.",
