        "action": "Ban the Bradford Factor to manage sickness absence in the workplace",
        "additional_details": "The Bradford Factor is a formula commonly used in HR to measure employee absence. It's a number that represents how many un-planned absences an employee has taken during the last working year. An employee who takes frequent, short spells of sickness will rack up a higher Bradford Factor than an employee who has less bouts of sickness but tends to take more days off each time. This discriminates against people with chronic health conditions.",
        "background": "Make it illegal for UK employers to use \"trigger\" based sickness absence processes (based on the Bradford Factor) which discriminate against people with chronic, cyclical and fluctuating health conditions.",
