        "additional_details": "Create a standard procedure across all NHS hospitals to treat the rights of fathers equally to women, and respect the need for a birthing partner incase of sudden and unexpected complications. Administer the 1 hour tests used in A&E departments already in the maternity unit when women are admitted to hospital. Test the mother and birth partner to prove their Covid status, thus removing the potential risks and allowing calmer less traumatic births for families who do not have the virus.",

Not all hospitals are making the changes and men and women are suffering as a result.",
