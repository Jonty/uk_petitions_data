This will include powers relating to financial distributions and the sale of football clubs, and the Government has said that the new regulatory system will be designed such that the likelihood of any financial distress is drastically reduced. You can find out more about the Government's plans here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-sustainable-future-reforming-club-football-governance/a-sustainable-future-reforming-club-football-governance\r\n\r\nThe new independent regulator will only be responsible for the top 5 tiers of the English men\u2019s football pyramid, and we could accept a petition calling for the regulator to be given responsibility for all English football clubs, if that's something you'd like to happen.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like the Government to take a different action you could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
