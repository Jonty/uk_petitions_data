It is clear that the current OFGEM regulated approach is not working. As a direct result millions of customers have crashed from one failed supplier to the next. Anxiety and stress caused to customers who have to pick up the bill with each failure is grossly unfair. In past decades although the industry was not competitive customers had a stable and well structured environment.",
