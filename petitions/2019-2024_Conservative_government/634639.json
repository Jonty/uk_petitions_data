Under the terms of that Charter, the BBC is operationally and editorially independent of government and there is no provision for the Government to intervene in the BBC\u2019s day-to-day operations.\r\n\r\nThe Government is responsible for appointing members of the BBC board, and we could accept a petition calling for the Government's role in the appointment of BBC board members to end, if that's what you want to happen."
