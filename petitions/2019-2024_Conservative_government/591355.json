I was told \u2018I have 12000 patients and I don\u2019t have room for you.\u2019 It has only got worse. The community\u2019s health is being neglected and we are not receiving adequate care. There is not enough appointments, doctors, or call answering. This includes both adults and children.",
        "background": "Residents of this area have been neglected since lockdown and are still unable to get GP appointments. An average number of calls made from each patient is approx 70-130 before getting an answer. Medical issues are being left untreated and patients are not getting an appropriate level of care.",
