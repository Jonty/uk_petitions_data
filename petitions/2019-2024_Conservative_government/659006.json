        "additional_details": "We are one of the most prevalent communities in the Uk, and we feel it is unfair for other languages, where there are less speakers of that language, to have their own GCSE language option, yet we don't.\r\nAlso, by having another language in our GCSE's, it's a massive plus, and help us in future jobs.\r\nI hope you will listen to our plea and not dismiss us by sending us back and forth with the exam board and yourselves.",
        "background": "The Government needs to introduce a GCSE for Romanian Language speakers. \r\nAs a 13 year old, born in England with parents that are both Romanian, I feel it is important for my future and for the other thousand's of Romanian speaking children.",
