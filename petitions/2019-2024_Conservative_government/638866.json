        "background": "The single use vape pens are being strewn across our streets everywhere - just like choc wrappers - for our refuse collection people to deal with; more plastic pollution. Also, to ban the advertisement of all nicotine products on TV & in shops; they need to be behind the counter, like tobacco.",
