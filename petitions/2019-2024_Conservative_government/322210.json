        "additional_details": "Throughout the world, there are millions of hard-working, tax-paying law-abiding couples with one husband and one wife who are struggling to make ends meet. It is not fair that those who break the law can take advantages of legal loopholes. Such people can take home more money in social security benefits than those hard-working, tax-paying couples who work. It puts a disproportionate strain on the taxpayer.",
        "background": "Polygamy (having more than one spouse) is illegal. Despite that, it still goes on in some countries. Some governments have banned welfare payments to such families. It's possible that such families can take home more money through welfare payments than working couples. We should do the same",

We're not sure what more you'd like the Government or Parliament to do."
