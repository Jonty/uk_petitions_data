        "additional_details": "The reason i think homework should be banned or optional is most homework can be extremely tiring for children as they can stay up late doing it due to the large and increasing amount there is. This can effect how they are doing in school i.e losing focus, getting emotional e.c.t(which can cause bad grades). Also homework seems to keep them cooped up in one place quite often, and if students do try to do it outside they can get distracted.Worry is an other important point due to the fact the children get really scared that teachers will tell them of for forgetting it or not making ong it good enough .\r\n.",
        "background": "I think homework should be banned or optional because it can be extremely stress full for children. And if not ban then maybe juts make it optional for students who want the extra help or prep before a test.",
