They arrive in dinghies, across the Channel from France and are breaking the law by doing so, as they should make a legal claim for political asylum in France, Spain or other safe country. Furthermore, there have been multiple cases where the Government has been unable to deport terrorists and migrants who commit crimes in the UK because criminals are afforded protectiion under the act.",
