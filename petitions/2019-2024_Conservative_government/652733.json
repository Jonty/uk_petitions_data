        "additional_details": "This will unjustifiably disadvantage low income households stopping them from being together as a family. The jump in threshold is unreasonably high. It will break families apart. It will likely force british citizens including children out of the UK so that they can be together as a family. This will in turn cause a higher level of job vacancies with fewer people to fill them. This will cause emotional and psychological damage.",
