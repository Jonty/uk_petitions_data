Football matches, the Brit awards and the current event that was held in Liverpool were allowed to go ahead. Celebrities shouldn\u2019t be allowed more freedoms that student just because they\u2019re rich. It\u2019s bad enough we have to pay \u00a39000 a year but to have paid \u00a327000 and not be able to experience graduation is disgusting.",
