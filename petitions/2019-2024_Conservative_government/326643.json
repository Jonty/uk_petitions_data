        "additional_details": "Survivors are getting no justice. The government need to step in to ensure that strong sentences are in place to help deter offenders acting on their impulses. OCAG groups and police work hard to provide the evidence to the courts, for very short sentences to be passed-some never receiving a sentence at all. Children are being groomed online and in real life, abused and the judicial system is showing them that they don't matter, that their abuse doesn't matter, this has to change.",
        "background": "As a group of people, we have helped convict thousands of offenders by handing the evidence to the police. The sentences being given serve as no prevention of someone abusing children. Sentences need to be on par with murder as offenders take children's lives away with their abuse.",
