Recently there are now covid tiers for local areas but despite this infections are growing and deaths are reaching their highest. My family all suffered covid and some still have long covid 3 months on. We need to stop this disease spreading and lockdown and enforce the rules more. Before it\u2019s to late !\r\nJust remember behind each death is the story of a loved one passing away. It\u2019s horrifying !",
