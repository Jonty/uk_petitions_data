        "additional_details": "Adherence to SCV2-prevention rules has been sub-optimal so far. This measure would:\r\n\r\n1. Help to contain the spread of Sars-Cov-2;\r\n\r\n2. Introduce a sense of urgency and inescapability from rules - which might psychologically spillover to other areas of distancing that are more difficult to enforce;\r\n\r\n3. Foster a much needed sense of duty, fairness and community in the population;\r\n\r\n4. Allow Britain to set an example of efficiency and pragmatism, leading the way globally, as per its best tradition.",
