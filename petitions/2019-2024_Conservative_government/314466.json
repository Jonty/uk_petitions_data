How can they pay for thousands of pounds of application fees with no or little income on benefits due to covid-19, whilst the government is saying stay at home where will the money come from for the fees. This will also save huge amount of time and money for the government in looking into expired visa's for people looking to settle in the uk.",
        "background": "Temporary ban on ALL fees for visa's for e.g. indefinite leave to remain, spouse visa uk etc for all applications made within the UK. As people can NOT afford them during the current pandemic, this will enable them to apply or renew they visa and keep them in the country as it would be their right.",
