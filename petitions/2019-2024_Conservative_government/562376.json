        "additional_details": "There is a strict building control procedure during design, construction and handover but compliance is forgotten about after handover when changes occur with renovations. Owners are then left exposed to adjacent properties having works done which decrease the fabric performance negatively impacting their quality of life. There is no clear legal stance on the matter; local councils refuse to intervene. Therefore affected people are unable to seek remedies or improve their situation.",
