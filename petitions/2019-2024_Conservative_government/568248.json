        "additional_details": "Online learning is unhealthy for children especially younger kids. Children are struggling to engage, teachers are unprepared and parents cannot cope especially parents working from home and those who for good reasons cannot support their children's learning. Not everyone can afford private tuition to make up for lost times. Many still have to care for their children during spring and summer holidays giving then no respite.",
        "background": "Change the academic calendar. COVID cases are high in the winter let the children have a holiday now and return to classrooms in Spring and Summer. Put together a plan for classroom learning, make schools secure and give schools and teachers time to prepare.",
