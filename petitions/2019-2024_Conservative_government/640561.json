        "action": "Rename Canterbury West and Canterbury East train stations.",
        "additional_details": "Canterbury sees millions of tourists visiting per year, and many of these will utilise the rail system. Ensuring that the stations are appropriately named will help visitors to the city, both in terms of wayfinding and in setting expectations. It will also improve the reputation of the city - without appropriately named train stations, its stature may be diminished. Enacting the demands of this petition may also increase tourism in the area (though I don't have data to support this).",
        "background": "The names of Canterbury West and Canterbury East stations do not adequately reflect their locations within the city. The former is in the north and the latter in the south. Indeed, they have virtually identical longitudes. Canterbury North and Canterbury South respectively are better suited.",
