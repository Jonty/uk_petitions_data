        "additional_details": "With announcements from the likes of Tesla & BWM intending to charge subscriptions for electronics aboard cars that already possess the hardware to provide that functionality, (purchased by the customer already), a law needs to be put in place to stop this from happening. BWM have announced they intend to charge customers for heated seats that are already installed in the vehicle, and which the customer has already paid for. Without law, it will inevitably lead to this practice being an issue.",
        "background": "When a customer buys a product and it already possesses the necessary hardware to perform a function (bought by the customer) it should be illegal for a company to charge for the customer to then access it.",
