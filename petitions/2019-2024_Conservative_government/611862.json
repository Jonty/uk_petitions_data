        "additional_details": "Changes the Government needs to demand to achieve equal reciprocal treatment. \r\n\r\n1) The same right to stay in Spain as Spanish citizens are given in the UK.\r\n\r\n2) The same access to social services like the Spanish health care system that Spanish citizens are given to the NHS.\r\n\r\n3) Spain must remove the higher tax forcing British citizens to pay.\r\n\r\nUntil these examples are removed or applied equally to both Spanish and British citizens, the current relationship is unfair and subservient.",
        "background": "Since Brexit British Citizens living in Spain no longer have equal rights. \r\nWhether you agree with Britain leaving the European Union or not, the current situation has endowed Spanish citizens in the UK with more rights than British citizens in Spain. This is unacceptable and needs to be addressed.",
