        "action": "Make the BBC a subscription only service.  Scrap a blanket mandatory TV Licence.",
        "additional_details": "The practice of forcing people to pay for a TV Licence is archaic and oppressive. It is even more draconian to criminalise people for not paying this. In this very difficult economic climate,  people are barely surviving as it is and should not be forced to pay for a nonessential service which is being forced upon them. Scrap the BBC and use other stations to give time allotted for government broadcast. Why do you need a whole agency to do this? Watching/listening to the BBC should be choice not a must",
        "background": "People continue to express their dissatisfaction at having to pay a TV Licence and many statements made about getting rid of this but it continues to be forced on people. Consider making the BBC a subscription only service so those who wish to use this service pay for it and make up funding with ads",
