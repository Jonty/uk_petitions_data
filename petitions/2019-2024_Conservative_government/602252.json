        "action": "Introduce school uniform vouchers for pupils from low-income families",
        "additional_details": "Many parents struggle to cover the costs of school uniforms forcing them to cut back on food and other essentials to be able to afford them. However, such costs not only put pressure on parents but can also be damaging to the pupils. Wearing unclean, poor-fitting or incorrect uniform can lead to children becoming victims of bullying, feeling excluded or even being sent home from school which is detrimental to their education, self-confidence and mental health.",
        "background": "Children from low-income families should be assessed for eligibility to receive school uniform vouchers enabling them to purchase compulsory school uniform at no cost to them. This scheme could be run in cooperation with major department stores and supermarkets who supply school uniforms.",
