        "additional_details": "There has previously been a petition calling for an early election which reached nearly 1 million signatures, and we believe things have significantly deteriorated since then. We want the chance to have the electorate speak and choose their Government. If the Government has faith in democracy it will put its trust to the test and call an early election, which is the argument they used for the previous early election in 2019 about the current opposition parties.",
        "background": "We want the Government to advise the King to dissolve Parliament and hold an early general election, to end the chaos of the current government, and allow the people to choose who they wish to be the Government. The issues and crises engulfing the current Government are unprecedented.",
