        "action": "Legalise all cannabis products for medical and recreational use.",
        "additional_details": "Extortionate private prescriptions aren't enough. There needs to be a regulated market, both medical and recreational.\r\nPatients should have the choice of which products they would like to medicate with along with the advise from a trained medical cannabis professional.\r\nRecreational users should have a safe location where they can choose to purchase cannabis in all forms. Similar to the layouts they have in the United States and Holland. These outlets will apply tax to help contribute to society.",
        "background": "The UK is the biggest exporter of medical cannabis, yet it is still a Class B drug. There's now plenty of evidence to show that cannabis is a lot less harmful than alcohol and tobacco. So why are the citizens of the UK still being being denied access to a safe substance with hardly any side effects?",
