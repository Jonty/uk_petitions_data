This letter/email prompt requests males to attend clinics at age 25, 40, 50, 60 and 70.  Attending these clinics prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and physical inspections are undertaken. As well as this a general assessment of health can be given.  Males attend the doctors less frequently than women, and their health is not scrutinised as much detail as females.  Pregnancy perhaps being a key driver.",
