        "additional_details": "This process is not only excessive: it puts us in very real danger. When you ask people to live for two years as their acquired gender without legal recognition, you require them to expose themselves to violence and discrimination without any real legal protection. And it also excludes non-binary people, who have no possibility whatsoever of legal recognition, or of the protections that come with it.",
        "background": "Plans have been leaked to scrap proposed reforms to the Gender Recognition Act. Instead of simplifying the process of changing one\u2019s legal gender, these plans appear to comprise an attack on fundamental trans rights, some of which are protected under the Equality Act 2010.",
