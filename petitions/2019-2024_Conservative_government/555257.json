        "additional_details": "In September, my Grandad began to act odd. He had a mild temperature, no appetite and kept falling asleep. He was not coughing.\r\n \r\nOn the 28th, he could not get out of bed. He could not speak. He was confused and in pain. We learnt then he had Covid-19.\r\n\r\nHe passed in October. The entire time my Grandad was ill, he did not cough. For this reason his GP advised him to get blood tests, as there was no indication of Covid-19.\r\n\r\nThe ZOE Covid app, the WHO and CDC list far more symptoms than the NHS, through which I recognised some of his symptoms after his passing.",
        "background": "Many people will have Covid-19 who do not present any of the three symptoms listed by the Government. I want the Government to expand the list of symptoms that mean people can be tested to include all possible Covid symptoms.",
