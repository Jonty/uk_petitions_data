        "additional_details": "Back garden displays are selfish and inconsiderate. Many people dread bonfire night approaching every year. The affects to some animals are fatal. Fireworks also have a negative impact on the environment and the wildlife. There is evidence of them causing upset to the elderly, newborns, vulnerable people and people suffering from dementia, as well as household pets. I don\u2019t believe that the sale of such items should be for sale and so easily accessible to the public.",
        "background": "I would like parliament to consider the banning of fireworks to the general public. I believe only council organised displays should have access to fireworks.",
