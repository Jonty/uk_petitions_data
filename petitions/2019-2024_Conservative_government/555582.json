        "additional_details": "Around 1 in 3 people suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder in the UK, with women being 40% more likely to than men. I think this is worsened by the impending darkness at around 5pm every winter's day. At the moment we are wasting this precious hour of light in the morning in an office or commuting. It would be far more beneficial to enjoy this hour of sun in the evening when people are more able and willing to socialise. This small change would make a vast improvement to our mental health.",
        "background": "We would like BST all year round because it would lead to a decrease in the mental health problems, which arise in winter, as people could use the extra hour of light in the evening to spend more time with friends and family, outside, after work. This would greatly improve our country's wellbeing.",
