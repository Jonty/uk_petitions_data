        "additional_details": "The Government should consider how much content students have missed and how some students may not have the correct resources to access work set for them online. Some students also may have learning issues meaning working at home or independently may become difficult. In addition, there is not enough time for students to learn everything they have missed during the lockdown period therefore stress and anxiety levels in students may increase.",
        "background": "The Government should not let the 2021 exams for years 10 and 12 be carried out. Instead they should cancel the exams or allow students mock results to be used as their final grade",
