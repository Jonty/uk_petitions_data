Since you started this petition, the Government has introduced a range of measures, including closing non-essential face to face services. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For instance you could start a petition asking for DVLA test centres to be excluded from the current closures, if this is something you would like to happen.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about coronavirus and how you can protect yourself and others here:  \r\n\r\nwww.gov.uk/coronavirus \r\n\r\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/ "
