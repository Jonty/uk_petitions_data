        "additional_details": "1 The enlargement goes against previous well supported commitments to reduce the size of the Lords. The speaker of the House of Lords opposes this increase.\r\n2 Parliament should scrutinise the merits of some of the nominations, e.g. Claire Fox who has defended IRA bombings and child porn use, Brexit supporters etc.\r\n3 The list has been announced within the first few days of the summer recess when neither house is sitting, and the government cannot be challenged in Parliament.",
        "background": "Many people have been outraged by the number and characteristics of the list of new peers announced on Friday 31 July 2020. Consideration by Parliament is the only viable democratic response, but won't be possible if Parliament is not recalled.",
