Your petition refers to any increase in taxes, but the Government has already given local authorities the power to increase council tax.\r\n                \r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nCease foreign aid during covid-19 and use the funds to support UK economy: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/552360\r\n\r\nCommit to a public review of HS2 project and suspend all on-going work now: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/314520\r\n\r\nHold a public vote on HS2 project as it is being paid for by the public: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/326850\r\n\r\nIf you want the Government to reduce spending rather than increase taxes to deal with Covid-19 spending we could accept a petition requesting that.\r\n\r\nWe also couldn't accept a petition making unsubstantiated claims about the cost of HS2. The latest estimate for the cost of the project is around \u00a3100 billion."
