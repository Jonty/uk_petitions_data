        "additional_details": "Around 250,000 weddings were due to take place this year. \r\nOf those an estimated 60-70% will be postponed or cancelled due to COVID-19. \r\n\r\nThe current guidelines from the government require couples to give notice, and this notice is valid for 12 months. Although you are only required to give notice 28 days before the ceremony, local councils encourage you to apply 8-10 months in advance. \r\n\r\nAs a result of this many couples will have to give notice again, including making a second payment of fees.",
        "background": "A notice of a marriage or civil partnership is only valid for 12 months. There has been no extension or relaxing of this due to COVID-19, yet a huge number of weddings are impacted. Extending the validity of the notice would significantly help couples whose weddings have been impacted by COVID-19.",
