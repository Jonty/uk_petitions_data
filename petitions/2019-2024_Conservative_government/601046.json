        "additional_details": "The UK declared a climate emergency in 2019 but has continued to issue licences for oil exploration and extraction. To have just a 50% chance of preventing a 1.5-degree rise in global temperature, emissions must be halved by 2030. \r\n\r\nPreventing all future oil production is fundamental to this goal. The UK government must act now to avoid a humanitarian crisis on a scale never seen before, and the environmental collapse from which humanity - including the most privileged - will not recover.",
        "background": "The UK government must take radical steps to prevent climate catastrophe. It must scrap its \"climate compatibility checkpoint\" in issuing new licences. No new oil exploration or extraction can ever be \"climate-compatible\". The government must outlaw the practise of issuing such licenses altogether.",
