        "additional_details": "I would like the Government and Courts to support our Police Forces and protect the public by throwing the book at knife welding offenders.\r\n\r\nThere is a epidemic of violent crime across the country and particularly in London. This needs to be tackled immediately. \r\n\r\nTougher sentancing will act as a deterrent to people who are involved in knife crime. \r\n\r\nIt will not deter everyone, but by having long sentances, the undeterred criminals will be off the streets and not be a threat to public safety.",
        "background": "Possession of a prohibited knife/bladed article in public to carry a minimum custodial sentance of 15 years in prison, with a minimum of 20 years for weapons such as machetes & swords.\r\n\r\nOffenders under 18 should receive the same punishment as an offender over 18 due to the gravity of the crime.",
