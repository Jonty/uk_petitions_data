        "additional_details": "The changes are draconian and offer an individual little to no chance to appeal. It against international law to deprive a person of citizenship & inhumane not to allow one to appeal a decision made without their knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe clause to strip a persons citizenship without notice should not be allowed to be made law. \r\n\r\nThis is especially problematic to British Asians who now will live in fear in the UK despite being born here and living here all their lives.",
        "background": "Clause 9 of the bill -  \u201cNotice of decision to deprive a person of citizenship\u201d exempts the Government from giving notice to people if they deem you are a national security threat. Under the guise of National Security the government can deem you a threat & revoke citizenship without you knowing.",
