        "additional_details": "Many businesses and people are getting significant financial support from the taxpayer for wind downs and doing nothing.  Nurses, doctors and other care workers are having to do far more than even they imagined possible.  They deserve solid recognition for their massively increased workload and stress.  The Government (i.e. all taxpayers) should do their bit for them financially - to help avoid worries now, for them to know we as a Nation are really behind them, and to maybe have a little extra for when they can get to take some time off.   Now more than ever we should be giving them proper compensation for their work and commitment and for their sacrifices and worries.",
        "background": "Immediately and simply start paying NHS nurses and doctors and other staff / agency workers in the FRONT-LINE of the NHS an addition to their wages (e.g. 10-20%) at least until the COVID-19 situation settles into a new normal status. Also Care Home Front-line Workers.",
