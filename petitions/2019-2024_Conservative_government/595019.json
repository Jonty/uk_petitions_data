        "additional_details": "To ensure the safety of Afghan nationals who undertook huge personal risks to deliver programming either funded by or in line with the UK's mission in Afghanistan, the criteria around ARAP must urgently be expanded. Given the Taliban's recapturing of Kabul and much of the country, criteria must include humanitarian and development roles to offer relocation to staff under direct threat due to the work conducted on behalf of HMG. Minority groups and women should be additionally prioritised.",
        "background": "The Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) offers safe relocation to Afghan staff that worked with the UK in Afghanistan. Currently, the policy is limited to staff that worked directly for HMG in certain roles. Given the Taliban's recapturing of Kabul, the policy must be widened urgently.",
