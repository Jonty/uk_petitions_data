        "additional_details": "During the current economic crisis which is affecting most of us, it is not the time to favour the people who have the most money in society: companies that are profiting while the most of us struggle to afford even just the cost of living. It is important now more than ever, to support the unemployed, homeless or poorer communities living in poverty in the UK. By sharing money out more evenly, from the wealthy, to the less advantaged, so that ultimately everyone is more comfortable financially.",
        "background": "Reconsider increasing windfall tax in the attempt to try and help the economy and climate change, by moving money back from elitist companies and back into the community more into a pot of money, for the wider people and to support everyday needs of the public and services everybody needs and uses.",
