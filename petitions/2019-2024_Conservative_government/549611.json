        "additional_details": "If the minimum sentence were increased substantially, then perhaps an individual would think twice about carrying a knife in public.\r\n\r\nAs I have lost a family member to knife crime in 2016, which the attacker had committed a knife offence the previous year, then aged 17. I personally know the devastating impact it causes. As we move forward, increasing the minimum sentencing would send a strong message to future offenders that it's not worth destroying their own life and somebody else's.",
        "background": "Since 2015, people aged 16 to 17 years old caught in possession of a knife face a minimum of 4 months custodial sentence and adults from 18 years onwards will face a minimum 6 months. It appears that hasn't been able to deter people from carrying a knife",
