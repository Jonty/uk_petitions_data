        "additional_details": "The current budget has resulted in less subsidy for transport providers, higher fares and loss of services; unfairly hitting those with lower incomes, senior citizens, non drivers, students, residents of rural areas, and anyone with disabilities/poor mobility; reducing both access to and positive outcomes in, medical care, employment, education and training opportunities.  To cut deeper still flies in the face of the Government's aims to 'Level Up', 'Bus Back Better', 'Tackle Climate Change',",
