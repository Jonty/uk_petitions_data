        "additional_details": "The current system is discriminatory. If an individual wished to end a marriage/civil partnership on the grounds that their partner had an affair with someone of the same sex, they would not be able to do so. This causes disparity as that individual may then struggle to have the third party be liable for any of the court costs. In addition, it often forces the individual to have to write lengthy unreasonable behaviour reports which can be emotionally exhausting.",
        "background": "The current legal definition only recognises adulterous relationships is between a man and a woman. Extramarital affairs between people of the same sex can\u2019t currently be included as grounds for divorce/dissolution of civil partnership. The laws ought to be equal for all, regardless of sexuality.",
