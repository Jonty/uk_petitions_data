There is no time for recriminations we need it to be fixed. Public Health authorities have the experience. Give them the funding to carry out track and trace now.",
        "background": "The government has lost control of track and trace twice now. They gave the responsibility to private companies with no experience. Control of track and trace must now be handed to the public sector ie Public Health England and their equivalent in the four nations who have the relevant experience.",
