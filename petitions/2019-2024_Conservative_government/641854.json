        "additional_details": "Private hire vehicles euro 6 diesel and euro 5 petrol  are exempt from all major cities across the country. Why does Bradford have a different ruling to rest of the country. Even London ulez doesn't charge us. We feel this is a money making business. Not the real reason of the CAZ zones made to stop high polluting cars entering and causing health issues.",
        "background": "We want a change in Bradford CAZ zone rules. We want all Euro 6 diesel including 4 seater vehicles and euro 5 petrol to be accepted in the zone without a charge. That should be a minimum requirement.",
