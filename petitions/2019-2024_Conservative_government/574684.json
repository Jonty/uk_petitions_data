        "additional_details": "This needs to happen.  For most people dogs are part of the family, companionship for older people, support for people struggling with mental health or disabilities and generally someone to get you out in the fresh air and stay active and healthy. Dogs are being stolen up and down the UK by thieves thinking they can make money by breeding or selling on people's beloved pets.  It's heart breaking for dog owners, putting more stress on people already struggling from a difficult year.",
        "background": "Increase the punishment for dog theft. \r\n\r\nCap the prices on dogs, the prices are going up and dog thefts are increasing as thieves believe they can make money on beloved pets.\r\n\r\nCreate licenses for anyone selling puppies.  Register new litters with their vet and provide a certificate to say this.",
