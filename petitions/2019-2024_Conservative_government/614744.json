        "additional_details": "Whilst the UK public were obeying the \u201clockdown laws\u201d on Covid, Johnson was not. The public couldn\u2019t attend funerals of close relatives. Johnson was attending parties. The Prime Minister, if has not lied to Parliament is not intelligent enough to understand his own laws.  Being the only serving Prime Minister to have been sanctioned for breaking the law is in itself enough for Parliament to hold a vote on whether they have confidence in him to hold the position.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson is the first serving Prime Minister to be sanctioned for breaking the law. He has either lied to both the public & Parliament or does not understand the Laws that his Government wrote. He should resign. Parliament should hold him\r\naccountable by debating his suitability to hold office.",
