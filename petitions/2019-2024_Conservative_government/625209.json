        "additional_details": "We need a domestic flight ban policy similar to the one implemented in France.\r\n\r\nTravelling by train rather than plane is one of the best things people can do to help tackle the climate crisis.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s ridiculous that the government refuses to adequately support our rail network, and yet freely hands airlines tax breaks which push unnecessary domestic flights.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s time to get rid of domestic flights, start taxing frequent flying and aircraft fuel and invest more in rail.",
        "background": "Banning flights on routes with fast rail connections could cut UK emissions from domestic aviation by a third, a Intergenerational Foundation (IF) report found.\r\n\r\nIf domestic flights on routes with a rail alternative under 4.5 hours were banned, it would reduce emissions by 885 kilotonnes (33%).",

What you want the Government to do would need to be clear from the title and main text of your petition."
