        "additional_details": "We want the government to review the policy, as it would help to prevent a second wave and keep the students safe as well as their parents/guardians. Also not all schools are big enough to enforce social distancing rules, and so mask would be the next preventative measure.",
        "background": "We want the government to review their policy on masks in schools. We as students, parents, guardians and teachers think that it would be a lot safer, if it was mandatory to wear masks in school, and it would decrease the likelihood of the spread of Covid19 through out schools all over the country.",
