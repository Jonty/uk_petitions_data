        "additional_details": "A balanced society requires both Arts and Science graduates in more or less equal need. These study areas interconnect and are mutually empowering. To cutback on one damages the other. Moreover, as individuals we need both facts and the wisdom/inspiration, gained from Arts courses, to use these productively. Even Stone Age humanity knew this.\r\nThe proposed cutback will also apply to language learning. One cannot assume the whole world either can, or wishes to, communicate solely in English, or will not adapt English to its various requirements. Being monolingual will isolate further an already emergent isolation. Read 'Hard Times' (Dickens) to see what happens in a philistine system based SOLELY on scientific 'facts': utter failure at the human(e) level.",
