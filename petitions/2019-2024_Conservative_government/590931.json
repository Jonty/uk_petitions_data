        "additional_details": "Universities are no longer providing the teaching experience that was promised to students during the application process. The value they are providing by not returning to full in-person teaching, including lectures, is greatly diminished. Students are missing vital opportunities to interact with lecturers and their peers. The 'blended' method of teaching is closer to the Open University offering but there is a disproportionate difference in fees and this should be corrected.",
        "background": "When students signed up for their University education, they did so on the basis that lectures, seminars and tutorials would be in-person. The widespread vaccination programme means there is no legitimate reason for Universities to offer 'blended' teaching (including online lectures) next year.",
