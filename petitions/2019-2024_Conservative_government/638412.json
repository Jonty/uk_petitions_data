        "additional_details": "This is causing sewage to be washed up in rivers and shores and is also poisoning our waters as well as the sea life in it. Water companies should not be allowed to dump sewage into rivers or the sea whether by mistake or on purpose, particularly where they are making billions in revenue, and charges are very high to customers. The Government must change this.",
        "background": "We are sick of water companies charging very high charges for water usage but then dumping most sewage waste into the rivers and the sea. We want the government to change the law to make sure that sewage water is treated before it is put back into rivers and the sea.",
