It cares more for shareholders than the people it serves.\r\nIt gave PPE contracts to its friends and family - with no formal tendering (using the excuse of urgency).  \r\nThis NI increase for social care is another example - taxing the people, not the entities it continues to allow to operate without fairly taxing them.",
