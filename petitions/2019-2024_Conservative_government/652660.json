        "additional_details": "So many people have worked so hard to get to a comfortable position ready to apply for the spouse visa to start their families, for it to potentially be ripped away from us. This will absolutely destroy families across the UK who just want to be together. We have bigger issues then people who are in love.",
        "background": "The annual salary threshold hasn't been raised since 2012, however this jump is not achievable by so many people. Minimum wage in 2012 was \u00a36.19 and now it is \u00a39.50, it is not possible for anyone who is working hard to achieve this new threshold, it will destroy families across the UK.",
