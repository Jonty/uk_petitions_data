Those slots are taken up within seconds as well. This is affecting productivity of people and providing avenue for nexus of agents to charge ridiculously high prices for test slots. Government and DVLA need to act immediately to remedy the situation with a defined timeline to bring down the waiting time for practical driving tests in London",
