        "additional_details": "I think the government should introduce some measure to stop the use of bots and programs when purchasing goods online. The use of these mean that average people cannot find items they want in stock at retail prices and have to buy them from sites like ebay at ramped up prices because they are the only ones available. This has become an increasingly common problem with electrical goods like computer components and game consoles.",
        "background": "Since stock and manufacturing has becoming restricted during the pandemic, the use of bots and similar programs has increased to the point where actual consumers cannot purchase the products they want at rrp. The people who purchase through bots tend to then sell them way about retail price.",
