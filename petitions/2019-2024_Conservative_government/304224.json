        "additional_details": "It's cruel and inhumane to advise members of the population to practice social distancing/ self-isolation, while many of their households are unable to do so, at the risk of future bankruptcy/ financial peril. Social distancing is the only thing that's helped kerb this thing. So why is the UK doing nothing to assist/ enforce it's blanket implementation? Guidelines are not good enough.",
        "background": "Statutory Sick Pay currently does not come close to what many (essential) jobs pay per week. Especially food/ delivery services. Many lorry drivers (who deliver food to supermarkets) are not given sick pay and on average this means a loss of 4/5ths weekly earnings. Sick days are discouraged.",
