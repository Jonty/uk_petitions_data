        "additional_details": "This money is desperately needed to help companies stay afloat over the spring and summer months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  This will not be a loan, grant or bailout so will be exempt from interest and repayments.  This money is currently INSIDE all VAT registered businesses and Q1 is due to be paid to HMRC at the end of the next quarter.\r\n\r\nThis could be the difference between staying afloat or closing for 100,000s of businesses across the UK by utilising money already INSIDE the economy.",
        "background": "The idea is relatively simple:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tSuspend all VAT for small businesses\r\n\u2022\tBusinesses still submit VAT returns as normal\r\n\u2022\tBusinesses owing VAT will not pay (zero on account)\r\n\u2022\tBusiness owed VAT rebates will still claim them",
