        "additional_details": "Under current law, fathers who are not married, are denied the right to sign a birth certificate without the mothers permission. Unfortunately this law is often abused, mothers will not add the fathers name to the birth certificate in order to deny them their rights as a father.\r\n\r\nThere are many changes the government can make to correct this injustice, the simplest one being to make it a criminal offence to add false information to the birth certificate, i.e. claiming father is not known.",
        "background": "When an unmarried couple have a child, the mother can choose to not add the fathers name to the birth certificate and there are no consequences. The birth certificate should be a legally binding contract whereby, if false information is provided, a criminal offence has been committed.",
