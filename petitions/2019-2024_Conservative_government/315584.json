        "background": "The bravery, care, and dedication of NHS staff is evident every single day, and should be celebrated every year, not just in times of crisis.\r\nCreate an annual, non-working holiday to recognise this and ensure that future generations celebrate the importance of a universal, free, publicly-owned NHS.",
