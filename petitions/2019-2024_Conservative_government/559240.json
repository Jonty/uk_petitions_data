        "additional_details": "Students are struggling. Their mental health is depleting. Depression is rising. There has been at least one death a week since term has started. Students should not be forced to pay for their halls during this pandemic. Universities should be supporting their students and they are failing. If students wish to leave and terminate their contracts they should be allowed to. It is humanely wrong to not allow this to happen. Universities are jeopardising their students well being.",
        "background": "Universities should provide the option for students to terminate their contracts. Students should not be bound into halls contracts. Allow students the chance to terminate their contract and go home to their support networks for the sake of their mental health and well-being.",
