        "additional_details": "Going out to eat is seen by the majority of the population as a \u201ctreat\u201d. Most families will not go out for a meal often and the calories consumed at that one meal will not have a huge impact on their overall health. \r\n\r\nThere are better and more effective ways to prevent obesity and this starts with education. Not necessarily saying certain foods are \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d but teaching people, specifically children, that every food group is okay in moderation and with the right amount of daily exercise.",
        "background": "Although by doing this the idea may be to prevent and help tackle obesity, the government may instead lead to the unwanted promotion of eating disorders. This could be harmful for both survivors of ED, who have potentially previously counted calories obsessively, and also to the younger generation.",
