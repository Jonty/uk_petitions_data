        "background": "Family allowance needs reform. A couple can currently earn \u00a350,000 each (i.e. \u00a3100,000 in total) and still receive full family allowance. For a couple where one person is not earning/on a low wage but the other is earning \u00a360,000 or more they are not entitled to anything.",
