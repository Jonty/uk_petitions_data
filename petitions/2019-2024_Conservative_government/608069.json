        "additional_details": "U-Turn on the current plan as it would be, in practical terms, a temporary loan that is levied from the public over the next five years, despite no ability to ensure lower prices next year. The current plan would drive proverty levels higher, and the knock effects of this will put more pressure on our health and social care services, a rise in crime and a depressing quality of life. The public, after suffering for the last two years- at the very least deserve the dignity of comfortable living.",
        "background": "The current energy crisis plan does not provide any relief, and we would like a vote in parliment for a Windfall Tax on British energy companies that taxes the large profits that these companies have enjoyed, and use this to fund an increase on a warm homes discount for households across the UK.",
