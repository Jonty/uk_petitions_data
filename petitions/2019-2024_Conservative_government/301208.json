I care for someone & we rely on hand gels etc daily yet the people that need it can\u2019t get hold on any. Most of us are doing what we need to but unless everyone follows then it\u2019s all pointless. It time our government put things into action to protect us all, we can\u2019t protect ourselves without more being done. I don\u2019t want to have to lose someone to this virus or see others in pain. Hygiene & contain isn\u2019t working",

To care & think more about those more at risk instead of just seeing them as an age or a health problem young/ old we all matter the same",
