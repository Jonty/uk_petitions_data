        "action": "Cancel GCSE and A Level Exams- instead grading students on assessed grades.",
        "additional_details": "We believe that the government should take this action to save lives.  Teachers are at very high risk of infection. The students with underlying medical conditions must weigh their future against their health- many unable to learn remotely must put themselves at risk to get an education. Poor mental health caused by repeated lockdowns and added stress is also especially prevalent among students. To cancel exams is to stop the spread of the virus, to save students and to save teachers.",
        "background": "We as students implore the government to reverse their stance on the 2021 examinations - and cancel them with quick decisive action. To follow the Welsh model, which has cancelled exams, replacing them with in classroom assessments- and easing the stress and workload of teachers and students alike.",
