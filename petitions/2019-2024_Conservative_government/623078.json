        "additional_details": "Rent increases are linked to RPI. RPI is already above the rate of CPI and many Shared Owners have contracts to allow rises of RPI + a %.  \r\nWe are tenants in law too.   We require the same consideration for rent caps that are currently being consulted by the Gov for other social tenants. \r\nWe propose the Government suggest Housing Associations cap rents for all their tenants including their Shared Owners.",
        "background": "We, in shared ownership, need help during the cost of living crisis.\r\nShared Owners had very high rent increases last year and will again this year. We are social tenants and need the same consideration given.",
