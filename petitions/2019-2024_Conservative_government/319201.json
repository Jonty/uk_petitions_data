By doing that we put our lives at risk. \r\nThe payment will be a small token of recognising and appreciating the hard work and the sacrifices care workers have to make on a daily basis to ensure vulnerable people are cared for during this extremely difficult period. As very often our work has gone without recognition over the past years. Hoping this will also mark a new era within the profession and hopefully will entice more people to join in and be part of the amazing profession.",
