        "additional_details": "To date this has been raised by several sponsors in Parliament. The public have made clear their wishes in the past e.g. for the commonwealth games in 2010 but for no good reason its never been allowed a second reading. As a Nation \u201cGod save the Queen\u201d is the correct anthem, but the Queen does not reign over England alone therefore it makes no sense for the English and could somewhat act to alienate the monarchy tot the other home nations.",
        "background": "To have a Minister sponsor the wishes of the English Nation to have its own National Anthem. It makes no sense when playing in domestic and international tournaments with other home nations who have their own national anthem.",
