        "action": "Make a substantive bilateral donation of Covid vaccines to the people of Nepal",
        "additional_details": "In WWs 1 & 2, Nepal contributed 90,780 and 137,883 Gurkha solders to our war effort.  We continue to enjoy the privilege of recruiting Nepalis into the British Army as Gurkhas who serve with the same pride, discipline, dignity and fortitude of their forebears.  We believe that we owe Nepal a debt of honour and must stand by it in its hour of need as it did in ours.  Many of our veterans, including recipients of our highest awards for gallantry, reside in Nepal and need our urgent support.",
        "background": "We owe a debt of honour to the people of Nepal and our Gurkha veterans.  We want the British Goverment to make a bilateral gift of Covid vaccines to Nepal, alongside those donations recently announced by the FCDO to Indonesia, Jamaica and Kenya.",
