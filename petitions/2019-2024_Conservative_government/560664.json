        "additional_details": "Only a handful of APs progress to Band 5, regardless of their role and length of service. Department managers can award APs Band 5 pay but instead, most only receive a greater workload. We want the government to make it mandatory for each NHS Trusts to start qualified APs at Band 5 instead of capping them at Band 4. At a minimum, there should be a transparent system in place for APs to progress to Band 5 especially when their roles start to resemble those of registered staff members.",
        "background": "Introduced in 2002 to address NHS staff shortages, Assistant practitioners (APs) work across the NHS in most departments. APs have been branded the \u201cunregulated\u201d workforce and the majority feel undervalued. Yet, they are highly skilled working with significant autonomy like \u201dregulated\u201d staff groups",
