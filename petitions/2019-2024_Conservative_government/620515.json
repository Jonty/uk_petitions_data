        "additional_details": "Brexit hasn't been done and many of the manifesto policies have been scrapped or changed. We are plodding along in a climate emergency, yet the govt have very few policy ideas to alleviate the impact, let alone stick to their climate commitments. There are strikes, crises in almost every department from NHS & social care to the DWP. A general election would force a rethink and hopefully introduce fresh policies and renewed energy for the things people need.",
        "background": "The new PM will have had months in post by the end of 2022 so the public will be aware of their policies and direction. All parties would have time to prepare for an election. An election would reinvigorate political parties & force them to come up with policies that help the country collectively.",
