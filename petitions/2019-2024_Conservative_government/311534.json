Our income has been completely and unexpectedly halted meaning we may have to downsize our homes or sell our personal possessions just to get by. We've worked hard to build our businesses which benefit many of our local communities. Without substantial help we could be forced to fold and look elsewhere for income which directly affects us as well as the local economy. We feel we've been deserted in our hour of need.",

Without help there will be many of us facing hardship over the months ahead through no fault of our own.",
