We are working with children of key working families. \r\nWe need this support to carry on our services.",
        "background": "Every college has stopped paying childminders their wages, although the funding has already allocated for the term; we need them to honour it.\r\nThis is leaving thousands of self employed childminders without wages that they rely on. It is our lively hood. \r\nWe are key workers. We are forgotten.",
