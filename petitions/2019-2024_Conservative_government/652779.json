        "additional_details": "We realise the importance of dependents earning a sum of money to sponsor foreign families and partners, however, \u00a338,700 is simply ridiculous and a slap in the face to the Britons who work hard and cannot afford to be with their partner or their family, especially during a cost of living crisis. In 2023, the median gross annual earnings for full-time employees in the UK was \u00a334,963. Therefore, how is \u00a338,700 attainable? We must lower the minimum amount for UK sponsors and lower visa fees.",
        "background": "The minimum income requirement must be lowered for family and spouse/partner visas. The new amendments to visas ask that UK citizens earn at least \u00a338,700 to sponsor foreign family members/partners wishing to gain a visa under the new rules. This sum of money is simply unattainable.",
