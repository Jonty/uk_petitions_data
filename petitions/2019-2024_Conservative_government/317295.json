        "additional_details": "Only having maybe 10 eligible children in a 50 place nursery will not cover the loss of income parents make up in fees to keep a nursery viable. We have been under funded for many years\r\nWe are know risking our health to provide emergency care but may not be able to reopen in the future after lockdown. Pay nurseries an income package for the gap between funding and what parents would have normally paid. This should be for ALL provisions whether they are stand alone or on LA/school/academy site",
        "background": "Pay nurseries for loss of income and fill the gap between funding and what parents have not paid. \r\nFunding provided for 2,3 and 4 year olds does not cover the true cost of providing a place for families. The funding is also dependant on how many of these eligible children you have at the time.",
