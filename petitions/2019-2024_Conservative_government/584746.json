        "additional_details": "It would be great to see the Government make this move in order to please Muslims all around the UK, allowing them to eat in restaurants, visit family indoors according to the limit and having the likes of cinemas and theatres available in order to celebrate the special day\r\n\r\nI don't wish this to be put across in a way where we want to be treated specially, I am only proposing this as it\u2019s 5 days earlier and the R rate is below 1 and this will put a smile on many faces after a gloomy year.",
        "background": "Eid is approaching and case rates are dropping I would like the easing of lockdown to be brought forward a few days. The reason for this is so that Muslims are able to celebrate Eid al fitr as we were unable to celebrate last year with the lockdown which at that time was totally understandable then.",
