        "additional_details": "So many Convicted paedophiles are walking free from court with suspended sentences along with community service or rehabilitation programmes. This is in no way any sort of justice for all those poor children. \r\nThe laws need to be alot harsher in dealing with these cases as the current laws do not offer any real deterrent. The only real punishment should be prison or the death penalty.",
        "background": "The current law has to be more of a deterrent for paedophiles as the current law does not set any sort of example to other potential paedophiles. The current laws are no form of punishment as we see day to day convicted paedophiles walking free with suspended sentences, when they should be locked up",
