        "additional_details": "Students are finding it hard to keep up with studies, especially students with more creative and practical courses. Studies are not being fulfilled and motivation is not at most as some students sadly have no access to enough resources, electronics or facilities that can help them thrive. The lack of contact with the students and teachers is also leaving the students deprived and is one of the wasted resources, as teachers would be able to guide students better in person.",
        "background": "As uni students haven\u2019t received the full potential of any of their courses, instead of making everything online postponing studies until September where students have a greater chance of coming back and succeeding in their studies. Many barriers are against students like not having resources etc.",
