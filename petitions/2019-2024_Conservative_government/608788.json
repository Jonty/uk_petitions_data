If he permits the continued repetition of falsehoods without taking action to correct the record, or fails to fulfil the role of his job & bring members into line who then continue to repeat falsehoods, he allows lying to become the norm, thereby betraying the electorate who are rendered unable to make informed decisions at election time. Ask the Speaker to fulfil his remit & stop this occurring.",

Where their behaviour is unlawful that is a matter for the police, when poor behaviour like falsehoods or slurs takes place in the House of Commons the Speaker should fulfil his/her role and address it.",
