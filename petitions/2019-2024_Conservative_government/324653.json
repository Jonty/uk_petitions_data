        "additional_details": "No child is born inherently thinking that someone else is worth less than they are. It is a facet of learnt behaviour from parents and family, or through exposure to outdated misinformation. It is our duty as a society to address this at the lowest level possible, at the ages where children are most likely to be indoctrinated into these beliefs.\r\n\r\nThis HAS to be addressed early and often in children's development to undo the damage that is being done in certain homes that perpetuate this.",
        "background": "Create a new class for children/young adults focused on teaching the current and historical state of prejudice & inequality (be that racism, sexism, homophobia etc.), and promoting future equality and acceptance as a basic tenant of society.\r\n\r\nIf we have Religious Studies, why do we not have this?",
