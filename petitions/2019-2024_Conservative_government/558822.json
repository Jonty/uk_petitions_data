        "additional_details": "The current sentences are way too lenient. Only a third of convicted child sex offenders end up serving time and only 18 months behind bars on average. This is absolutely not enough for the years of trauma a victim has to go through. If the minimum custodial sentence for ALL child sexual offences were to be increased to at least 10 years, more for repeat offenders, our children would be safer for longer. The government needs to step up and do more. This has been happening for way too long.",
        "background": "The minumum sentence for all child sex offenders should be increased to at least 10 years. This will keep convicted offenders off our streets and away from our children for longer. We need to do more to protect the children of our future and more justice for the victims of these horrible crimes.",
