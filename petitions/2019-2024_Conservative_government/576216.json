Like many women, the law has put me in a position where I have had to fertilise my PRIVATELY harvested eggs due to the seemingly-arbitrary 10 year egg thawing law. This situation has put me at great personal risk. Less than a year after creation 5-day embryos (foetus/placenta visible) are to be destroyed. (embryos are my ONLY chance to have a child)",
