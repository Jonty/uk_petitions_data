The most prominent recent examples being graffiti on the National War Memorial, The Cenotaph in Whitehall and the Statue of Sir Winston Churchill in Parliament Square.  But there have been a number of other examples in cities, towns and even villages across the country. Whilst some are acts of mindless vandalism, many are politically motivated and fuelled by hate - as much as spoken words. This will enable the courts to impose more appropriate sentences.",
