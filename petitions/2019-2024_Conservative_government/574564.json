        "additional_details": "In my opinion, I feel this is unethical and contradicting, as most 16-year-olds are in Sixth Form or other Post 16 education and they need some sort of transport to get to school. Although we have TFL it can be very unreliable... seeing as some buses can be delayed up to 2 hours or more at times.\r\n\r\nAllowing sixteen year olds to drive gives us a sense of independence. It gives those teens who live away from family members to visit without requiring a parent, as parents are busy most of the time...",
        "background": "The UK Government deems 16 years olds independent enough to consume alcohol, travel internationally, old enough to consent to sex, and get a job. Seeing as Countries like the USA and New Zealand, allow Teenagers at the age of 16 and above to drive, I don't see why we should be different?",
