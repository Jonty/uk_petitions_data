        "additional_details": "Seeing this information will be highly triggering for the 1-3 million individuals in the UK who have eating disorders. It will mean many individuals can no longer eat out. If calorie information needs to be published it should be done so online so those who do not wish to see it. Calories are not an effective measure of the \u2018healthiness\u2019 of food (for example a large salad can have more calories than a McDonalds burger) and therefore this step by the government is unnecessary.",
