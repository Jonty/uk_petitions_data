        "action": "Do not send any person who is seeking asylum in the UK to Rwanda",
        "additional_details": "We believe that the UK asylum system is already inaccessible to many asylum seekers by limiting their access to work and a dignified way of life. Sending people to a country 4000 miles away will only make this worse. \r\n\r\nRwanda is not as safe a place as the government claims. Sending vulnerable people to an unfamiliar and potentially dangerous country is immoral and we do not want our taxes spent like this.",
        "background": "It is immoral for our government to send people away simply because of how they travelled here. Many asylum seekers do not have the time or money to cross borders \"legally\". Crossing in trucks or boats is their only option. They should not be forced to risk everything, only to be sent away.",
