        "additional_details": "When I was at school, we were told to read the N word out and told that it was ok by a WHITE teacher. As a kid, this is very contradicting and is teaching kids that it is ok to say that word when it is not. It has made the black community feel unsafe and disrespected. A white teacher has no right to state what is ok and what is not when it comes to racism and they're very clearly not the race that was targeted by that word. A lot of kids nowadays feel it is okay to say the N word when it is not.",
        "background": "In the school curriculum, we were made to read a book called 'of mice and men.' This book, quite obviously, stated the N word more than once. The government should replace this book in the school curriculum with a more appropriate one.",
