        "additional_details": "Half the population is on benefits and University is meant to be there to break the cycle so that people aren't living off the government. University is meant to be an opportunity it shouldn't be something that people are struggling to pay for because the 9k is just covering the entry and the course not accommodation, travel, food and hygiene and social life. If the government is trying to get people of the streets and make England the Royal country they need to start off small and change the prices so more people are able to get an degree.",
        "background": "The government should not be charging so much for entry fee even though they do give out a loan it still isn't necessary. University has been effected by inflation. It was \u00a31000 in 1998,\u00a33000 in 2006, and in 2012 it went up to \u00a39000.",
