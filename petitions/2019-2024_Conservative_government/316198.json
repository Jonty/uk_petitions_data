        "additional_details": "I have recently been involved with a Animal Charity called HEAVENS GATE, they are based in Langport, Somerset. They help to rescue the many hundreds of dogs destined for the MEAT TRADE. These dogs are kept in abominable conditions. Crammed into tiny cages only to die horrifically at the hands of unscrupulous dealers. The ARCHAIC treatment of their animal population has got to STOP. By enforcing a TRADE EMBARGO on China, this may be the way to ENCOURAGE the Chinese Government to take action.",
        "background": "Put pressure on the Chinese Government to make the whole sale and breeding of dogs and cats for CONSUMPTION illegal. To also STOP the cruel mass exploitation of these animals which suffer beyond our imagination. Enabling the Chinese Government to realise, Public Opinion is AGAINST them on this.",
