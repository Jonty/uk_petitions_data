        "additional_details": "In recent events senior government officials have been promoting wreckless behaviour such as driving vehicles as a good way of testing eyesight.\r\n\r\nThis is not good for the general British public as some may follow in the footsteps of their beloved government leaders. Instead of seeking professional help from opticians, optometrists or even ophthalmologists some individuals may get behind the wheel of a car to test their own vision putting themselves and others in immediate danger.",
        "background": "The government should ensure that driving vehicles such as cars, trucks, motorbikes, etc as a means to test eyesight is illegal.\r\n\r\nIt is dangerous and foolish. \r\n\r\nThe government must make this clear and promote safety. And prevent unnecessary disasters for British people and citizens.",
