        "additional_details": "In the UK alone 48,000 people die of Sepsis each year, 60,000 people leave hospital with permanent life changing conditions including amputation. Sepsis costs the NHS and the public purse 16 billion per year.  This is an illness that is completely preventable if recognised early and something as easy as IV antibiotics can prevent septic shock. The government need to make sepsis awareness a priority for the whole population, run TV campaigns etc. PSS is physiologically identical to long covid.",
        "background": "Many Sepsis survivors in the UK and globally suffer a condition called Post Sepsis Syndrome, although most hospital clinicians recognise the illness many GP's just dismiss it and tens of thousands of Sepsis survivors are left with no support or even a recognised discharge pathway. It needs to change",
