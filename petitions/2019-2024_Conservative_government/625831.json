        "additional_details": "Water Pollution has been scientifically proven to have adverse and damaging effects on the natural local biodiversity of environments across river basins and a dramatic effect on human health for those residing in river basins which are affected by Water Pollution. With the government's help in reinstating European Union water protection laws, we can ensure that the British Public has access to clean and safe rivers without the risk of chemical, thermal and environmentally damaging pollution",
        "background": "In recent years, after Brexit, Water Pollution has massively increased within river systems within England, as they have repealed most of the Water Protection laws that were EU laws. In order to have a government that cares for the people, we need our water systems to be safe from pollutants.",
