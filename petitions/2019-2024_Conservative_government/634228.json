        "additional_details": "Stop companies being able to chase debt without a court judgement and a reasonable proof that the debt is owed. Allow mechanisms for challenge before the debt is passed to debt collectors to ensure the private citizen can challenge wrongful proceedings. It is not right to put the burden on the citizen to have to go to court to prove they do not owe money whilst being threatened and bailiffed. The burden of proof should be on the company. Faceless companies nowadays mean no ability to challenge.",
        "background": "Many private citizens are chased by bailiffs or debt collection for debts that are not theirs or a mistake made by a company. The company does not have to provide any reasonable standard of proof to do this.  The individual has no choice but to pay and can be threatened to do so.",
