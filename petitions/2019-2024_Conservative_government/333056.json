        "additional_details": "Many people who struggle with eating disorders or have a bad relationship with food make a habit of calorie counting as a way of reducing their food intake. Going out for a meal, and finding that the calorie intake is on the menu in front of you has the likelihood to damage a lot of people mentally through knowing what they\u2019re eating in a place where they may be trying to avoid it. Calorie information should be available on hand for those that genuinely need it for nutritional value.",
        "background": "Parliament are planning on allowing restaurants to publish the calorie intake of a meal right beside the item on a menu. This information, majority of the time, is available with the allergen information, and should not need publishing as it can affect those who have a bad relationship with food.",
