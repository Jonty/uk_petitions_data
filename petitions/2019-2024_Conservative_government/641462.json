        "additional_details": "Small food businesses often struggle to expand due to the heavy tax burden they face, which is much more significant than giant corporations. Furthermore, the absence of VAT when purchasing goods is zero-rated, while a 20% VAT is imposed when selling them, creating a significant discrepancy. This makes it difficult for small businesses to compete in the market. A more equitable tax system would be beneficial for everyone involved.",
        "background": "Hot food has a 20%charge, while fresh, frozen, and dairy products are zero-rated.The difficulties as our expenses remain zero-rated. Or apply a standard rate of 20%on for all wholesale purchases.\r\nTherefore,the significant amount we have to pay every quarter.It's not sustainable for small businesses",
