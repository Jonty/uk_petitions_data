These are qualities a 21st century Monarch should have, & these are all qualities that our own Queen has unfalteringly shown throughout her 61 year reign.",

Through our  late Queen's dedication to this country and to the Commonwealth, she has worked to help redefine what Monarchy is. In this case, \"the Great\" in title, is warranted.",
