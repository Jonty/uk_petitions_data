The amount of women who are my age and have had the same shows the smear test age needs to be lowered. 6 in 10 women will receive an abnormal smear test. This needs to be lowered as it is high, something needs to be done. If the smear age was lower then the HPV positive cells could be picked up and monitored before the turn abnormal. I am currently going through this and my cells are already abnormal at my first smear.",
