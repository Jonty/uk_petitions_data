        "additional_details": "Every rent paying and mortgage paying citizen that is being asked to isolate for the good of the country and the world should have help from the Government to pay rent or mortgages. This should be done immediately so that people can concentrate on carrying out the will of the Government without the thought that they will be left in debt. Banks are now offering 3-month mortgage holidays but this just delays payment of the debt.",
        "background": "The global coronavirus pandemic has sent shockwaves around the world. Millions of people in the UK may find themselves in debt due to no fault of their own. It is at a time like this that Government should step up and do more to protect people from financial hardship.",
