        "additional_details": "The government announced a phased return to primary school from the 1st June with \u2018the government\u2019s ambition for all primary school children to return to school before the summer for a month if feasible\u2019.\r\n\r\nHowever many schools have said it will not be possible to reopen safely, with pupil numbers & class sizes a major concern.\r\n\r\nBy returning to school part-time until things return to normal this would solve the problem of keeping class sizes to under 15 & get children's education back on track.",
        "background": "If schools operated a 2 week timetable and split classes in half, it would be possible for students to attend school on 5 out of 10 days whilst keeping class sizes to a maximum of 15.\r\n \r\nIt will be sometime before things return to normal and attending school part-time is better than not at all.",
