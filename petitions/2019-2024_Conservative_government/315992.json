        "additional_details": "It is outstanding that a country of our wealth should expect such Key Workers to pay for their training in the first place, but then also not receive appropriate pay to effectively \u2018cancel\u2019 their incurred student debts. Many Key Workers are therefore paying for their student debts some 20 years after they\u2019ve qualified. They should not have to pay for the right to serve their country and it\u2019s citizens as Key Workers. The current crisis has shown how necessary these workers are to our country.",
        "background": "Those working as Key Workers should have their student debt cancelled as way of showing them they are appreciated for their skills, bravery, and qualities. This should apply to Nhs staff, Social care workers, Teachers & any other student debts incurred for Key Workers part of Pandemic 2020.",
