The ban also has an adverse impact on the UK Treasury. As the industrial action is going on companies can train the asylum seekers who have skills and get employed. adding people should be given the right to work and not be constrained to the Shortage Occupation List. If we use asylum seekers, we don't need to get people from other countries by providing visas.",

In the first year of their wait, asylum seekers have no legal right to work, and must survive on minimal government support. After this point, they can apply for the right to work, but available roles are heavily restricted.",
