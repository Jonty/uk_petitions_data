        "additional_details": "Employers do not provide leave to parents to deal with the loss of a child after a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy.If leave is provided it is treated as sick leave instead of bereavement leave when in majority of the cases its the grief that needs to be dealt too.Since there is no legislation at present to give leave if miscarriage occurs before 24 weeks of pregnancy employers in most cases just stick to govt guidance instead of showing compassion and treating it as a bereavement leave.",
