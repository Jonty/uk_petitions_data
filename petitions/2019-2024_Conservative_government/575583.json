        "additional_details": "Targeted exercise improves the quality of life, recovery rate and life expectancy of cancer patients and survivors. It has been referred to as the, 'underrated wonder drug' by Macmillan. It eliminates the side effects of treatment that often lead to further investigations, scans or medication: an extra unnecessary burden on the resources and finances of the NHS. Research proves that the impact of exercise is extremely effective; it is still not routinely prescribed to cancer patients.",
        "background": "Recognise and prioritise the physical rehabilitation of cancer patients, during and after their treatment. The NHS must prescribe specialist, physical rehabilitation, to avoid the associated health risks of the treatment and give patients the best chance of preventing a return of the disease.",
