        "additional_details": "There are two parliamentary loopholes in 2020 allowing any MP or Minister to lie with immunity, due to draconian laws dating back to 1689 and 1844. These need to be amended and replaced by a new law making it a criminal offence for any MP to tell a lie in Parliament, at an Election or Referendum. This Law would also prevent lies and misrepresentations by electronic mail & social media.  \r\nShould these amendments be put into law it would have an immediate impact on restoring trust in our Democracy",
        "background": "Make it a criminal offence for any Minister or MP to deliberately lie in Parliament, an Election or Referendum which after the last 4 years is now destroying parliamentary democracy. Abolish the 331 year old  parliamentary privilege law, that allows MP's to lie without fear of criminal prosecution.",
