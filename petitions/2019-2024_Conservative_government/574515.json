        "action": "Remove the outdated draconian tax called a TV licence.",
        "additional_details": "The \u00a3159 a year tax hits the poorest of our population the hardest. The parts of our society that may not be able to afford much else but to entertain their family or educate their family through television. It\u2019s a draconian tax wrapped up in a draconian name and times like these the UK government needs to lead from the front and provide relief of outgoing bills to hard hit families. Scrap the fee and encourage the BBC to operate like its peers ITV etc using advertising and other general taxation means.",
        "background": "From April 2021 the TV licence fee will increase by \u00a31.50 to \u00a3159 a year. This licence fee is an outdated and draconian tax which needs to be abolished and either fund the BBC through general taxation, abolish the BBC or ask the BBC to fund itself via advertising like all other non BBC channels do.",
