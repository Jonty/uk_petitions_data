        "additional_details": "This is dire, as esports not having the level of funding and officiated guidance that sports in the UK have is negatively affecting an industry that even the Department of Digital, Culture, Media & Sport stated has \"[the] potential to develop as an area of real national strength in the UK.\" The recognition of esports as a sport could open the door to more support and help officiate it within the UK, which is nationally, in some cases, decades behind other countries in terms of progress.",
        "background": "I would like the Government or Parliament to revisit the classification and recognition of esports in the UK, as currently it is recognised as a game, and not a sport. This hinders the industry as it has meant that there is no national governing body or officially recognised governance.",
