        "action": "Make businesses furlough clinically extremely vulnerable workers.",
        "additional_details": "Change the legislation to stop businesses abusing CEV employees with SSP. Any shielder who is unable to stay at home, due to financial fear, must have their employment ceased due to the risks of catching COVID and they must be put on furlough under the CJRS. Any employer who previously paid SSP for a CEV worker to stay at home must repay that employee the difference in losses of earnings comparable to CJRS. CEV employees are and have been forced into complacency at the discretion of companies.",
        "background": "Clinically extremely vulnerable, some with big families to support, are not getting access to CJRS. Businesses are granting these workers SSP to shield, some are being forced into redundancy. CEV workers should NOT BE MADE to go to work because their company WON'T GRANT THEM CJRS (FURLOUGH).",
