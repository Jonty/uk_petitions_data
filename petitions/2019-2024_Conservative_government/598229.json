        "action": "More secure parking areas for HGV with better facilities & safety for drivers",
        "additional_details": "Basically if it continues more drivers will leave the industry, the wages are only part of the problem. Local authorities have imposed many HGV parking restrictions , service areas charge between \u00a330-\u00a340 a night to park and is nether safe or secure and as an ADR driver carrying a wide range of chemicals this causes me problems & many other drivers too . The job is very unappealing to anyone who looks into it , also many present drivers will leave the industry if these problems aren\u2019t addressed",
        "background": "As you there is a massive driver shortage & being a HGV driver myself one of the biggest complaints amongst drivers is the lack of safe secure parking with basic facilities for hygiene, this is one of the major reasons drivers leave the industry, it\u2019s not all about wages .",
