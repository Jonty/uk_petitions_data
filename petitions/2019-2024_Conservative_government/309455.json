        "additional_details": "Many NHS workers currently are not being provided with sufficient protection from the life-threatening virus that they are coping with. The general public stays at home, safe, whilst these brave frontline workers battle with an overflow of patients and stressful daily duties. A family member of mine works with the NHS currently and revealed that her co-workers were belittled and scolded when they entered the workplace wearing a mask. Protect and support our frontline workers, please.",
        "background": "The government should provide precautionary equipment such as masks for nurses and doctors and others who are putting themselves at risk daily to treat others. At the very least they should support those who decide to wear their own masks to keep themselves safe.",
