        "additional_details": "The government should issue ration books to the entire country and each member of your household should be given a daily/weekly allowance and each family should be bound by their rations. It\u2019s the only sensible way of making this work.  It will also help with social distancing that people aren\u2019t currently adhering to in their panic to over-buy.",
        "background": "Trying to get hold anything to make a meal, essentials like bread and milk, non-prescription medicines, cleaning products is near on impossible. Shopping online is also impossible; either no slots or nothing available. We cannot continue like this and despite the stores rationing, it\u2019s not helping.",
