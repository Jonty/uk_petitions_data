        "additional_details": "Covid-19 has a devastating effect on animal charities in the UK. \r\nDue to government restrictions shelters and sanctuaries have been forced to close. Their ability to fundraise and collect donations has been greatly effected. Many have reported a decline in funding due to shop closures. \r\nAnimal charities are responsible for collecting animals from the homes of people who've been admitted to hospital with Covid-19, who may not have anyone else to care for them.",
        "background": "On 8 April the Chancellor announced charities across the UK will receive a \u00a3750 million package of support to ensure they can continue their vital work during the coronavirus outbreak. The announcement did not mention if animal charities will be included. Animal charities need funding urgently.",
