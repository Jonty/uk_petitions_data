        "additional_details": "Similar to the way that the bank of England was given independence in 1997, a decision hailed as a massive success by all, the NHS too should be free from the whims of the party in power of the day. I propose a cross party board with NHS professionals on the panel the ensure that the NHS can run its own affairs and bid for funding based on the needs of the day. No one party should be allowed to sell or under invest in any more of our services in future.",
        "background": "For too many years the NHS has been used as a political football. Parts of it have been sold off to the donors of the governing party of the day. The covid epidemic in the face of 10 years of underinvestment have brought the disastrous treatment of our health services into stark contrast.",

The Bank of England has similar operational independence from the Government, so mainly differs from NHS England in that it also raises its own funding.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petitions, which include requests for funding for the NHS to be protected through various means, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nEnsure continued Universal health cover by legally committing to a minimum spend: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/300925\r\n\r\nCreate a National Health Insurance Tax for the NHS: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/313361\r\n\r\nRevoke the Health and Social Care Act 2012 and renationalise the NHS: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/300019\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about coronavirus and how you can protect yourself and others here:\r\n\r\nwww.gov.uk/coronavirus\r\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/\r\n\r\nThe Government has also created an online service to help you out what you can do if you\u2019re struggling because of coronavirus: https://www.gov.uk/find-coronavirus-support\r\n\r\nYou can read NHS tips to help if you are worried about coronavirus here: https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/coronavirus-covid-19-anxiety-tips\r\n\r\nYou can read impartial analysis of the Government response to coronavirus and policy developments here: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/coronavirus/\r\n\r\nYou may also be interested to know that because of the large number of petitions that have been started in relation to coronavirus, the Petitions Committee has been questioning the Government about its response to the coronavirus outbreak.\r\n \r\nFind out more: https://committees.parliament.uk/work/192/the-governments-response-to-coronavirus/"
