We call on out government workers and MP's to do the same and support the economy and the UK people in these times. \r\nPublic sector workers have struggled under austerity for too long while we see tax breaks handed out to millionaires. It's time for out MP's to put their money where their mouths are !",

We apparently can't afford to give all of our public sector workers need a pay rise. So we call on our MP's to stand with us.",
