        "additional_details": "It would significantly change the way current services and organisations operate. It would change the way people treat and behave towards one another in society once and for all. Individuals who have narcissistic tendencies would be made to be accountable for their own behaviours rather than victim blaming. The behaviours exhibited from a narcissistic individual are completely textbook. The behaviours can also be evidenced by the copious amounts of research on narcissistic personalities.",
        "background": "Narcissistic Abuse is a Worldwide toxicity affecting millions of people.  Adding  Narcissistic abuse to the Governments Abuse categories would enable the Police, Mental Health/Child Protection Teams to identify, prove and ultimately provide justice to those victims & children of domestic abuse.",
