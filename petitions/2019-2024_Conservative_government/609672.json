        "additional_details": "The Government must now introduce Pump Watch\r\nNo longer are Asda the fuel cutting leaders they were and the big 4 competition is deminished since the CMA approved take over.\r\nOil companies have made a unprecidented amount of profit over the course of 2021 while working families are made poorer. It is critical to remember high fuel prices do not just effect car owners but people buying food and adds inflationary pressure.\r\nThe Government now needs to step in and stop this profiteering",
        "background": "The UK faces a serious cost of living crisis and serious inflationary issues (currently over 5%).\r\nSince 2020 fuel companies have made over 10p a liter, closer to 20p, profit per liter. This is a raise from 6p ordinarily. High fuel costs, fuel inflation, high food prices and other economics",
