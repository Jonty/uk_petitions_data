Blocking members of ISIS/similar affiliates from returning to the UK will improve security, diminish home recruitment to these extremist groups and save tax payer money in legal fees. Where the decision has been made to withdraw citizenship, it should not be discussed at tax payer expense in courts.",
        "background": "Block any ISIS member or ISIS sympathiser from entering/re entering the UK. ISIS or their affiliates who have lost citizenship should not again receive it. Attempts at tax payer funded legal actions should be blocked by matter of course under the same national security concerns as the first point.",

The legal process for the revocation of citizenship, including any appeal, is a matter for the Courts, which are independent, not the UK Government or Parliament."
