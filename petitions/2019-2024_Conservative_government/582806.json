        "action": "To commit to not using any kind of vaccine passport domestically",
        "additional_details": "Previous petition 569957 as discussed in parliament on 15 March 2021 was essentially swept away by Penny Mordaunt who implied it had not yet been discussed enough to make any decision. Many citizens believe that the introduction of domestic passports could be 'stage one' in a process to adopt a Chinese-style social credit system and will therefore be boycotting any businesses that sign up to a domestic passport scheme. For the sake of freedom and democracy, do not introduce domestic passports.",
        "background": "Review the discussion of petition 569957 which had requested the government commits to not introducing vaccine passports. The request was essentially swept under the rug by Ms. Mordaunt and we now see the government is planning to introduce them domestically despite  concerns from MP's & citizens.",
