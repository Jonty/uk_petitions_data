The students studying for external exams next year need to be in school working together with each other and our teachers. It is time for adults to realise that we are more than capable of making informed decisions. Adults are speaking for us but haven't taken the time to speak to us, to find out our opinion.",

Teenagers around the country want to go back to school, to learn properly and see our friends. We fully understand the impact of coronavirus and accept we will have changes put in place.",
