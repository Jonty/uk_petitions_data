        "additional_details": "Employees are given 80% of their salary to help with supporting their families and to pay bills because they cannot work during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the self-employed have to settle with \u00a394 a week statutory sick pay. This is unacceptable. Our proposal is fair, and equal. The self-employed and sole traders are extremely important and skilled workers and should be treated with the same support as the government has given the employed.",
        "background": "The government should use a self-employed worker's most recent tax return to calculate the support they should be given while they cannot work during the COVID-19 pandemic. A worker applies with their UTR number, they're average monthly income is then calculated, and the government then pay 80%.",
