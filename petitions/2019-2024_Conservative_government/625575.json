        "additional_details": "For 100 years, the BBC has been 'one of this country's glittering achievements' and thus 'the Government's attack on the BBC is a threat to our democracy' as it provides unbiased news reports (to quote the Guardian).\r\nNot only has it been a major part of British culture with its globally renowned films and shows, it also educates children through BBC Bitesize, helping from primary school to A-Levels.\r\nThus the Government must stop funding cuts, continue to fund and protect the BBC as it used to.",
        "background": "The Government has significantly cut the BBC's funding which will prevent the BBC continuing to function as before. The Government must not only cease cutting the funds, but also raise the funding so that the BBC is able to survive (e.g. CBBC can continue as a proper channel, not just online).",
