The removal of Colston\u2019s statue by force is also criminal and should not be repeated. With a government act, protesters, victims of racism and slavery will have more confidence that their voices are heard and understood. Removal of these landmarks will stand for a greater moment in our history. Black Lives Matter.",

To officially recognise that these monuments are no longer relevant in modern Britain and should be removed from the fabric of UK society. Black Lives Matter.",
