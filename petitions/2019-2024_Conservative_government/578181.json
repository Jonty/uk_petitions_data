        "additional_details": "The average salary a NHS nurse earns is \u00a333,384. This means they will get an extra \u00a37 per week, that's 50p less than a Burger King Double Whopper Meal. Bear in mind that's the average, there are loads that will earn less than that per week. Hancock has given the excuse that there isn't enough cash. Here's an idea, stop funding pointless stuff that doesn't benefit peoples lives in the long run.",
        "background": "The pay rise given to NHS workers was a measly 1%. This is simply not enough. if it wasn't for the NHS, the UK would be in a state as dilapidated as Manaus, Brazil due to Covid-19. If it wasn't for them Boris Johnson wouldn't be alive. That's why I want this government to give them a 15% pay rise.",
