        "additional_details": "Because this issue has to be in education. I myself didn\u2019t think this was a problem until I had many friends who are girls tell me their stories of how they have been harassed and I was shocked in how many stories people had to tell. The only way to solve this is for years 7-11 to be educated on this point and for each and everyone person to understand this issue from a young age so everyone understands exactly what sexual assault/harassment boundaries are, I don\u2019t know the boundaries myself.",
        "background": "This needs to be in education in schools from years 7-11 most importantly, simply because men need to learn boundaries and when they are crossing the line of sexual harassment/ assault. We all need to be clued up on the ins and outs of sexual harassment/assault.",
