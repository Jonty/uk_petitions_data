        "additional_details": "Those working in education have been at the frontline during this pandemic as they provide continuity in education, providing important support to students of all ages \u2013 particularly the most vulnerable. \r\n\r\nWhile we agree with the JCVI that health and social care workers should be first in line for COVID-19 vaccination, alongside vulnerable members of society, we owe it to them and to our whole community to put those who work with children and young people near the front of the line for vaccines.",
        "background": "Government should prioritise educators & childcare professionals in distribution of the COVID vaccine, along with other key workers who have bravely accepted the greatest risk during the pandemic. Those working in education settings need to be able to do so without fear of the risk to their health.",
