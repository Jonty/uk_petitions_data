While some of our history is dark we have done great things for the world. Removal of these pieces of history is travesty and an insult to the British identity! If they must absolutely be taken down a nation wide referendum should be held to discover if that is what the MAJORITY of people want.",
        "background": "Over the past several weeks memorials and statues around the U.K. have been vandalised, torn down or damaged by protestors associated with #BLM. Now we have learnt that councils around the U.K. are kneeling to pressure and removing them, themselves. This is unacceptable.",
