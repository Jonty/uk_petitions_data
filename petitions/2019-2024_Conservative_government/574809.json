Working towards driving is essential both for my current job role and allowing me to further my job prospects in the future. By not allowing driving tests to go ahead, the government is inhibiting progression of the next generation of young people and creating a backlog of people wanting to drive. ALL (not just emergency service) key workers should be granted a test ASAP.",
