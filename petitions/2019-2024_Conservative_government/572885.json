        "additional_details": "I am a dog owner and I am becoming scared to walk from my own front door and walk my dog.I have friends and family who feel the same. \r\nThere are constant posts from local groups on social media with attempted or actual dog theft, leaving families distraught if not  harmed, and then dogs taken from what and who they know best to go on to be harmed and sold on if not worse. It\u2019s is inhumane behaviour and as a nation of dog lovers we can not let this continue. \r\nIn the current covid situation, outdoor exercise and family time is all we have so I urge for this to be discussed at government level. Stop dogs from being a monetary item and allow them to continue to be part of a family and be safe.",
