        "additional_details": "One of the reasons for Brexit was to take control of our borders, & I believe some lawyers take advantage of the 1951 convention to enable immigrants who have illegally entered the UK to remain in the UK.\r\n\r\nNobody objects to genuine refugees. I am the son of two immigrants who entered the UK legally from India. By failing to withdraw from this convention, I believe the UK is misdirecting resources, that could be used to help those in genuine need, to support people who entered the UK illegally.",
        "background": "The Polish government is holding a national referendum on the same day as national elections on October 15. We should do the same at the next general election. One question should be about leaving the 1951 Refugee Convention which is outdated & not fit for purpose and the vote fully respected.",
