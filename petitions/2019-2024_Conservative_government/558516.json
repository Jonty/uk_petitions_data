        "additional_details": "This small change in the government\u2019s policy could help some pubs survive. That bit of income proved so helpful to many public houses during the last lockdown.\r\n\r\nAll pubs have adhered to the government\u2019s guidelines regarding safety with Covid-19 regulations. \r\n\r\nSome would consider them safer spaces to buy alcohol than some small off Licenses or small supermarkets with narrow aisles. \r\n\r\nThe reasoning doesn\u2019t make sense, if one business can sell alcohol why can\u2019t the other?",
        "background": "The Government have currently Banned the sale of takeaway Alcohol when the lockdown starts on Thursday 5th November. \r\n\r\nHowever Off Licenses and Supermarkets are permitted to still sell alcohol. \r\n\r\nPubs could sell alcohol in sealed containers just like the other outlets.",
