However, MPs must commit to avoiding a public sector pay freeze, like that of 2010, as a means of cutting expenditure.\r\n\r\nOur NHS heroes, and all public sector workers have done vital, life saving work throughout this crisis - we must ensure that their pay reflects the work that they do. There must be no pay freeze, and wages must increase, at-least at the rate of inflation.",
        "background": "UK Government must not freeze NHS and public sector pay in financial response to the Coronavirus pandemic. Pay for all of our essential public sector workers must at-the-least increase in-line with inflation in the months and years following  the Coronavirus pandemic.",
