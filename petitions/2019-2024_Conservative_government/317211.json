Patients being cared for due to covid-19 should have one set of appropriate PPE to be available for one family member or next of kin. Patients should not be dying without having the opportunity to have a family member with them. These are frightening times and what scares people most is being alone at their time of greatest need. The impact of knowing your loved one died alone will make the grieving process so much more harrowing.",
