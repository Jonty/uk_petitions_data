        "additional_details": "In 2018, the government rejected calls to change the law, saying the Theft Act provided \"sufficient sanctions\".\r\n\r\nBut former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith is calling for stricter penalties to deal with so-called \"dognapping\".\r\n\r\nSupporters of the change argue that the emotional impact of losing an animal is greater than when an ordinary, non-living belonging is stolen.",
        "background": "This is the law in America If the stolen dog is worth more than $500, it can result in imprisonment for up to 10 years or a fine of up to $3,000 (or both) If the stolen dog is worth less than $500, you could still face a stiff fine and imprisonment but less so than for higher value pets.",
