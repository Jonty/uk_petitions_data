        "additional_details": "The Government, in the midst of a crisis, quietly introduced this 296 page bill which means any peaceful protest can be stopped if anyone objects, or if the Home Secretary and the police decide so. This country has a long history of the right to a peaceful protest, which has been obtained through the loss of many lives over the years. Furthermore, the 1986 Public Law Act already allows the police to apply restrictions, if thought that there could be serious public disorder, damage or disruption.",
        "background": "At a time when protests are being clamped down around the world, this bill must be amended so anyone can have the right to a peaceful protest, restricted only in accordance with the existing legislation.",
