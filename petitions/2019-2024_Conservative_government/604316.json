        "additional_details": "I work in an SEMH school. Their Ofsted review was very low - Ofsted only focused on academic progress and failed to account for the fact that these children have experienced trauma and abuse from a young age and cannot learn maths/english without feeling safe/trusting others, without the ability to attend for long periods of time or without the social skills in place to react appropriately to classroom stimuli (as opposed to using violence or swearing - which the school focuses on combatting).",
        "background": "Ensure the department of education is fair when reviewing the status of schools for children with special needs and disabilities (SEND) or social, emotional and mental health (SEMH) backgrounds. There is a reason these children are not in mainstream schools as they need to learn how to regulate.",
