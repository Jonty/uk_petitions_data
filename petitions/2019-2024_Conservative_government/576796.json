        "additional_details": "An example role description for a vaccinator states \"The vaccinator role is a registered nurse or GP who will work at a vaccination station. The vaccinator will discuss and record consent with the patient (etc.).\" This illustrates that nurses and GPs are carrying out the same amount of labour for different wages. Southampton is an example of the pay disparity, with nurses being payed \u00a327.90 per hour and doctors being payed \u00a345.00 per hour (both values before tax).",
        "background": "Across the country, in primary care settings, practice nurses are experiencing a great disparity in pay when vaccinating the population against COVID-19. Nurses are calling on the government to make it law that during primary care vaccination sessions, they receive the same payment as GPs.",
