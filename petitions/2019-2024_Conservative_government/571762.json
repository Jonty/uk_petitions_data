        "additional_details": "The disadvantages of children doing home schooling are obvious, we are looming towards a mental health crisis. To ensure we return to some kind of normality we need to vaccinate our school staff to allow society to move forward. \r\nOur teachers are at risk and as a parent we need to support them to allow us to continue doing our part by working. We are at risk of redundancy, job loss, because we simply cannot do it all. We need our children back at school, let\u2019s get our school staff vaccinated.",
        "background": "Teachers and school staff should be a priority for being vaccinated as such I ask the government to add them to the priority list.",
