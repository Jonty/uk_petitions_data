        "action": "Refund university students for inadequate teaching during the pandemic & strikes",
        "additional_details": "Paying \u00a327,000+ for a university degree demands a high quality of teaching and support throughout the degree. However, the disruption has meant the teaching has been inadequate and unsatisfactory and does not meet the expectations of a university teaching experience. Students deserve their debt to be removed completely or partially due to this inadequate teaching and to avoid them spiralling into debt following a poor university experience.",
        "background": "Students will leave university with over \u00a327,000 worth of debt to repay through their adult life. Teaching during the UCU strikes in 2018/19/20 and the COVID-19 pandemic has been inadequate and not sufficient for the cost of university. Students deserve a full or partial refund for this issue.",
