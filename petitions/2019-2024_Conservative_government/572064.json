The costs of shopping between the UK and the EU will return to normal.\r\n\r\nIf your weekly spend went up by 40% after trying a new supplier, would you continue going or go back to your previous supplier? It\u2019s common sense.\r\n\r\nIf the real reason the UK\u2019s rich & powerful wanted Brexit is not because of the EU\u2019s stricter tax laws, then why doesn\u2019t the UK Government implement those same tax laws? It would raise \u00a335 Billion every year.",

The UK does not benefit at all, but the 27 EU states will benefit with an increase in taxes, business rates and more EU jobs for its citizens.\r\n\r\nWhat was once dismissed as \u2018Project Fear\u201d is clear for all to see as truth.\r\n\r\nAnd it's only 26 days after Brexit.",
