        "additional_details": "Many couples have postponed weddings already (from 2020 into 2021) and now a wedding is being treated significantly different to a 'Large Event' with the cap of 30 people in place well after fans can return to stadiums and cinemas. With a defined guest list and significant impact upon the hospitality sector, the allowing of a more 'normal' wedding as part of Stage 3 would bring hope to many.",
