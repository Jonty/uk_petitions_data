        "action": "Reverse plans for oil and gas expansion in the North Sea",
        "additional_details": "There is a huge public and cross-party mandate to green the UK economy, yet the plans announced by PM Rishi Sunak to massively expand leases for oil and gas exploration not only ignores this, but puts our future generations at risk. \r\nSpecifically:\r\n- It fails the 'leveling up' agenda by offering working communities the dregs of a dying sector.\r\n- It leaves the UK economy totally unprepared for an inevitable low-carbon future.\r\n- It fails its climate pledges and loses all credibility as a leader.",
        "background": "We urge the government immediately to halt plans to expand leases for North Sea oil and gas drilling. As signatories from all parties and backgrounds, we recognise the urgent need to move away from fossil fuel reliance and instead invest in clean energy, jobs, and infrastructures.",
