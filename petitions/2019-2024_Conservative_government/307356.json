        "additional_details": "Government needs to bring in powers to force caravan parks and holiday homes to close during the crisis. The advice has already been to self isolate and stay where you are. People coming to tourist hotpots as if it were a normal summer break are greatly putting the locals of these areas at risk and should be ashamed.   Something needs to be done NOW!!!",
        "background": "We need the government to take drastic action to help tourist hot spots like North Wales from being inundated with Corona-Evacuees. Since the crisis began, our caravan parks are filled to the brim with tourists - if these people get sick our local small hospitals will be inundated and unable to cope",
