        "additional_details": "Burial and cremation are currently the only funeral options available to bereaved families in the UK. Both of these options are extremely harmful to the environment. Over 75% of families opt for a cremation which is approximately 470,000 cremations a year. Each cremation produces on average 250kgs of carbon dioxide which is released into the atmosphere (that's 115,000 tonnes a year) Burial also has its own list of harmful factors. One being the absorption of harmful chemicals into earth.",
        "background": "To give bereaved families an eco-friendly end of life alternative to burial or cremation. The human composting process is a natural process which avoids the use of any chemicals or fuels and results in rich, fertile soil being returned to the family.",
