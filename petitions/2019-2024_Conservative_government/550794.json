        "additional_details": "In 1938 we rescued 10,000 children from the Nazis with the Kindertransport. In 2020 surely we could rescue just 407. The fire has left 13,000 people living on the streets and they have been refused access to the town centre.  These people are now struggling to survive without food, water, shelter or healthcare. As Brits, we look back at the Kindertransport of 1938 and we are proud of our history. Let\u2019s make history today that we can be equally proud of and create the Moria Kindertransport.",
        "background": "Moria refugee camp in Greece was the largest in Europe until it burned to the ground on the 9th September. The camp, designed for 2,700 residents, was home to 13,000 at the time of the fire, including 407 unaccompanied minors, according to Unicef. I petition the UK Government to welcome them here.",
