        "additional_details": "The CV tragedy has had a catastrophic impact around the world, and the fact that the virus has spread to most countries around the globe, reinforces how we are a global community. It is important that victims and key workers are never forgotten and the hope is that their legacies will contribute to a global commitment to plant other such areas in other countries and help to reduce carbon levels in the atmosphere. In doing so, their legacies will help to save the lives of millions in the future.",
        "background": "The Govt should purchase a significant area of land within the UK and to plant a tree for every global victim of the virus and for every key worker who has kept the rest of us safe. Family members of victims can name trees in memory of their loved ones, but it is a forest for the people.",
