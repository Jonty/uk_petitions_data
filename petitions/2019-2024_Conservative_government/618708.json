        "additional_details": "Travel teaches us so much about the world and other cultures. With a ever increasing rise in mental health problems it\u2019s very difficult for people to switch off. Life moves at such a fast pace, quality time is infrequent for lots of working families and holidays give us time to re-connect and reset. This year my children and I took school supplies abroad and spent the day at a school for children living in extreme poverty in Dominican Republic, the experience was life changing. As a single working parent I have always taken my children out of school for holidays, if I didn\u2019t they wouldn\u2019t have seen any of the world. I won\u2019t allow my children to miss out on opportunities simply because we have only one income",
        "background": "Families should be given the opportunity to chose to take their child on a family holiday annually if they believe that it would be beneficial for their child. Seeing the world should not only be obtainable to children who\u2019s families have a significant amount of excess income or the means to save.",
