        "action": "Cancel iGCSE and iAL examinations for international students in 2020",
        "additional_details": "As a result of the outbreak of COVID-19, international students have been disproportionately affected in comparison to those in the United Kingdom. Consequently, students sitting for iGCSE and iALevel exams internationally have been given an unfair disadvantage in the face of all other international candidates sitting for said exams, as certain schools around the world have been required to shut. As a result of the school closure, students face the possibility of not completing the course material prior to sitting on our exams in May/June.  \r\n\r\nI believe that there should be an indefinite cancellation of May/June exams for international candidates as arguably we have been even more affected by the virus than those in the U.K. Please consider this proposal.",
        "background": "This petition is about the matter of iGCSE and iALevel examinations taking place in the summer of 2020 internationally. As the UK government have announced that students within UK will not be required to sit for exams, it is fair to provide the international students with the same opportunities.",
