        "action": "Freeze all rent and mortgage payments until the Covid-19 crisis is over",
        "additional_details": "As self-employed people have to self-isolate or cannot work due to the risk of contracting and spreading the new coronavirus, the pressure to pay rent and mortgage payments continues unabated.\r\nParliament should vote to pause all rent and mortgage payments to drastically reduce the economic drain of rent-seekers and thus reduce the cost of living. This should not be a temporary loan to be repaid, but a complete pause of payments. The next few months should be free for renters and mortgage payers.",
        "background": "Freeze all rent and mortgage payments to take the pressure off of individuals, families and productive businesses and support the real economy from the bottom up during this pandemic. This would be achieved by pausing the cycle of payments until after the crisis.",
