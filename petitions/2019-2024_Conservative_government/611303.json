        "action": "Have a price cap on heating oil, for those who can't get mains gas.",
        "additional_details": "About 4% of homes use oil central heating. These are mainly in small rural communities and villages who can't access mains gas. Typically, a storage tank holds 1000 litres, and companies who supply oil will only put in a minimum of 500 litres. Oil prices were between 30 & 50 pence per litre until early last year. Now they are over 110 pence a litre, meaning people have to shell out upwards of \u00a3600 as a one off payment. There is no protection for consumers and so oil costs have trebled in a year.",
        "background": "We want the government to institute a price cap for oil heating, as they have for gas and electricity, to protect people in rural settings and allow them to use heating and have hot water.",
