        "additional_details": "We would like the government to review assessment formats and establish a fair way to assess its students as a whole. After the previous academic year, it was found that the non-detriment policy helped students without giving them any great advantage.  \r\n\r\nThe current format of teaching is subpar and as such we believe it is disadvantageous to proceed with returning back to the normal way of assessing students. The situation with the virus has not improved enough to justify this change",
        "background": "With the current disruption caused by the pandemic and the way in which course material is being taught, it is believed that the current trajectory for assessments, within the university spectrum, will not include the non-detriment policy. This puts courses with lots of people at a disadvantage",
