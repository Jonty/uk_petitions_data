He has now gone on to do this documentary knowing fine well the palace will not say their side of the story. The whole reason he left the UK was to be out the limelight but instead he is cashing in on his total status and his life inside the palace. It is disrespectful to our country and therefore does not deserve to be Prince of the UK.",
