        "additional_details": "There are 6-7 million self-employed people in the UK, they do not know if they will have an income last May. Whilst some self-employed workers can work again now (such as tradesmen, and cab drivers), those in industries such as the arts, can\u2019t! This is unfair, and prejudicial. Those in the arts have had their industry virtually stopped dead, and they can not \u2018get back to work\u2019 whilst theatres, etc, remain closed. SEISS is essential to those it covers.",
        "background": "To provide a clear and immediate decision on whether the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme will be continued last May. Furlough schemes for PAYE employees have been extended to October, but no announcement has been made for the self-employed.",
