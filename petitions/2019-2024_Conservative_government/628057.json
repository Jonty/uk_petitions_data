        "additional_details": "It will allow for a fairer system in which people who live in a safe seat constituency like Louth & Horncastle can have more of a say in who their MP is. It will also allow for a more proportional system whilst keeping First-Past-The-Post. Because the USA have this system in place, we know it would work and will allow for higher political participation whilst also encouraging non-career politicians and local people to try get into office.",
