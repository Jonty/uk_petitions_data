        "additional_details": "There are many serious accidents involving vehicles knocking cyclists off of their bikes. If the cyclist is not wearing a helmet the rider can suffer life altering injuries or even worse death. Helmets could lessen injuries and even save someone from death and I feel it should be made law to wear one. My husband was recently hit by a car which did not stop. His helmet was destroyed, that could have been his head. Please act.",
        "background": "There are thousands of serious accidents each year involving cyclists being hit by cars causing serious injuries and death. Bringing in a law to make wearing a helmet compulsory would greatly lessen these numbers",
