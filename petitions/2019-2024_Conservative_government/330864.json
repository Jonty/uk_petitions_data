        "additional_details": "Myself and numerous other disabled people are not able to gain spaces near enough to where we need to get to.  It is very difficult to physically get to our destination as it is.  With perpetrators taking up spaces an already difficult journey can be made stressful.  It feels like a slap in the face for the disabled person that an abled bodied person is cheating the system and mis-using the badge. We need consistent enforcement of prosecutions to prevent these perpetrators from re-offending.",
        "background": "I wish to stop perpetrators that mis-use the Blue Badge to get parking priority when the disabled person is not present. I would like to see enforcement of the fine increase significantly. There are currently 2.29 million Blue Badges held and only 1,432 prosecutions between 2018-19.",
