        "additional_details": "A basic income policy would help boost the UK's post-pandemic economic recovery by quickly increasing demand without relying on the job market to recover beforehand, to get the economy moving, and reducing the impact of the loss of income, loss of jobs, and uncertain living costs, and would incentivise people to stay at home when in quarantine without worrying about needing to go into work in order to pay for bills and living costs. UBI would have a positive impact on mental health and wellbeing",
