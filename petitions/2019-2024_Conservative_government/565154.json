        "additional_details": "We would like you to consider this and give it to current sky or Freeview or BT etc customers \r\n\r\nBecause before lockdown stadiums were full and offered a day out to escape from everything and they also offered a sense of togetherness. With that still gone for Tier 3 and 4 populations Mental Health will decline. If you can keep Gyms open you can certainly use a little bit of Tax payer money to boost morale in this way",
        "background": "The government should work with Oliver Dowden and the Premier League along with TV companies where for those in Tiers 3 and 4 get free sport \r\n\r\nBecause fans can not go to the games and take their minds off the stresses of life. watching a game of football or an F1 race can offer an escape",
