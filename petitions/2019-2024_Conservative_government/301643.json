        "additional_details": "Devon is one of the areas worst hit by the coronavirus. Students have been anxious. Asian students suffer not only from the anxiety of the virus, but also racism. People are afraid to go out, to go to class.  Accommodations need to evict students to quarantine potential virus carriers. Some things had to be done. NHS has shown to be very unhelpful in face of the current crisis. Students with symptoms have had calls rejected and had to take taxis to the hospitals.",
        "background": "We would like to request for the Uni of Exeter to temporarily close and have online classes.  It would be best if date of examinations could be pushed forward slightly with the anxieties and the quarantines that are going on currently in Devon.",
