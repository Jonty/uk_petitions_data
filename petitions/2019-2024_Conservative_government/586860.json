Why can\u2019t we be reading \u201c130 children rescued from trafficking gang\u201d or \u201ccyber servers catch large quantities of peodophiles seized\u201d. The crimes focused on are all about money and drugs. We have real, sick, monsters in our world, that weirdly seem to stay under the radar. Let\u2019s prioritise funding to protect our children from torment and suffering.  This needs to change. Respect will be gained.",

Stop thinking about money, the general public are bored of seeing news of \u201cgangsters\u201d jailed and how much money and drugs have been seized. This isn\u2019t a series from Narcos, real children need our help in our country",
