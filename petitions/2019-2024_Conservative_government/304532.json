        "additional_details": "NHS staff are our front line of defence against this pandemic AND all other health challenges, all of which remain. \r\n\r\nWhy should we protect those who protect us? \r\nIt\u2019s not rocket science. Frontline staff are more likely to be exposed, and if infected likely to transmit to others while not symptomatic. The \u2018do-nothing\u2019 and carry on policy has likely meant tens of thousands more have been infected. There will be time for an inquiry later. Right now, help those who are helping us without question.",
        "background": "The government should immediately test frontline NHS staff as a priority and do so rapidly. Those who are symptomatic should be tested first and not simply told to come back to work after 7 days of self-isolation.",
