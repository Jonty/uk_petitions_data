        "additional_details": "We\u2019re calling on the government to implement a complete cancellation of student debt to relieve the burden on graduates and kickstart the UK economy. The level of student debt has now reached more than \u00a3150 billion, with that number only set to increase. The increasing levels of public and individual student debt is clearly unsustainable and is not fair to students or taxpayers. Forgiving past student debt would encourage more people to go to university whilst helping those with large debts.",
        "background": "Student debt has placed a huge burden on university students and graduates across England and Wales. The average full-time tuition fee is now \u00a39,250 per year whilst maintenance grants have also been cut. The result has been that university graduates now have an average of \u00a350,000 in student debt.",

Your petition states that cancelling past debts would encourage more people to go to university, but it's not clear how if they would still have to take out loans themselves.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
