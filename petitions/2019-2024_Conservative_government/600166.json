According to the Priory - Between 1.25 and 3.4 million people in the UK are affected by an eating disorder. I believe that sizing clothes correctly and universally would be a positive change and progress in combatting the eating disorder epidemic. Being in recovery myself I know first hand how difficult getting dressed can be. Help us make it a little easier.",
