        "additional_details": "OFQUAL should cancel A-Levels and give Centre Assessed Grades. March saw A-Level examinations being canceled, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the dreaded algorithm scuppered a percentage of students; we believe that by canceling the examinations now, the Government can devise a much better system, that is fair for all students. Whilst keeping the option of Centre Assessed Grades open.\r\n\r\nIt's not fair that Welsh and Scottish students are given a 'free pass' into English universities.",
        "background": "The Government announced reforms to 2021 examinations are not sufficient, consequently, they are not viable.\r\n\r\nWe call to cancel A-Level Examinations for the Summer Series of 2021. With the Welsh Government canceling their A-Levels, 10/11/2020, and the Scottish equivalent canceled on 08/12/2020.",
