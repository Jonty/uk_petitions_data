        "additional_details": "People are frustrated by the party political sytem and the state of political discourse and conduct.  Parties imply that poor turnout is due to voter apathy.  However, voter disengagement also occurs \r\nwhen Party manifesto's do not reflect voter's concerns and priorities.  The current system leaves many people feeling they do not have a voice. A facility to register an abstention will record the level of disatisfaction with the political parties, increase voter participation and drive change.",
        "background": "Include a line at the end of all ballot papers to register a vote for \"None of the Above\" in order that people can formally register disatisfaction with the political offerings and that the level of disatisfaction can be properly recorded.",
