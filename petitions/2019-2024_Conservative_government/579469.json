        "action": "legalisation of pepper spray as a form of self defence.",
        "additional_details": "As a young woman all my life I have been told ways to avoid being a victim but it\u2019s not enough. Something has to be done about the amount of sexual assaults and attacks across our country. Something as simple as walking home alone has always been extremely scary but now the problem is increasing. I strongly believe the legalisation could save lives, protect people from attackers who over power their victims. Give people the leverage they need to get away from these situations and to safety.",
        "background": "I want to change the law so that it is legal to carry pepper spray as a form of self defence. This would give victims of horrific crimes to to fight back before they became victims. Legalisation would mean many people across the UK to feel protected doing simple tasks like walking home.",
