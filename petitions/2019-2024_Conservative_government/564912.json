        "additional_details": "The Erasmus scheme is an exchange programme providing students (EU and non-EU members) with freedom of travel to study abroad at the participating institutions without having to pay tuition fees abroad. Other benefits included grants to help with living costs, as well as funding support for students with physical, mental, or health-related conditions. Educational opportunities are investments not expenses. Currently underprivileged students are missing out as the Turing scheme is not in place.",
        "background": "Re-join the Erasmus scheme for the 2021-2027 period / until the Turing scheme is in place with over 27 participating countries. Recognition that the Turing Scheme is not a sufficient replacement for Erasmus until this is achieved. For many students this was their only chance of funding an exchange.",
