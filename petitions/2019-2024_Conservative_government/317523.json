        "additional_details": "With many people in great suffering and in need of medications, such as morphine, it is a tragedy on so many levels that care homes may have stocks of much needed drugs they cannot use because they were prescribed to people now dead. In such a crisis as the present one allowing care homes to use these otherwise wasted drugs should do something to lighten the immense burden of care home staff.",
        "background": "The Government should pass an emergency regulation that would allow care homes to use drugs like morphine that have been prescribed to people who have since passed away. It is a waste for drugs, which may be sorely needed, to be unable to be used for those in desperate need of them.",
