        "additional_details": "For too long racists have been able to use internet platforms to abuse our great sports people. They are able to do this anonymously and without punishment. The government need to step in and make it so they can\u2019t hide and get away with it. There should be harsh penalties for this kind of abuse, life bans from all social media, life bans from all sporting events and possibly a custodial sentence for the most severe cases/repeat offenders.",
        "background": "After more online abuse directed towards some England players, the punishment for doing it needs to be made harsher. These people need to be tracked down and prosecuted, preferably receiving a custodial sentence.",
