In any case, we can't accept petitions that call for action at a local level. We also can't accept petitions when we already have a petition about a very similar issue. This is because you are more likely to get action on this issue if you sign and share a single petition.\r\n\r\nYou may wish to sign this petition: \r\n\r\nBad owners are to blame not the breed - don't ban the XL bully: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/643611\r\n\r\nSince you started this petition the Scottish Government has announced that it will introduce a ban.
