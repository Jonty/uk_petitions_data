        "additional_details": "Local and independantly funded pubs relied on the takeaway sale of alcohol as a means of income during the first lockdown, the new rule means that the pubs that have struggled to stay open throughout - apart from that time when the government told everyone to go to the pubs - will now have to close down completely again. This will cause many businesses to close for good coming into what should be the busiest season for the hospitality industry.",
