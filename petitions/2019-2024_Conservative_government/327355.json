        "additional_details": "It is understandable that large weddings that would involve a lot of people should not be able to go ahead at this time, but to have an outright ban on weddings is wholly unfair, especially as non essential businesses are now able to re-open. \r\nYou only need 5 people in order to get married - the couple, two witnesses & the registrar, and so long as this can be socially distanced, then these ceremonies should be allowed to go ahead.",
        "background": "Currently no wedding ceremonies are being allowed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This made sense at the beginning, when all non essential services were being stopped; however now that non essential businesses are being allowed to reopen, small wedding ceremonies should be allowed to go ahead.",
