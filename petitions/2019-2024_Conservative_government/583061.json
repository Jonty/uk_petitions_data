        "additional_details": "The government has halted in-person teaching for almost the entire academic year which has directly reduced the quality of learning. Online learning is not equal to face to face teaching so many students have lost out on learning, debating, placements and experience whilst incurring huge amounts of debt for their courses and living. Keeping universities close makes no sense within the framework of the PM's roadmap. It is grossly unfair and illogical to force closure, cut quality and demand money",
        "background": "Fund universities to give substantial tuition fee refund/cut for all students that have had <20 hours of in-person teaching for the academic year of 2020-21.\r\nAlso, the government must permit the reopening of universities for in-person teaching for all courses from the 19th of April.",
