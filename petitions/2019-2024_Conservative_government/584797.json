        "additional_details": "During court cases victims of sexual crimes are torn apart my defence lawyers and the whole justice system. Bullied and embarrassed in front of and entire room of people. No victim wants to be treated this way after going through what they already have. I want the government to change the way they treat victims of sexual violence and help remove the stigma around reporting it. Many people victim blame and when the courts find the accused innocent it can ruin the life of a victim.",
        "background": "Victims of sexual violence are not given enough justice. I demand that victims are treated better during the whole period of their case. I want to make sure that they are treated with more respect in court. Victims should be offered support during and after their case, regardless of the outcome.",

Conduct in court is a matter for the judiciary, not the Government or House of Commons.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, we could accept a petition calling on the Government to fund a service to support victims of sexual offences through the courts process.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nIncrease minimum and maximum sentences for all sexual offences: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/577443\r\n\r\nMake the minimum penalty for all sexual offences imprisonment: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/579986\r\n\r\nPublic inquiry into the drop in prosecutions for rape and other sexual offences: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/580587"
