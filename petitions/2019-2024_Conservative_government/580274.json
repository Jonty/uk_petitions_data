        "additional_details": "The Government has openly and actively lent its support to our key workers through public speeches, national addresses or by organising weekly claps. We have a responsibility to do more. Normality will return in the near future in some capacity but the sacrifices of our key frontline workers must never be forgotten. I urge the UK Government to dedicate at least one national day a year to our key workers so that we can appreciate and always remember their selfless services to the British people.",
        "background": "The Government must recognise the efforts, sacrifices and perseverance of the UK\u2019s key workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. These critical workers have had no respite and yet, they continue to serve the British people with dedication and integrity, putting the welfare of others before their own.",
