        "additional_details": "I believe it should be stopped from going ahead as it may increase calorie counting, which is harmful behaviour for those struggling with an eating disorder, and it may also just take the joy out of going out for a meal. 25% of people that calorie count go on to develop an eating disorder, and by making calories available to the public, cases of eating disorders will rise.",
        "background": "With the government announcing the plan to label calories on menus and food labels from April 2022, I believe that we should look at alternative roots for tackling obesity. \r\nCalories should not be included on menus and instead there should be an alternative menu available if you want it.",
