        "additional_details": "The government need to see our right to protest and use our voices to ask for change. Trying to take away our right to protest is silencing us from expressing our opinions on important issues that we deserve to share. Instead the government should put in measures so the police can work with protests to make them as safe as possible while allowing them to go ahead.",
        "background": "Protests are part of our human right and democracy. Giving police more powers to tackle peaceful protests is only going to cause more harm than good. In most cases police tackling protests have caused much more violence and disruption than when people have been allowed to peacefully protest",
