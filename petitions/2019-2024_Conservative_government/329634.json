        "additional_details": "For too long the civilians of Yemen have suffered at the hands of the Saudi government, using weapons provided by the U.K. government, whilst the U.K. is also a part of the coalition. The U.K. is Saudis largest arms dealer, and this is causing the loss of thousands of innocent men, women and children\u2019s lives. The coalition is nothing but a way for Saudi to put other Middle Eastern countries down. Saudi must be held accountable for what it has done and the government the power to do so.",
