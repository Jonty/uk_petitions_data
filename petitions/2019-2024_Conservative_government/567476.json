They have had nearly all of their education moved online where support for assignments and projects cannot be provided the same way and the mental health effect from this pandemic has affected many students\u2019 grades. \r\n\r\nAs the online learning is due to continue until nearly the end of this academic year minimum, we should not be paying the full amount for a degree that is now forcefully restricted by the government",
