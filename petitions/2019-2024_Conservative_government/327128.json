        "additional_details": "Too many times i have seen parents being stopped from having contact with their children because the other parent wants to play god with the child. The impact this has on your mental and physical health is ridiculous yet the perpetrator of this problem doesnt ever get held liable for the impact this action has on the child and the parent. I want the government to send people who stop children seeing their parents to go to prison or face fines and community service and have a criminal record.",
        "background": "There needs to be a law that stops parents using children as weapons and stopping their children seeing their other parent. It is against the childs human rights and they should not be overlooked at all unless there is a significant risk to the child with that parent",
