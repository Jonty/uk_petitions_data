        "additional_details": "I want to see this reversed and I would like to see a discount if you pay at the post office!  On top of that, I want to see a return of road tax stamps. Under that system, you could buy a \u00a35 stamp whenever you wanted to, and over a year spread out the cost of paying your road tax. When it was due you could hand over your savings stamps and pay the difference. In the long run this will save many post offices from closure, save jobs, and increase revenue brought in by taxation.",
        "background": "From April 2024 people will no longer be able to pay for their road tax at a post office. This is wrong. Our post offices are essential for our communities. However this discriminates against the elderly or disabled who may not be able to do this online & we will all be elderly one day!",
