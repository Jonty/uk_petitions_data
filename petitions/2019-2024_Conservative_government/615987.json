        "additional_details": "Recently, the price of energy and fuel has sharply risen and this ineffective, useless Government has made attempts to cut the costs but have failed. It is not rocket science to know that higher bills means more people dropping below the poverty line and more people coming to the poverty line. We hope that this government can stop being selfish just once and think about everyone in this country.",
        "background": "We want the government to cut the cost of fuel and energy so those less fortunate can stay above the poverty line whilst heating their homes, filling up their car to get to work or even charging their car if their car is electric. This government has tried to do this before but it has not helped!",
