        "additional_details": "Studios that cater for dance, pole fitness, aerial arts, yoga and Pilates are predominantly attended and owned by women. \r\nGyms can be intimidating and many women do not feel safe or comfortable to exercise in these settings.\r\nThe decision to ban activities in Tier 3 affects 1000\u2019s of businesses and the inability to keep mentally and physically well.\r\nThis is an equality issue. Classes are reduced in numbers, pre booked and monitored carefully, attendance control is safer than random gym visits.",
        "background": "Many fitness industry businesses run solely on class environments with Covid compliant rules in place. We are allowed to open under gyms but the entire business is viable through class instruction.\r\nWe need to be able to run socially distanced and covid compliant classes in Tier 3.",
