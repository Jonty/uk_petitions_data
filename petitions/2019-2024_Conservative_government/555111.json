        "additional_details": "The CMA has currently given guidelines which state that 100% refunds should be given to consumers where services could not be provided due to the pandemic, however majority of wedding suppliers are refusing or ignoring refund requests. Thousands of couples in the UK are now facing extreme stress and a long winded battle of trying to get their hard earned money back. This is also greatly affecting their mental health and extremely debilitating to their financial situation. We need your help.",
        "background": "Couples save up for years for their big day and to lose it all due to a pandemic that no one could have predicted is really unfair and detrimental to their financial situation and mental health. Covid has already affected us all mentally and financially without the stress of losing more money.",
