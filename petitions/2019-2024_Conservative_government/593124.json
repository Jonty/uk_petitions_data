Ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister.\"\r\nThe Prime Minister should be the epitome of correct Parliamentary behaviour, and the very last person to be seen to be above the law. Currently Mr Johnson falls far short of these standards.",

Currently the Prime Minister has multiple outstanding corrections to address, and there is no evidence of him attempting to make corrections or expressing any willingness to do so.",
