        "action": "Cancel plans to reduce the number of Welsh MPs.",
        "additional_details": "The plans to reduce the number of Welsh MPs by nearly a quarter are divisive and unfair. The plans, which were initially intended for all UK constituent countries, will now only take place in Wales. Such action will negatively affect Welsh representation in the House of Commons, while boosting English representation, since the proposed removed Welsh seats will be added to England's seat total. This change will politically marginalise both Wales and the Welsh people. This action must be halted.",
        "background": "The Government must cancel these proposed changes to the parliamentary structure, ahead of the 2024 General Elections, and maintain the status quo of constituency boundaries in Wales.",
