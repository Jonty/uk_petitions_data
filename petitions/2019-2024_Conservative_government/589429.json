        "additional_details": "I write on behalf of thousands, if not millions of families. \r\n\r\nParliament are the only people with the power to truly protect tenants and the children who may live with them. We do not want to say that we live in a country that allows children to be thrown out onto the street because their parents are being evicted for no reason. There has to be at least a valid reason, arrears or anti social behaviour, not just because the landlord wants to sell or make repairs.\r\n\r\nPlease, don't let this be the reputation of our country.",
        "background": "A Section 21 has been recognised as an unfair/unlawful eviction, why does there even need to be a petition? \r\n\r\nIt is costing the Government too much money to rehouse the homeless and it is devastating the mental health of young children as well as their parents.",

Your petition refers to Section 21, and assume this is referring to the Housing Act 1988, but your petition goes on to say this has been recognised as an unfair/unlawful eviction, and it's not clear what you mean by this.\r\n\r\nSection 21 of the Housing Act enables landlords to evict a tenant after the fixed term of a tenancy, or during a tenancy with no fixed end date. You can find out more about this here: https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants/section-21-and-section-8-notices\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
