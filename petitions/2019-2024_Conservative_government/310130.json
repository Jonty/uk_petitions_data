        "additional_details": "Our current situation consists of airlines whom continue to sell flights at extortionate prices that have zero chance of going ahead. They refuse to provide refunds to their customers, who spent their last penny for their non-complete services. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019re asking our government to step in. Some of us have no more money to pay for these flights, some of us are days away from running out of life saving medication. Our situations range from urgent, to critical, to life threatening. \r\n\r\nWe are desperate.",
        "background": "We ask that The U.K. Government urgently begin to take measures to assist the thousands of travelers currently stranded in other countries, unsupported and unable to find safe passage home. Wasting no time in collaborating with the Ministry of Defence to coordinate chartered flights back to the U.K.",
