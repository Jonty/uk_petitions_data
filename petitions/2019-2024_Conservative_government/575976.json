We believe this affects their fundamental human rights as some of them may have sustained injuries or raised families here, and being made to leave the country could mean access to less good health services, and ending up losing their lives and families.",

The Government should either scrap these fees or at the very least give a 50% discount in recognition of their service to this country.",
