        "action": "Urge the UN and the South African Government to stop the riots and protests",
        "additional_details": "Request formally that the SA government stop the protests, provide food or supplies as there is currently nothing in the supermarkets. Families are going without food because of the fear. Request the UN to intervene for the fundamental breach of human rights, namely, right to life, torture of civilians, right to a private and family life; all of which have been violated due to the barbaric riots. Please intervene and send in help to protect the masses",

Whilst the country is in disarray, with COVID-19 cases rising, supermarkets and shops are being looted and civilians are losing their lives.",
