        "additional_details": "There are so many positives about e-scooters, such as low-to-no carbon emissions, less clutter on roads, generally far less costs, easier to manage than cars to an extent, and all round have practically no issues with educated riders. Most people want to push for rules such as \u2018Rideable in roads and bike lanes, riders have to be 16+\u2019 etc. The same rules with rental scooters can apply. Within this 3 year period, a community has risen, and the UK has shown to be behind within the e-scooter rules.",
        "background": "The government has been putting off legalising E-Scooters for almost 2 years, limiting them to rental scooters such as VOI. We ask the government to please speed up this process and allow them.",
