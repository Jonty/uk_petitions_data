        "additional_details": "There is far too much of this happening just one look on social media and you\u2019ll see the amount of sexual harassment present. Women don\u2019t feel safe anymore in daylight or night. Enough is enough. How many more women need to be sexually harassed in the form of catcalling before it is taken seriously? Women should not have to live in fear over unwanted sexual advances thrown their way. Women shouldn\u2019t have to feel anxious about what clothes we wear because of the vulgar comments that we may face",
        "background": "I and many women like me have been subjected to unwanted and vulgar sexual harassment when just walking home in broad daylight. There is nothing at the moment that is working to stop this problem but a jail sentence would keep these obscene people off the streets allowing women to feel safe again.",
