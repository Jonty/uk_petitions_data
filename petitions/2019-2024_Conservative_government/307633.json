She could barely speak and definitely could not drive. She had just finished an 18 hour shift and was overwhelmed with tiredness. She went to the shop to buy something to eat on her break and simply wasn't able to buy anything due to others stockpiling throughout the day. We need to look after our NHS - without them, there is no us!!!",
        "background": "Bring in emergency action immediately and urgently for supermarkets to provide more flexible dedicated shopping hours for NHS staff and vulnerable groups. The current 1 hour slots twice or 3 times a week are simply not helpful for staff who work during these hours and they are not benefitting.",
