It is unfair to those who have been so careful to stay safe to put them at risk by us coming into contact with patients who don\u2019t have a mask, it will increase the chance of us passing it on to our next patient. We need to maintain the current infection controls and mask wear to protect us and all of our patients and to remain accessible to everyone",
        "background": "With Freedom day approaching, mask wear should still be mandatory in ALL NHS settings for patients and staff. Including Optical dental and care settings. By making mask wear a choice healthcare will become difficult to the most vulnerable",
