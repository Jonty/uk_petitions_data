        "additional_details": "The Chancellor has made considerable support available to those that are established self employed workers through the 80% scheme and this is very admirable. The newer self employed are at considerable risk. Newer self employed workers will have put any spare money in to their business to get them started and they are now being treated differently to those that happen to have been doing the job longer. Dear Chancellor, Do whatever it takes to make this fair for all the self employed.",
        "background": "Newer members of the self employed community have their current year's accounts and these can be used to calculate their entitlement under the scheme. This happens in other government departments such as HMCTS.\r\nInclude the newer members of the self employed within the 80% financial support scheme.",
