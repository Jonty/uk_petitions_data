        "additional_details": "Obviously with an overstretched NHS still dealing with a pandemic the timing might not be ideal but I think there is a strong case at least for some clinical trials into the effects of spray tans on mental health. Antidepressants do seem to work but are not without  side effects. Talking therapies are far less efective but the point is that this 'two sizes fits all' aproach is clearly flawed and alternatives need to be considered.",
        "background": "The government gives lip service to mental health but doctors just proscribe antidepressants or talking therapies. Spray tans make clients look better and therefore feel better about themselves and if that is not what is needed for some people suffering from depression then I don\u2019t know what is.",
