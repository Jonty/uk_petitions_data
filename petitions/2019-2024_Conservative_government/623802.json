        "additional_details": "The government has introduced a \"mini-budget\" (or fiscal event) containing swathes of tax cuts, adjustments to benefits and other legislative changes. Introducing such measures in this way means there has been no forecast from the OBR to assess the consequences and no chance for proper parliamentary scrutiny of such plans. This has drastically devalued the pound, caused turmoil in the markets and produced an even poorer outlook for already rising inequality.",
        "background": "The government must scrap and reverse the latest \"mini-budget\" (fiscal event). It should produce a proper budget with OBR forecast and scrutiny from both chambers to ensure that it will not damage the economy, devalue the currency and drive inequality such as the current plans have begun to.",
