        "additional_details": "I was born with spina bifida and have missed out so many things in life due to lack of mobility. Growing up, things never used to get to me but now that I have a son, missing out on special moments like a full experience of being at the beach with him, my family and friends is very upsetting. It disheartens me to see so many others with mobility issues miss out on these special moments too and I feel building footpaths on uk beaches to the sea isn't too much to ask.",
        "background": "We need accessible footpaths on all UK beaches leading to the sea. Myself and many other people with mobility issues miss out on so many special moments in life due to lack of accessibility. It saddens me to see so many like myself missing out on the full beach experience due to lack of footpaths.",
