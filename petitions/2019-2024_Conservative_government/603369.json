        "additional_details": "I feel that the government need to help the younger generation to support those who might be part of the LGBT+ community. This would allow those who have heard horrific stories to know that they will be welcomed and supported. \r\n\r\nAs I have seen that when something is different about someone which they did not know of or accept, they challenge that of which another person wishes to become. If more children are aware of these meanings, then they will support those who come out.",
        "background": "Children in primary school of the age 10 and above should be made aware of the LGBT+ community and what it means to be part of that community. This will make those who are questioning their sexually while going through their teen years feel more safe to talk about it and not afraid to be judged.",

It is therefore not clear what it is you would like the Government to do that it is not already doing.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/908013/Relationships_Education__Relationships_and_Sex_Education__RSE__and_Health_Education.pdf\r\n\r\nIf there is a specific change you would like the Government to make to the Relationships Education curriculum, you could start a petition about that."
