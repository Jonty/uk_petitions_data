However, the STRB accepts informed evidence when consulting on its proposed advice on teacher pay, including from the Government, so it's not the case that the Government 'dictates' what the STRB can recommend. We're therefore not sure what it is you'd like the Government to change about how the STRB operates.\r\n\r\nYou could have a petition calling for STRB recommendations to be legally binding, if that is something you'd like to see happen."
