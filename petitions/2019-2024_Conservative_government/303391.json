        "additional_details": "Since Boris Johnson was a mayor he always promoted amnesty for illegal immigrants. Most people assume it will put a bill on UK taxpayers but that's not the case. 10 years is a fair time to get used to the British culture and make a life in the country and amnesty should be introduced at a cost to applicants\r\nHundreds of illegal immigrants could be staying in their homes rather than seeking medical help due to their status and worrying about getting deported.\r\nStop spreading the virus is vital at the moment and inhuman living conditions may make things worse and will spread the virus to others",
