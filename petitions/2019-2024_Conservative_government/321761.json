Climate change, through food insecurity, water scarcity, climate refugees etc., will create similar but larger crises in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe previous economic system guaranteed an increase in global temperatures to well above 2\u00b0C. Scientists show +2\u00b0C is the last point of safety.\r\n\r\nCOVID-19 shows we can make huge economic & social changes in times of crisis, but the bigger, climate crisis is still ahead. We must change path now.",
