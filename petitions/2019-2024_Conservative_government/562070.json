        "additional_details": "Lancaster\u2019s Covid infection rates are only 102 cases per 100,000 people currently, the average in England is according to the data 165. Yet Lancaster has been included as Tier 3 together with the rest of Lancashire in the latest announcement. The data clearly exists to be more targeted than the government is currently being, which cannot be right or appropriate to the good people of Lancaster and the surrounding areas. Lancaster deserves to be removed from Tier 3 restrictions immediately.",
        "background": "I want them to change their minds about the restrictions around the Lancaster area they announced on the 26th November.",
