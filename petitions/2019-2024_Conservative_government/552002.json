        "additional_details": "In the words of Ruth Bader Ginsberg \u201cWomen belong in all places where decisions are being made.\" And this is never more true than on the subject of climate change, where women throughout the world are among those worst hit by climate breakdown.\r\n\r\nUN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres recently stated that gender equality (UN SDG5), is the prerequisite for a better world, and yet the government is demonstrating a flagrant disregard for it, with the choice of a male-only senior team at COP26.",
        "background": "Yesterday's article in the Guardian, states that all senior politicians, civil servants and negotiators to represent Britain at next year\u2019s COP26 talks are men. We want the government to change the line-up, so that the UK top team includes both male and female representatives.",
