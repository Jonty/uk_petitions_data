        "additional_details": "Year after year after year, Greek people and celebrities ask for the marbles to be returned. \r\n\r\nThe U.K. government had said that they would give us the marbles back if we had a new, better suited museum to store them in. This, in Greece now we have a new Acropolis museum. \r\n\r\nThey were given to the U.K. unlawfully and the British Museum is still storing them under false pretences (to save them from pollution). \r\n\r\nThey are part of our history and culture and all of us (Greek people) want them back.",
        "background": "Those marbles were stolen from The Parthenon in Athens, when Greece was under the Turkish occupation and the Turkish leader gave permission to Lord Elgin to take them. Unlawful. The British Museum says they store them to avoid them being affected by pollution. London has more pollution than Athens.",
