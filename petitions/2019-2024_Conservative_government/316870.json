        "additional_details": "We need to ensure that the businesses that need it most are included and can apply for the Small Business Grant. Nearly all businesses in Serviced Offices are in there because of their size or the turnover of their businesses meaning they cannot commit to a bigger office. By definition these are the small businesses that need it most, with rent being one of their biggest costs. Serviced offices are empty but that rent is still due, this grant will help ensure the survival of these businesses.",
        "background": "The Government has arranged for small business grants of \u00a310k for businesses that already get small business rate relief. This unfortunately misses a lot of tenants in serviced offices and small businesses that have been waiting for the valuation office to correctly register/update their details.",
