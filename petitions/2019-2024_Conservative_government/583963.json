Some require to take the tube or overground trains. So for the parents of those children to be penalised and have to pay for travel I believe is totally unfair.\r\nChildren and parents have suffered enough with school closures, parents income being cut or being furloughed. The govt should be supporting families not causing more financially hardship.",
