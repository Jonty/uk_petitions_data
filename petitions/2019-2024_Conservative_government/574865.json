        "background": "Either:\r\n\r\n- Ensure asthmatics who are classed as moderate risk, and already receive the yearly flu jab, are included in Group 6 for the first phase of the rollout\r\n- Alternatively commit to offering the vaccine to this group during the first group of the second phase.",
