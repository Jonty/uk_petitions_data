        "additional_details": "The Government must increase SSP, if only temporarily, to support workers who do not benefit from a company sick pay scheme and to give much needed help to the self-employed. Apparently there is a blank cheque from the Government to help workers and businesses through this crisis, so lets do this now.",
        "background": "During the Coronavirus lots of workers will only receive \u00a394 per week, whilst some workers will receive 80% of their wages if they are furloughed by their employer. I have to self isolate for 3 months because of my health condition and I will only receive \u00a394 instead of \u00a3320. How is this fair.",
