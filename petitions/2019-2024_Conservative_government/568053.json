        "additional_details": "Simply making students do mock exams brings forward a large amount of pressure as they desperately struggle to fit the infomation necessary in. As these students do not have any GCSEs these \"mocks\" act as such , and so carry the same tension as real exams. Why are we issuing \"mock exams\" for exams that arent even going ahead. Furthermore some students cannot be expected to partake in such stressful events as they may have lost family members and are grieving.",
        "background": "A large majority of students feel that going forward with the mock exams planned for 2021 would not only endanger their families and personal health but also negatively impact mental health as well as prooving entirely pointless.",
