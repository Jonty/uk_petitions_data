We understand that you want private candidates, such as home-schooled children, to be given A-level grades however you don't specify how you think this should happen. \r\n\r\nAs happens in normal times, private candidates wanting to be considered for a GCSE or A-level have to register with an assessment centre. These centres have been given guidance on what evidence they can consider, in the absence of exam results, when calculating grades for private candidates.\r\n\r\nYou could start a petition calling for a review of how private candidates' education is assessed and how their university prospects are being affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, if that is something you would like to happen."
