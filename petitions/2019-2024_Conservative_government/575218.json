They are prioritised due to significantly increased risk of respiratory complications if infected with the flu and should therefore have priority to the vaccine. By the government's own definitions they are clinically vulnerable and at significantly higher risk than the general population, as such, they should be vaccinated as a priority group not with the rest of the population, which is sadly where many of the people in this group have been placed.",
