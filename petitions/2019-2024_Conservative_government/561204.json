        "background": "MP's have had 8 pay rises in the last 10 years. Now they are talking about raising taxes in the UK and putting a cap on people's pay rises in order to pay for the COVID crisis. MP's should have their pay reduced before implementing any UK tax rises or salary caps for citizens of the UK.",
