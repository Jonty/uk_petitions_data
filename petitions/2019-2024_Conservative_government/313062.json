        "additional_details": "It is through plants that children gain essential learning whilst at home. Nature soothes us, we need this during a lockdown that isolates us from our family and friends.\r\n \r\nHalf a billion pre grown plants for this spring valued at \u00a3250 million will perish. Without garden centres to take them they will be dumped on huge compost pile. These independent growers employ 45,000 people, an entire sector will be decimated, leaving us reliant on imported plants from Europe.",
        "background": "Garden Centres are allowed to sell food & pet care, but not plants? 66 million UK citizens are in lockdown, if we can spend less time on phones & tablets and more in our gardens with nature, growing fruit, veg & flowers its a proven therapy for mental health & wellbeing so reduces strain on the NHS.",
