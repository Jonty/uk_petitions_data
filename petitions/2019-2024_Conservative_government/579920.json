        "additional_details": "The police have the appropriate powers to punish wrongdoing, be it during a protest or elsewhere. Peaceful protest is fundamental to freedom of expression in a democracy such as ours, allowing citizens to have their voices heard in the space between elections.\r\n\r\nProtest is designed to cause 'annoyance' by making those it is directed to feel pressure from the protesting group. Therefore, this bill can, in effect, criminalise any protest that the government or police would like stopped.",
        "background": "The right to protest peacefully is an important one for the civil liberties of UK citizens. The bill criminalises protests which cause \"serious annoyance\" with a punishment of up to 10 years in prison. This is a flagrant abuse of our rights and such language should be removed from the bill.",
