        "action": "Stop breaching civil liberties due to Covid, protect the old and vulnerable.",
        "additional_details": "Current laws to slow the spread of Covid are disproportionate to the risk, poorly targeted and causing massive damage to our economy, long term health and social cohesion. It is illogical to cause financial and health suffering to the majority to protect the few, when the many could be going about their lives normally to create the means to protect the old and vulnerable. The young and fit should be allowed to create the wealth that will pay for the old and vulnerable to be looked after.",
        "background": "Remove all current infringements of civil liberties including restrictions on gatherings, the need to wear face coverings, curfews and business closures, whilst and the same time providing dramatically increased support to allow the old and vulnerable to shield if they feel they want to.",
