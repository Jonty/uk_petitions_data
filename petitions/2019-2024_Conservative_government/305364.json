        "action": "Require universities to reimburse lost tuition fees due to COVID-19",
        "additional_details": "A university charges a tuition fee that goes towards education and general facilities at the university, including: exams, societies and lectures. On top of this, there have been 4 weeks of strikes preceding COVID-19 and we as students feel that nearly a total term of university has not been available to us. With tuition fees being so expensive, we believe that we should be reimbursed for the loss of time and help that a university normally provides.",
        "background": "This year's outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in universities across the UK closing very suddenly. Although shutting for good reason, they stop students from learning effectively since all contact hours have been cancelled.",
