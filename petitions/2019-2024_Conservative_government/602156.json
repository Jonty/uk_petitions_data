        "additional_details": "Costs of hotel quarantines are incredibly expensive, especially after saving for years to try reunite with family members. It\u2019s not only a financial burden on many but creates a problem for those who would like to return to their place of UK residency. The hardship agreement, which should assist with these fees, is granted based on necessity but is near impossible to be granted. If the hotel quarantine is scrapped for nationals, we would be able to quarantine at home without a financial burden.",
        "background": "We need the Government to Stop the hotel quarantining for British/Irish/EU settlement nationals. We don\u2019t want to pay the exorbitant hotel quarantine fees and feel that we should be able to self isolate in our homes, especially when tested negative on a fit to fly PCR test.",
