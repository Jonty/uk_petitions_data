        "background": "We request the UK Government to keep sanctions on the Russian economy and hierarchy until Russia agrees to:\r\nRemove troops from all Ukrainian territories\r\nRemove all unexploded munitions from Ukraine.\r\nMake full reparation to rebuild the Ukraine\u2019s infrastructure and compensate the people.",
