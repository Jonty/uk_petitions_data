        "additional_details": "I can see no reason why Robert Jenrick MP requested the child friendly cartoons be painted over - except to deprive traumatised children, of a warm setting to help ease their very real fears. He does not represent the majority of the UK who are disgusted and ashamed by this cruel act against innocent children. During the 2nd world war the UK welcomed refugee children into our homes, this government is turning its back on them. Please have a heart and reinstate the murals. Thank you.",
        "background": "The Kent intake unit (KIU) is a reception centre for unaccompanied child asylum seekers. These are vulnerable children who would have been without the family and displaced from their country due to war, famine, climate disasters or economic hardship.",
