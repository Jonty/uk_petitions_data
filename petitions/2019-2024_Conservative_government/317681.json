        "additional_details": "COVID-19 has highlighted the fragility of our society and economy.  Security and stability of the UK is paramount and the Universal Basic Income provides a strong solid foundation.\r\nThe Personal Allowance of \u00a312,500 in 2020-21 should become the new gross Universal Basic Income.\r\nUBI can be taken as income and taxed @ 20% or given as a new defined benefit state pension contribution. In the process, the administration burden of the current Universal Credit & Basic State Pension would be eliminated.",
        "background": "The government should implement a Universal Basic Income to ensure minimum living standards for all UK residents that covers their entire life.  Thus, providing individual welfare and security to support the community, society and the economy through both personal and national crisis e.g. COVID-19.",
