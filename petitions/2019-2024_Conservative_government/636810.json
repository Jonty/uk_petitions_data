        "additional_details": "This guidance could lead to the immense harm of children across the UK, who already have a 92% rate of considering suicide and 45% attempting it (Mermaids 2021). While it may have been proposed from a place of concern, children could be ostracized, kicked out or come to greater harm if exposed when choosing to remain secretive surrounding information that could lead to their endangerment if shared or even if they are suspected of being transgender by school staff and  great caution is not taken.",
        "background": "The guidance proposed by the conservative party in the UK requiring schools to inform parents if their child exhibits \"signs\" of identifying as transgender should not be put forward into schools nor any such guidance requiring the exposure of minors to possibly unaccepting homes.",
