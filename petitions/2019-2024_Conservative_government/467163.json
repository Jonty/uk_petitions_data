        "action": "Make sanitary products for women free.",
        "additional_details": "The government should allow these products to be free as these are essential for young women to access especially if they're from a poorer background and they only live with one parent and they're under the legal age to work which is pretty common in Britain. Furthermore women don't ask for periods. Women can't help bleeding each month and these products cost up to 3 pounds doesn't seem like much but it adds up. Children as young as 8-14 get there period and struggle to afford them.",
        "background": "Sanitary products should be made free for all women. it isn't considered that children as young as 8 are able to get their period so I'd like the government to use money to make these products free the government receives so much money so having these easily accessible is an essential.",
