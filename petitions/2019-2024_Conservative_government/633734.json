        "additional_details": "From personal experience, local news and student responses, it has come to my attention that this is a significant problem facing students in the UK. While most schools allow students with bladder problems to use the toilet facilities at any time, Students with mild, recently developed or disease-related bladder problems are expected to wait until the end of lesson time, and face punishment if they walk out of class.",
        "background": "Make it a baseline to allow toilet use at any time within school environments, unless a student usually uses the time to slack off. Following significant backlash, this has become a much more prevalent issue locally- I began a local petition and garnered heavy support from around the school.",
