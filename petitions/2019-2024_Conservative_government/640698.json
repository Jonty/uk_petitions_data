        "additional_details": "As a wheelchair user I find that it is currently already difficult to travel, despite having assistance from a carer. Closing ticket offices and removing staff would make journeys even more difficult, stressful and anxiety-inducing. Many of my acquaintances who are older express concerns of digital tickets as they do not feel comfortable with this and believe it would make travelling using the railway difficult and stressful. I also believe that saving the careers of railway staff is important.",
        "background": "I would like for railway offices to remain open for customers to purchase tickets and to keep them staffed with regular staff in order to allow all people to travel and purchase tickets comfortably, with assistance and safely.",
