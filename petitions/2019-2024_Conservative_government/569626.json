        "additional_details": "The Government should work with retailers to make Healthy Start vouchers available to be used against an ONLINE supermarket shop as well as in-store so you have the choice. \r\n\r\nAt the moment it is in-store only and those families not going into shops during this pandemic are losing out because they cannot spend their vouchers or wish to send someone else into a shop on their behalf to use them as Healthy Start has advised to do.",
        "background": "It's now been just over a year since the Covid 19 outbreak and feeding the nation's poorest children has been very much talked about in the media, but many families are still losing out on fresh food because Healthy Start vouchers still cannot be used online. Please make this possible.",
