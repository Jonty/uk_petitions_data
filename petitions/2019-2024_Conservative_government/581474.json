In considering any name, the Committee takes into account many aspects including the history of that name, battle honours, recent affiliations, and the civic support that may go with it. The SNBC presents its recommendations to the Navy Board; the name(s) chosen by the Navy Board are forwarded to the Secretary of State for Defence before being submitted to Her Majesty the Queen for approval.\r\n\r\nYou may wish to contact the Ministry of Defence to make this suggestion: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-defence"
