        "additional_details": "The cost of fuel in the UK today hit an all-time high with warnings that there is more to come. With the cost of living already putting the country at a crisis point, now is not the time to remove support. In addition, the lack of new cars over the last year has also made this change more difficult. As this starts to ease and pre-ordered cars begin to be delivered, it's only fair that these people should also be able to make use of the grant. Make sustainably affordable.",
        "background": "Extend the OZEV EVHS grant that helps domestic households with a grant of up to \u00a3350 towards the installation of an EV charger. The current scheme is due to change at the end of the month, and will only apply to people who live in flats, rented accommodation and businesses.",
