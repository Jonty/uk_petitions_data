        "additional_details": "For example, the TMUA entrance paper has closed its deadlines for a remote exam setting, but the actual exam is only sat on the 5th November. For those people who contract COVID-19 in this period, their future may suffer from not being able to do the examinations. Therefore, removing this limit will allow those to sit the exam.",
        "background": "For the remote university exams; allow people who contract COVID-19 to sit these exams as the current deadline has passed. There are many possible ways for students to catch COVID-19; they may have caught it from a secure place. Limiting their access to this has the potential to limit their future.",
