        "additional_details": "In school we are often taught that structural racism ended with the Civil Rights Movement in the US. This serves to bury the UK's role in perpetuating white supremacy and anti-blackness, both then and now. By updating the education system we can actively tackle 'white blindness', shedding light on the covert racism that is perpetuated throughout society, rather than relying on generational change to drift vaguely towards racial equity and a deeper understanding of these issues.",
        "background": "Update the GCSE syllabus to include texts about systematic racism today & more specifically in the UK, as well as further diversifying the list of authors.",
