        "additional_details": "The anxiety and pressure on students to return when cases are still high and most parents, students and teachers are not fully vaccinated, is unfair and parents should have the choice to protect their families from COVID-19. Many teachers, students and their families will share the concerns about social distancing in schools, when they have firsthand seen the lack of it and know it is not taken seriously. Particularly for students in exam years, as they have no examinations to be preparing for.",
