        "additional_details": "When this is over we want to celebrate, we want to have things to look forward to, we want to spend time with our loved ones, visit the places we've missed, be entertained in the theatre and at concerts. Go on holiday, stay in hotels and eat in restaurants.\r\nUnfortunately, whilst these places are not currently viable, their future is very uncertain. \r\nBut they are viable and wanted again when some form of normality is restored. They will create employment and enjoyment again in the future.",
        "background": "As a return to normality is a long way off, lots of sectors still cannot open and are in danger of being permanantly lost.\r\nProvide grants to protect closed businesses from their crippling running costs (insurance, rates, standing charges etc) so they can re-open when all restrictions are lifted.",
