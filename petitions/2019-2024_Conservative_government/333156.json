        "additional_details": "The decision to put calorie counts on menus across the UK is harmful to ED sufferers and to the general public ; calorie counting is a symptom of EDs and disorded eating/unhealthy relationships with food, and serves no purpose in the battle against obesity. Instead, the government could introduce taxes on fatty foods and use these to subsidise healthier alternatives, encouraging people to cook at home more regularly instead of relying on eating out and takeaways.",
        "background": "Reverse the decision to put calorie counts in menus when dining out across the UK ; it serves no purpose in the battle against obesity and encourages disorded eating instead of healthy eating.",
