You could also sign this petition asking the Government to make Friday a part of the weekend: \r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/597715\r\n\r\nIt isn't clear what you mean by \"better foods\". The decision over the individual drinks that schools sell is a matter for schools rather than the Government or Parliament. \r\n \r\n"
