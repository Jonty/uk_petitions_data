        "additional_details": "We can achieve the above and also protect the most vulnerable people in the UK and our frontline workers. Ensuring fair global distribution is morally right - for vulnerable people, families, and communities not as fortunate as us.\r\n\r\nVaccinating the UK and saying \u2018we\u2019re fine\u2019 will simply not work. Leaving the virus unchecked around the world could lead to more variants emerging. Economically, 'vaccine nationalism' could cost high-income countries \u00a33.3tn.\r\n\r\nLet's do the right thing!",
        "background": "Once all vulnerable groups in the UK have received their jabs, we would like the Government to act to fulfil our moral duty to people around the world.\r\n\r\nWe can do this by pausing further UK vaccinations at that point, and freeing up distribution of further doses to the world's poorest countries.",
