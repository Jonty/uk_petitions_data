        "additional_details": "As you know, I am not the only bride in the world who has been forced into postponing her wedding. The after effects of this pandemic have been horrific for all would-be newlyweds. It has not only put restrictions couples who wanted to begin married life together but also set would-be mothers back a whole year who were waiting until marriage to have a baby. Surely, that is taking away women\u2019s rights to have a child? I have spoken to most wedding venues in North London and all are suffering.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to increase the number of guests permitted at weddings according to full venue capacity. Wedding venues around the country are suffering due to no business. My fianc\u00e9 and I have postponed our wedding twice because there is no possible way of having a Greek wedding of 30.",
