        "additional_details": "We feel that the national pay we get now is not enough to support our modern day living needs, a \u00a320 pay increase could help the younger generation afford housing and bills without struggling to live or worry about being late on bills because of a sudden change in prices. An increase this large will help people enjoy the life they have without feeling stressed 24/7.",
        "background": "We the people feel it is necessarily that the public get a national pay rise of \u00a320 per hr to help with the dramatic increasing amounts of homes and food price rises. This will encourage people to get jobs and help those in need who are barely scraping the barrel.",
