        "action": "Implement a tax on food packaged with any single use plastics",
        "additional_details": "Plastic pollution is a huge problem, and currently there is little commercial incentive towards change. Food is one of the markets where single use plastic is highly prevalent, yet alternatives exist - from traditional waxed paper, through to new technologies e.g. cellulose based packaging. The UK should be a world leader in the green economy, and this approach would help to drive investment in alternatives to our plastic-heavy economy.",
        "background": "A tax on all food packaged with any single use plastics in order to persuade food suppliers to replace it with non-plastic alternatives. The tax should start low but increase over time to make plastic food packaging commercially unattractive. For example 10% in year 1, 25% in 2 two, 100% in year 3.",
