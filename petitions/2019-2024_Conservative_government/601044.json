        "action": "To have well-being days termly for school years 6-13 to improve mental health.",
        "additional_details": "Due to COVID-19 and pressure children are feeling in the school environment, the mental affect it has had on young minds is detrimental. Therefore, it should be a legal requirement that all schools and colleges have a designated lead for mental health to meet with students.\r\nIf students stress levels are decreased, they are more likely to socialize with peers without worries of their studies and school life. This also means the national exam board levels will increase.",
        "background": "To benefit pupils in schools years 6-13, we want the Government to make it a legal requirement that schools must provide at least one day per term and dedicate it to a mental health awareness, thus meaning the pupils can talk about their feelings and share concerns with those they trust.",
