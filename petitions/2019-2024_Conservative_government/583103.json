        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to allow women to feed their children (breast or bottle) in public indoor places while they are out. Women are feeding in toilets, on the floor, in shopping aisles and in their cars. This is detrimental to the physical safety and mental health of mothers all over the UK today. \r\n\r\nThere must be spaces, a seat in a coffee shop or restaurant for women to feed their children. It is an essential and not a luxury to be able to feed out of the cold, rain, and to be seated.",
        "background": "Currently there is no space for mothers to feed their baby when out in public. Where they would usually sit in a cafe, a shopping centre bench, these places are hosting large queues and shoppers but not open for a mother to breastfeed or bottle feed her child in warmth, safety and while comfortable.",
