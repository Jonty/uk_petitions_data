        "action": "Change the income tax structure to remove the 60% effective marginal rate",
        "additional_details": "Removal of the personal allowance for people who earn over \u00a3100k has the effect of creating a 60% effective marginal rate of income tax up to \u00a3125k, returning to 40% for \u00a3125-\u00a3150k. As such, the current effective income tax structure is not progressive. It does not apply higher tax rates to higher levels of income. \r\n\r\nThe 60% effective tax rate is a clear disincentive for those earning around \u00a3100,000 (mainly those seen as \"wealth creators\"). The vast majority will act to avoid this rate.",
        "background": "The Government should remove rules that reduce the personal allowance for people who earn over \u00a3100,000. The associated loss of tax revenue to the exchequer should recovered through the introduction of a more progressive income tax structure.",
