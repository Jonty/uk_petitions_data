        "additional_details": "When people reduce their use to save money, they still pay a heavy amount due to the standing charges. These are paid by all, regardless of how much, or how little, energy is used. This makes it hard to reduce bills, even when cutting back on usage. Standing charges are unfair.",
        "background": "Remove the standing charges from energy bills. These charges have increased heavily recently.\r\nCosts to cover failed companies and green energy plans should be linked to consumption.",
