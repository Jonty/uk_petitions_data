People are losing their baggage or the bags are not being loaded onto the flight because the airline handling agents haven\u2019t recruited enough staff.\r\nCurrently nothing is done to compensate the passengers for their inconvenience of not receiving their baggage, and I feel this is wrong.\r\nWhere baggage is included or added to a fare, passengers have a reasonable expectation to receive it after the flight.",
