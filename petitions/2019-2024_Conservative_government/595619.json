The people are sick to death of politicians that cannot do the job that we put them there to do. They are allowing development that suits them personally and it is to the detriment of this country and its indigenous people. We do not want to walk around the park. it is too tame and there is no wild life. We want to walk into the countryside and breath the air. It is fast disappearing and it has to stop.",

The governments of countries, and first and foremost \"ours\", (UK)  Are gutless and cowardly when it comes to the most important problem of all. We have to  start by getting back our green belt",
