It is essential that the government supports the creative and supporting industries during these times of great need. The entire events industry has disappeared overnight and with it the income for our most creative and talented pioneers. All of the associated and seasonal industries are also affected. Tradesmen, construction workers and drivers are also left out in the cold.",
        "background": "Millions of people in events, creative arts, construction and similar industries have seen their income disappear overnight. Without PAYE they have been excluded from financial support programmes. Many run small Ltd companies from home and are also excluded. Measures are needed to support them.",
