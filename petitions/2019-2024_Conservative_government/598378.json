        "additional_details": "My son has passed his driving theory test but due to the current situation, not being able to book the driving test, his certificate will expire. He rides a motorcycle so he is fully up-to date with his road safety. Also being a brick layer he needs to be able to drive to put tools in a car. Unsafe to have these on a motorcycle. Thank you",
