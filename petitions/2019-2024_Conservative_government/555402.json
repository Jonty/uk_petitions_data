        "additional_details": "Government has supported many industry sectors that have returned to work - Eat Out To Help Out, reduced VAT etc but there is no support for an industry sector that has been unable to return to work. Government turned to the Events Sector for Nightingale Hospitals, Mortuaries & Test Centre\u2019s at the start of the Pandemic yet ever since then the Events & Exhibition Sectors have been completely overlooked with regards to helping our sector return to what we do best",
        "background": "Hold a debate with regards to why the Events & Exhibitions Sector has been overlooked for further funding given that our sector has been closed since the lockdown. Our sector generates in excess of \u00a380 Billion in UK Revenues and employs nearly 1M people",
