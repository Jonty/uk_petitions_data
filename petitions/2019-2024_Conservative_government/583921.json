        "additional_details": "The 50+1 rule is an informal term used to refer to a clause in the regulations of the Deutsche Fu\u00dfball-Liga (German Football League). The clause states that, in order to obtain a license to compete in the Bundesliga, a club must hold a majority of its own voting rights. The rule is designed to ensure that the club's members retain overall control, by way of owning 50% of shares, +1 share, protecting clubs from the influence of external investors.\r\n\r\nFootball is for the fans! Not greedy owners.",
        "background": "After seeing what the \u201cEuropean Super League\u201d has done to the football community, it shows that change is needed soon rather than later, we must ensure that something similar can never happen again. Therefore we should follow in the footsteps of German clubs and enforce the 50+1 rule to the clubs.",
