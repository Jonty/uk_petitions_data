        "additional_details": "We need a re election because we dont have a prime minister that is making better decisions. We need a new prime minister who makes better decisions for us so we can move out of lockdown quicker, going in and out of lockdowns is having a toll on peoples mental health thus causing them to commit suicide, some people are even alone and have no one to be there for them also, this impacts people who have no work as they will be led into being homeless as they would not be able to afford rent anymore.",
        "background": "I would like the parliament to call for a Re election for a new prime minister, who will make harsh decisions to make this country go back to normal as soon as possible. We need someone who make clear decisions and can give us straight and real answers, not hidden answers and lies.",

In practice, this is usually the leader of the political party that wins the most seats in a general election. You can find out more about this here:\r\nhttps://www.royal.uk/queen-and-government\r\n\r\nYou may wish to sign this petition calling for a general election: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/557074\r\n\r\n"
