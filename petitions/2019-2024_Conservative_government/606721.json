        "additional_details": "With the UK sustainability strategy, a scheme that promotes car ownership with no equivalent for public transport is illogical. Enabling people to use salary sacrifice will reduce the cost of rail for commuting, encourage people to commute back to the office. This would fit with the government climate ambitions and aligns with Great British Railways ambitions.",
        "background": "Similar to the car salary sacrifice scheme, make annual and flexi rail season and tickets eligible for the salary sacrifice scheme. Employers would encourage people to commute using public transport.",
