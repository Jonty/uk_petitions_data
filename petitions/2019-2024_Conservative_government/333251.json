        "additional_details": "While obesity is a very real issue in our society, displaying calorie information next to each item has a very detrimental effect, particularly on those who already suffer with serious eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia and other eating disorders. Calories are just a unit of energy and don\u2019t show how \u2018healthy\u2019 food is. We should be aiming to educate the public on what a healthy, balanced diet looks like without promoting the idea that more calories is always a bad thing.",
