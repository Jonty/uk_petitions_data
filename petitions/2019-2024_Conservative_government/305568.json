We all need to be acting consistently for real success.",
        "background": "I would like the Goverment to introduce Lockdown across England to give instruction, rather than only guidance, to the nation. Whilst the Government have made drastic changes day by day, the nation remains divided in their responses, actions and behaviours. The guidelines need to be black and white.",
