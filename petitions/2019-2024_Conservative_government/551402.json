        "additional_details": "We've been debating this for many years and our European neighbours voted on 27 March 2019 to abolish summer time. Let's harmonize practices but have us live perpetually in British Summer Time (+1 UTC). \r\n\r\nThere have been many attempted to stick to summer time (see 2005 Lighter Evenings Bill, Daylight Saving Bill 2010-2012 and the recent House of Lords EU Internal Market Sub-Committee).\r\n\r\nBut we're pretty much done with 2020 so no-one will object to it being 1 hour shorter. Now is this time to act.",
        "background": "There have been many petitions to get rid of the arcane act of adjusting our clocks twice a year and much scientific evidence presented to the house as to the savings to the economy if we were to stick on Summer Time. But frankly we really don't want another hour of 2020 so lets make it happen now.",
