        "additional_details": "Guidance published on May 11th outlined that primary schools should begin to reopen from June 1st. The guidance states that school children cannot socially distance and staff working in schools should NOT wear PPE unless in exceptional circumstances. The government has advised that employees returning to all other work settings should socially distance or, if not possible, to wear PPE. It is unexplainable and inexcusable why staff working in schools should be treated any differently.",
        "background": "The U.K. government should reconsider the opening of schools in England from June 1st. Schools should only open once all staff can adequately protect themselves and their pupils from coronavirus and have access to PPE. The reopening of schools should not unnecessarily put staff lives at risk.",
