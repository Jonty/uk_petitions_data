This prevents them from buying alcohol that they are legally allowed to drink, or buying alcohol as a gift. We think that 16 and 17 year olds should be allowed to buy alcohol, but only drink in the company of an adult.",
        "background": "We want the Government to allow 16 and 17 year olds to buy alcohol. 16 or 17 year olds can drink (but not buy) beer, wine or cider with a meal, if they are accompanied by an adult, but they cannot buy alcohol, even if this is to be drunk in the company of an adult. We think this should change.",
