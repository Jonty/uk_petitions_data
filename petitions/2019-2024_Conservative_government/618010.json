        "additional_details": "No other worker in any other company would be tolerated if it became clear that they were using illegal drugs. They would be disciplined and almost certainly dismissed. In some cases, criminal charges would be brought. Why should the House of Commons, the very place in which laws are made, also be a place in which those laws are routinely flouted and broken by those who are supposed to be governing the country?",
        "background": "As it\u2019s become clear that certain politicians in Westminster may have been using illegal substances in the Parliament building, it is time to introduce random compulsory drug testing, carried out by an independent body, and to refer to the Police any illegal use or possession of these substances.",
