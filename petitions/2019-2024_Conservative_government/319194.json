        "additional_details": "The rainbow symbol has united the nation during the COVID pandemic. Children and adults alike have put rainbows on their social media and drawn and painted rainbows to on everything from scraps of paper to houses.  Therefore we would like government to encourage the NHS to use the rainbow as an official additional logo to celebrate the dedication and sacrifice of our NHS heroes.  This new additional rainbow logo will complement the main NHS logo which is known and respected throughout the world.",
        "background": "The rainbow has become a powerful symbol of hope and of appreciation of our wonderful NHS fighting the COVID pandemic.  We want government to ask NHS Trusts to use the rainbow as an official logo in addition to their main logo, and to pass any legislation needed to remove any legal barriers to this.",
