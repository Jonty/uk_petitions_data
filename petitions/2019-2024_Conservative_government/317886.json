        "additional_details": "The gross inequality of the two schemes is causing mental and financial strain on many self-employed, leaving them with no income. The government should demonstrate equality; helping all self-employed to continue contributing to the economy and society, working with them to protect small businesses and not add them and any staff they have to the unemployed. Amend the scheme and remove the cap on trading profits; back dated to the start date of the furlough scheme, running for the same duration.",
        "background": "Under the self-employed income support scheme an individual with profits in excess of \u00a350000 for 18/19 (or 3 years to 2019) is excluded from accessing benefit. By contrast the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme for employees, is uncapped on earnings. For a fair system, please remove the profits cap.",
