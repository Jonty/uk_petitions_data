        "additional_details": "The loss of any family member is devastating, however as it stands, the loss of a child warrant\u2019s paid leave, but the loss of a parent, spouse or sibling warrants no financial support. A child cannot be replaced, indeed nor a mother, father, brother, sister, husband or wife. As a minimum, we should support UK employees through such loss of an immediate family member, and provide at least 3 days paid leave as a legal minimum.",
        "background": "To make it a legal requirement for UK employers to give employees at least 3 days paid leave when they suffer the loss of a parent, spouse or sibling. The loss of a child is already managed through \u201cJacks law\u201d and equates to two weeks leave. We need recognition of other loss requiring support.",
