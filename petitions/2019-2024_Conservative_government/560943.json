        "action": "Cancel our A-level exams next summer and rely on the teacher's assessments.",
        "additional_details": "Those exams will provide unfair results because we had 4 months of online learning. Even all our teachers claim that it was very far from ideal as they could not provide us with all materials using the online system and they believe that is unfair to force us to sit those exams. Exam boards made a statement that they have reduced the amount of content we need to cover during the year but they actually have not. Our main concern is that we will have spent our 2 years doing A-levels for nothing.",
        "background": "We ask the UK Government and Parliament to cancel A-Level exams in England in summer 2021 and rely on teacher's assessments in order to get fair and just results because those exams cannot show our capabilities and skills that we have gained during these 2 years.",
