        "background": "Telford has a ever increasing population & needs it's own 24/7 Accident & Emergency Department, in light of the Covid-19 Pandemic, I urge the Government & Parliament to back the people of Telfords right, to have the best medical care available at it's disposal, a part time A & E is unacceptable.",
