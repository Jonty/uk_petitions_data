        "additional_details": "There has been numerous errors throughout the pandemic that our government leaders have made which has had a drastic effect on all of our lives. Whether it is closing the borders to late or enforcing new laws that havnt been upheld by themselves even a day after announcement. The pressures put on the NHS without any worth while aid and support. Using the NHS great work as their own and focusing all their time on this virus whilst pushing back any treatment for other  health problems like cancer.",
        "background": "This petition is for a change of government leaders due to all the lies and mistakes they have made throughout this pandemic. Also the way they have and are treating local businesses and people across our country.",
