        "additional_details": "There is a severe lack of NHS dentists, with people now being forced to pay for private treatment, which they can ill afford, when they are entitled to treatment on the NHS. This is a country wide issue, affecting all age groups, which requires immediate attention. Unable to get any treatment, desperate people are turning to their local A and E departments, which in turn is causing it\u2019s own issues. Something needs to be done and quickly before things get any worse.",
        "background": "I would like for this issue to be addressed by the Government and more funding and attention given to NHS dentistry as a matter of urgency. It feels as if NHS dentistry is being surreptitiously privatised and this needs to be stopped.",
