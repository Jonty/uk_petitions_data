        "additional_details": "Many people, especially older people are afraid to go out in case they get caught short. Many can\u2019t afford the money required to have a pee, and many don\u2019t have the right change. Going to toilet is a natural and unavoidable thing, just as much as breastfeeding, so why are we being charged ? It\u2019s a disgrace. It\u2019s against the law to pee in a hedge etc. but what other choice have you when faced with a desperate situation. I believe it would bring more people back to the high streets",
        "background": "Public toilets are a necessity, not a pleasure. More and more are closing, and those that remain open are charging up to 50p. It\u2019s scandalous and the government should stop this happening",
