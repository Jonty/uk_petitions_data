The most egregious example of this is in the United States, where many states risk having permanent DST, and their residents are suffering greatly from its side-effects, including unnatural darkness and an increase in dangerous driving and/or RTAs. Full GMT would prevent this from happening in the UK.",

Hora Solaris (Solar Time) has been active since 2020 and is allied with the International Alliance for Natural Time or IANT.",
