And that isn't out of the realm of possibility, with 22 days of strike declared/used in this academic year alone. Even if there were only a thousand students that saw the effects, that's \u00a3500,000 lost from the pockets of students. But this is across 74 universities, with over a million students affected. The loss is substantial, but the majority of students don't see any money back.",
        "background": "Thousands of students, across 74 universities, are being caught up in UCU strikes over pensions and pay. Each lecture costs, on average, between \u00a320-\u00a330 an hour. Students are missing essential learning time from a service they're paying for, and it is only fair that they get reimbursed.",
