        "additional_details": "Many students, including myself rely on casual work, part time jobs and support from parents to pay for rent. As many parents and students have been furloughed, those earning under \u00a32,500 per month have had their wage reduced by 20%. Although some companies including Student IQ accommodation and Unite have cancelled contracts for students or reduced the rent. Too many are ignoring emails or declining student requests for help. As a student company these landlords should have a responsibility.",
        "background": "For the past 6 weeks the UK has been on lockdown. Students across the country have travelled home to isolate with their families after universities closed, leaving their student accommodation empty. As Universities announce they may not open until October, it means many students will not return.",
