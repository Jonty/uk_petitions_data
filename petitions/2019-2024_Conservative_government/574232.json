There is no competition so they can at present charge whatever they want. The government are urged to regulate this and make this fair for all. Fuel should not cost more just because there is only one del station.",
        "background": "The government need to regulate the fuel industry, especially fuel stations and the prices they charge which differ so drastically. The government should set a cap on the maximum that can be charged per litre at any time, it is then down to retailers to either charge the maximum or less.",
