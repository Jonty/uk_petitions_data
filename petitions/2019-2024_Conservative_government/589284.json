While we are free to move everywhere in UK we can't afford to visit our family in our home country because of the cost of the required PCR tests for a family of 4 is roughly \u00a31000. We're locked up in UK for more than a year. Christmas and Easter were cancelled. We want to visit our family same like British people wanted theirs during the lockdown.
