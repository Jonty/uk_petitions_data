To have this money back would take a huge strain out of the current situation and day to day living. We shouldn\u2019t even have to ask. It\u2019s pure greed. They know who we all are. It should be a click of a button on their side (or ours) and the refund is done. We\u2019d all be much happier and customers relations would be intact.",
        "background": "During Covid-19 more airlines are removing the \u2018claim refund\u2019 button from their websites instead you have to phone in but its always engaged. Those getting thro are steered to take vouchers/reschedule. This is unfair. Airlines could go bust or client die of the virus then these options expire!",
