        "additional_details": "90% of British citizens live outside of London, with the average median wage outside of London being 25% lower. The internet has changed the face of democracy, allowing the public to become far more hands on in having a say in the way our nation is run & we want to break away from the past archaic methods that we feel hold back our democracy in an antiquated manner. Parliament should be moved to a modern online UK central (Derbyshire/Manchester) building, rather than its London rebuild from 1876",
        "background": "The palace of Westminster needs repairing; the cost of \u00a322 BILLION far too heavy a burden for public purse. The buildings should be sold to the private sector. Proceeds used to create a new parliament in UK central location, with rest of money used to help create new national public energy company.",
