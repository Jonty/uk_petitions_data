        "additional_details": "The authorities insisted he moved to appointments but he kept 5 slots available per clinic for emergencies. Government targets were emergency patients to be seen in 3 days. My Dad saw them same day! People with a long-term condition were seen every 3 months, keeping the condition under control minimizing hospital referrals. My Dad also had innumerable nurse led specialist clinics further keeping conditions under control. I am a former training GP and Joe Public wants this system back.",
        "background": "If it\u2019s not broken don\u2019t fix it. Under the new system, people can\u2019t get a GP appointment leading to more going to hospital or even deaths. When my Dad was a GP he made 15 appointments per clinic. You took a numbered paddle. You were seen in numerical order. Patients loved it- they got seen!",
