To exclude these professionals from any government help is inequitable.\r\nIt is also inequitable to exclude the self employed who left employment to commence self employment simply because their employment income is greater than their profits because they commenced later in the 2020 tax year. \r\nThe newly self employed are also excluded from access to the Bounce Back Loan.",
        "background": "The UK Government should debate scrapping the ceiling threshold of the SEISS as there is already a maximum payable (in line with the JRS) and the SEISS should be available for all who were registered self employed as of 19th March at HMRCs discretion.",
