        "action": "Remove quarantine for amber countries for the fully vaccinated like USA & EU",
        "additional_details": "The British Embassy across many different countries would not supply UK citizens with vaccinations developed in the UK which meant citizens had to fend for themselves, and in some instances, pay to get the same vaccinations as the UK. Now citizens living in countries not in U.S. or EU are being penalised. Border control is now being used for political warfare to get better deals and is neglecting the care of citizens abroad by providing better entry requirements for some on the same list.",
        "background": "The Government have announced that fully vaccinated U.S. and EU citizens will be allowed to enter England without quarantine. These rules should also apply to other amber countries, not in the EU or U.S. or at least to fully vaccinated UK citizens living abroad.",
