        "additional_details": "Teachers have worked incredibly hard to keep education going and parents have supported their children's attendance since schools re-opened. If teachers / families have to self-isolate over Christmas it will be incredibly stressful and could ruin the good will that has been shown. Whilst we don't yet know what Christmas will look like in terms of socialisation, we do know that spending it self-isolating will be very hard.  For teachers who live alone this will be particularly difficult.",
        "background": "If schools stay open beyond 11/12/20 then, if any child or adult tests positive, it will result in their whole bubble having to self-isolate for Christmas. Close schools or ask schools to move learning online from 11th December to avoid this happening.",
