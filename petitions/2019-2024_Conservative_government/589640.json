        "additional_details": "There are 230,000 muslims students in the UK making up around 8-9% of the total population who have difficulties when it comes to university. This is because any loans that require repayment with interest added on are not permissible. This is because in Islam money has no intrinsic value \u2013 it's just a medium of exchange. That means Muslims have to work for money to attach its value.",
        "background": "Introduce a new funding source/method that is ethical so that university students who are follow the faith of Islam can go to university without being charged interest on their repayments. Interest in islam is strictly forbidden.",
