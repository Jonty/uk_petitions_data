        "additional_details": "Parliament, and the Government must erase the vision of cheers from the benches of the House of Commons when pay rises for NHS workers was limited to 1%.\r\nTo show that these workers are valued for their work, we call on the Government to award the NHS workers a thoroughly deserved 10% pay rise and to set a higher minimum wage for care workers of \u00a311 per hour. Our colleagues in the NHS and care sector deserve nothing less.",
        "background": "NHS and care staff have done an immense job during the Corona Virus crisis. It is time to reverse the limit of 1% pay rises to these special workers, and the minimum wage should be set higher for Care Workers to \u00a311 per hour.",
