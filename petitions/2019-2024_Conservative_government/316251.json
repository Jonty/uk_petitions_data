        "additional_details": "Captain Moore has shown himself to be an inspiration to the country, something that the level of support and the funds he has raised clearly demonstrates. As was the case during the war, when his country needed him he has done his bit, not letting the ripe old age of 99 stand in his way. It is a way for the country to say thank you, once again for his service to us all.",
