        "additional_details": "As a result of the pandemic, many schools have not taught students large sections of the A Level content. Being tested as we would have been in a normal year, means that it is very stressful trying to cover content we haven't seen before in a short amount of time. Since having left our school, there is no means of getting help on topics we haven't covered, and this is a very big disadvantage. Having a topic list helps to focus our preparation and makes it humanely manageable.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to tell us the list of topics that will be in the autumn A Level exams, for all subjects, so the students know what they need to revise, rather than learning absolutely everything.",
