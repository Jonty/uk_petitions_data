        "additional_details": "COVID-19 cases are rising sharply across the country, yet the government are promising to scrap all restrictions on the 19th July, including masks on public transport.\r\n\r\nWhilst a \"you take your own risks\" approach may be appropriate for social gatherings, pubs, bars or clubs, public transport should be kept as safe as possible for everyone. Masks help keep public transport safe, especially when COVID-19 cases are high.",
