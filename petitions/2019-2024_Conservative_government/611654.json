        "additional_details": "The is no equity, and amid a massive nursing shortage, it is yet another barrier to becoming a nurse. Furthermore, it is wholly unjustifiable - how van those paid members of staff receive \u00a30.56 per mile, yet UNPAID students (doing 2300 hours of unpaid labor) are paid half of that. In fact, they are actually paid less than half as we are only paid mileage that is above our 'normal' mileage to university - again, this does not reflect reality. Its another example of discrimination against students",
        "background": "I want a review to be carried out on the current mileage rate for student nurses that have to travel to unpaid placements. The rate of \u00a30.28 per mile (only paid above 'normal' daily travel which has been severely impacted due to COVID-19) is half of that of paid NHS staff - this is unjustifiable.",
