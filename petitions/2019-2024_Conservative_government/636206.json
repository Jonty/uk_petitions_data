Manipulation & coercive control are very hard to prove. If you are a victim of any emotional or psychological abuse, you are given limited time with a CAFCASS worker who determines if what you are saying is genuine. If both have raised DA it\u2019s then drawn a line under. There needs to be a change. The right support & training needs to be given!",

However it is also not a safe place to have your voice heard due to perpetrators being in denial and unfortunately unless there is a criminal conviction you are not taken seriously.",
