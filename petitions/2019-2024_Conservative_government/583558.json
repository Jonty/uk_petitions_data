As pioneers of the \u2018beautiful\u2019 game, we must take a stand against this atrocity of clear disregard for our proud football heritage. This is an act of greed by the \u2018elite\u2019 clubs and will jeopardise grassroots football, potentially leaving lower league clubs on the brink of collapse. Football is nothing without the fans and by creating this so called \u2018Super League\u2019 disregards generations of fans and their memories",
