        "additional_details": "YouGov found that 64% of women of all ages have experienced unwanted sexual harassment in public places. This increases to 85% of girls aged 18-24 with 45% of those experiencing unwanted sexual touching. Only 11% of women said anyone had intervened though 81% said they wished someone had (2016). \r\n \r\nThe police should be intervening. In recent years France, Belgium, Portugal, Peru and New Zealand have all implemented new laws to criminalise street harassment. The UK is falling behind.",
        "background": "The Anti-Harassment Club defines street harassment as any unwanted behaviour of a sexual nature, whether implicit or explicit, forced on a stranger in a public place without their consent. \r\n \r\nUK law must change. Street harassment must be recognised as the pervasive violation of human rights it is.",
