        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson is further undermining the country's ability to work within the International Community. Like so much of the Government's dealings with the EU regarding Brexit, Boris Johnson and his ministers are resorting to petty and ill-judged decisions. Even Trump backtracked on his decision to downgrade the diplomatic status of the EU mission. The EU bloc is our nearest neighbour and we should maintain a strong, working relationship with it.",
        "background": "The UK will not give the EU ambassador full diplomatic status. The bloc enjoys full diplomatic status with 142 other countries. When the EU\u2019s foreign service was set up, the UK agreed that EU diplomats enjoy the \u201cprivileges and immunities equivalent to those referred to in the Vienna Convention\u201d.",
