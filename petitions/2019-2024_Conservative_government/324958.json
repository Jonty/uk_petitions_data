        "additional_details": "The Government has chronically underfunded our national parks, councils and charities which manage Britains towns, countryside and AONB.  They simply do not have sufficient environmental wardens to  adequately manage.  Too many volunteers are carrying out unnecessary work in litter picking  (beach, town and country) when this is an issue which can be reduced significantly with appropriate legislation.  Wardens have little authority they can implement to deter litterers. Its about time this was reviewed and debated in parliament.",
        "background": "The maximum fixed penalty notice, is \u00a375. Few are issued, less than half are paid and it is too easy to give a false name and address.  In light of the massive amounts of litter left, stiffer penalties and better funding for wardens is needed to help facilitate appropriate legislation.",
