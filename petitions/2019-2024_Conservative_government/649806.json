As a person with ASD and learning disabilities I have to explain to people what autism is and how it affects me which I am fine with doing but I can't speak for everyone with ASD and learning disabilities. Students should also be taught what to do when they see someone having a mealtdown. Guest speakers with ASD should be considered.",
