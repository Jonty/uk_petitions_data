        "additional_details": "The Chancellor announced a cut of 5p per litre, in the same week the cost of fuel rose by 12p, the biggest rise in a week ever. It's ok for government ministers living in London claiming huge expenses, completely out of touch with the harsh reality facing it's people.\r\nEnd fuel duty now.",
        "background": "Scrap fuel duty at least until the cost of living crisis has abated. At current fuel prices the government is collecting an average of 84p per litre while working people are forced to go to foodbanks or skip a meal to survive.\r\n\r\nIt is immoral for this government to impoverish its own people.",
