        "additional_details": "Squalene oil is found in plants, animals and humans. Sharks livers are rich in this oil and it is being used by companies such as GlaxoSmithKline in vaccine manufacturing. It is estimated that half a MILLION sharks will have to die to supply a vaccine to the entire population. Our oceans are already hugely depleted, fish stocks that support economies and the food supply will collapse. Sustainable plant based squalene is readily available derived from olives, so why are we killing these animals.",
        "background": "Sharks are being killed for their Squalene oil, an oil that naturally occurs. It is used as a carrier for vaccines. Half a million sharks will have to be killed to supply the world with a vaccine. When this oil can be derived from plants, why are we killing these animals.",
