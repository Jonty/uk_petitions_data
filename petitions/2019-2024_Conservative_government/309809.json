What a great service it has performed. Efficient, cost effective and great results. Now after years of cuts and less investment than needed by our people it is time for this government to profoundly improve the health and social capital of the nation. Set your health staff free by testing us, directing us to the right place to help you.",

For those who are not immune give us enhanced protection or other roles. Extend to other key workers ASAP. Set us free to save you.",
