        "action": "Make school meals free for all children, including secondary schools",
        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to bridge the gap of inequality in school age children.  I would like children to have at least one school meal a day regardless of their age, or their parent's financial situation. Children are often bullied if they are in receipt of free school meals and feel ashamed to even eat the meal.  Therefore I feel if meals were free in schools, it would not single out any child who is entitled to free school meals through no fault of their own.",
        "background": "I want the Government to help children to feel 'equal' by enabling all school children of all ages to have a free school meal regardless of their parents fiancial status.",
