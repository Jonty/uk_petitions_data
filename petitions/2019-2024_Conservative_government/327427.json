In 2017, May pledged to allow people to legally change their gender without medical checks. \r\n\r\nFollowing the public consultation on the Gender Recognition Act (GRA), the Government\u2019s response was due in July and now presented in a leaked document. \r\n\r\nThe Government reportedly plan to ditch self-ID (despite 70% of 100,000 GRA respondents in favour of it), thus denying trans people their identities.",
