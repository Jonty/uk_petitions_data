        "additional_details": "The tampon tax fundamentally is flawed. The idea that menstruating bodies are considered non-essential by the government in frankly disgusting. A helicopter is considered an essential, however a sanitary product for an uncontrolled human function is a luxury. There is nothing luxurious about menstrual hygine. During the Covid-19 pandemic with shops only selling essential items, any person to menstruate has been denied any right to purchase vital items. This flawed taxing must be stopped.",
