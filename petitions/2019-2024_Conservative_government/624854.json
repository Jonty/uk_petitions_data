        "additional_details": "I want it to be mandatory for mainstream schools to educate children and young adults about disabilities. This will enable more of a community between mainstream schools and special schools with children with disabilities. I often find children even adults don\u2019t know how to approach someone with a disability it\u2019s not because they don\u2019t want to, they just don\u2019t know how.",
        "background": "I work in a special-needs school and often when we are out on trips and people will just stare . Some mainstream schools ,pupils have never come in contact with another child with disabilities. You can see from the child\u2019s face they don\u2019t know and don\u2019t understand children with disabilities.",
