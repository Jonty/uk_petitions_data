        "additional_details": "The UK Government must reconsider India and South Africa\u2019s request to the WTO that intellectual property rights must not create barriers to timely access affordable vaccines and medicines essential to combat COVID-19. The COVID-19 vaccine like many other treatments is paid for with public funds. Regardless of where people live or how much money they have, it should not be up to pharmaceutical companies, corporations, and patent laws to decide who lives or dies.",
        "background": "Call on the government to consider holding debates in Parliament to push for waiving intellectual property rights and making the COVID-19 vaccine affordable for all people regardless of where they were born, where they live or how much money they have. COVID-19 treatment should not be for profit.",
