Who is going take care of the public if the healthcare workers are getting ill? How can you be sure that the ordinary PPE is enough to prevent us from a new unknown virus? NHS workers will get ill and NHS will pay with lives and money. Therefore, we need use the most effective PPE that we currently have, not what is second best.",
        "background": "We need to adopt national advanced PPE for all healthcare workers coming into contact with potential or confirmed patients with COVID-19. PPE such as surgical masks, aprons and gloves is not enough! We need more protective PPE. This includes: FFP3 masks, visors, elbow length gloves, surgical gowns.",
