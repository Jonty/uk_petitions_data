Due to the current pandemic and the potential to catch infection and other bugs via cash and coins, I petition the government to increase the contactless debit card limit and suspend restrictions on debit card usage. This is to facilitate the essential purchase of food and medicine without coming into contact with cash point devices.",
        "background": "I petition the government to increase the debit card contactless limit to \u00a3100 and also increase the number of contact usage to 10 times before a PIN number is required, or temporarily suspend the requirement of pin for contactless payment.",
