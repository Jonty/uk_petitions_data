        "additional_details": "While our climate crisis is becoming exponentially worrying, the issue has to be at the forefront of our attention. While the transportation of vapes from China to the UK contributes to our global climate, the levels of ill-disposed vapes within the UK are also a huge problem. The process of recycling plastic is costly and detrimental to the environment in itself; however, they nearly all end up on the streets or in mixed waste bins and therefore contribute to the existing landfill crisis.",
        "background": "90% of disposable vapes are made in China. A disposable vape ranges anywhere between \u00a33-\u00a310 and tends to last up to only a few days; They're almost all made up of plastic outer casings and contain non-recyclable batteries. They end up on our streets or in landfill sites; please ban the sale of them.",
