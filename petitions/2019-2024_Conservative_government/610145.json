A cap needs to be put in place to reduce this. \r\nListening to peoples stories is heartbreaking, do we eat, or keep warm.\r\nApril is almost here, and then an October price will be issued, this will be horrendous for the winter months. Many people do not want to be paying back \u00a3200 for the next 5 years. This has to be looked at in a sensible. Please act now.",
        "background": "The country has been through a pandemic that has caused great hardship to many households/businesses. People are trying to recover from this, and now they are being given another blow not only with NI increase but this massive hike in utility prices.",
