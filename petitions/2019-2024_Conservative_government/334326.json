        "additional_details": "The Government should allow all those with hidden disabilities to have a Blue Badge regardless of professionals involved in their care because those with hidden disabilities shouldn\u2019t have to prove they need one other than proof of their condition.\r\n\r\nThe need for professional involvement could be trapping those who need a Badge but don\u2019t necessarily need professionals in their care. Also, rejection of the Badge could lead to worsening mental health of those who are vulnerable in our society.",
