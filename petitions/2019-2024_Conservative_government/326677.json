However, we must stop placing slave traders in positions which portary them as worthy of respect. \r\n\r\nA similar petition received over 100,000 signatures on change.org. I hope that it can gain some traction on here too.",
        "background": "Statues do not teach history. Statues - quite literally - place figures on pedestals. To place a historical figure on a pedestal is to portray them as heroes - as people worthy of respect. For slave traders, this is simply not the case.",
