Now is the time to redirect public resources away from traditional policing and find real alternatives. In the UK alone, if you're black, you're FIVE times more likely to be stopped and searched, alongside a shocking statistic that anyone who isn't white are TWICE as likely to die after being restrained. Policing in the UK needs to be reformed now",
