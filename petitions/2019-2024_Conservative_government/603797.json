        "additional_details": "The hospitality industry employs nearly 3 million people, almost 10% of the British workforce. It is the third biggest employer in the UK, making up 6% of businesses and 5% of GDP.\r\n\r\nIt has already been devastated by the pandemic, with revenue at 70% of normal even outside of lockdown, and huge problems with staffing. Many made it through thanks to furlough payments, loans and grants only by a hair\u2019s breadth. \r\n\r\nBecause the Government has not mandated closures, they have zero support. Help them.",
        "background": "England has decided not to mandate closures for hospitality venues, such as restaurants, bars, pubs, hotels, & nightclubs. However, the British public are following scientific advice & cancelling plans anyway. The industry needs support: bring back furlough & grants immediately for Christmas.",
