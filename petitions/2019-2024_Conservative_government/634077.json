        "additional_details": "When looking at the history of the VAT threshold it has increased consistently every year from 99 until 2018. The governments target of inflation when measured by the CPI is 2% so therefore why has the VAT threshold not reflected this. However given the current climate the inflation rate has been approximately 10% recently which therefore means this extra needs to be accounted. Hence the substantial increase is believed to be necessary as it has not been amended for the last 5 years.",
