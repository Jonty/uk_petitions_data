        "additional_details": "It is perverse, that one Govt Dept (Foreign & Commonwealth Office) advises that it is safe to travel to the Canary islands or Balearics (there being a specific exemption from the mainland Spain ban) BUT another Govt Dept (Dept of Transport) requires a 14 quarantine for those returning from the Canaries or Balearics (there being no exemption from the blanket Spain requirement).\r\nThis is unreasonable, unfair and unjust. The Canary islands have very low Covid cases, which are far less than the UK.\r\nThis unnecessary action is jeopardizing the economic survival of the islands and the UK airlines.",
