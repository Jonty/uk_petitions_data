        "additional_details": "The Communist Party of China's recent decision to impose a new National Security law in Hong Kong threatens to undermine their rights and freedoms. This risks the \"one nation, two systems\" arrangement being discarded.\r\n\r\nFor years, the people of Hong Kong have clashed against the CPC's strategies to revoke their rights, and only the US has led a meaningful response thus far. We must ensure the CPC upholds the agreement, or risk allowing HK to slip into Chinese law before the 2047 expiration date.",
        "background": "The UK has demonstrated its ability to influence nations on a worldwide scale, and has been a leader in efforts to ensure its democracy. When Hong Kong's freedoms are at stake - when protesters are being beaten down, holding Union Flags, why can't we take a firmer stance against the CPC's actions?",
