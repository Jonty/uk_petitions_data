        "action": "Lift the restrictions on conducting marriages to allow up to 10 people.",
        "additional_details": "Marriage is very important for society. Many people will want to get married this year. They will not be able to go ahead this year if we have to wait until restrictions on churches and venues are lifted. We are not asking to go against social distancing regulations as we know these are important and are thankful for them. This change in regulations would allow many people the chance to start their married life together whilst still protecting society and those most vulnerable to this virus.",
        "background": "We wish for the current restrictions on marriages to be lifted and allow marriages to take place with up to 10 people (the same as funerals).\r\n\r\nOnly the Government can do this.",
