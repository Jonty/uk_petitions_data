Despite the lack of education, people\u2019s lives are at risk by attending the exams, public transport are needed and then when taking the exams over 100 people are being mixed. We re in a national lockdown for a reason , to prevent the spread but are we not encouraging it? The exams need to be postponed. Boris has cancelled exams in summer , including GCSE, because they\u2019re \u201cunderprepared\u201d so how is it us BTEC students are more so prepared for our exams yet we have not been in for enough face to face lessons?",
