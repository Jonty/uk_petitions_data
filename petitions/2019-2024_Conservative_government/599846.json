This would allow people to start over and to allow them to have full control. For example if someone has a bad experience in education, they may want to reset or delete their account. I want this to be discussed and raised in government and for it to be taken seriously. I would like to submit a request for my account to be deleted/reset due to my experiences.",

I believe that currently the online accounts are not sufficient. I would like the government to help persons like me, to allow more control over their online account.",
