According to the NHS over \u00a370M was invested by the government by 2021. However, our children are currently subject to public weigh-ins facing embarrassment and receiving labels regarding their body weight. The implications of such actions are causing children self esteem/ body issues. We therefore recommend private weigh-ins to avoid such consequences.",
