        "additional_details": "With a flat mortality rate of 1%, 39,000 lives will be lost to COVID-19 before quarantines are put in place. That is inhumane. No human life is expendable. Italy has warned that the UK is in danger with the measures they are trying to take at this moment. This plan is NOT safe.",
        "background": "The Government's plan to delay quarantines and lockdowns until 60% of the population is infected will result in a mass amount of deaths across the country. Other countries have proven the effective methods; quarantines and lockdowns. The PM needs to reconsider before it is too late.",
