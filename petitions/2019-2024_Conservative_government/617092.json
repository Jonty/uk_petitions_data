GP\u2019s, and women and girls themselves need thorough training on women\u2019s reproductive diseases and conditions. Women are not being diagnosed for reproductive diseases for up to 8 years in the UK (Perez, 2020: 224). Women\u2019s bodies have not been considered important enough for GP\u2019s to spend more than a 1/2 hour optional study on them (McCall, 2021: Channel 4).",
        "background": "1) require GP\u2019s be deeply trained in reproductive health to diagnose endometriosis, fibriods, ovarian cysts, peri/menopause +;\r\n2) educate girls in schools & women in community health centres for preventative reproductive self-diagnosis; and \r\n3) give funding yearly for reproductive health research.",
