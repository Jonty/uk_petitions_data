        "additional_details": "The afore mentioned individual should already be regarded as a national hero for his role in the Second World War, spending his youth fighting for the freedoms that we in modern day Britain enjoy. He clearly wasn\u2019t done being a hero. Raising more than \u00a312,000,000 at the age of 99 is an unbelievable achievement and shows that he remains, to this a day, a true hero. As such, we believe he is more than deserving of a full Knighthood for his efforts.",
        "background": "I think the UK government should present the monarchy with information on the actions of Captain Tom Moore, a 99 year old WW2 Veteran who has managed to raise over \u00a312,000,000 for the NHS.",
