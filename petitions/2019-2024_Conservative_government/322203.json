        "additional_details": "Legalising cannabis could generate up to \u00a33.5 billion per year for the treasury, as well as save costs associated with responding to crime and health problems associated with black market cannabis use. It would also allow medicinal cannabis to become accessible for lower income families who currently cannot afford to obtain a private prescription. \r\n\r\nRecent legalisation in some US states and Canada has shown it dose not increase crime. For example, after legalising Cannabis in 2014, Colorado experienced both increased state revenue and a decrease in violent crime.  At this time where every penny counts, this would be a very easy way for the government to raise some",
