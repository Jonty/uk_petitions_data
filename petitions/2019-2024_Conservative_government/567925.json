        "additional_details": "The BIP payment should be increased to allow for sufficient trading to occur in order for these payments to be made. In addition, all CBILS lenders should be encouraged to offer 10 year CBILS offerings. the Virus has impacted everyone far more than initially anticipated and therefore some flexibility on these matters would be very well received.",
        "background": "In March, when the CBILS loan was announced, the Government agreed to cover the first 12 months of interest as a Business Interruption Payment (BIP). For those early applicants, the first payments will be due soon but the virus has not allowed sufficient trading to allow for this.",
