        "action": "Make it law that both parents automatically get 50:50 custody on separation.",
        "additional_details": "The current system is already over run with child arrangement cases and this time should be better used to deal with the most complex and challenging cases.\r\n\r\nIn most situations it\u2019s just down to the control of one parent who dictates access. If both parents automatically had the legal right to equal access (unless safeguarding were already involved). Then only the more challenging cases would go to court, this saving time, money and the emotional damage to peoples wellbeing, mainly the children.",
        "background": "This petition is to request that the government amends the Children's Act to reflect the dynamics of family units in todays society, and that on separation, a child/children would automatically have the right to equal access (50/50) to both parents, unless any safeguarding concerns are apparent.",
