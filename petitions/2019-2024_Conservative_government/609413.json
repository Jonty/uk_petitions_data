        "additional_details": "My mother doesn\u2019t have GCSE maths. She\u2019s an incredible English tutor & has taught English, Media & drama in schools. She would never have been able to help all these people if she hadn\u2019t gone to uni (without a student loan it would have been impossible). These tests don\u2019t always test actual intelligence. Students must tick boxes and some of the brightest individuals struggle. That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t deserve access to higher education in an environment that might suit them better.",
        "background": "It is essential that everybody has the chance to go to university. Some people don\u2019t get these GCSEs because of the school they go to which might be in a poorer area. It is completely unfair to block them from making the leap to higher education just because of where they live.",
