Decisions about requesting an extradition are taken on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\nThe Sexual Offences Act 2003 permits the criminal courts of England and Wales to exercise jurisdiction over the following categories of person:\r\n\r\n- a UK national who does an act in a country outside the UK, and the act (if done in England and Wales) would constitute one of the offences listed in Schedule 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003\r\n- a UK resident who does an act in a country outside the UK, where that act constitutes an offence under the law in force in that country, and the act (if done in England and Wales) would constitute one of the offences listed in Schedule 2 Sexual Offences Act 2003\r\n- a person who does an act in a country outside the UK at a time when they were not a UK national or resident, where that act constituted an offence under the law in force in that country, the act (if done in England and Wales) would have constituted one of the offences listed in Schedule 2 Sexual Offences Act 2003, and the person is a UK national or resident at the time when criminal proceedings are brought\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for changes to the Sexual Offences Act 2003, or asking the UK Government to seek changes to its extradition agreement with Thailand, but it would need to be clear what changes you want."
