This proposal could benefit both local businesses, residents of usual car meet areas, reduce the number of illegal meets preventing pointless stop and searches by already under funded police, and the wider car community that have a safe place. Keeping safety as the main priority whilst enriching an otherwise lacking area for leisure activities.",
        "background": "Provide a safe space where car enthusiasts can meet and show off their vehicles in an area that poses no danger to drivers using roads/car parks. Car meets are a regular occurrence and are hard to police to keep everyone safe. The majority aren\u2019t set in Wales and there is a community not spoken for.",
