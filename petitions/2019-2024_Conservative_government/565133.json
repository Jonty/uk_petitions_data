        "additional_details": "At the Climate Ambition Summit 12/12/2020, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he will cut carbon emissions by at least 68% in the next 10 years, whilst reminding world leaders of their responsibility to tackling climate change while encouraging other countries to take more action. Prof Sir Brian Hoskins said: \"Mr Johnson's target is ambitious, but we need action to back it up, right now\u201d. \r\nSigning this petition will help decrease carbon emissions, and lead the way for other countries to follow.",
        "background": "We must stop importing fresh produce from the EU via lorries, and actively encourage UK farmers to start farming for Britain again. The Carbon Footprint of locally produced fresh produce is far less than imported tomatoes from Spain, with a round trip of 2'000 miles.",
