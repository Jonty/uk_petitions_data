        "additional_details": "The reason I\u2019d like this to happen is to prevent sexual harassment and assault against women at gyms all over the country. Many of us feel unsafe in normal gyms. I also feel this would help people with social anxiety and a fear of being harassed. Too many women have suffered, from non consensual videos/photos being taken of them when they\u2019re only trying to exercise, to groping and staring. I believe making women\u2019s only gyms more accessible would help with this issue and would encourage exercise.",
