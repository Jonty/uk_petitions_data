        "action": "A furlough scheme or financial aid for those made redundant due to Covid-19.",
        "additional_details": "While employees continue to benefit from a furlough scheme, those made redundant face a crippled job market with no financial aid other than weekly JSA (\u00a358.90 for 18-24's, \u00a374.35 for 25+). This is NOT ENOUGH and hardworking people are at risk of losing their homes and/or depleting the savings they had put aside for housing deposits/children's education. Meanwhile, the \"retraining scheme\" doesn't even cater for those who already have qualifications, many of whom also have student debt.",
        "background": "Parliament must recognise the 695,000+ people who left company payrolls since March as a result of Covid-19. To help, they must consider rent/mortgage breaks, increased JSA, salary based JSA, or salary based payouts to those made redundant before 2 years service (who aren't entitled to any payout).",
