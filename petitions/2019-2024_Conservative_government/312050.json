It has been acknowledged how school and college students will be unable to perform in their exams and thus have been cancelled. However, while the government may not have a say on university exams, they can ease some of the strain on students by providing comfort in knowing they will not be in debt due to such circumstances and also not feel restricted by lack of income in their final term.",
        "background": "University students are under a lot of pressure at the moment to attain at a high standard while also worrying about lack of resources and family members who may be sick or are sick themselves. To be expected to still pay back tuition fees and maintenance loans is unrealistic and harmful.",
