        "additional_details": "Students should be awarded CAGs based off the grades they would have been expected to get under normal circumstances not from 5 months of missed schooling. This structure of awarding CAGs will not take into account students work ethic and their true academic ability. Many students will receive grades that will not allow them to get into university and will be extremely detrimental to their future. \r\n\r\nThe amount of missed schooling and quality of online learning should be taken into consideration.",
        "background": "Recently it was announced that summer exams will not take place as normal due to the pandemic and student will receive CAGs. These CAGS will be awarded as the grades that students would have gotten due to the pandemic, not taking into account students ability under normal circumstances.",

For example, you could start a new petition asking for a specific change to the Government's current guidance on how CAGs should be calculated. You could also start a new petition calling for a different system, such as changing CAGS to UCAS predicted grades, if that's something that you'd like to happen. "
