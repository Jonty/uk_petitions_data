        "additional_details": "We have ALL faced unprecedented challenges during the recent COVID19 crisis. Key Workers have been the backbone of our country. There has been a profession that hasn't benefited from the admiration that the NHS has seen. It is right that the NHS and all Key Workers receive official recognition but without schools facing the challenges head on, many Key Workers would have been able to function in their roles. Schools have looked after those that we hold dearest - our very future. Our children.",

Everyone has had to face extreme adversity and show remarkable resilience but there are those who have gone above & beyond who enabled Key Workers to be able to go to work.",
