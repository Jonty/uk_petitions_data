        "action": "Make fit to fly PCR tests and arrival PCR tests available at a fixed or no cost.",
        "additional_details": "With the Secretary of State for Transport already admitting that PCR tests are excessive, with private companies unfairly profiting from tests that are cheap to administer, and with restrictions likely to be lifted on 19th July, there is no reason why fit to fly and arrival PCR tests are not provided by the Government at a fixed or no cost. The requirement for testing is a government obligation and thus the cost of the test needs to be regulated or overseen at the very least by the Government.",
        "background": "With the restrictions to be lifted on 19th July, the Government should make fit to fly and arrival PCR tests available at no cost or at a low cost. Other countries, some with lower GDP than the UK i.e Madeira have made fit to fly tests free for travellers, travel PCR tests should be free.",
