        "action": "Legislation needed to ensure recycling sewage into drinking water is ultra safe.",
        "additional_details": "Water Companies are often found guilty in the courts by flouting UK law demonstrating significant disdain for environmental regulation. As such, the public requires robust protection, reassurance and monitoring from regulators that demands provision of drinking water made from sewage is 100% free from pharmaceuticals, chemicals, nano-plastics & other threats to public heath  to high standards. The public needs legal protection from water companies who typically prioritise profit over compliance.",
        "background": "The UK's first ever plant for recycling sewage into drinking water is being planned by a water company. It's imperative that government regulators have legislation in place that will protect/secure public health from all aspects of recycled sewage for families who will have no option but to drink it",
