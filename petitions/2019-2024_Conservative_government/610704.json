        "additional_details": "The mayor has already imposed massive expansion and ever-increasing hikes to the congestion charge. The proposed ULEZ changes are another huge burden on London road users who already pay some of the highest fees to drive locally than anywhere else in Europe. \r\n\r\nWe ask the government to stop the mayor from using vehicle owners as London cash cows and offer alternatives such as:\r\n* Introducing green discounts on newer vehicles\r\n* Green scrappage schemes\r\n* Green travel discounts for using public transport",
        "background": "Sadiq Khan is proposing all London boroughs should be ULEZ areas meaning hundreds of thousands of motorbike, van, lorry and car users will have to pay \u00a312.50 per day to use their car. We ask the government to direct the Mayor of London to investigate alternatives to ULEZ in outer London boroughs",
