Not only did British students study poorly, but International students had it worse, considering that many did not even return to schools, being too scared to. It is also very unfair for regular GCSEs to be cancelled and not the international grades; we are human too! Secondly, CIE & Edexcel don't care about students mental health (too long)...",
