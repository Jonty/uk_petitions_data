        "additional_details": "The homeless are often dependent on donations or support from the wider public. This is a petition to parliament to put in place measures which will ensure that the homeless have free access to vital provisions during the outbreak. We ask that homeless charities be granted with priority access to basic supplies to distribute to those in need, and that sufficient funds are allocated to charities for the purchase of those supplies, including food, clean water and medicine.",
        "background": "The government's emergency measures to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak have now virtually shut down the UK with all but key workers directed to social distance and remain indoors unless travel is essential. Although necessary, these measures will have a severe impact on the homeless population.",
