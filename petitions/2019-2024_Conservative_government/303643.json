        "additional_details": "Currently anyone on a zero hour contract, including agency workers, part time workers or low paid workers are not entitled to statutory sick pay. Given the current situation the country is in with regards to the corona virus, it is unfair that these workers should be entitled to nothing, should they be unable to work. This includes myself. I work full time hours, however I am currently entitled to nothing should I be unable to go to work due to the corona virus.",
