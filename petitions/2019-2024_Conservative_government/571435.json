        "additional_details": "Instead, students should be based off of latest completed mock assessments, target grades, work done in lockdown, and recent work attitude. This will ensure grades are fair for students and those who deserve the top grades can get them, without the pressure of any form of exam, no matter how 'mini' it may be",
        "background": "Covid has his stuents hard. Months of learning have been missed out on, and, while the traditional exams have been cancelled, they have been replaced with more exams. However 'mini' these may be, it simply is not fair for students to be sitting any forms of exams, as so much leaning has been missed",
