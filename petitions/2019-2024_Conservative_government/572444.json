These employers and employees are suffering due to not being eligible to claim furlough for these employees, when it was the government's guidelines that closed non essential businesses on the 20th December 2020. These employers are now having to choose to pay or not to pay these employees for the months that the business' remain closed. This is putting additional pressure on both employers and employees that find themselves in the above situation. Employers having to decide if they should pay them or issue them their P45. The CJRS was supposed to help STOP termination of employment but employers are being left with no choice but to do this.",
