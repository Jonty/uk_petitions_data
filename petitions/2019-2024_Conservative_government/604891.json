Various countries have tried different options, from DNA databases and fining dog owners, to creating biogas lamps fuelled by dog waste. One way or another, the solution must come from the state and it must come quickly - this problem is not going anywhere.",

Left hanging in the hedgerows, these will neither bio-degrade nor compost as their makers promise, but remain in our countryside adding to the blight of litter that mars our beautiful nature.",
