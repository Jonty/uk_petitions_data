        "additional_details": "For me Personally, both myself and my partner are self employed. My partner only went self employed in March 2020 and therefore is not eligible for support. This leaves us in a very vulnerable position while we are not able to work due to current lockdown conditions. Having access to only the extended self employed scheme at 40% will mean that we are not able to pay our bills and will push us into hardship. As the furlough scheme still offers 80% it seems unjust that we are only offered 40%",
        "background": "To support the UK Self Employed businesses fairly and inline with the current furlough scheme which offers 80% of salary. The self employed scheme only offers 40% of your average salary, which for most of us is not enough to live off. While we are forced to close adequate support should be offered.",
