        "additional_details": "Wearing masks will only help if the majority do it (and do it properly - not under their nose/mouth). If doctors can provide codes (maybe QR codes) people could have on their phone or on a tag around their neck/wrist that could be scanned & checked, it would stop people lying to avoid wearing one. Fines must be heavy and non-entry must be enforced for those unjustifiably not wearing a mask. People also need to be educated on how to safely wear a mask and (if disposable) dispose of it.",
        "background": "With masks now becoming compulsory in shops as well as on public transport (and hopefully soon all indoors places), and people with medical reasons being exempt, more people will lie to avoid wearing one. Let doctors issue verifiable codes for those who are genuinely unable to wear a mask.",
