        "action": "Stop or delay on-campus teaching for medical students during lockdown.",
        "additional_details": "It is unfair for medical students and staffs to risk their lives. No subject or teaching should be above human lives. We understand that medical field is special but all lives are equal. Practicals and laboratories can be delayed and compensated when the situation becomes safe and stable. This decision is also unfair for international students who cannot travel due to travel restrictions and face unaffordable flight & quarantine fees.",
        "background": "Medical students should not be asked to attend on-campus learning because of the current uncertain and deteriorated situation of Covid. The government should close universities temporarily without exceptions. Teaching can be conducted in alternative ways but lives should be valued and respected.",
