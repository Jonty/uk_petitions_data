        "action": "Start a national anti-litter campaign raising awareness across all age groups.",
        "additional_details": "We need an advertising and education campaign targeted at the general public and schools, getting people to reevaluate their littering habits and to stop and think about the real life consequences of their actions; litter must be binned or taken home without exception. The next generation need to understand the detrimental effects it has on wildlife and to passionately believe it\u2019s their duty to  not drop litter of any kind and contaminate the countryside. We only have one planet Earth, love it.",
        "background": "With the easing of lockdown has come the return of litter, suffocating landscapes and coastlines. I believe we need a national campaign to educate people of all ages on the consequences litter has for wildlife and the future of the planet, and that littering, in any form, is completely unacceptable.",
