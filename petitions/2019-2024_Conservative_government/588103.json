        "additional_details": "The gastronomy industry is struggling finding Chefs. Because Chefs are getting fed up, working over 12 hours a day, and getting an incredibly low pay. If they work over time, calculated many get less than \u00a36 an hour. Many contracts for Chefs state, that they need to work according to the need of the pub/restaurant. Due to the shortage of staff, most Chefs work 80 hours a week.\r\nNo one wants to work for that poor pay.",
        "background": "Get a Union for the Industry of Chefs, regulated the hours legally, enforce it legally. No more horrendous over time. \r\nAnd make it illegal to not having to pay over time. Get these Chefs better pay & hours or the industry is going to die.",
