        "action": "STOP energy companies charging extortionate prices for domestic supplies.",
        "additional_details": "Government insists it is doing its best to alleviate energy costs but refuses to cut HUGE profit being taken by allowing energy companies to charge the highest price for electricity by basing it on gas prices.  Energy companies are receiving huge amounts of electricity being generated by renewables at a fraction of the cost of electricity being generated by gas from Russia (domestic solar generators are currently paid 5p per Kwh by companies who sell it to the people for 56p).  This must stop.",
        "background": "Energy companies are charging domestic energy use at the same rate as it is for producing energy using gas to power generator stations when they are receiving electricity into the grid from wind and solar generation across the country at hugely less than they pay Russia for the gas they use.",
