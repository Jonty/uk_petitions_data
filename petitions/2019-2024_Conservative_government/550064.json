        "background": "Israel is a settler colonial state with ever expanding borders and settlements, that reduce the possibility of a peace settlement everyday. As we will be free from EU legislation, we should lead the way in sanctioning Israel to stop the violent ethnic cleansing regime, recognise Palestine and peace.",
