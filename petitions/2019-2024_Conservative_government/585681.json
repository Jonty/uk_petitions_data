The cause of inequality has been discussed, debated and accepted in political circles for the last 400 years. Inequality is caused by a particular set of conditions, namely; Freedom under Law or rather restraint for the many, freedom from obligation for the few. The whole point of Conservatism is the conservation of those conditions. Do we therefore have a legal State?",
