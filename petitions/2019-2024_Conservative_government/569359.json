I am one within a huge group of individuals who have suffered a difficult and long winded diagnosis. Sometimes when the diagnosis is made it is too late and the condition has caused infertility and other health issues. If endo etc is taught in schools there will be more awareness and the length of time to diagnose will reduce.",

On average it takes 7.5 years for a woman to be diagnosed with endo, this is often due to the condition being misdiagnosed as there is little awareness.",
