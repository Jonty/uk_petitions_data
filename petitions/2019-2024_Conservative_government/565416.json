        "additional_details": "The government have given us an extra 3 weeks to catch up which is only 90 school hours. \r\nMy concern is a lot of students haven\u2019t been given the time to be taught face to face. No video calls, only work being set over show my homework with no help. Now time is more important than ever due to these new strands and more cases than the first lockdown. It blows my mind how I can go to school and see and sit with over 200 students in a small space but I cannot see my mum due to her being high risk?",
        "background": "On March 23rd 2020 the uk went into lockdown. On the 18th of March the announcement that GCSE and a-level were cancelled despite they only had 2 months which they could of still taken them. We were then aloud back into school on the 3rd of September meaning we missed 450 learning hours.",
