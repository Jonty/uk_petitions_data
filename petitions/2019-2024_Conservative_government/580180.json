        "additional_details": "We have seen many Politicians that say they will do something, but never seem to act on it. This is plainly seen in many manifesto promises that never materialise. I believe the British Public deserve to know why that is. I think an extension of the livestreaming service to all sectors and meetings in government would be ideal, but this would be a logistical nightmare. Livestreaming cabinet meetings will be a good compromise, holding important political figures accountable for their words",
