        "additional_details": "The chronic illness/disabled community have benefited from the restrictions of COVID-19. The flexibility of working, or learning from home has allowed the disabled community to feel and work better. Prior to this disabled people, or those with chronic illnesses have had to risk their own wellbeing in order to complete work. There is a lack of information on how COVID will affect people with autoimmune diseases in the long term, so allowing for continued inclusivity would be beneficial for all.",
        "background": "Allow employers, education and independent businesses to continue flexibility post pandemic, such as home learning. Increase support by providing services for those with health anxiety post pandemic and the easing of restrictions which have made them feel safe and included in normal life.",
