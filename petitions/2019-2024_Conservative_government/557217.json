        "additional_details": "I believe that the Government/Parliament should close schools during the second lockdown. I believe this as they are a mass gathering. A family of 10 aren't allowed to meet up yet a year group of about 100 or 200 pupils are allowed to meet, all from different families (and inside). All it takes is one pupil to go into school with Covid-19 with no symptoms and cause an outbreak within that school which would lead to further outbreaks. If schools were closed there would be no needless outbreaks.",
        "background": "I believe that schools should be closed during the second national lockdown. Online lessons should be provided for everyone until the Covid-19 cases have drastically reduced in number.",
