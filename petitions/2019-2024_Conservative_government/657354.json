Regrettably, unauthorised encampments frequently cause disturbances and, in severe instances, entirely obstruct individuals' ability to utilise their nearby green spaces. Our goal is to ensure that our play parks and green spaces are free from unauthorised encampments at all times, so that they are accessible to all individuals.",
        "background": "We want the Government to pass legislation which would allow local authorities to ringfence play areas and parks so that they have the authority to immediately move on any unauthorised encampments so as not to deny or deprive people of access to local green spaces.",
