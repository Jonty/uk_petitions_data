        "action": "Bring back face to face consultations with GPs and stop telephone triage system.",
        "additional_details": "Doctors surely make a better assessment of a patients health by their visual appearance. Many people find it difficult to explain their situation over the phone and a doctor can often see that a patient is perhaps not giving a complete picture of their problems. By having a face to face consultation people open up more. Some people may not feel comfortable having a telephone conversation from their home for all sorts of reasons. People with serious issues will fall through the net.",
        "background": "Restore GP surgeries to pre Covid working practices and stop telephone appointment system which can lead to a double appointment and longer wait if the GP then decides he\u2019ll see you anyway. Dentists and Opticians see patients, why can\u2019t GPs?",
