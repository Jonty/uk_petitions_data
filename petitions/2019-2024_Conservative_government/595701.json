        "action": "Introduce a statutory limit on COVID-19 testing fees",
        "additional_details": "Private firms are extorting the British public with overpriced PCR tests which are invaluable in the fight against COVID-19. The government should act to support the public by limiting COVID-19 tests to a statutorily fixed price below \u00a350 including shipping.\r\n\r\nThe pandemic is likely to affect us for years and current policy is hindering people's ability to travel and visit their loved ones. It is also obstructing economic recovery by discouraging tourism and international business.",
        "background": "Bring in regulation to prevent private COVID-19 testing firms from extorting the public with overpriced profiteering. Introduce a statutory limit on COVID-19 testing fees such as in other countries e.g. France \u00a342/\u20ac49.\r\n\r\nPCR tests are critical for our public health and must be accessible to all.",
