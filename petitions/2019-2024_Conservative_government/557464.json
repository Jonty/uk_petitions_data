        "additional_details": "Football is a huge part of local community life, with many children playing and training each week. We have children from all parts of life, and all backgrounds and for some this is the only time they get out of their houses and be part of something special.\r\n\r\nFootball is a way to release energy, keep fit, make friends, learn new skills and have a chance to achieve new goals.\r\n\r\nCoaches put so much time into being covid secure and maintaining distancing and a safe environment to train and play.",
        "background": "If schools are to be kept open with children mixing in classes of 30, then why does grassroots football have to stop?  We coaches are covid secure, with social distancing in place, and plenty of fresh air to keep the children happy and healthy. \r\n\r\nKeep youth football alive and running as normal.",
