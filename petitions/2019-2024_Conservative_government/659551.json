        "additional_details": "The current uniform is outdated in majority of schools. No child should be forced to wear a blazer, shirt and tie. All uniforms should be smart casual. Polo, trousers and shoes and a shorts option for summer. It would be cost effective for families. Children with ADHD or autism would prefer smart casual uniform because children don't like feeling restricted. It would create a happier environment in schools. I think this is a really serious issue and it needs addressing. Please get with the times",

Schools need to follow this trend and go more smart casual. Trousers, shoes and polo with school logo. #nomoreschoolblazers",
