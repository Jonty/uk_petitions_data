We have been told repeatedly that Social Distancing is one of the only ways in which we can stop this deadly virus in its tracks, yet the UK Government see fit to continue to allow 15,000 people PER DAY to enter the UK, some of these from Covid19 hotspots, without any testing or quarantine rules being applied. This is Criminal and goes against all policy and guidance on this subject",
        "background": "We request that the UK Government close our borders immediately in an attempt to stop the spread of Covid19. We also seek the UK Government to apply strict health-checks and Quarantine rules on any remaining repatriation flights which are seeking to land at UK airports",
