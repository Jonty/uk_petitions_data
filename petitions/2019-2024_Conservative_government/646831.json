        "additional_details": "Of 462 polls since July 2017 asking if Brexit was right or wrong or if we would now vote Remain or Leave, 431 back Remain (with just 10 for Leave and 21 tied).\r\n\r\nA further 159 polls since Nov 2021 show 155 backing Rejoin the EU with only 4 for Staying out.\r\n\r\nNo poll since May 2022 has supported Leaving/Staying out. All 244 polls since then have been in favour of Remain/Rejoin with a lead of up to 29% and a recent average of 19%.\r\n\r\nDemocracy means the right to change your mind. It is time to Rejoin.",
