        "additional_details": "I believe that the following, should be the new standard. \r\nAny sex crime should be punishable with a minimum of 7 years without parole. \r\nAny sex crime committed against persons under the age of 16 should be punishable by 15 years without parole.\r\nAny cases of rape of a child under the age of 13 should be punishable by 2 life sentences ie 50 years without parole. \r\nI believe these changes provide some justice for victims who will suffer eternally and act as a deterant to prevent such crimes.",
        "background": "It's time that victims of sex related crimes ie rape, molestation, grooming etc, get proper justice where possible. The small minority of the people that commit these types of crimes that are successfully put behind bars, don't receive harsh enough punishment.",
