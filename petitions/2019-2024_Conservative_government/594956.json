His work I. Daniel Blake, brought serious needed attention to a system that was in place should we find hardship, where people were being left without benefits. This created some government reform around the jobcentres. We cannot let Keir Starmer keep dismantling Labour from the inside, when who we need is a strong opposition leader.",
