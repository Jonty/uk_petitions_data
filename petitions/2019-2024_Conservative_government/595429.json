Heather moors are a haven for many types of wildlife  you might see a curlew, black grouse, ring ouzel, field vole, merlin, short-eared owl, adder a red grouse. We have a duty to protect all habitats and not to lose some that seem less important than others . They are visually beautiful particularly in August when the heather blooms . They are under threat and will be sadly missed if they are not allowed to be managed and conserved .",

There are number of protections that already apply to areas of the countryside, and establishing additional protections are largely a matter for local authorities and other authorities responsible for areas of the countryside.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about protected areas of the countryside here: https://www.gov.uk/check-your-business-protected-area\r\n\r\nIf there are specific changes you want to be made to the framework for how areas of the countryside are protected, you could start a new petition, but would need to explain clearly what changes you would like the Government or Parliament to make to existing rules."
