        "additional_details": "The policies the government have pursued in re to the covid pandemic have failed to meet the stated objectives and are based on flawed modelling. The measures taken have failed to fight the pandemic and have caused untold misery and suffering to the general population, not to mention the effect on other health issues that are being ignored as a result. The government should replace Patrick Vallance and Chris Whitty with competent experts who will base their advice on reality.",
        "background": "Seeing that all the predictions and scenarios outlined by Patrick Vallance and Chris Whitty have failed to materialise, the government should replace them with experts that actually know what they are doing.",
