        "additional_details": "Students should not have to pay the same tuition fees for a reduced use of facilities. Students should have semester 1 fees reduced if online teaching is the only option in relation to COVID-19. Students already face high tuition rates with most paying \u00a39250. Why should a student pay the same price they would pay to use all university facilities whenever they are being taught online thus depleting the use of facilities?",
        "background": "It has been heard in the news that semester 1 starting September 2020 for university students will likely have to be done through online teaching. However, students will still be charged the full tuition despite not being able to use all university facilities.",
