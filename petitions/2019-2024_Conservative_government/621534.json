        "additional_details": "We urge the Goverment to, at the very least, place strict limits on how much an energy company can raise a monthy Direct Debit amount without consent, and to ensure that the provision to pay bills in full upon issue, is made a mandatory requirement by energy companies and without penalty or levy. This way, the consumer can instead place their energy fund in their own savings accounts and received the interest on their own money.",
        "background": "The original intent of the Direct Debit was for inviduals and households to budget according to their requirements.  With the energy crisis and rising caps, we are seeing energy companies significantly increase Direct Debits without consent, seemingly in order to bolster finances. This need to stop.",
