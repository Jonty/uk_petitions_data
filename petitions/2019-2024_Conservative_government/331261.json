Since April 2019, new and expectant mothers have been able to access specialist perinatal mental health community services in every part of the country. Community health services have continued to provide support during the pandemic through greater use of digital and remote technologies, prioritising higher needs families.\r\n\r\nBaby and toddler groups are important community facilities crucial to the wellbeing of new parents. Activities for young children and their families, such as baby and toddler groups, can operate provided they follow relevant government guidance, including guidance for community facilities which are now able to open for the provision of services for children and young people. Guidance on which premises and businesses are legally able to open can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-businesses-and-premises-to-close.\r\n\r\nBaby and toddler groups should also have regard to, and where relevant, ensure they are following government guidance on the safe use of multi-purpose community facilities, which can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-safe-use-of-multi-purpose-community-facilities.

In its landmark report, the Committee urged the Government to meet with the sector to ensure necessary support was received. \nThe Committee wrote to the Government in September when it emerged the lack of clarity within the guidance was forcing many groups to close.  \nChair of the Petitions Committee, Catherine McKinnell said:\n\u201cThe recent addition of parent, baby and toddler groups to the list of exemptions from gathering limits in all tiers is a clear, if long overdue, acknowledgement by the Government that they are vital to young families and our society as a whole.\n\u201cOur inquiry heard compelling evidence from new parents and experts on how crucial these groups can be for the mental health of new parents, providing support and a much-needed lifeline at such an important time in their lives.\n\u201cThis addition to the guidance on exemptions is testament to our petitioners and campaigners who worked tirelessly to demand clarity for the sector, and of the power of the petitions system. \n\u201cBecause of these petitioners\u2019 drive for change, many who otherwise might not have had the support they need will be able to access these groups during what has been, and continues to be, an extremely challenging time for new parents.\u201d\nWhat does the new guidance say?\nWith the updated guidance now explicitly mentioning these groups, many are now clearly exempt from gatherings limits. The official exemptions in all tiers include: \n\u2022 Supervised activities provided for children, including wraparound care (before and after-school childcare), groups and activities for under 18s, and children\u2019s playgroups, for formal support groups, and parent and child groups \u2013 up to 15 people aged five and older.\n\u2022 In the guidance for early years and childcare providers, the following exemptions are included:\no   Parent and child groups that meet in Ofsted registered settings can operate in all local restriction tiers. \no   Groups meeting in community spaces, such as in a place of worship, community centre or library, can operate in all local restriction tiers and should follow COVID secure guidance for the venue.\nRead the full guidance here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures#parent-and-child-groups \nRead about the Committee\u2019s report here: https://houseofcommons.shorthandstories.com/how-has-maternity-and-parental-leave-been-impacted-by-coronavirus-/index.html \nRead the letter to the Government here: https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/2699/documents/26695/default/ \nAnd the Government\u2019s reply here: https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/2970/documents/28398/default/ \n",
