This therefore limits affordability of payments made by the government for relatives whose deaths and injuries are recognised as vaccine related.\r\nThe windfall tax would create a fund which will provide for long term support for those injured by the \u201csafe and effective\u201d vaccines promoted by the government.",
        "background": "The government saw fit to create a windfall tax on the energy companies. The  profits of the energy companies are dwarfed by the massive profits pharmaceutical companies have made in the course of the covid pandemic.",
