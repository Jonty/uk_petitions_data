This is an impossible task as the consulates are closed, meaning that even family members and friends of British citizens from Ukraine can't come to visit them at this hour of need. The UK parliament should temporarily lift visa requirements for Ukrainians so they can seek shelter in the country. This act will help the civilian population much more than any words of comfort, hopes or prayers.",
