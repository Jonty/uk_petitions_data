        "additional_details": "With me personally not having GCSE exams due to being the class of 2020, most people for example who have moved from year 11 to year 12 have massively struggled. With the content being vastly different to the GCSE curriculum we struggle with vaster concepts especially with teachers focusing on the year 11\u2019s and 13\u2019s as it\u2019s their exam year we struggle in term, we need to have our grades based upon our course work and attitude to learning to provide us with a better representation of us pupils.",
        "background": "The pupils that are sitting exams in 2022 should have their exams cancelled without question! With us missing out on so much learning due to the current pandemic it would be unfair to provide exams to pupils that have missed out on the necessary learning they need to complete the exams, it\u2019s unfair.",
