        "additional_details": "The list of valid ID for voters is heavily biased away from a young/less affluent demographic and instead favours older, car-driving or passport-holding citizens. This is voter suppression and is wholly unacceptable in a democracy. It is a clear attempt to skew results in favour of the ruling party.\r\nDisenfranchising a vast slew of voters is wrong.",
        "background": "Voter fraud is extremely rare and the ID measures introduced under the Elections Bill are unnecessary and anti-democratic. Either withdraw the ID requirement or expand the list to include things like the CitizenCard and Post Office Pass Card to ensure equality of access to the democratic process.",
