        "additional_details": "Junior doctors basic pay starts off at minimum wage and many of them are struggling to pay rent in the early years of their training despite working gruelling hours under poor conditions with limited access to PPE during the coronavirus pandemic. It\u2019s about time the government recognised the need to fairly compensate key workers holding up the backbone of the NHS.",
        "background": "The new government pay rise of 2.8% is the government\u2019s response to critical healthcare workers putting their lives at risk during the covid-19 pandemic. HOWEVER - this does not include any junior doctors (majority of front line workers) or paramedics. We must change this now!",
