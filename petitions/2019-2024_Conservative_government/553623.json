        "additional_details": "The UK music sector contributes over \u00a35bn to the UK economy with \u00a31.1bn coming from live events. Live music provides direct employment for around 30,000 people. Many of these are hard-developed and trained for careers. \r\nThere is also a groundswell of mental health issues as a result of lockdown, both in the providers and consumers of music. Live entertainment has a huge role to play in mitigating this.\r\nThe sector doesn't simply want hand-outs, it needs to be able to operate safely.",
        "background": "As a solo performer I have had around 50 shows cancelled, in part due to lack of guidance from the gov't on how live entertainment can take place. By convening a group of experts in H&S and live events, a robust plan of support and guidance could be developed ensuring the health of the live sector.",
