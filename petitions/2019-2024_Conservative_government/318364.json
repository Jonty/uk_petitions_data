This has included prescription collection and delivery, shopping deliveries (particularly during the panic buying phase), and has been a central point for grocery donations from local businesses. The team have worked non-stop to support those in need, and their actions have certainly limited illness and spread, as well as eased worry amongst the vulnerable. This needs recognition.",
