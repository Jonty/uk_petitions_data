        "additional_details": "It is impossible to guarantee a level playing field for exams due to the ongoing impact of the COVID pandemic. Some students have missed weeks of school due to self-isolation.\r\nDue to Wales cancelling all 2021 exams, the government should work on a national approach to ensure consistency. \r\nCancelling exams would also give time for teaching to continue through the summer term. The uncertainty of exams is becoming detrimental to mental health and wellbeing, this solution would be very beneficial.",
        "background": "Cancel all 2021 exams due to the ongoing impact COVID is having on teaching and learning. In recent light of Wales cancelling their exams, it is only fair to remain consistent with this approach. Cancel exams and allow for CAGs to be the grades received next summer or at least reduce exam content.",
