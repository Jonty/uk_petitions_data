        "additional_details": "It has come to our attention that in the UK we know so much about black history in the USA but know very little about our own. It is important that our youth are educated about these matters or else we face the erasure of history. We are a multicultural country yet we hardly know why that is anymore. It's time for us to face our history so we can understand systematic racism and learn how to undo it.",
        "background": "In both primary and secondary school education there is a lack of teaching in regards to Britains history with racism. The government/parliament would introduce Black British history and British Imperialism to the secondary curriculum and get teachers to start discussing racism at primary school.",
