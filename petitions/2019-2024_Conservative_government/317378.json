A further 12 billion is recovered by stopping child benefit because all children will receive \u00a32500 per annum. To fund the short fall of \u00a358 billion, a quantitative easing mechanism should be used. As it's a better use of digital money created by Bank of England then buying Government Bonds to increase asset prices with the hope of increasing economic activity.",
