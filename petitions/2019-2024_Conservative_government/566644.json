        "additional_details": "As a drama school everything has to be carried out with approval from higher education. The staff at ArtsEd were prepared for us to return safely with testing and social distancing however we cannot go against the government so are at risk of closing. We had a whole term online last year. Our training is suffering and we cannot do anything about it unless parliament make the change that is necessary. You cannot have dance/singing/acting classes online and pay the full tuition. Please help us.",
        "background": "I am a musical theatre student at ArtsEd in London. We are a practical course that is impossible to carry out online. My school has put testing in place but is still at risk of closure (again)? The performing arts are just as important as anything else. Don\u2019t let our fees and our lives go to waste.",
