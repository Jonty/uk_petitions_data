This means they\u2019ve gotten 80% of their salary for doing no work. However they\u2019ve been saving on transport costs and such like. \r\nAll key workers who have worked during the pandemic should receive a pay rise. Those on minimum wage are clearly in professions worthy of more than minimum if they\u2019re essential to the running of the country and deserve the increase.",
