        "additional_details": "There is no scientific evidence, other than questionable and disputed hypothetical modelling, to suggest Lockdowns have saved a single life in 2020.\r\nThere are at least 28 scientific papers based on real empirical data that show Lockdowns either make no difference or even increase viral transmission and deaths.\r\nAn unacceptable number of excess deaths occurred in 2020 which have been linked to lockdown measures. This must never happen again.",
        "background": "Parliament should cease all current lockdown measures.\r\nParliament should follow Florida's example and apologise to the public for imposing Lockdowns and then pass legislation ruling out the use of Lockdowns in any future health crisis.",
