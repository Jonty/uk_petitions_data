        "additional_details": "For those who are not lucky enough to benefit from Occupational Maternity Pay, we are relying upon SMP from the government to pay our bills whilst on maternity leave, many having to cut short time with their baby as the drop from a full time salary/wage to just over \u00a3600 a month is not sustainable long term. \r\nDue to Covid 19 new mums and families are unable to leave their homes and therefore face the same hardships as everyone else claiming UC, which has been raised to counteract this.",
        "background": "Universal Credit has been raised to account for the fact that people are having financial hardship due to Covid 19 - SMP has not been included in this and we are reliant upon this money just like everyone else.",
