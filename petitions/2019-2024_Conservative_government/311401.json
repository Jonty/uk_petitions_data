        "additional_details": "After the government announcement on Thursday 26th March, Boris Johnson said he would leave nobody behind. He currently has those that are newly self employed with under 1 year and not currently done a tax return. \r\nIt has been made impossible for those that have a partner to get any help regarding UC if their partner is a key worker with a wage as they don\u2019t qualify. This has left a small amount in a difficult financial situation. And will have a serious impact on livelihoods.",
        "background": "If newly self employed under 1 year, but have 3 years employment history previous, and have paid national insurance in the last 3 years, to receive 80% of their previous earnings.\r\nBe able to qualify for UC if their partner is a key worker and still earning a wage as you currently can\u2019t claim.",
