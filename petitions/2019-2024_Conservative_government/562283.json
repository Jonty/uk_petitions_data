        "additional_details": "The World Health Organisation says that \"the practice is a violation of the victim\u2019s human rights...\" with \"immediate and long-term consequences that are detrimental to her physical, psychological and social well-being.\"\r\n\r\nThe WHO goes on, \"the examination has no scientific merit or clinical indication...there is no known examination that can prove a history of vaginal intercourse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Virginity testing\" is sexual assault, with life-long physical and emotional consequences. It must be banned.",
        "background": "\"Virginity testing\" is gender-based violence which is happening in the UK. The tests involve a vaginal examination to check if the hymen is intact. Yet, \"virginity\" is a social construct.\r\n\r\nThe Government must put an end to the abusive, unscientific, & violating \"virginity testing\" here in the UK.",
