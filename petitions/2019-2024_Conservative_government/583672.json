        "action": "This petition is to change the Covid rules on funerals",
        "additional_details": "To give the dignity and humane respect to mourners who are grieving the loss of a loved one. We saw a complete contradiction on Saturday where unvaccinated people were celebrating the first Saturday of a night out not keeping to social distancing and yet in a time of sadness and sorrow, there is a limit on those attending a last goodbye to a loved one at a funeral. This discriminative contradiction needs to be looked at and give justice to the most needed in this matter without delay.",
        "background": "The urgent review to lift the rules on funerals and the number of those attending? A funeral is not a gathering of strangers to party but it is a gathering of family and friends to say goodbye to a loved one. If the lifting of rules are good for unvaccinated drinkers it is good too for mourners.",
