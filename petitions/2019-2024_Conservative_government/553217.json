        "action": "Free public transport for secondary school pupils.",
        "additional_details": "If public transport was free for secondary school children, 11-16, it would mean that students would be able to make better choice in what school they want go to without worrying about the cost of travelling.  I fear that many vulnerable and low income families will be affected the most. It is a punishment for students with less well off families. The government should take action because it is an unnecessary cost that students pay every day. Boris should end this unfair cost.",
        "background": "This petition is for the government to make public transport free for students. Students who travel to school, pay from \u00a33 to \u00a37 each day. Hence, they spend \u00a3585 - \u00a31365 yearly. This money is going towards commuting to school which is a necessity for all students.",
