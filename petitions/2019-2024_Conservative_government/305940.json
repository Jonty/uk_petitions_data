Teachers know students abilities from continual assessment, this extra information is crucial. You will still get a range of results, they'll be more accurate, as an accumulation of different indicators. You can avoid cheating by completing assessments at school under monitored conditions. It will show understanding and creativity, not just an ability to memorise the nuances of mark schemes.",

The current system, which bases your grade exclusively on a handful of exams, is unfit for purpose, and produces inaccurate results.",
