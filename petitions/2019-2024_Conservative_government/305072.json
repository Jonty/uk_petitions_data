        "additional_details": "There are currently gaps in the UK government\u2019s strategy to tackle Corona and to support citizens and organisations. We need political leaders to put tribalism aside for the good of the whole country and every citizen. We have had 4 years of tribalism over Brexit. The best way to get through this Corona crisis is for us all to work together. A government of national unity should be installed until a vaccine is readily available and in use for C19; and then we can return to current administration",
        "background": "This is a moment of profound crisis. We need our political leaders to work together: to defeat Covid19; to better support every citizen; and to create better days ahead. We want a UK government of national unity to be a positive example of collaboration to work with leaders around the world.",
