        "action": "Stop the regular assessment of persons with Epilepsy and life long disabilities",
        "additional_details": "Once assessment has taken place the decision to grant PIP or DLA should it be awarded it should be a one time process and not a regular assessment every few years as a or the life long disability will never change but instead only be treated. A person can work yes but some days may find it hard to work and that is then and where PIP or DLA is of help to the persons. So to avoid the financial stress and worry I believe the debate should be heard and argued to abolish the ongoing assessments",
        "background": "People who suffer with Epilepsy and other long term disabilities have to have regular assessments causing distress to the person and even financial hardship even though the disability is life long and will never change so the discussion should be heard in parliament to abolish the assessments",
