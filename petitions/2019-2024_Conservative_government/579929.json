        "additional_details": "Many women with endometriosis also suffer from infertility, causing more pain and heartbreak for the patient and their partners and wider family. Endometriosis is a chronic condition and currently, there is no cure. Treatments to manage symptoms include contraceptives, medically induced menopause, and surgery. Surgery can help the chances of conceiving naturally, but it is not always straightforward. Women should be offered the chance to freeze their eggs and preserve their fertility.",
        "background": "I want women suffering from endometriosis to be considered for egg freezing prior to undergoing treatment and surgery to limit their chances of becoming infertile. Usually, the NHS will only fund egg freezing for cancer patients having treatment.",
