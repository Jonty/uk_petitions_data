        "background": "Consult immediately with the leaders of the Westminster parties on forming a Government of National Unity within one month.\r\nDraft legislation for this, including clear time limits on its duration. \r\nInclude provision for a Citizens\u2019 Senate, selected by lot and operating virtually, to input ideas.",
