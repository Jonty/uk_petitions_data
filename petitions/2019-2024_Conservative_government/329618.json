        "additional_details": "Let\u2019s talk RUBBISH! \r\n\r\nThere has been an astonishing amount of people leaving their rubbish in public areas recently. It is lazy, careless and most of all unnecessary. Perhaps there are a lack of bins in some areas, but that does not justify the copious amounts of  plastic bottles, cans and junk left in our local areas.\r\n\r\nThese are our most precious areas and if we don\u2019t look after them then who will?\r\n\r\nPreserve our beaches and save our countryside by signing below.",
        "background": "I propose that councils look closely at their local areas to ensure adequate amount of rubbish and recycling bins, along with regular collections to reflect the demand. Consideration needs to be given to the consequences of littering when bins have been provided. Clearing beaches? Increasing fines?",
