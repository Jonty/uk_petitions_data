        "additional_details": "The NHS currently funds the doctorate in Clinical psychology for UK applicants. Every year large numbers of UK graduates move abroad or into the private sector resulting in significant shortages of Psychologists across the NHS. International candidates (Tier 2) currently working in the NHS, should be afforded a funded opportunity given they provide a signed commitment to work for the NHS for atleast 5 years post qualification. This would benefit the NHS and reward committed clinical candidates.",
        "background": "Allow international students working in the NHS the opportunity to study on a funded Psychology Doctorate (e.g. DClinPsy) by signing an agreement to work for the NHS for atleast 5 years post qualification. This commitment will insure the NHS benefits from the funding allocated to such individuals.",
