        "additional_details": "School children and families are always trying to cross the busy road and with concern about speeding, it would help people cross safely. I have just had to help a child cross this busy road as no car stopped to allow them to cross. With people caught speeding down this road having a zebra crossing could help prevent an accident. You ask why? Well for the safety of children and their families!",
        "background": "It is essential for a zebra crossing to be put close to white wickets park as families try and cross this busy road all the time. There has been an inquest into speeding down this road and this could help part of the problem as you tend to find most speeding within school run hours.",
