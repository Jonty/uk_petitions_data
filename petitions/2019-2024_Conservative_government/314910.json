        "additional_details": "This is because the academic year 2019-20 has been of several disruptions such as UCU strikes and now the COVID-19. COVID-19 has placed the entire batch at a disadvantage. It has adversely affected the study, career, and employment prospects. In order to minimise that government should consider this post-study work route so that these students get enough time, as things get normal, to apply for jobs in the UK. They should not suffer any disadvantage because of something totally external to them.",
