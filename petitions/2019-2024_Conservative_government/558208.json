It is only right to make everyone wait an extra month for their driving test rather than make only those with November tests wait till next year. \r\n\r\nWithout tests being pushed back those with November tests will be forced to wait until February/ March time to even get a test which is totally unacceptable!!\r\n\r\nAll tests must be postponed by the length of time in which the lockdown lasts, in order to be fair on all learner drivers!!",
