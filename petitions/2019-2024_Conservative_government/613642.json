        "additional_details": "In Boris Johnson's own words, conversion therapy is \"absolutely abhorrent and has no place in a civilised society\". Medical professionals universally agree. There is no justification whatsoever for the arbitrary decision to allow trans people, including vulnerable teenagers, to continue to be subjected to this \"abhorrent\" and abusive practice. Trans people have a right to equality before the law and freedom from bigotry and persecution.",
        "background": "The Government's plan to ban conversion therapy for gay and bisexual people but not transgender people is blatant legal discrimination, pure and simple. UK law must be brought into line with laws in other countries like Germany and Canada to protect all LGBT people equally with a universal ban.",
