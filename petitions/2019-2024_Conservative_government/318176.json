        "additional_details": "Some students do not have the resources such as online access, computers etc. to complete assignments or exams given to them by lecturers via online, meaning that they would not be able to pass for the modules due to lack of resources. Some students are also key workers who are doing their best to help the nation and beat the outbreak, which is also affecting their studies. Just because students are staying at home, it doesn't mean they have the ability to complete their assignments or exams.",

Due to the tough times during the lockdown, it has put an impact on student's studies and careers.",
