        "action": "Make visible colour-coded carbon footprint labels compulsory on all food items",
        "additional_details": "Action on all levels is needed to combat the climate crisis; from consumers to multinational companies. The public need readily available, highly visible and understandable information regarding the carbon footprint of food products. Stickers detailing this, with colour codes depending on proximity to carbon net zero, similar to the nutritional 'traffic light' symbols, should be compulsory. This will also give companies an incentive to lower the carbon footprint of their products.",
        "background": "To diminish carbon emissions and to stop the climate crisis, we need to raise awareness of the carbon footprint of everyday food items. This will not only help consumers make informed decisions about purchases, but will also incentivise large brands and supermarkets to reach carbon neutrality.",
