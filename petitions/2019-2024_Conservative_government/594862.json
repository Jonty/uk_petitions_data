        "additional_details": "Many people especially the elderly would be disadvantaged as they don\u2019t have internet. Landlines are a basic, essential, reliable source of communication. Internet is always going down and often unreliable. If someone wants emergency services, or alarm system needs to activate, or elderly person needs to press emergency panic button, and the internet has gone down, the call or signal will not go through. Land lines also work in the event of a power cut. This a ludicrous and dangerous idea.",
        "background": "Stop the telecommunications industry scrapping the phone network, and swapping it to a digital internet based phone network by 2025. Internet networks are always going down. There is no logical sense to scrap the phone network. The elderly would be most at risk as many do not have internet.",
