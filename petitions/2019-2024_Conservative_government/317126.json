        "additional_details": "It is IMPOSSIBLE to socially distance from primary school children, or for them to socially distance from each other, regardless of whether they have learning difficulties or not- play-times would be particularly difficult to manage.\r\nIn principle you may consider other countries measures eg: classes spilt into Am & PM. This will help but its not the answer! Perhaps colourful washable fabric masks would help as child friendly. Washing hands & surfaces is NOT enough. Chn cough & sneeze everywhere.",
        "background": "Offer some PPE Protection (masks, gloves) for Teaching staff, particularly Primary School Teachers & those working with children with learning difficulties, as part of the exit strategy for sending children back to school, if the rest of the country is still in lockdown. Children are super spreaders",
