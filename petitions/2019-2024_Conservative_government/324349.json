        "additional_details": "This has been a bubbling conversation for many years in the UK. We as a country must look at the situation in the USA as a call to action to sort out our own systemic and institutionalised racism. We have seen that this begins with listening and learning from these oppressed groups. We must start with our national education systems and educate current and future generations on the reality of the post-colonial world we live in. We must see colour in our curricula.",
        "background": "The national curriculum is dominated by a Eurocentric narrative which perpetuates systemic racism in the UK. Gavin Williamson should conduct a national curriculum review in partnership with BAME organisations & education specialists to change the narrative across all subjects in our curriculum.",
