        "additional_details": "The government want you to believe that they are being kind in the \u00a3770M in aid they send Yemen. But this is just an attempt to ease the guilt of those who agreed the sale of \u00a36.2bn worth of weapons to the Saudi-led coalition. So the UK shares responsibility for the fate of Yemen. Yemen is currently suffering through:\r\n\u2022A Civil war (100,000 dead)\r\n\u2022A Cholera Epidemic\r\n\u2022Famine (10M on the brink of starvation)\r\n\u2022Drought\r\n\u2022A Fuel Shortage and\r\n\u2022The Covid-19 Pandemic\r\nWhich is why Yemen needs your help.",
        "background": "We are demanding the UK government starts supporting Yemeni People by: increasing their humanitarian aid, by building emergency medical facilities in Yemen and sending medical staff to support their debilitated medical system and to ensure critical aid reaches those most in need.",
