        "additional_details": "A ~6% of reported rapes are convicted, and the CPS is chooses to drop 'difficult' cases. The number of rape cases being charged has fallen to the lowest in a decade, despite an increase of reports. Children themselves are blamed. The public has stereotypes on how rape victims are expected to behave and is exposed to disproportionate coverage of false allegations of rape. For example, the paedophile who, despite video evidence, was absolved because the victim \"didn't cry enough\" during the trial.",
        "background": "Appoint a judge who has undergone specialist training for child sexual abuse. Also appoint a panel of assessors, such as those on discrimination cases, all of whom would have expertise in issues relating to sexual violence. Panellists could help inform the judge in the case about relevant issues.",
