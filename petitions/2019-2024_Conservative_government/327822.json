        "additional_details": "We need better cleaner facilities,free to use where a driver can take his LEGAL BREAK comfortably with good facilities,areas where the driver can get out of his cab if he desires,where loads can be parked up safely,the driver is responsible for his load therefore he can\u2019t truly relax until he\u2019s parked up in a safe place,but most truck stops are full and over crowded and we end up parking on the roads in lay-bys. Our drivers need these facilities to get proper rest periods and food",
        "background": "Lorry drivers have limited time to drive,and have to park somewhere for the night or day. Motorway service areas and the few truck stops charge over \u00a330 to stop on there premises,and dish up expensive food with poor facilities like showers",
