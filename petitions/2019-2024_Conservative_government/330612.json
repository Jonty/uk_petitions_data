        "additional_details": "I want the government to do this because singing and praising God  is a crucial part of our worship. \r\nBased on advise from relevant professionals, Church leaders have taken the necessary measures, e.g. distancing, sanitising the environment etc., and acting appropriately. \r\nChurch leaders have acted in view of public safety, public order and health of others to minimise risks.\r\nWith all that has been put in place, singing should be seen as a least way of spreading the virus.",
        "background": "On behalf of Christians who share this same view, I would like the government to kindly remove the restriction on our places of worship.\r\nUnder the Human Rights Act 1998, Article 9:Freedom of thought, belief and religion, we are given the right to put our thoughts and beliefs into action.",
