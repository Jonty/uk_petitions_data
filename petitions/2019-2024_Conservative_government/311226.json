        "additional_details": "For the response to the COVID-19 outbreak I would like the government to arrange for the NHS to be collectively awarded the George Cross, similar to Malta receiving it in the Second World War. NHS workers are having to separate from their families, travel to work on public transport so they can then face the threat of treating patients with COVID-19.  They do this each day. I strongly believe this repeated courage should be recognised with the highest award that can be made to civilians.",
        "background": "The George Cross is awarded for 'acts of the greatest heroism or for most conspicuous courage in circumstance of extreme danger'. I think this sums up what every member of staff of the NHS is currently doing to help us fight the COVID-19 outbreak",
