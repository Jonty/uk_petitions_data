There is minimum support from staff who have the deadly virus.\r\nIt would be appreciated if the parliament would lower the grade boundaries, and exclude content from the specification as students aren\u2019t able to go over the content with teachers, meaning that some students wouldn\u2019t understand the topics. Also, there would be less time in the next academic year to go over these topics & handle next years content.",
        "background": "During these difficult times, the year 5,10 & 12\u2019s feel neglected. They feel as though they are stuck in the middle of the COVID-19 situation and no one has raised any concerns for them. It\u2019s not ideal for them as they have lost out on a lot of time and content that could have been used with staff.",
