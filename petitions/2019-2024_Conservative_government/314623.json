        "additional_details": "I see carers who have families, mortgage, etc. Working 3 different jobs just to keep their head above water, working more than 48 hours a week just to be able to afford a living. It\u2019s unfair that they be on minimum wage in private homes as well as the NHS. They deserve to be earning at least \u00a310 per hour. They are looking after human beings, it is physically and mentally draining, they are trying so hard to earn a living and working so hard during this pandemic. They deserve it.",
        "background": "For it to be a statutory rate that carers are to be paid \u00a310 per hour, they are on minimum wage and work so hard especially during this pandemic. They deserve to be earning more and not struggling to feed their kids and pay their bills. It takes working more than 48 hours to earn a decent living.",
