        "action": "Revoke the British Museum Act 1963",
        "additional_details": "Many items in the British Museum were taken violently or smuggled illegally out of their country of origin during colonial eras. Many people of these nations have not ever been able to experience the art and artifacts of their history. The UK condemns the actions of that era and yet upholds colonial beliefs by holding onto items stolen from this period. Some examples of contested items are the Amaravarti marbles, Benin bronzes and Rosetta stone.",
        "background": "The act impedes the chance of reparation for stolen items, it states no items can be taken out of the museum & has been used as a way of avoiding serious discussions on whether the items should be returned. This petition is to ask to revoke the act which would allow trustees to begin discussions.",
