        "additional_details": "Many of these types of dogs are family pets, very loyal and calm natured. Every day many different breeds attack people or have bitten, but they don't make the news. The XL bully hasn't been bred to be aggressive. By banning this breed/type, many peoples family pets will be wrongly taken away from the people the dogs devote on. Why not make people more aware of respecting dogs and how to train dogs as apposed to just banning them first. It is down to the owners and backyard breeding.",
