I have personally experienced a pregnancy loss in the middle of the current pandemic and not having my partner in the hospital at the time was devastating. I am asking that the government allow women the opportunity to have 2 partners for emotional and physical support during their labour and 1 partner to be allowed on the maternity ward afterwards.",

The majority of hospitals in England have always allowed women to have 2 partners with her during labour and 1 partner on the maternity ward after.",
