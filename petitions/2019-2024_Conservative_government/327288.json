        "additional_details": "This is a matter of democracy. The government must implement the democratically requested changes to the Gender Recognition Act. To not do so would undermine democracy itself. The government asked the public for their wishes, and the people have spoken in favour of simplifying the process to update birth certificates for Trans people in England & Wales\r\n\r\nThe supported reforms have no impact on single-sex spaces. They only seek to reduce cost, grant dignity & recognize trans people's lives.",
        "background": "The government did a consultation to find out if the public wanted the Gender Recognition Act reformed. Leaked documents show 70% of respondents were in favor of reform but states the government has no plans to make the supported changes. The government must honor the outcome of their consultation",
