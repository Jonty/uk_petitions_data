        "additional_details": "Working parents in Northern Ireland are already getting left behind our counterparts across the UK. We currently have no free childcare hour\u2019s available even for 3 year olds. This early year access to funded childcare would make a huge difference and would allow many women to get back to the workplace. Currently people are out of employment as the cost of childcare is too high to be out working. If this can be seen as a priority in the rest of the UK it needs to be available here too.",
        "background": "The chancellor announced in the budget that England will be allocated \u00a34 billion to allow 30 free hours of childcare a week from age 1. In NI we are getting left behind in the absence of a working executive. This needs to be accessible to working parents in NI too as a matter of urgency.",
