Your petition asks for the penalty to be reduced for seven days, but it's not clear what seven days you want it to be reduced for.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nPermanently reduce the Lifetime ISA (LISA) withdrawal penalty from 25% to 20%: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/570826"
