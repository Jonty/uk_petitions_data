        "additional_details": "Almost 4,000 samples recently gathered by the Environment Agency in 20 English rivers showed Fipronil was detected in 99% of samples and a highly toxic breakdown product called fipronil sulfone was found in 97%. The average concentrations were 5 and 38 times higher than their chronic toxicity limits, respectively. Imidacloprid was found in 66% of the samples and was above toxicity limits in seven of the 20 rivers.  Many pets are treated every month, whether needed or not.",
        "background": "One flea treatment contains enough pesticide to kill 60 million bees! The washing of pets flushes chemicals into rivers, while dogs swimming is another pathway for contamination. Rivers are being polluted. The government is requested to ban the use of these products in all pet flea treatments.",
