        "additional_details": "Key and Critical Workers must be able to travel to work and some require car travel but have been unable to get tests due to current circumstances. Allow emergency tests again, for those who can prove status, and take maximum precautions when doing so. Many Key and Critical workers are risking their lives more by taking public transport which could be avoided by taking a car. Cars can be sanitised after every person and made as safe as possible with proper ventilation, sanitising and masks.",
        "background": "Allow Key and Critical Workers emergency tests again during the national lockdown in order for them to travel to and from work safely. This will allow more to avoid public transport (on essential journeys) and reduce the risk of spread of the virus. Cars can be sanitised and masks can be worn.",
