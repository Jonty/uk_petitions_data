        "additional_details": "In the face of adversity, front line key workers have come together in solidarity to tackle the greatest post-war crisis this country has faced. From Doctors to Constables, they have all put their lives, and the lives of their loved ones at risk to save others - epitomising British spirit, resilience and grit. We need to give them something back to showcase our gratitude and how truly grateful we are for all remarkable efforts. These people are what makes Britain \u2018Great\u2019 - we simply owe them.",
        "background": "In light of the sacrifices that front line staff in the NHS and Police have made during the pandemic, we are obligated to give something back. I would like the government to offer two weeks additional holiday, with pay to front line service staff, who have championed the best of Britain!",
