        "additional_details": "Democracy rests upon the right of appeal and human rights are slowly and systematically and almost imperceptibly being taken away from us. \r\n\r\nHumans have suffered as a result of covid. Late filing as a penalisation for access to funds that are granted as a staple human right across the employed sector must not be subject to inequalities that would breach the human rights act neither the equality act. \r\n\r\nWe therefore request the petition to be debated in light of the breach the 2nd March deadline",
        "background": "Allow right of appeal for each person who missed the 2nd March deadline to present their mitigating circumstances in order to qualify for the fourth SEIS grant. \r\n\r\nThe right of appeal is fundamental to a democratic legal system and a fundamental aspect of human rights",
