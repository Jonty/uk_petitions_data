A world-wide war against an indiscriminate killer, an invisible killer. \r\nThey are fighting a killer, about which, is seemingly striking both young and old, healthy and not healthy. They haven't flinched in their duty. They haven't put themselves first. They have carried on, often exhausted and in tears, but they haven't faltered.",
        "background": "On Remembrance Day, I would like all NHS staff recognised for their  selfless, tireless work, putting themselves at risk, to help all of us. This is for the country to show their gratitude for these present day heroes.\r\n NHS staff deserve more long-term recognition for what they are doing.",
