        "additional_details": "In recent events it has been highlighted how unsafe women feel. Whilst doing this unfortunately won\u2019t stop all sexual abuse and harassment it has every ability to minimise it, if children are taught this from a KS3 then there\u2019s less of a chance they will be groomed as they will be more aware of what to look out for.",
        "background": "Schools teach children about STI\u2019s and periods and how to put a condom on but they don\u2019t teach them how to notice if they\u2019re being groomed; it\u2019s a topic that isn\u2019t taken seriously and needs to be. Children need to understand grooming, assault and consent before anything can change",
