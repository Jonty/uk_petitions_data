And now, pupils who didn\u2019t achieve as highly as expected in Mock Exams for example, or pupils in more economically deprived areas/weaker schools could suffer disproportionately compared to those in the more \u2018well off\u2019 areas or the best schools.\r\nTeachers know their pupils best, and most will have made accurate predictions. We shouldn\u2019t be punishing pupils for a situation completely out of their control. We should instead encourage more flexibility and guarantee every student fair grades to ensure their hard work and ability doesn\u2019t go to waste.\r\nThese pupils shouldn\u2019t suffer for not being able to sit exams. We must make sure they get equal opportunities in life.",
