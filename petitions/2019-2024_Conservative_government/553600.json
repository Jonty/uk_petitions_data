        "additional_details": "When a family decides to have a baby, a woman's life changes. Pregnancy is a challenge to her body, and breastfeeding is something that only she can do. This is nature and we can't do anything about it. \r\nBut the following \"maternity leave\" time off work that seems to be standard in most families is something that society has created, and we can change it. \r\nShared paternity leave is not working as most fathers choose not to take it, but it shouldn't be an option, it should be the new standard.",
        "background": "Leave must be non-transferable between parents to normalise both men\u2019s and women\u2019s care-giving duties and promote wellbeing and gender equality.\r\nWhen men take leave, it helps women with their jobs, improves child-father relationships and helps to create a more gender equitable future.",
