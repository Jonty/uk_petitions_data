        "additional_details": "A black, British born student of mine presented a speech on his desire for more black and other ethnic British literature to be included in the English literature curriculum at school. Whilst the values in works such as 'An Inspector Calls' are commendable and transferable, many non-white, non-middle class students find this context difficult to identify with. He hoped that people from different ethnic backgrounds could share with others via literature from their perspective. Context is key.",
        "background": "For the Education Secretary to include more literature which enables students from diverse backgrounds to connect more with key concepts.The current curriculum is dominated by white, male, middle class literature with which few BAME, EAL, refugee, traveller and white British students can identify.",
