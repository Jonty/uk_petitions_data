It feels as though the general public are been penalised by been charged for something that is completely out of our hands. We are at a stage of been able to freely get access to lateral flow testing kits along with the pcr test through the nhs to get back to normal life and resume activities. Why should the public be charged any fee at all to enter the uk after travelling on an annual holiday on top of the costs for the vacation.   Whilst there are quite a lot of exemptions from having these tests. A lot of families are unable to afford these costs and shouldn\u2019t be made to pay when the tests we have to have on a week by week basis are completely free",
