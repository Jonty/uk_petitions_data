        "additional_details": "My daughter is in Year 10. She missed six months of classroom teaching in Year 9 impacting the beginning of her GCSE courses. She also missed 3 months in Year 10. She is studying all 3 sciences - but has not been in a laboratory since March 2021. The progress NEA element of her DT course has also been affected. Some students nationwide have had poor levels of access to remote learning. Every child has been adversely affected; hence the 2022 exams cannot take place without sweeping alterations.",
        "background": "OFQUAL, Department for Education and the Government must discuss and announce by 31 July 2021 how the forthcoming exam season in 2022 will happen. Both Students and staff at Schools and Colleges must have sufficient time to prepare, making appropriate changes to the teaching and learning.",
