        "action": "Examine the efficacy of the COVID vaccine with those who are immunocompromised.",
        "additional_details": "There are many either through illness or medication, who have a lower immune response to disease exposure. There needs to be more transparency as to the effect of the vaccine on immunosuppressed individuals, as to whether they are likely to become seriously ill from COVID even if fully vaccinated. There have been several mentions about research, but no outcome. There have been statements made about the lesser effect on those with compromised immune systems, with no firm evidence as to what.",
        "background": "There needs to be more urgency into the research findings of the many immunocompromised individuals, who despite being vaccinated against COVID, could very well become seriously ill and hospitalised if they are exposed to the virus. There should be better clinical advice as restrictions are lifted.",
