        "additional_details": "It is appreciated that those on benefits can receive veterinary care via PDSA for free, however low income households are expected to pay the extortionate prices that some of them just physically cannot afford. It is an immoral emotional tax on humans that leaves many in a difficult position: say goodbye to their beloved pet before their time has come, or get into debt to fund their care. A nationalised service would at least lessen the blow a little and make certain care for pets free of charge",
        "background": "Consider nationalising certain parts of veterinary care. The current costs of care for sick pets in the UK, even with insurance, is extortionate. There is no justification for the prices. Many people would be happy for part of their income tax to go towards a nationalised veterinary service.",
