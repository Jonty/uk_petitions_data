Many are temporarily unemployed and/or struggling financially. Schools are reopening and working hard to educate our children safely. A patriotic new paint job is a luxury we simply cannot afford now. You have correctly reevaluated the necessity to provide children with free school meals, please do the right thing and abandon this foolish idea.",
        "background": "Around \u00a3900,000* of tax payers\u2019 money is being used to unnecessarily re-paint the RAF voyager from grey to red, white and blue, in the midst of a global pandemic. Not only is it selfish but it\u2019s also reckless and pointless. Spend the money where it\u2019s needed instead, such as better funding the NHS.",
