        "additional_details": "As a solution pay should reflect the efforts each and every social care worker put into this pandemic, they put their own lives and their family lives at risk to care for other people and to make sure not a single person was alone through the pandemic, the pandemic that is still ongoing. \r\n\r\nNHS workers pay should reflect the price of inflation and daily living.",
        "background": "The government needs to reconsider the payrise for nurses, the agenda for change ends in 2021. Nurses, Paramedics, CSW\u2019s, ECA\u2019s, Porters etc and everybody else deserve the recognition they deserve throughout this pandemic and this should be shown by increasing their pay just like the other 900,000",
