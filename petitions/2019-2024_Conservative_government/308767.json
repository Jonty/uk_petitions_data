        "background": "People who work in the food retail sector (Tesco, Aldi etc) have put in long hours over the Covid-19 period, putting themselves and their loved ones at risk; all so we can eat, and have access to a dwindling supply of toilet paper.\r\nThree days off at Christmas would show how we noticed their effort!",
