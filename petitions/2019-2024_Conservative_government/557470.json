There is noticing for those that made it possible for doctors and nurses  to go to work. Because children weren\u2019t allowed to go to grandparents, children would not have been allowed to go to school if it was not for the support or catering staff.",

Some of whom worked even through their holidays to ensure the children were fed and looked after whilst their parents were in the hospitals saving the lives of many.",
