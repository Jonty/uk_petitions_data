        "action": "Reform Hackney & Private Hire Regulations & Make It Universal",
        "additional_details": "Having a universal approach to our taxi industry reduces the chance of illegal plying. By allowing all councils to have powers to check and penalise drivers from other councils would eliminate the time consuming process and close any loopholes that allow those drivers to continue working without any deterrent or consequence of their actions. Public welfare and safety is the forefront of our taxi industry and must be taken seriously. At present this is not the case and needs serious reform.",
        "background": "At present cross border is permitted, but cross council checks aren't. Opening up a difficult process when challenging illegal taxis. Liveries/plates are not universal, I believe there should be a universal approach such as having blue license plates for ALL taxis (example: Spain).",
