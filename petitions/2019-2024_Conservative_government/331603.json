        "additional_details": "PPC are effectively exempted from contract law in the Magistrate Courts due to the lack of legal background of many District Judges.  PPC can impose any term or condition and issue a flat \u00a3100 PCN for alleged breaches regardless of the true \u2018economic loss\u2019 to them.  A charge of \u00a3100 for overstays beyond a 2 hour+ free parking period to prevent abuse of the land and a parking charge at the daily rate, capped at \u00a325, for all other alleged breaches of contract should be introduced immediately.",
        "background": "The Parking (Code of Practice) Act 2019 that purports to protect motorists from rogue Private Parking Companies (PPC) has failed to prevent the PPC from charging \u00a3100 for any minor violation of their terms and conditions, further abusing the motorists\u2019 legal & consumer rights in the name of profit.",
