        "additional_details": "The exclusion of Covid-19 support has meant many of us on legacy benefits which include the disabled have been left to struggle through the pandemic. Many disabled people are already in a high risk group from Covid-19 and been left isolated with very little support if any and have to choose between a hot meal or a warm room. The government is already well aware of this. Many charities and doctors have spoken out about this discrimination and the harm it is inflicting. \r\nWhy have we been excluded?",
        "background": "The government has actively chosen to leave all those on legacy benefits behind and not provide Covid-19 support as they have done with Universal Credit. The government has decided we are not worth the extra support and this must end. We are worth it and discrimination is not acceptable.",
