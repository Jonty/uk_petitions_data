        "additional_details": "17.9m working days a year are lost to poor mental health, costing employers \u00a345bn. Work-related illness cases are highest amongst healthcare workers costing employers like the NHS, up to \u00a32,174 per person. \r\n\r\n78% report that moving to a four-day week has improved their happiness, with 64% of businesses reporting improved productivity.\r\nMoving all public sector workers to 32-hour contracts, whilst maintaining current pay would only add 6% to the current salary budget, creating up to 500,000 jobs.",
        "background": "During the pandemic many businesses have adopted a 4-day week. Adopting a 4-day week would address the current mental health crisis by improving peoples work-life balance, whilst also increasing productivity and reducing business costs. This petition calls for a government trial of a four-day week.",
