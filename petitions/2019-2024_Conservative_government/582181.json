        "additional_details": "The current volumes of plastic waste in our oceans and environment is shocking and is only increasing. Single use plastic bags from supermarkets directly contribute to plastic pollution which could be easily avoided. We need to act now before it's too late. By only having the higher price \u00a31 multi-use bag options, customers will be more likely to remember to bring a bag instead of purchasing new ones each time.",
        "background": "The current cost of single use plastic bags in supermarkets is too low to deter the majority of customers from purchasing them. Remove the the option of purchasing single use plastic bags for 10p. Instead only sell multi-use bag options such as 'bags for life' for a minimum of \u00a31.",
