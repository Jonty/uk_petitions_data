        "additional_details": "It should be the same for cats as any other animal/pet covered under the road traffic act 1988. They are loved by many families across the country and although sometimes unavoidable, hitting a cat with a car and reporting it/taking it to the vets immediately increases their chance of survival\r\n\r\nCats are family pets and mean a lot to families that have them. There have been too many cases recently of cats being hit and then left to die in the road despite there being a chance to save them.\r\nOnly 25% of cats hit by cars die as a result of this, this means that the other 75% have a chance of survival if taken to a vet",
        "background": "It should be made law to stop and report hitting a cat as currently this does not exist unless the animal is a dog, sheep, pig or cattle etc.",
