        "action": "Make it mandatory for dogs to be on leads on public rights of way",
        "additional_details": "The law needs to be changed so that dogs must be kept on a lead, specifically on public footpaths, bridleways and byways to protect livestock, equestrians and wildlife. If people do not obey the law, then there should be a significant financial penalty. Too many animals are being put at risk due to irresponsible dog owners which appears to be a majority, not a minority; mainly due to owners not understanding/caring about current legislation regarding having control of their dogs in public spaces",
        "background": "In light of all the dog attacks that have occurred recently, I believe the government should make it mandatory for dogs to be kept on leads, specifically on public rights of way: public footpaths, bridleways and byways. Too many horses, dogs, wildlife and sheep get attacked by out of control dogs.",
