        "action": "The UK Govt should deal with political criminals with promptness and honesty.",
        "additional_details": "UK govt must not support these corrupt politicians and they must be deported back to honour the justice served by UK courts. UK must not depend on delayed evidence which is usually fabricated and provided after months and years. The poor Pakistani nation's looted wealth is enjoyed by these criminals who have had held public offices at TOP ministerial levels. I hope UK Parliament does not pay a deaf eye and blind ears to suffering and cries of Pakistani nation. I expect promptness and justice.",
        "background": "There have been many political criminals who have laundered money from Pakistan and have purchased offshore properties and buildings in UK. They have entered UK through visit visas but later produce false medical documents to extend their stay because they cannot face Pakistani courts.",
