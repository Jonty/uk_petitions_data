        "additional_details": "For to long women and men alike have suffered through birth control and the risk of unwanted pregnancies due to our health system believing they know more than the able bodied adult making the request. \r\n\r\nThis should not be a want decided by a doctor, but a human right.\r\n\r\nAs adults we should have complete bodily autonomy, and this starts and ends with our reproductive rights. Which in the 21st century should expand to gull control over our ability to reproduce on top of our right to abortion.",
