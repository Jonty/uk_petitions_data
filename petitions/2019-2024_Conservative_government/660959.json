Isolationist and divisive ideologies of the 2016 referendum must not be artificially kept alive. To deprive our young of this opportunity to study, work, travel and find friendships in the other 27 European countries is a huge loss.\r\nLooking at recent polls of young people, the majority want a closer relationship with Europe. Nobody under 25 years old had a vote in 2016. Don\u2019t rob their future!",
        "background": "The EU has just reached out and offered to make arrangements for young people to be able to move freely in EU member states. This is a generous offer to give UK youth the same opportunities as they had before Brexit.",
