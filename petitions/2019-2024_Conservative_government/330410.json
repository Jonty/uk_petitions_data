        "action": "Support an anti-litter awareness campaign",
        "additional_details": "For many years there has been a notable increase in the amount of litter being thrown with no thought of the environmental or financial cost. This change of attitude has culminated in scenic locations, green spaces and country lanes being strewn with litter. Those of us who lived through national campaigns by Keep Britain Tidy in the 1970s, can remember the impact and positive change that happened as a result. Now is the time for a new government backed campaign.",
        "background": "The easing of lockdown restrictions has seen some of the most beautiful scenic locations strewn with litter by members of the public who seem to have no thought or care for their actions. We urgently need the government to support a long term campaign to raise awareness of the impact of litter.",
