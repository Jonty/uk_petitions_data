        "additional_details": "The destruction to the lives of tens of millions of people who are affected by directly consequential factors including widescale redundancy, business collapse, disrupted education, poor mental health \u2013 the anxiety, loneliness and despair already leading to an increase in suicides -  as well as the additional deaths caused by the NHS focusing solely on Covid, far outweigh the risk to life from Covid. It is unfair to seriously diminish the long-term life-chances of our younger generations.",
        "background": "Government measures in response to the Covid pandemic are disproportionate. Excepting a small minority, who must be protected, the overwhelming majority, especially the young, have no serious risk from Covid. Specifically protecting the vulnerable can be achieved at much lower cost than the lockdown",
