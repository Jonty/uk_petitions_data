        "additional_details": "Bond offers escapism.  While a Scot he is also a quintessentially British character at a time when the union is under pressure, That he represents a unifying source of national pride across the political spectrum has royal assent: brilliantly realised in the Olympic ceremony.  The nation has called on Commander Bond in times of crisis before.   Our shattered key workers, our homeschooled children, the locked up and lonely can just about wait for Top Gun 2.  They simply can\u2019t wait for Bond.",
        "background": "The government should act to force EON Productions Limited and Danjaq LLC to release/stream the new James Bond film for U.K. audiences during lockdown.   Bond is a great British institution and the immediate release of this film would be good for morale in this time of national crisis.",
