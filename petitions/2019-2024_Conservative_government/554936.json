It will show that we truly do care & cherish their contribution. The boost in staffing would be finite, can be forward planned, and would in itself speed up service delivery in other areas impacted by lockdown strictures, so in turn benefitting wider society, and boost holiday and travel businesses as a byproduct.",

Once medical options for preventing & treating COVID-19 reduce the demand, let\u2019s increase staffing to allow 10 extra funded days of leave for these workers as a thank you.
