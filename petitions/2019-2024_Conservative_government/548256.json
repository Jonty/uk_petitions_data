This grades the school, not the student.\r\n\r\nIn addition, students in schools and colleges with smaller classes (mostly private schools) have been allowed to keep A levels grades awarded by teachers, whilst students in FE and Sixth Form colleges have been subjected to this faulty algorithm, leading to lowering of their grades.",
