But that doesn't solve issue) but nothing is done about even euro 6 cars that release toxic black/blue fumes. I can bet \u00a3500 that if I go for a 5 minute drive in London streets I will find at least 5 cars that release black or blue smoke... That's how bad it is in London and NO One does anything about this?",
