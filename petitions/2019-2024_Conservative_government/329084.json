        "additional_details": "The UK Government has little knowledge, facts or figures regarding the tattoo/piercing industry and we believe that it is being classed as, \u201ca service for which there is not a population wide demand\u201d and will be put to the bottom of the reopening list. It is estimated that 13% of Europeans are tattooed. That rises to 36% in the under 40 age group.  It is also estimated that 72% of women have ear piercings and 20% of the population have other piercings.\r\nHelp us save the tattoo/piercing industry.",
        "background": "The tattoo industry has vast experience re: cross contamination, disease control and surface disinfection. It demands its participants to be cognisant always of the necessity of following rigorous standards of hygiene therefore the industry is better equipped than most to deal with covid-19.",
