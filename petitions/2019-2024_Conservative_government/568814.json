        "additional_details": "The government has a responsibility to educate and help our students about not just their physical health, but also their mental health which is just as  important. If this petition was passed to the government, it may make them understand that many parents of children with mental health issues feel they are being let down by the system and that more could be done to help their children, as while young they are more open to help and change. Often, young people feel ashamed to ask for help.",
        "background": "Secondary school pupils/ teens tend to suffer from mental health issues such as depression all too often, this petition would make educating all pupils about mental health stigma mandatory and teach them ways to fight it.",
