However your petition refers to people who have recovered from Covid-19 as though they all have immunity against future infection, when this is not the case. It's therefore not clear if you want the arrangements you have proposed to cover anyone who has tested positive for Covid-19 at any point, people who have tested positive for Covid-19 during a certain timeframe, or only people who have antibodies against Covid-19. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
