        "additional_details": "Students are typically paying \u00a39250 this academic year just to be taught online. No additional steps have been taken to account for the abnormal year, such as deadline extensions and extra credit.\r\nOn top of this, university students are still expected to complete end of year exams online, and to those in their last year of study, this will help decide their degree classification. Why is this the case when GCSEs and A-levels have been cancelled in England and Wales?",
        "background": "University students have been swept under the carpet with little information given during this pandemic. They are expected to still produce the high quantity and quality of work even with rising mental health issues, stress and worry, self-isolation and family and friends becoming ill and dying.",
