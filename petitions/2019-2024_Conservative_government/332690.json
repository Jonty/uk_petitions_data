        "additional_details": "If face masks are necessary to fight COVID then it is not fair for shoppers to expect to pay for a mask every time they go shopping. Since the masks either have to be washed or replaced regularly to be effective, this will end up being very costly to the shoppers. Because the supermarkets have been making record profits during the lockdown, it is only fair to expect them to shoulder the burden of the masks and make them available free for shoppers.",
