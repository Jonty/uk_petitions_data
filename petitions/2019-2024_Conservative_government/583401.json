        "additional_details": "Keeping these teams as they are and evenly distributing money between high league teams and low league teams. I\u2019d also praise the total ban of a breakaway league and any type of break away league in the future. I also believe heavy fines should be placed on the top 6 clubs for even coming up with the idea. Furthermore legislation should be in place to protect football clubs and fans from falling victims of such breakaways.",
        "background": "I would like the government to enforce a ban or high fine on clubs willing to leave domestic competitions to join this new league. It\u2019s totally un acceptable and destroys the basic football morals which this country helped find. It is your responsibility to not ruin the game as well as lively hoods",
