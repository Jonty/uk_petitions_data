        "additional_details": "The National Memorial Arboretum (NMA) Staffordshire has indicated it would consider a living memorial to Covid19 victims from the 'key workers' frontline. We propose that this demonstrates a willingness to create such a memorial in the United Kingdom for victims. Whether at NMA, Westonbirt or elsewhere, the tens of thousands of victims from the UK should be memorialised with a native species tree, their plots marked and identified to ensure not a single victim of Covid19 goes unremembered.",
        "background": "We would like the British Government to debate a proposal to create a national living memorial to Coronavirus victims both public and key workers, created at a site similar to Westonbirt or The NMA Staffordshire.",
