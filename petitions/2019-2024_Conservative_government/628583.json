They change mortgage rates quickly to be in line with the Bank Of England and they make sure their interest is the same as the Bank of England and or more than the BOE. Yet when it comes to savings accounts they are dragging their heels and putting it way bellow the base rate. Best on the market right now is 2.25% when it should be from 3% up.",

Too many banks are putting their deposits in the \u00a310,000 region when they should all be from a \u00a31. Giving everyone equal access.",
