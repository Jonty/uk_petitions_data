Mayflower East car park in the city centre has had a daily\r\nPrice increase of \u00a34 and a monthly\r\nIncrease of \u00a320, how is that justifiable when the only change to the car park is the pay machines. Other than Toys R Us car park there is no where reasonably priced and\r\nNot forgetting somewhere that is safe to park\r\nwithin in the city centre and not the outer edge",
        "background": "During the cost of living we have all noticed everything going up, gas/electric, food, petrol etc. Affordable parking is lacking and what once was affordable has had a major price hike which then takes up a significant portion of your monthly wage",
