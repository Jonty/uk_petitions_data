        "additional_details": "As one of the wealthiest countries in the world it is absolutely scandalous that people are having to make the choice between heating and eating.  Although the measures that the government has proposed will help some households stay out of fuel poverty, many will still be left with a stark choice. \r\n\r\nSupport for energy poverty needs to be increased and far better targeted. Support for small businesses needs to happen. Investment in long term renewable energy security must increase rapidly.",
        "background": "The governments approach to tackling the energy cost crisis is badly thought out and should be reconsidered:\r\n- households that don\u2019t need a rebate cannot opt out and allow more targeted support for those in need\r\n- there\u2019s no support for small business\r\n- it does nothing for long term energy issues",
