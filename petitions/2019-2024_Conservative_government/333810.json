The government's half thought out decsion has left people vulnerable to Airlines exploiting their options regarding changes to travel plans. \r\nPeople are no forced to pay an excess of \u00a375 per person for flight changes alone.\r\nMany of these people who are key workers have not benefited from any furlough or support, many were hoping to visit family who live abroad and may now be forced to abadon plans not only this year but next due to being unable to afford fees to change.",
