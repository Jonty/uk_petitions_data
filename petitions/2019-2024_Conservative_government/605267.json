        "action": "Cancel the mandate of COVID-19 vaccination for NHS staff",
        "additional_details": "COVID-19 cases are at the highest since records began despite at least 83.5% of the UK adult population having received at least 2 doses - and when COVID-19 first struck no members of staff were vaccinated yet there were less infections than there are now, the mandate can violate disability provisions within the Equality Act 2010, and fully vaccinated people are still passing away from the virus, therefore the mandate will not solve our problem. It should be optional without risk of losing jobs.",
        "background": "This is not a petition against the COVID-19 vaccine, this is a petition against the mandate for NHS staff. To have staff members' employment terminated is a violation because their personal choice is being taken away. This petition may not receive as many signatures as it affects NHS staff only.",
