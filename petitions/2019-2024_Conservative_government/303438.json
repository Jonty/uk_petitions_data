        "additional_details": "This issue is causing a lot of issue to other citizens who might not be able to purchase in bulk at any time due to lack of funds but also because they do not have the time to do so. A lot of health care workers work around the clock and do not have the time to go shopping and when they do the supermarkets are empty. WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION TO THIS!!!",
        "background": "The government should restrict people from bulk-buying in supermarkets, they should advise supermarkets to restrict the number of products people can purchase. I recommend a maximum of 2 of the same item to be purchased.",
