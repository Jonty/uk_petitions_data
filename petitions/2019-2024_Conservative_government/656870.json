        "additional_details": "Where I live, a man walks his dog off lead and not under his control at all. It walks in the road, is often out of sight of its owner and goes up to any dog, human or child it has a mind to and doesn't respond to commands from its owner. It has frightened a number of children by going up to them and also adults who are scared of dogs. It is only a matter of time before it causes an accident and or gets injured. Police say they can do nothing unless it is dangerously out of control.",
        "background": "I would like the Law amended so that all dogs must be on a lead when walked on streets, not just under control. Currently anyone can walk a dog off lead without penalty unless dangerously out of control.",
