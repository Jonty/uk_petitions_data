Scandinavian countries work 32 hours per week on average and their employee productivity and work life balance is higher than the UK - why is it that we have not followed suit or investigated this further?",
        "background": "I want the government to consider implementing a four day working week with no loss of wages in order to bring the number of hours worked in line with Germany and Scandinavian countries in order to promote a better work life balance and improve employee productivity.",

This would be a decision for employers."
