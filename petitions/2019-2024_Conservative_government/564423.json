        "additional_details": "Families, such as my own, have been isolating in order to safely be with loved ones, in the end for nothing! If people wish to see their families for Xmas then they should be encouraged to get tested first before travelling to ensure no transmission of COVID! Xmas is the time of the year where families get together to celebrate and be united especially after a year like this. It is disgusting to say that people, especially in low number households cannot be with family!",
        "background": "It is unfair that families in tier 4 areas have to suffer and not see family for Xmas! EITHER households with only 3 people or less should be able to get together with other households for Xmas OR the travel period should be reduced to 2 days (24th & 25th) instead of the original 5 days (23-27).",
