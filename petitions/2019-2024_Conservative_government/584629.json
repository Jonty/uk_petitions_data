        "additional_details": "In 2009 the MOD deemed the subject of UAP held \u2018no defence significance\u2019. We respectfully disagree. Reported US Navy incursions, which include photographic and video evidence, have been officially confirmed by the U.S. DoD. The UK Government remains silent on a subject which has profound technological, scientific and environmental advantages to enhance the quality of life of its populace. We are requesting that the UAP/UFO subject is officially approached without stigma and without prejudice.",
        "background": "We are asking that HM Government treats the UAP/UFO subject as a serious scientific endeavour, making data available to the public and British press. A similar investigative program is being undertaken by our US allies, and by Russia and China, and the UK risks being left behind in this field.",
