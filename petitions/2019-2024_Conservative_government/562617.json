        "additional_details": "Many side streets in London have been closed off to cars, thus causing people to drive via the main road.\r\nMain roads are therefore a lot more congested than in the past, thus causing more time spent in traffic jams. \r\nRather than driving directly home, we now need to take a longer route, which is unfair and irritating.\r\nDue to having to drive via the main road, rather than taking short cuts, journeys are a lot longer and thus has a negative impact on the environment and on mental health.",
        "background": "Councils in London have introduced LTN's i.e. the closure of many side streets, in a bid to encourage walking and cycling and to reduce traffic. These schemes are instead causing disruption to citizens' everyday lives. Fining people for driving in roads they've always driven in is unjust.",
