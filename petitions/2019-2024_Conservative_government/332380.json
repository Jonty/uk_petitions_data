Skin can often become blistered, inflamed and irritated, which can sometimes cause severe pain to the sufferer, and can affect quality of life. This could easily be avoided if allergens were clearly listed on products. \r\nMany food allergens are also in common household items.\r\nAccording to Alexandra Richmond at Mintel (2010,) approximately 44% of adults suffer from at least 1 allergy- so why isn't labelling more clear?",

When many household items contain allergens, why must we stop at food items?",
