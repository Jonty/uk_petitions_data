        "additional_details": "While many countries around the world (such as the US, Israel and Canada) have successfully begun vaccinating over-12s, this country has still yet to even make plans to offer COVID-19 vaccines to all over-12s. In order to avoid more disruption to young people\u2019s education and prevent a new variant (with the Delta variant already being more transmissible among younger people), we must give all 12-17 year olds the opportunity to protect themselves and others.",
        "background": "The UK\u2019s vaccination programme currently does not allow under-18s who are not considered vulnerable or who do not live with someone with a weak immune system to get vaccinated. The Government should allow all 12-17 year olds to get vaccinated to protect as much of the population as possible.",
