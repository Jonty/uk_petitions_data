        "additional_details": "It is vital that Science does not turn into dogma. The role of vaccines in human health is not clear. Today, there are many doubts by scientists and lay persons as to the use of aluminium, with studies appearing in even the British Medical Journal, that question both the efficacy of vaccines and the harm that can be caused because of the ingredients used. The public must never be censored by draconian laws which discard any potential harm or severe health risk posed by the use of vaccines.",
        "background": "The Government and Parliament must pass a new law to ensure that the freedom to continue to speak freely about vaccine harm, whether in person, or on social media, continues and is never criminalised, or otherwise shamed.",
