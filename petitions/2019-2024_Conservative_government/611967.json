They can admit to this grooming behaviour and it is acceptable in the eyes of the law.\r\nThis activity affects many young and vulnerable people and the law must be changed to ensure it is recognised as illegal grooming behaviour. It is an abuse of trust and is conducted to knowingly circumvent existing laws on sexual activity with children.",
