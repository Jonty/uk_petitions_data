Now they aren\u2019t in school full time which means they are missing out on more valuable information which will come up on their exams. One idea I would like to put forward is to give the students a set amount of time to study and make notes before the exams begin. If we act now we can prevent the generations of tomorrow suffering due to the events taking place today.",
