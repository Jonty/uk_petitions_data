        "additional_details": "By moving the 6 week holidays to earlier will  prevent families from being fined when they want to take their families on holiday in the warmer periods. This will also benefit those older children taking exams in such hot  and uncomfortable conditions. As It seems every year we are experiencing the same wet and dismal conditions that are  colliding with the dates the children are off school. Surely this would make sense and maybe parents wont need to take children away from school for holidays.",
