        "additional_details": "Serbia is a country that is a member of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which means that its driver's licenses should be recognized by all countries that have signed the convention. Therefore, we call on the UK Government to take action and recognize driver's licenses issued in Serbia, in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. We believe that this is a fair and reasonable request, and we urge the UK Government to act on it as soon as possible.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, urge the UK Government to recognize driver's licenses issued in Serbia, and to allow holders of Serbian driver's licenses to drive in the UK without the need for additional testing or licensing requirements. Currently, Serbian citizens are required to take a UK driving test.",

            "details": "Petitions need to call on the Government or Parliament to take a specific action.\r\n\r\nYour petition states that Serbian citizens are required to take a UK driving test, but people with a Serbian citizen can drive in Great Britain on their full, valid driving licence for 12 months. After 12 months holders of a Serbian driving licence would need to apply for a provisional licence and pass the theory and practical driving tests to drive in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe Vienna Convention on Road Traffic does not state that member nations should recognise licences of other nations indefinitely. It says that licences should be recognised until a licence holder becomes a permanent resident of another nation.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to allow the use of a Serbian driving licence indefinitely, or to allow the exchange of a Serbian driving licence for a UK driving licence, without any need for testing, if that's what you want to happen."
