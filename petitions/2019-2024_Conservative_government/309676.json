        "additional_details": "Our Prime Minister Boris Johnson is known to be an evangelical Christian. He is very  supportive of faith groups and Christian organisations.\r\n\r\nIrrespective of ones  religious views, the fact is that every day Parliament begins prayers, for Her Majesty and indeed for all politicians, that they should govern justly. \r\n\r\nI would like our Prime minister to set a National day of prayer in regards to the Coronavirus  (COVID-19) pandemic,  for God to intervene & heal our nation.",
        "background": "Our Prime Minister is an evangelical Christian. He once described his faith in exactly the same way as many of us may be feeling in light of  COVID-19.\r\n\r\n\"I mean sometimes the signal is strong, and then sometimes I'm afraid it just vanishes. And then it comes back again.\"",
