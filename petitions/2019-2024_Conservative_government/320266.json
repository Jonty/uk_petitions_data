        "action": "Change earliest return to school planned for reception & Year 1 class children.",
        "additional_details": "Due to focus and concentration capacity of 4-5 year old, there will be  children who forget to wash hands after using the toilet in school or unable to remember not to touch face with unclean hands or wash hands correctly before lunch and snack times. These year groups are least to follow government guidelines on how to minimise risk of catching or transmitting COVID-19. As a parent I do not feel safe to send my child to school and feel it is unrealistic and high risk.",
        "background": "Reception - Year 1 will not be able to understand social distancing measures. It is not realistic to keep 4-5 year olds 2 metres apart from their friends. There will be emphasis on hand-washing but young children are not as focused as older children due to varying attention span of 4-5 year olds.",
