        "additional_details": "The decision to defer scholarships for some of the brightest Afghan students has been attributed to the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan which makes it difficult for embassy staff to process their visas, but it is precisely this situation which makes it imperative for these at risk promising individuals - half of whom are women - to be granted their hard-earned opportunity to continue studying in safety.",
        "background": "The Home Office should continue processing visas for 35 Afghan students awarded Chevening Scholarships to pursue masters degrees in the UK starting in 2021, exploring options for these exceptional circumstances such as remote processing, visa on arrival, or processing in neighbouring countries.",
