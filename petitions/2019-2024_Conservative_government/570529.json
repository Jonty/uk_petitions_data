Of those, poor metabolic health which includes obesity, increases risk of hospitalisation and long Covid. Gyms and leisure are the primary preventative industry towards reducing obesity, improving metabolic health and educating the public towards better health for the future which can reduce the burden on the NHS long-term.\r\n",

What we would like, is for gyms and leisure industry to be classified as an essential service for mental and physical health.",
