        "additional_details": "This a gross misuse of Section 35, directly targeted at some of the most marginalised people in our society, which significantly undermines the devolution settlement and will unlock constitutional and diplomatic strife.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the argument made that this bill will have a  'serious adverse impact... ...on the operation of the Equality Act 2010', is incorrect, as the bill solely affects the Gender Recognition Act 2004.",
        "background": "Section 35 was recently invoked to veto the Scottish Parliament's ability to make an amendment the Gender Recognition Act 2004, making it easier for anyone to apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate. By lowering the required age to 16, and removing the need for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria.",
