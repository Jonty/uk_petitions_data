        "additional_details": "Dogs, with their sensitive hearing, are especially vulnerable, and many hurt themselves trying to get away or hide. They can escape in panic, and risk getting lost or hit by traffic.\r\nFireworks offer spectacular displays which are greatly enjoyed. Reducing the noise levels to a minimum would not significantly affect that enjoyment, but would save animals and their owners from a great deal of distress. Not only on 5th November, but on numerous other occasions.\r\nThese quiet fireworks already exist.",
        "background": "Every November, animals are frightened and upset by the sound of fireworks. Some owners have reported that their animals have become seriously ill or died, from shock, heart attacks, etc, due to extremely loud fireworks being set off.",
