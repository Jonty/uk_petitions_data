During Covid there was an increase of 57%, despite a fall in crime. \r\n\r\nThe police are only supposed to authorise the use of section 60 when there has been serious violence or if there is risk that an incident may occur. However, many officers abuse their power and target black people with their overzealous policing. \u201cWe call for a review of the Section 60 order. There is an urgent need for the order to fair, accountable and free from racial discrimination. We require meaningful action to be taken to tackle the discrimative actions of British Policing\u201d.",
