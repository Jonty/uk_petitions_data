        "action": "Reintroduce Mandatory Dog Licensing in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Licensing would reduce the indiscriminate 'backyard breeders' trying to meet the demand for the latest 'fad' breeds. In turn this could mean breeding licenses only issued to reputable breeders and prevent interbreeding and overbreeding, leading to health problems.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of a dog license is a % of the fee (eg 5-10%) could be fed back into shelters and rescue centres and go towards the education of correct canine management.",
        "background": "After the death of a seal by an unleashed dog near Hammersmith Bridge on 23/03/2021 + a 52% surge in dog attacks on children in the past decade it is time to reintroduce annual license laws for dogs, with the aim of having every dog owner holding a license for every dog they currently own.",
