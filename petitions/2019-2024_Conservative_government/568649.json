        "action": "Tighten the definition of 'essential retail' to reduce the spread of Covid-19",
        "additional_details": "We are told to stay home and only go shopping for essentials. However many shops are allowed to remain open when they should be closed, especially general retailers such as Wilko, The Range, B&M. They are treated as essential retailers, but they don\u2019t sell any essentials that you can\u2019t buy at supermarkets, which we visit anyway to buy food. Plenty of what they sell is clearly not essential. The fact that they are open encourages people to go shopping (breaking the law) and enables the spread of the virus to customers and staff alike.",
        "background": "Reduce the number of shops that are open to the minimum so that while our basic needs for food, medication and toiletries are still met, we are not tempted to go shopping for non-essentials",
