        "action": "To ban the idea of vaccine passports in order to travel and regain freedom.",
        "additional_details": "The government should do this as it is unfair to force people to get the vaccine. Although some may argue that people hold the choice, realistically the choice isn\u2019t theirs anymore once you do that as the UK government is imposing an ultimatum upon the people to either remain in the UK if you don\u2019t take the vaccine or receive the vaccine allowing you to travel. This is unethical and it strips the people of their democratic rights, if this motion is pursued this will be an act of dictatorship.",
        "background": "Ban the idea of vaccine passports, as it is unethical to impose fear upon the people by not allowing people to travel without vaccine. The UK is a democratic country and it is our bodies, so we should have the choice of what goes in or out our bodies at all times without this impacting our freedom.",
