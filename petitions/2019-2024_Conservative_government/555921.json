        "additional_details": "Apart from displaying some common decency and basic, common or garden compassion, we want leaders to actually lead for a change.  That means 'you go first' when it comes to stopping access to free meals for children facing food poverty and hunger.  Please make us believe that you care more about kids than your own stomachs, and that arent just a bunch of cynical hypocrites who are happy to indulge in luxuries while their people suffer.\r\n\r\nAfter all, we're all in this together.  Apparently.",
        "background": "MP's need appropriate motivation to ensure the Children they represent dont go hungry.  As a show of good faith, MP's should lead from the front by stopping all free and subsidised meals for themselves (including those paid for by expense accounts), until they have ended domestic Child food poverty.",

            "details": "The UK Government and Parliament aren't responsible for setting MPs' pay or expenses. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) is responsible for deciding on MPs' expenses and pay. IPSA is independent of both Parliament and Government.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about IPSA here: https://www.theipsa.org.uk/about-us/\r\n\r\nMPs may claim for the cost of purchasing food and non-alcoholic drinks where they have stayed overnight outside the London Area and their constituency. This is limited to \u00a325 for each night they have stayed, but the claims can be for purchases made during the day.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nIncrease food and drink prices for MPs in House of Commons catering venues: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/555565\r\n\r\nIncrease food and drink prices in House of Commons catering venues: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/555947\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons Catering service does not provide a subsidised service in the commercial sense of the word. Some venues make a profit, while in other venues the cost of providing the service does exceed the income received in sales due to the irregular hours and unpredictability of parliamentary business. The House of Commons publishes details of the cost of House of Commons catering services: https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/foi/transparency-publications/hoc-transparency-publications/catering-services/transparency-reporting-catering-services/\r\n\r\nCustomers of the House of Commons Catering Services include some of the 650 MPs but also around 14,500 other pass-holders, many of whom are staff on lower wages that work irregular hours. In addition, members of the public and non pass holding visitors to Parliament also have access to these services. The irregular hours and the unpredictability of Parliamentary business contribute to increasing the net cost of providing a catering service. To offset this many of the restaurants, dining room facilities and their staff, are used to cater for private events at times when they are not required by the House. This is one of a number of measures used to reduce costs.\r\n\r\nWe have also published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nFund free school meals over school holidays until April 2021: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/555727\r\n\r\nProvide the free school meal entitlement throughout the year: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/555723\r\n\r\nEnd child food poverty \u2013 no child should be going hungry: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/554276"
