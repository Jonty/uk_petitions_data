It's businesses continuing to trade, diversifying and new businesses starting up.\r\n\r\nIncreasing tax will put people off from starting businesses and growth plans and have knock on impacts on jobs, etc.",
        "background": "It has been suggested that the the level of Corporation Tax that businesses pay could rise by 5% in the Autumn to help recover the country's debt.\r\n\r\nTo support growth and recovery, extra tax should not be levied on businesses.",
