        "additional_details": "As with late loan payments a charge is applied, the banks rarely care about the reasons for lateness. The banks need motivation to move money. It is not that they cannot because they can offer loans within days but these are their own products of less than \u00a35000 not the CBILS.  Eg. majority tax payer owned NatWest state ten working days for a decision, but this doesn't happen. People have been waiting for over 20 working days now which is totally unacceptable and is going to destroy businesses.",
        "background": "The government to apply a fine of say \u00a3100 (amount flexible) for each working day over the bank's defined timeline. The amounts raised would be the banking community generous gesture to create a Business Support fund to help businesses that may struggle to repay the loans.",
