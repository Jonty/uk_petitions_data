        "additional_details": "Mandatory vaccines go against many human rights and the Nuremburg Code. Are the government happy to lose professionals who could potentially save people's lives just because they're enforcing a vaccine? Why are we losing human rights. Why do you want people out of work? You must stop this and allow freedom of choice. No vaccine should be mandatory.",
        "background": "People should not be losing their jobs over the Covid-19 vaccine. No vaccine has ever been mandatory and this shouldn't be either. We will lose many professionals in many industries with this mandatory vaccine. I would rather be treated by someone unvaccinated than no one at all.",
