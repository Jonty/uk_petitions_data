        "action": "Launch a live event insurance fund to give organisers financial security",
        "additional_details": "Covid has brought the live events industry to its knees and the organisers are unable to take large financial risks. However the government is able to take on that risk. In an effort to boost our economy and the mood of the nation the government should own an insurance scheme enabling organisers to go full steam with their events knowing that if the worst should happen and we cancel due to a third wave they will have financial security",
        "background": "The government needs to create an insurance fund to enable live events to be planned and run as usual, giving the organisers confidence and financial security if their events are cancelled last minute due to covid restrictions. This is the only way we can have a chance of a great British summer",
