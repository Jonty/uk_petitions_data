We deserve to live comfortably with the hard work and hours we provide to making sure the country is fed, watered, clothed and has all the necessities you could possibly need. Along with building supplies and many other facilities we provide everything. It\u2019s time to give us the respect and comfort we deserve.",
        "background": "To make it mandatory to pay truck drivers a minimum wage of \u00a315. For too long we've been underpaid & without recognition of our profession. Drivers wages have remained stagnant for years. Without truck drivers, the country would come to a stand still as this pandemic has shown our worth once again.",
