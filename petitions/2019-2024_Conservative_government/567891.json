        "additional_details": "I think whilst the rules surrounding fishing should be reviewed (ie number of people permitted to fish together, social distancing etc) it is a very rash decision to just outright ban the sport. For many fishing is their only source of exercise and recreation. I do not believe that one or two people fishing at distance presents a higher risk of spreading the virus than two people walking or running together in close proximity. The latter of which HAS been permitted by the government.",
        "background": "I would like for the government to reconsider their decision to ban recreational fishing nationwide, as of the 5th of january. Other forms of exercise/outdoor recreation have been permitted, many of which present a far greater risk of infection, so why not fishing.",
