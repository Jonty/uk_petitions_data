        "additional_details": "The government should not be physically blocking refugees fleeing from seeking asylum in the UK. Instead of doing so, we should create a safe passage into the U.K. from Calais for refugees so they do not need to take unsafe routes such as on dinghys and pay smugglers for their journeys.",
        "background": "Priti Patel promised after the Windrush scandal she would create a more \u2018compassionate\u2019 Home Office. Instead she has taken steps to block refugees crossing the channel with Naval ships. This is an unacceptable treatment of refugees who have fled war and persecution- all they want is safety.",
