        "additional_details": "A master's degree such as the LPC is a prerequisite for entering the profession. However, due to a lack of funding, many recent undergraduates cannot afford to undertake the necessary qualifications.This means that despite these students determination and intellectual abilities, they will be incapable of pursuing a career in this field because of their socio-economic background. This abject inequality is obstructing social mobility and making some career paths only open to society's upper class.",
        "background": "The funding for postgraduate courses is prohibitively low. At present the government provides a loan of \u00a311,222 to fund the study of these courses. Some tuition fees alone exceed this amount. The LPC course can cost up to 17,300, which is financially inaccessible to the majority of students.",
