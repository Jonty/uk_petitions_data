        "additional_details": "We believe that the sentencing guidelines are not tough enough.\r\nVictims of child grooming may never fully recover from the abuse they suffered.\r\nExamples of child grooming include spending time in chatrooms looking for children to groom.\r\nThis may also happen on other social media platforms.\r\nOr, being caught in the act by an undercover police officer.\r\nThe grooming of a child is abhorrent.\r\nWe call upon the Government to increase the sentence upon conviction to a mandatory life sentence.",
        "background": "At the moment, the average sentence for child grooming upon conviction is anything between a community service order and a maximum of 10 years imprisonment.",
