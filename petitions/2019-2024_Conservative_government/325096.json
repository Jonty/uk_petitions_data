        "additional_details": "Britain's colonial past has shaped the world we live in today yet many Brits grow up unaware of their country\u2019s colonial past. We want to see the national curriculum revised to include: the transatlantic slave trade, Britain's role in colonising the world and creating national borders and the role of people from commonwealth nations in building Britain back up after WWII.\r\n\r\nThis history forms the backdrop of the many racial inequalities that are present today.",
        "background": "We would like the national curriculum updated to teach children about Britain\u2019s colonial past. We believe this part of the curriculum should be driven primarily by BAME educators to ensure that children are exposed to a wide range of perspectives which they would not otherwise encounter.",
