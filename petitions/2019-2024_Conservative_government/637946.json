        "additional_details": "It is so much more common in younger people than I think is recognised by the Government. The 25-30 year old age bracket has so many cases of Breast Cancer, the recommended age should be lowered to protect people. You cannot just rely on feeling for lumps as sometimes you cannot feel them. Lowering the age would save lives and allow for a much higher survival rate.",
        "background": "I want the Government and Parliment to recognise that the recommended age for a mammogram in the UK shouldn't be 51. It should be much lower, to protect the younger generation from Breast Cancer, so we can save younger peoples lives.",
