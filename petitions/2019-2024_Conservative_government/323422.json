        "additional_details": "There is a growing need of new blood donors across the UK and more than 500,000 potential donors are refused to donate due to the draconian presumption that they are prone to adverse donor reactions, specifically, syncope and convulsions. However, many studies show that this information is incorrect and it is keeping many people from helping their community. Moreover the NHS would greatly benefit from the increased donations.\r\n\r\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9212625/",
        "background": "Over 500,000 people in the UK have epilepsy, and many of them would like to donate blood. However, the policy on blood donation for people suffering from Epilepsy does not allow them to donate. This is due to the inaccurate and antiquated assumption that they are prone to adverse donor reactions.",
