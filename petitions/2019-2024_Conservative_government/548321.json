        "additional_details": "My self and others have witnessed walking past a shop or salon, hearing young babies distressed and held down whilst having their ears pierced.\r\nWe can not understand how it\u2019s acceptable for a young baby or child to be put through that hurt for a fashion accessory. \r\nIt is against the law to hurt a child, Which should mean It is illegal to put a needle/ piercing gun through an ear when the baby/ child is not aware.\r\nSchools and nurseries don\u2019t allow piercings and have to be covered up if kept in.",
        "background": "We need the government to make it illegal for qualified ear piercers in Salons, Shops, Beauty Business to be allowed to say no and not pierce ears until the child is older enough to understand and have a choice.  \r\n\r\nNo babies or young children. \r\n\r\nLet the child decide if they want this done.",
