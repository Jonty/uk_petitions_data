The effects of bullying devastates whole families and destroys many many young lives. While the abusers just go on care free and unaffected.

However the age of criminal responsibility in the UK is 10, so under-16s can already be prosecuted for several offences which might constitute bullying. It's therefore not clear what it is you'd like the Government to do.\r\n\r\nYou could have a petition calling for bullying to be made a specific criminal offence, if that is something you'd like to see happen."
