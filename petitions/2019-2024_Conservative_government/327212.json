        "action": "Require drive-thru takeaways to write customer vehicle reg numbers on packaging.",
        "additional_details": "During the coronavirus lockdown, litter from fast food outlets all but disappeared. But with the easing of restrictions, discarded fast food packaging has begun to increase on roadsides and at beauty spots, causing plastic pollution and draining the public purse. Councils and Highways England spend nearly \u00a3700m a year cleaning up litter. The Government could reduce this cost by introducing a requirement for vehicle registrations to be recorded on all drive-thru takeaway packaging.",
        "background": "Litter from fast food and coffee drive-thru takeaways is blighting our urban and rural landscapes. Voluntary measures have failed. An effective solution would be to require businesses to write customer vehicle registration numbers on packaging, forcing people to dispose of their rubbish responsibly.",
