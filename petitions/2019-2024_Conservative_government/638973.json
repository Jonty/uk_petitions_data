Whilst we continue to increase our capacity significantly, our present supply does not always meet this excess demand, which has led to temporary shortages or intermittent supply which is expected to last into 2023.\" \r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for the Government to review supply of and access to medications for diabetes, if that's something you'd like to happen."
