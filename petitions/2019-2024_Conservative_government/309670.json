        "additional_details": "The Government and the Parliament have the powers to pass laws to approve that small gesture of appreciation. \r\nWe see people getting bonus and rewards all the time, although I completely agree in supporting those in lockdown, we need to reward those that cannot, are exhausted and are true heroes. We will be in utter chaos without them.",
        "background": "Insight of the current Covid19, everyone with non essential jobs is to lock down, still getting a part of their wages.\r\nEssential workers do not have that luxury, and are indeed working extra shifts with a higher risk. It's only fair they get a subsidy for that risk as a token of appreciation.",
