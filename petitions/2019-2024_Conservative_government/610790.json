        "action": "Stop the rise of fuel prices across the UK",
        "additional_details": "The government must put a cap on fuel prices and they must reduce the current price of all fuels. With the cost of living, housing and food on the rise, fuel is just the latest to go up. Soon, members of the public will not be able to afford fuel and no one will be able to support their families as they will not be able to go to work.",
        "background": "The cost of fuel has risen dramatically since the so-called \u201cfuel crisis\u201d in 2021 - We were told this is due to a fuel shortage and a driver shortage but the cost of fuel is making it extremely difficult for an every day working person to afford to drive to work.",
