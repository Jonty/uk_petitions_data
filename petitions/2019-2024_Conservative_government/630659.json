        "additional_details": "Unqualified EDI staff with no function other than promoting divisive identity politics are employed in every NHS department, paid \u00a375,000 per year: \u00a328,000 more than a doctor, \u00a339,000 more than a nurse, \u00a349,000 more than an ambulance driver, and triple the average UK wage. NHS cleaners vital to safety in hospitals receive minimum wage only. \r\nEDI staff serve no useful practical function. Removing them would enable employment of staff vital to delivery of medical services, on higher salaries.",
        "background": "The NHS has a shortage of clinical staff while EDI employees draw bloated salaries, funded by people who are unable to see a medical practitioner when needed. No sick person has ever called for an emergency EDI manager. Only staff directly necessary to clinical care should be publicly funded.",
