        "action": "Accelerate the covid-19 vaccine roll-out to include late-night provision.",
        "additional_details": "The covid-19 pandemic has been one of the most difficult times in the UK's recent history and the world's. The availability of efficacious vaccines is a remarkable scientific achievement and it is incumbent on government and Parliament to ensure the swiftest possible roll-out to the maximum number of people.\r\n\r\nThe faster we do this, the faster we can begin to rebuild lives, jobs, businesses and the economy - and most importantly the sense of connection with each other we so lacked in 2020.",
        "background": "The government claims there is 'not a clamour for jabs to be delivered after 8pm'. The signatories to this petition both want to see the most vulnerable in society vaccinated as quickly as possible, and to receive protection ourselves. Government should immediately expand provision on this basis.",
