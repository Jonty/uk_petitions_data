        "additional_details": "I would like to see this done as so many families struggle with there pets. Many dogs are petrified of the noises and respectful dog owners try and prepare but getting prescribed sedation. Unfortunately they can not prepare for most weekends in the winter months. So many families preach about there dogs being part of the family , so why are we not making sure they feel calm and safe? Also many ex soldiers/serving soldiers that suffer with ptsd , hear fireworks which is a trigger for reliving the terrifying war they fought. these men and women fought for our county and now we are terrifying them with resemblance sounds of guns and bombs.  Not only are we making our animals suffer but also our people suffer. Please can we limit the use of fireworks for bonfire night/weekend and maybe NYE.",
        "background": "Fireworks are brilliant for family enjoyment on bonfire night and maybe New Years. Many families struggle listening to fireworks all year round. I\u2019d like Parliament to implement some nights of the year in which fireworks can be used.",
