If we bring in mandatory voting, my hope is that it will force the public to engage with what is going on politically, and force the candidates to engage with the people they are supposed to represent.",
        "background": "I propose mandatory voting for all General Elections, By-elections, Referenda, and devolved powers elections.\r\n\r\nRecently in the Hartlepool By-Election there was a turn out of 42% of eligible voters. The last general election many areas had around 50% of eligible voters actually turn up.",
