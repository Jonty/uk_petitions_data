        "additional_details": "In light of several MPs resistance to Marcus Rashford's plea to extend the free school meal voucher scheme for the most vulnerable children, it is impossible to justify what is in effect free school meals for MPs. How does an MP who earns over 70k per year struggle to afford food. And also with Ben Bradley MP's request to prevent the vouchers being used for alcohol, it seems only fair that MPs pay for their own alcohol as well, although in the real world drinking on the job is a sacking offence.",
