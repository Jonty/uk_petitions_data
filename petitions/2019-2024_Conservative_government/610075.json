        "action": "Commandeer UK property of absentee Russian nationals to house Ukrainian refugees",
        "additional_details": "According to Transparency International, \u00a31.5 billion worth of UK property has been bought by Russians accused of corruption or links to the Kremlin (https://www.transparency.org.uk/uk-money-laundering-stats-russia-suspicious-wealth).  Several hundred Ukrainian families could be housed in these properties for as long as they need shelter in the UK. A highly symbolic yet practical act that would surely resonate with all fair minded people.",
        "background": "Undertake a practical and symbolic act in defiance of Putin's wanton aggression against Ukraine whilst providing succour to at least some of the impacted innocents. This initiative would target wealthier Russians (e.g. with total assets >\u00a35,000,000) who have properties in the UK.",
