Not only does the sequence of events illustrate the incompetence of the government; perhaps more depressingly it betrays a contemptuous lack of care and compassion for individual humans.\r\n\r\nGavin Williamson oversaw the debacle, insisting that the precious algorithm was sacrosanct until this became untenable even in his own party. He must take responsibility, or be forced to do so by the Prime Minister.",
