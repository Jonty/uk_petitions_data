        "additional_details": "Students in the UK have already missed hundreds of hours of learning since 23rd March last year.  Many don\u2019t have a proper learning environment, therefore results will most certainly not reflect the true efforts of pupils. Cancel Functional skills exams and provide teacher assessed grades to show the true reflections of students across the country and bring it in line with other exams being cancelled in UK. Students feel discriminated and it is grossly unfair to let these go ahead.",
        "background": "The Government should cancel Functional Skills in 2021 due to the disruption of Covid-19. By the time students go back to learning, Many months would have already passed since establishments were closed to most pupils and still are. This has already had a huge impact on learning of so many.",
