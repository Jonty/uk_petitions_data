Universities are helping with only online learning, but still not enough and not the same as equal to face to face learning, many times students face internet crashes, in this kind of situation students  cannot achieve higher targets/ grades. Passing final year with average grades will not worth it. Universities are not granting any other help or extensions. \r\n\r\nI would like to request government to get involved and help out students (deducting fees)",
