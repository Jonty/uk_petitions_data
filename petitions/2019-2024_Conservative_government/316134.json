        "additional_details": "Have a simple Universal Credit application where the increase is ONLY in place for those directly affected, so those who have recently lost their jobs. To give those who have been unemployed for 1 year+ a 17+% payrise when they are not financialy impacted is wrong and unfair to the Tax Payer. No one else sees such a income increase from the Government in this time.",
        "background": "Giving those uneffected by the Coronavirus as they were unemployed prior to the global pandemic is wrong. While the Tax Payer sees no such increase, and infact takes a 20% pay cut to give those economically inactive prior to crisis a 17% pay increase is wrong.",
