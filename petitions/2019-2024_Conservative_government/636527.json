Plus why should my Son have to go to London just to get an Appointment to see someone. Which is a 75 mile journey one way. The British Government charter flights at a cost of \u00a3250,000 Minimum to take refugees to different Countries and it cost me \u00a315,000 just to fix my teeth the Way i wanted it done. I had to go Abroad to fix this Situation. Why can we not do the Same for Children & adults in Britain.",
