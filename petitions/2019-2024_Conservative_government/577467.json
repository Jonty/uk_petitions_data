It is not essential for all children to have free travel that is subsidised by the tax payer. It is however important the elderly, disabled and their carer are afforded free travel as their need to greater.",
        "background": "Free travel for all children is costing everyone, including those households without children a large amount of taxpayers money and contributing to obesity rates in young people. It makes sense to only give free travel to kids who live further away from school or those who get free school meals.",

Slightly different rules apply to families on low incomes.
