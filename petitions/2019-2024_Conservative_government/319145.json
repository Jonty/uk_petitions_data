But left out those who have paid into this country for years, who decided to make a change in their employment status. How is this fair? This is penalizing those who have made that choice within the last 12 months. You have left them to draw closer to dept, mentally draining them in this fight for help and the only answer we get is 'unfortunately there is no help for you'. Bye. Time to help the WHOLE of \"GREAT BRITAIN\"!",
