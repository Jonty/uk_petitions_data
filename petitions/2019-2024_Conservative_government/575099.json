            "details": "The UK cannot act unilaterally to change the rules governing travel from the UK into the Schengen Area. Any changes to the arrangements agreed between the UK and the EU would have to be the subject of negotiations with the EU. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, under the Schengen Area rules of stay for third-country citizens, non-EU citizens entering the territory under the visa-free regime can stay for a maximum of 90 days, for every 180 days. Only days spent in an EU member state count towards the 90 day limit, so a 3 day trip to an EU country in January followed by a 3 day trip in April would only count as 6 days out of the maximum 90 days allowed in a 180-day period. You can find out more about this here: https://www.gov.uk/visit-europe-1-january-2021.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not clear what action you would like the Government to take.\r\n\r\nYou could start a petition calling for the Government to negotiate for some specified change to travel rules for UK citizens visiting the Schengen Area, if that is something you'd like to happen."
