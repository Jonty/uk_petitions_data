        "additional_details": "The reintroduction of gold and silver as legal tender/currency will assist in combating inflation as it will maintain a consistent value year on year. It will also help boost trading with other countries, increasing the UK's rate of development. Additionally, it will allow the circulation of money to flow through the economy which will greatly aid in reducing homelessness, unemployment rates, crime and many other detrimental factors affecting the UK.",
