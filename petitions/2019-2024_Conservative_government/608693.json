        "action": "Government's compulsory \u00a3200 energy scheme - Scrap entirely or allow an opt out",
        "additional_details": "This is not a fair scheme, why would any government pay wealthy people energy subsidy. The notion is flawed. The repay is flawed if several people share then move out and have to pay separately \u00a340 for five years. The government stands to make a lot of interest on their initial 'loans'. Scrap the whole scheme, it doesn't help anyone. It's a further tax that no one has agreed to.",
        "background": "The legal implications on enforcing a debt on the people in a democracy is unacceptable. The scheme is unfair also in that if people share a house now but move out within the five years they each have to bear a \u00a340 payback meaning the government make many times more than the amount they forced on us",
