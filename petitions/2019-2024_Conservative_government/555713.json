Members of Parliament earn a sufficient enough salary to budget the purchasing and running of their own food, transport costs and household bills without having to rely on the country\u2019s welfare system. Financial independence should be encouraged and therefore, all financial aid to Members of Parliament should be halted in order to achieve this.",
