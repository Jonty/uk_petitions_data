        "additional_details": "The criteria for the childcare grant and free childcare hours should be based on an individuals earnings as primary carer's cannot improve their financial situation. Not every family combine incomes and this often leaves one party reliant on the other and without skills when the children leave the home, as they cannot afford childcare when they are not earning a salary. I was refused recently as they took my partners salary even though I do not have access to his finances.",
        "background": "I found my passion later in life and decided to study and fell pregnant in year 2. I could not continue or receive childcare grants as my earnings were too high as a household even though I am on a basic wage. My bills are rising and I need to work whilst I study and I cannot afford to study.",

Your petition calls for free childcare to be made available to working parents in higher education on a basic wage, but also calls for eligibility for free childcare to exclude a partner's income, which is a much wider request.\r\n                \r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
