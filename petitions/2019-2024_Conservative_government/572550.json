        "additional_details": "I would like the government to give driving instructors the right to appoint licences OR open up test centres and prioritise NHS staff and Key workers. If Covid strict measures are in place then this should decrease the number of Covid positive cases as more people are able to use private transport to and from work, rather than public, decreasing the amount of people they interact with, especially for people working with Covid patients.",
        "background": "I would like competency to drive to be checked under national lockdown and otherwise using Covid strict measures in place. Continue with theory and practical exams, either by giving driving instructors the right to appoint a Full UK drivers licence, or by the traditional means.",
