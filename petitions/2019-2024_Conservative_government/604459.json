        "additional_details": "This should be done to protect our students, teachers and also the vulnerable group. As, students are catching covid in schools and going home to their grandparents. This puts them all at risk, as not all people have symptoms. Please do not make the same mistake as last year by closing schools 1 day after they had reopened. As many parents will be buying uniform and other essentials ready for the new term. Please close schools to protect all of us.",
        "background": "In order to protect our students and teachers and decrease the rate of covid cases, schools should remain closed after Christmas break. And all learning should be done from home. Schools should still remain open for children of Key Workers.",
