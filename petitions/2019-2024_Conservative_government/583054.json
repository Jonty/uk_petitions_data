        "additional_details": "The cost of childcare leaves little incentive for parents to work. Many single parents rely on state benefits and the funding used on that would be put to better use if it went into a state childcare system. \r\nMany parents feel they \"can not afford to work\".\r\nParents earning above national living wage put most of their disposable income into childcare, therefore lowering their standard of living. \r\nParents working hard with professional careers should have a lifestyle that reflects that.",
