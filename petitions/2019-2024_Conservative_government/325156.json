        "additional_details": "After witnessing videos of police horses being used against crowds at a Black Lives Matter protest in Whitehall. I am extremely appalled at the situation these horses were put in. They should not be subjected to this sort of chaos. \r\n\r\nOne horse broke free from it's officer and was visibly panicking amongst the crowd. Another was hit by a bike and clearly hurt. There were also many objects being thrown about which would also cause potential stress and harm.\r\n\r\nHorses are animals, not tools for the police force.",
        "background": "Police horses should not be used as a means for crowd control at protests, as they are often put in harms way when these events turn violent. \r\n\r\nThe police should not be allowed to use innocent animals to protect themselves, they should face protestors as equals.",
