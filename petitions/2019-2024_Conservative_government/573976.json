However, as a 25% reduction in the EU's quota over 5 years was agreed as part of formal negotiations on the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the UK cannot take unilateral action to cut the EU's quota without breaching the terms of this Agreement and thus break international law. We can't accept petitions which call for anyone, including the Government, to break the law.\r\n\r\nYou could start a petition calling for the UK to negotiate with the EU for the total removal of all fishing rights in UK waters for EU member states, if that is something you'd like to happen.
