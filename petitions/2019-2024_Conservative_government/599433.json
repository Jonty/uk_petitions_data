        "additional_details": "1 in 6 young citizens in the UK are experiencing record levels of anxiety & depression in a mental health pandemic. Gender-based violence & systemic racism continue unabated, all in the midst of an intensifying climate emergency. We have seen the government responding reactively and not preventatively. Evidence-based programmes, like Think Equal, prove that preventative measures do work. Therefore the government needs to reassess its' strategy & prioritize Early Years education.",
        "background": "Mandate Social and Emotional Learning alongside numeracy and literacy \u2013 if it is compulsory to learn how to read and count, it must surely be compulsory to learn the value of human beings? Evidence-based programmes exist to prevent mental ill-health, discrimination & violence before it's too late.",
