        "additional_details": "Switching to BST permanently will have the following effects:\r\n1. Reduce our electricity bills and CO2 emissions by making it lighter later, and reducing peak power demand\r\n2. Stop the spike in strokes and heart attacks we see when the clocks go forward\r\n3. Avoid a \"time border\" on the island of Ireland\r\n4. Save 80 lives each year on the roads\r\n5. Reduce crime\r\n6. Improve our health by giving us more evenings to exercise outdoors\r\n7. Improve our mental health by reducing the effects of S.A.D.",
        "background": "Everyone hates it when the clocks go back, so let's stop doing it.  In 2021, every EU nation will stop changing their clocks twice a year.  This is a great opportunity for us to do the same thing.  It also has a surprisingly long list of benefits.",
