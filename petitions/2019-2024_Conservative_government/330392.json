        "additional_details": "The City of Salisbury once upon a time was full of wonderful independent shops, today only a handful survive, every street you walk down has many empty retail units, this is due to the local government's obsession for charging ludicrous parking charges and business rates. The local government/council encourage business's to relocate to out of town retail parks, this is killing our City! By making the City centre a pedestrian only area will be the final nail in the coffin of this once amazing city!!!",
