        "additional_details": "According to a survey of the comedy industry carried out by the Live Comedy Association (LCA):\r\n- A third of comedy venues believe they are facing closure in 6 months, 77.8% face closure in less than a year.\r\n- 60% of respondants have said that they will have to leave live comedy if performances do not restart before Feb 2021.\r\n- Over three quarters of performers have earned less than 5% of their pre-pandemic expected earnings even with online gigs.\r\nComedy has the ability to change lives. Save it.",
        "background": "The Government has announced a \u00a31.57 billion emergency fund for the arts last week. This does not cover the thriving comedy circuit that brings in a great portion of income for the UK. We want the Government to recognise stand-up comedy as an art form and include it in the bail out plan for the arts",
