        "additional_details": "I want the government to think wisely about the decision they\u2019ve made & to reconsider it so the whole UK agree, because if it\u2019s going to continue people are going to leave this country and never come back especially the people who are already BRITISH CITIZENS like me as our own country & government can\u2019t look after us or support us when we do so much for the government already. If you\u2019re not going to reconsider your decision then give everyone a pay rise with a minimum starting salary of \u00a329K",
        "background": "There\u2019s been a huge jump in price for the change of financial requirements in the UK for a fianc\u00e9 and spouse visa so now its been made so difficult for the people in the UK to now call their partners or spouses to the UK. There aren\u2019t many jobs out here that even offer \u00a329K so what do people do?",
