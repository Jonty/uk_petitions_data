        "additional_details": "The UK as a whole will benefit greatly from membership, with particular advantages to fishing and agriculture being able to access freely their largest markets. The UK is a world leader in the entertainments industry and its members will be able to work freely in Europe bringing investment in art and culture to the UK and Europe from across the world. The UK will benefit from a ready workforce for agriculture, healthcare and many other fields where there is now, sadly a shortage of workers.",
        "background": "The electorate has never been consulted if it wants to join the EU, two non binding referenda have been held to consider the option of leaving with the most recent being almost tied after a deluge of misinformation. Recent events show the value of being a member state within the UK's largest market.",
