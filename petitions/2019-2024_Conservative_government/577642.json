We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nWe understand you want to make blood tests for prostate cancer more easily available, but we're not sure whether you want the age limit on the existing NHS England informed choice programme for PSA testing to be lowered to 40, or whether you want to see a routine screening programme implemented for men aged 40 and over.\r\n\r\nThere's currently no screening programme for prostate cancer in the UK. This is because it has not been proved that the benefits would outweigh the risks, and research has shown that the current tests don't reduce the number of men dying from prostate cancer.\r\n\r\nRead more:\r\nhttps://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/prostate-cancer/getting-diagnosed/screening\r\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/prostate-cancer/psa-testing/\r\n\r\nYou might like to sign the following petition:\r\n\r\nFund routine prostate cancer screening tests for all men over 50\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/560007"
