We dont havd to keep paying into it.",
        "background": "Its time we said no to the ESC.  The UK is known as one of the \"big 5\" one of 5 countries that PAY into the contest, this guarantees the UK a place in the finals  WITHOUT having to compete for a place. Its time we stopped putting UK money into what is  clearly a POLITICALLY motivated contest.",
