        "additional_details": "WE need a change in the syllabus! To help educate our children and teach them information about things that have happened globally in the past. With added international events, it will help fuse out the ignorance that will later grow in the future, it will teach children information that will help them become open-minded and interested in other cultures instead of distancing away from them outside of schools and in their daily lives.",
        "background": "Reading the History syllabus has brought nothing but shame as there is a lack of international history. A lack of African, Asian, Arabic and Southern American history. The syllabus is full of Euro-centric events that children are learning, and censors history from the rest of the world.",
