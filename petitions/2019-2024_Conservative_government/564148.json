        "additional_details": "On the 14th December 2020 the government stated it had no plans to force vaccinate anyone. Medical intervention should always be consensual. The government also agreed men & women should not be coerced into vaccinating against their will by way of removal of goods & services. Adding this group of people to current anti-discrimination laws would give them protection from unscrupulous corporations & Government agencies ensuring the continuation of freedom of choice.",
        "background": "I am asking the government to add men & women who chose not to take anyone or more vaccines offered to them to be given protection under law by adding this group to existing anti-discrimination legislation.",
