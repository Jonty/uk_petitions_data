        "additional_details": "With the \"minimum\" prison time only being 5years....your own statistics show out of 1400 convictions hundreds re-offend upon release.\r\n\r\nClearly this stipulates your current system is broken and Does Not benefit the general publics safety.\r\nBudgeting for street lights an cctv is one thing but releasing offenders way too early is the simplest approach to increase sentences to help protect the general public. The public need more reassurance to come forward with confidence that CPS has more power.",
        "background": "Statistics show that over 1.4million people each year are sexually abused with only 1400 people per annum being given custodial sentences.\r\nOver the past 5 years alone Hundreds of convicted rapists have re-offended committing further sexual offences upon release from prison.",
