A wedding should be celebrated with your closest family and friends, very rarely less than 30 people. If the day cannot be everything you ever wished for, why should you compromise. If all guests have proved they are COVID negative, why can it not be the amazing, special, day the bride and groom have always wanted?",

If this can be successful for public events with thousands of people, why can\u2019t be successful for 100 at a private wedding?",
