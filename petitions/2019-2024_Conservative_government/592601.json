        "additional_details": "The alternative \u2018milks\u2019 can be expensive, and children from less affluent families shouldn\u2019t be excluded because their families can\u2019t afford to buy them (especially when these are some of the children who require the extra nutrients provided in those fortified milks the most due to potentially having poorer diets). Please introduce alternative fortified \u2018milks\u2019 as part of the scheme so that children with allergies aren\u2019t excluded and are receiving the nutrients they need too.",
        "background": "Cow\u2019s milk protein allergy is one of the most common allergies in children. I am calling for an introduction of fortified plant based milk as an alternative option in all funded milk schemes. All children should be included. Having an allergy is not a choice!",
