As part of Section 9, Animal Welfare Act 2006, DEFRA clearly states the 5 basic needs of a dog. \r\n1. A suitable environment \r\n2. A suitable diet \r\n3. The need to be housed with or apart from other animals (including humans)\r\n4. The need to be able to exhibit normal behaviour patterns\r\n5. The need to be protected from pain, suffering, injury & disease. \r\nSadly, as these are not \u201claw\u201d but recommendations, many dogs are suffering.",
