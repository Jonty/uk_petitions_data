        "additional_details": "It will also help with the economy as people are too scared to book flights abroad as they will catch it. So businesses within the airforce don\u2019t stand a chance. People are also too scared to leave their houses due to the Coronavirus and I think that will cause an affect on workplaces, so would be easier to just go on lockdown. I feel like this is starting to become a pandemic and is killing people off unnecessarily. Everyone should be working together to get rid of this virus by a lockdown.",
        "background": "Put the whole of the UK on lockdown to protect its citizens from catching the Coronavirus. And leaving it long enough for the virus to die out. Doing this will create less stress on the NHS and it will boost the economy. The NHS is struggling, so by doing the lockdown, prevents it from failure.",
