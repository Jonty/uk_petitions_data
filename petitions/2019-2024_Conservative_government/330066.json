        "additional_details": "It seems unfair that other establishments allow drinking and eating not restricted to 30 guests from the 4th of July 2020 to operate whilst weddings despite months of planning and spending are having such damaging and upsetting restrictions placed on them. It appears football, protest marches and crowded beaches are been treated more leniently then a traditional family wedding, I feel the wedding industry has not been treated the same as others in the hospitality business during Co-Vid19.",
        "background": "The current restrictions applied to Weddings where only 2 houses can mix a father cannot walk his daughter down the aisle, sanitising of hands during the ring exchange and the fact no food or drink can be served despite pubs and restaurants been open renders Wedding Ceremonies currently unworkable.",
