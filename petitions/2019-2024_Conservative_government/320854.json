        "additional_details": "Lockdown - Flaky internet service supplied via aluminium/copper. Most households are getting continuous and intermittent service failures along with slow broadband speed (5mbps or less, the majority of the time). Children who are home schooling are struggling to complete lessons and homework, the elderly and vulnerable (who are self isolating) cannot make or receive video calls and/or do their online shopping, banking and paperwork). People working from home are unable to complete video calls or log onto the network to download their email to keep working.",
        "background": "BT are aware of the issue (ongoing complaints from most households for 15-20 years). BT are refusing to upgrade the aluminium line to fibre due to the amount of work.. the box is also over 2k away.",
