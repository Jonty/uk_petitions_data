We need to increase the countries I.Q level, and help poor and skeptical people to advance themselves and improve our economy. Too many people get in debt and are discouraged by the system. The government needs to look into a new plan to upgrade this sector, or we will fall behind other countries general development. Why should money be an obstacle? All people should be given a free chance.",
