        "additional_details": "Reforming the way final grades are assessed can give more chance to the students who find exams difficult, a chance to achieve higher grades. And it would avoid stress for some, which maintains their mental health. Final exams are also unfair because if a student has an \"off-day\" and they underpreform, the student may have a hard time finding employment as their exam grade do not reflect their true potential. Grades should be assessed in a natural work-like environment such as the classroom.",
        "background": "To change the way the final grades are assessed. By not having exams as the final say. But instead, use a number of factors like: Attitude to learning, homework, classwork, small controlled assessments.",
