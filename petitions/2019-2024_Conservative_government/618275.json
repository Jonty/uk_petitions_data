If a person tries to touch them, or shouts, or grabs them, it triggers their primitive 'Fight or Flight' response. And most dogs, due to the evolutionary desire to survive, will face the threat. At the moment there's no recognition of how human behaviour effects dog behaviour, and therefore it doesn't provide a full and rounded picture of the circumstances.",
