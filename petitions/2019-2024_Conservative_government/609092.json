It's misaligned to Streatham's 2019-2030 strategy to \"change perceptions, improve resident experience and progress development opportunities\", amongst other things. This design effectively acts as a budget commuter hotel which is unlikely to offer much to the residents of Streatham. The plot is fantastic with huge potential and residents deserve alternatives.",

The current proposal of a 5/6 story, 117 bed Travelodge in residential area shouldn't be the only option.",
