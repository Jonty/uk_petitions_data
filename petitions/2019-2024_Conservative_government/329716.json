        "additional_details": "DIFID is world renowned for delivering value for money and impact, and is by far the most transparent department in government. \r\nIt\u2019s a national asset we should all be proud of rather than merging or scrapping it. \r\n\r\nOver its 22 years so far, the UK\u2019s world-leading Department for International Development has saved millions of lives. It\u2019s led the world in tackling Covid-19, Ebola, extreme poverty and gender inequality, and provided life-saving aid following devastating disasters  and conflicts. Please leave it as an independent force for good.",
        "background": "Plans to merge the UK\u2019s Department for International Development with the Foreign & Commonwealth Office will sabotage the UK\u2019s ability to respond effectively and equitably to global crises to help those who need our aid the most.",
