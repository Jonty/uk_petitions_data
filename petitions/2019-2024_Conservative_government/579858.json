        "additional_details": "Dog theft is not currently a specific offense. With thefts on the rise for our much-loved pets, the current laws and penalties are not enough justice for the families and dogs that go through this trauma.\r\nMost pedigree dogs are worth much more than the average fine, this is not a deterrent for the thieves.  \r\n\r\nThree petitions have been previously run and this has been debated in parliament twice already. It is clear to see issue needs revisited and new laws in place.",
        "background": "Have harsher punishment for criminals stealing pets. The current punishment is less than 6 months jail time this act is over 50 years old and now needs amendment, pet theft is not treated with enough seriousness, and police need to be preventing this crime just as much as other crimes.",
