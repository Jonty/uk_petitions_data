        "additional_details": "There is a lot of negative news surrounding the pandemic and for the morale of the British population, it is essential that more POSITIVE news be published, which could be done by publishing the number of patients recovering from COVID-19 on a daily basis. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s failure to report how many people have recovered from Covid-19 has been criticised by public health experts\u201d (The Guardian, June 2020).",
        "background": "The UK is one of the very few countries around the world that is NOT reporting the number of COVID-19- recovered patients. We have the RIGHT to know this information so we can have a true reflection of how well this government is doing in terms of combatting this virus and protecting us.",
