        "additional_details": "Currently, individuals who have dedicated five years on an ICT visa are unfairly unable to apply for ILR. This policy creates a barrier and undermines the contributions of ICT visa holders. By allowing ICT time to be considered for ILR eligibility, we can establish a fair and inclusive system that recognizes their commitment and valuable contributions to the UK. It is essential to ensure equal opportunities and a just immigration process for all individuals involved.",
        "background": "Urge the Government to revise the policy excluding ICT visa time from ILR eligibility. It's unjust that after 5 years on an ICT visa, individuals can't apply for ILR. Let's create a fair, inclusive system acknowledging their contributions. Currently, ICT time doesn't count toward ILR eligibility.",
