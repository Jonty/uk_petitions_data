A strong message be sent by removing humanitarian assistance, ie Border Force or RNLI rescuing them and landing them in the UK, and instead escorting them back into French waters. \r\nDeploy the military to patrol our beaches to arrest any immigrants reaching our shores for immediate deportation to France.",
        "background": "500 men a day entering Britain illegally being housed and fed at tax payer expense whilst our own Vets, including Gurkhas, are homeless is no longer acceptable.
