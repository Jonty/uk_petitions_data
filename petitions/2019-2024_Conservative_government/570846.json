        "additional_details": "I believe keeping the increase is the least our government can do, to ensure families are protected indefinitely, from the financial fallout of covid 19. \r\nBenefits have been decimated over the years of Tory rule, with many living on, or below the poverty line. \r\nThe \u00a320 increase doesn\u2019t cover the cuts and barely makes up for them, but it undoubtedly is vital in these uncertain times. \r\nInevitably, considerably more people will find themselves unemployed over the coming months.",
        "background": "I believe it is necessary and vital to maintain the increase in universal credit for all. \r\nAs more people are now unemployed, and the rate will continue to rise in light of the current situation, the extra support has never been more needed by so many",
