        "additional_details": "I\u2019m calling for the PM and education secretary, to step in immediately and ensure there is no \u201cmarking down\u201d of individual students based on where they live or where they attend school. They should also provide a free appeal system that is open to EVERY pupil. There should also be more weight given to teacher assessments as they are in a better place to judge us as individuals. The students of this country have every right to the GCSE and A-level results that they deserve.",
        "background": "Every student that hasn\u2019t been able to sit exams is now having their future decided by an algorithm. Almost 40% of A-level assessments have been downgraded; with poorer pupils being marked down because of where they live and where they go to school, with individual efforts completely disregarded.",
