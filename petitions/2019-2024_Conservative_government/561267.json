        "additional_details": "Repaying debt related to COVID. The Government and wider group of MP\u2019s should lead by example before freezing public sector pay, and take pay cuts to what has become an over inflated salary increasing by \u00a316,000 over the last ten years, this during enforced national austerity. A 10% pay cut followed by a 7 year pay freeze will leave MP\u2019s with a base salary of approx \u00a373,738.80, excluding expenses claims. This being more than double the national average U.K. salary approx \u00a330,000 a year (2019).",

MP\u2019s should lead by example and not exclude themselves any longer when public debt needs to be paid back.",
