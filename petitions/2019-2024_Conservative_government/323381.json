This agreement between the UK and China made clear that Hong Kong's high-degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms would remain unchanged for 50 years. This hasn\u2019t been the case as year after year China has been breaking this agreement by attempting to breech this by implementing controversy changes that impact the many freedoms the people of Hong Kong enjoy such free speech and a free press. The most recent breech of this agreement is that China is attempting to implement another change called the national security law that many have described as the death of Hong Kong.",
