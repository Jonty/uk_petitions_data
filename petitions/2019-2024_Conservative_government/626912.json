The Government's mandate is determined by their party having a majority of MPs. Whilst a party are not in government, it is only right that the party membership should determine its leader, but when in government, the selection should be made by the people with a mandate from the electorate.",
        "background": "We would like Parliament to pass a law requiring governing parties to allow only democratically elected representatives to choose a new PM. Currently, the main political parties leave the final decision of a leadership change to their party membership - a tiny proportion of the electorate.",
