        "additional_details": "Those looking to change the gender on their ID would have to testify before a judge, removing some of the traumatic medical hurdles and streamlining a process which can currently take over five years. The speed of this is especially important if plans to introduce ID checks when voting (trialled in December 2019) go ahead because if the gender identity of the person and the ID don\u2019t match they would be unable to vote. This decision sends a hostile message to the trans community.",
        "background": "Leaked documents disclosed government plans to scrap a proposed change to the Gender Recognition Act aiming to demedicalise and speed up the process for changing gender on ID. Will the government confirm that they will in fact go ahead with the proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act?",
