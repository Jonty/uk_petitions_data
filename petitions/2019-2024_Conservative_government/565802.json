        "action": "Allow students who study in the arts to go back to university earlier",
        "additional_details": "By not allowing people in the arts to go back, it is hindering our ability to practice performing. Many students come from poorer background with insufficient space to practice and move about. therefore, they are unable to join in with dance classes. Some students aren\u2019t allowed to sing too loud due to strict families or neighbours and some people don\u2019t have access to all the tech to provide a decent sound quality and video quality during classes",
        "background": "As someone who studies musical theatre, I fail to see how my course and many other arts degrees don\u2019t fall into the list of degrees that will go back on the 5th January. Thus we ask that the government allow us to go back so we can advance in our degrees",
