We need to come together as a society in these unprecedented time but it isn\u2019t working, issue rations books to each household.",
        "background": "At present we are relying on common sense and shops to regulate their own rationing system but it isn\u2019t working.  People are still hoarding and clearing shelves.  Issue ration books to each house for use when shopping in supermarkets, butchers etc to limit the quantities people can purchase.",
