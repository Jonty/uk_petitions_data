        "additional_details": "The mental health of young people is important. soon suicide statistics will become higher than coronavirus. No student has motivation any more, they have gave up. Mini exams are unfair. cancel the academic year and let students rest, not only physically but mentally too. Don\u2019t let the young generation down, they need your help. The coronavirus stress wasn\u2019t enough, now they stress about their future too.",
        "background": "The teachers have all the information they need to give students grades. If students aren\u2019t happy with the grade they\u2019re given they can retake it later. Introducing mini exams has put more stress on students than ever before. They\u2019re just bringing the real ones more forward if anything.",
