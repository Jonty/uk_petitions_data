It can't be left to BBC management to regulate itself and decide how much it thinks it is worth. It must be forced to work within a given budget, shared among every applicable household plus 10 per cent to cover non payers and any money made through selling on content or merchandise to be spread between the licence fee holders at years end.",

To operate within a budget averaged from other mainstream broadcasters pre profit. Over 65 / under 18 given free licence. Managers+ to have public annual audit on performance and impartiality.",
