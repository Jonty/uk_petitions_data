        "additional_details": "While the government has started a number of programs to help people buy their own property, for people who live in areas where property values are higher than average (for example Surrey where properties are around 3x higher than the national average) it\u2019s still expensive. Furthermore the amount a person can get for their mortgage remains the same despite the difference in house prices. People in these areas should be allowed to get a higher mortgage providing they can pay it off in time.",
        "background": "Allow money lenders to provide mortgages of up to 10x annual income in areas where property values are higher than the UK average in order to allow people who live in these areas to own their own property instead of having to spend higher amounts renting.",
