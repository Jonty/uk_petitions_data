        "action": "Reduce tuition fees for students studying primarily from home",
        "additional_details": "During COVID-19 University students were neglected in the governments plans to reopen leaving many students fearful of what this meant for their education. In the UK, university degrees are encouraged and needed for many jobs, meaning those attending university rely on the knowledge, support and resources of their chosen university to get a job post-university allowing them to contribute to the economy. Education from home won\u2019t allow students to reach their full potential.",
        "background": "Reduce tuition fees for students that will be studying predominately from home as the quality on education will not be of the same standard as pre-COVID 19 teaching. Many students in the creative arts (dance, music & theatre etc) do not have a suitable environment to be educated from home.",
