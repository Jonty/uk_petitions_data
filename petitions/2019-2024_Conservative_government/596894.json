This will open up more availability of drivers to fill the void even if you cap it of five years of driving experience.",

These rights still exist, so we're not sure what you mean by asking for these to be reinstated.\r\n\r\nIf what you want is for the Government to give anyone with a driving licence the right to drive 7.5 tonne HGVs, we could accept a petition requesting this.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nGrant PSV holders automatic Class 2 entitlement for free: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/590718\r\n\r\nProvide grants to pay for the training of more HGV Drivers: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/593511\r\n\r\nGive Class 2 drivers a Class 1 licence without needing to take the test: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/596865\r\n\r\nReduce training/testing requirements and introduce grants for HGV C1E licences: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/593120"
