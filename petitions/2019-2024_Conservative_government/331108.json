        "additional_details": "Wild camping is a civil offense in England and Wales unless the permission of the landowner has been granted. However, with most woodland, moors, and other such areas, who owns the land, and how to contact them is very unclear.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Land Reform Act of 2003 allows camping in almost any unenclosed area in Scotland, granted the area is left how it is found.\r\n\r\nWild camping is often regarded as the best way to escape to feel free and grounded, with little reason it shouldn't be legal.",
