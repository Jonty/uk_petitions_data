        "additional_details": "During pandemic all GCSE and A levels have been cancelled which are key to determine future of kids, while authorities are considering to delay secondary transfer test. This feels unfair for kids who have not been able to study since last three months due to closure of schools and tuition centers and disadvantaged kids. If this gets delayed then it will have huge impact on mental health of kids to continue to study for coming months. We strongly recommend to either take exams on time or cancel.",
        "background": "We would like all Grammar Schools in England to either continue with Secondary transfer test as original dates or cancel it completely. This would be unfair on all kids preparing for last two years specially while kids have lost their key education time in last three months, if exams get delayed.",
