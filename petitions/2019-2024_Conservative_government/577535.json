        "additional_details": "Britain has drastically cut its aid to Yemen, which has been devastated by conflict for six years, saying the pandemic created \"a difficult financial context for us all\".\r\n\r\nThe planned UK cuts have been called by Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN Chief, a \"death sentence\" for the people of Yemen.\r\n\r\nWe can, and must, do more to protect people who are in the most need. Please sign to demand the UK gov. provides for those most in need.",
        "background": "We are asking the UK Government to immediately reverse its planned cut to aid for the people of Yemen who are living through what has been called the world's worst humanitarian crisis. 60% of the population relies on aid, millions of people including young children, are being abandoned by the UK.",
