        "additional_details": "It is essential that we have as many COVID-19 vaccines as possible to meet global demand. Vaccine trial participants have selflessly given their time and risked taking an experimental vaccine to help make this happen. When the government removes any requirements for fully vaccinated people to self-isolate, the same requirements to self-isolate must be removed for vaccine trial participants, otherwise the government will disincentivize people from taking part in these vital trials.",
        "background": "I would like the government to confirm that from 16 August, all participants in vaccine trials will no longer be required to self-isolate if they have come into contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. All changes to self-isolation rules for the fully vaccinated should apply to trial participants.",
