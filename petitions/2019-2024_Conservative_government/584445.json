        "additional_details": "The Universal Declaration of Animal Rights should ban and seek to end (as far as possible) all unnecessary abuse, use and killing of animals for food, experiments, testing, fur, hunting, trapping, circuses, zoos, blood-sports, racing, clothing, skins, Chinese medicine and cruel training. All perpetrators of animal cruelty laws be punished as severely as if the victim/s were human. We demand that the UK Government pass all of this into law and pressure other countries and the UN to do the same.",
        "background": "From fur trapping and farming to the cruelty of dairy, from shooting to meat farming, from animals in circuses to egg farming, and from zoos to testing, humans abuse, use and kill nonhuman animals as if they didn\u2019t matter! Animals do matter! It\u2019s time to change the world for animals!",
