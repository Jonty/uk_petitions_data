        "additional_details": "At a time where non-essential travel is discouraged / banned and commuters are taking pay cuts / being furloughed to help businesses survive, it seems highly inappropriate that those same individuals should lose thousands of pounds through an unfair annual season ticket refund scheme. \r\n\r\nAnnual season tickets should be frozen to give people peace of mind. Annual season ticket holders should not be punished financially during this crisis.",
        "background": "We are calling on the government (department for transport) to freeze annual rail season tickets during the Coronavirus lockdown. \r\n\r\nCurrent refund policies offered by rail companies such as Thameslink leave commuters thousands of pounds out of pocket.",
