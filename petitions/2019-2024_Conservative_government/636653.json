Across the country, many will be in the same position as me. We want to be able to perform our best in our exams, and this can only be done right now if exams are marked with leniency or we are offered advanced information. If these requirements are not met, millions of students will be left in a disadvantaged position, and the government will bear the consequences of a failed generation.",
