This is over 6 times more than in the same period last year and the most in a single month since the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2013. People on Universal Credit increased by 40% in one month. With the UK's children already having some of the worst food security in the EU, the above statistic can only have a worsening effect on child poverty.",
        "background": "I ask that the government continues to offer each eligible child a free \u2018school\u2019 meal voucher that exceeds what it pays to schools for free school meals (due to not bulk buying) throughout the months of July and August to mitigate the negative impact of growing deprivation worsened by Covid-19.",
