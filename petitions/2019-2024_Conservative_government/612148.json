The Government has produced guidance on the admission and care of residents in a care home during COVID-19, which recommends self-isolation and reducing communal activities in certain circumstances: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes/coronavirus-covid-19-admission-and-care-of-people-in-care-homes\r\n\r\nDeciding how to implement this guidance is an operational matter for individual care homes.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for the Government's guidance on the admission and care of residents in a care home during COVID-19 to be changed, if that's something you'd like to happen."
