        "additional_details": "Outdoor tennis is naturally socially distanced and represents limited risk of transmission of Covid. The risks of transmission can be further reduced by hand washing, closing pavillions/bars at tennic clubs and players using their own balls when serving. \r\n\r\nThe health, including mental health benefits, from playing tennis outweigh any risks from it, so the government should allow outdoor tennis to continue during lockdown.",
