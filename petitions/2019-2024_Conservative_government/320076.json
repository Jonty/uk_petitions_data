        "additional_details": "The RSPCA reported \u201c\r\nAn estimated 200,000 sky lanterns are sold and released each year in the UK. As the popularity of these items increase, so does the risk to wildlife. They also cause injury and suffering to animals and have a devastating impact on the environment.\r\nThere have been reports of animals becoming entangled in these lanterns and becoming injured trying to free themselves, which will cause extreme stress and suffering.\u201d This is before discussing Ingestion  off them and wild fires.",
        "background": "The government works hard to provide a thriving farming economy which this country should be proud of whilst it also has a booming equine industry. Chinese or flying lanterns cause pain, suffering and death for many of these harmless animals. To see them banned would put a stop to this.",
