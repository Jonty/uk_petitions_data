        "additional_details": "The NHS is a cornerstone of our society. It underpins British values of fairness and helping those most in need. If we allow the NHS to be sold to Big Pharma in trade talks with the US, we will all end up worse off and many will die simply because they cannot afford proper healthcare - as happens in America right now. We must protect the NHS, especially after the immense sacrifice they\u2019ve made throughout the coronavirus crisis, and ensure it is owned by all of us, for all of us, forever.",
        "background": "On 20th July, the government voted down an amendment which would have prevented our NHS from being sold to the highest bidder after leaving the EU. They promised they wouldn\u2019t allow the NHS to be sold off. We call on the government to exclude the NHS and NHS services from any post-Brexit trade deals",
