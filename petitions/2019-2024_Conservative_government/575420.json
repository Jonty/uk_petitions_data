Some of us cannot wear masks so we are shielding but not been asked to. Asthma is dangerous and if we get COVID it is dangerous. All asthma patients should be next regardless of severity to save lives. You tell us to get the Flu Jab for free every year with pregnant, over 70s and diabetics, so why are we left out with COVID which is in the same family?!",

Anyone diagnosed with asthma should be next on the list for the vaccine. Asthma can kill regardless of severity!",
