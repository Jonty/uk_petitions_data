They would\u2019ve also already finished the course by now, so what would they do for a year? They may also find the exam too easy it\u2019s almost pointless, this may be because they were planning to do a more challenging exam in year 11 e.g. further maths after doing normal maths in year 10. If someone wanted to retake after getting a predicted, they should be given the option to do it in year 11, but for others, they should just be given a predicted grade.",
        "background": "It seems completely unfair that year 10s and younger who were given the privilege to do a specific GCSE a year(s) early are being told they have to do it in year 11 like everyone else, especially when year 11s will be given these new predicted grades. They should apply the same rules for year 10s.",
