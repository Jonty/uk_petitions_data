        "additional_details": "70% or more of a bars income is taken after 10pm by enforcing a curfew at 10pm the government is almost completely removing key trading hours for most of these types of businesses and as a result making them unsustainable. This is not going to be restricted to just independent businesses, nearly every business in the Industry will be adversely effected and will be put in serious financial jeopardy. The government is risking millions of jobs.",
        "background": "Review the 10pm curfew imposed on bars and restaurants due to Covid or provide the Industry with empirical evidence as to why it will make a difference and then support the Industry through it.",
