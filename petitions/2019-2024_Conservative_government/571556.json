This leaves them vulnerable and exposed to risk of harm from others who have access to the individual throughout the duration of the night.\r\n\r\nThis petition is seeking signatures of support to request that parliament reconsider the law in order to reduce the risk of harm from others to employees working through the night in the hospitality sector.",
        "background": "I am aware of the lack of directive law surrounding risk management and security for those working alone at night in the hospitality sector. \r\n\r\nWhile keeping within petition standards I call upon parliament to review the law surrounding lone working within the hospitality sector.",
