        "action": "Change the passing criteria for year 3 university students during this pandemic.",
        "additional_details": "We want the government to tell the universities to change the module requirements during this pandemic in order to ease the pressure from learning from home. This will give more weight to the modules completed already, meaning less modules need to be completed to pass, dissertation to be scrapped or word count made dramatically lower than 10,000 words. Completing a dissertation all from home with no face to face communication is daunting and scary. This is the least that should be done, considering the amount of money students have paid for this year.",
        "background": "Year 3 University Students having to learn from home on their most important year is extremely detrimental to their overall grade that they have worked nearly 3 years for! This pandemic is already stressful enough but to include a dissertation on top of that while working from home is difficult.",
