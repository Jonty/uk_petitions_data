        "additional_details": "By closing schools, and with people forced to spend more time at home in winter, they will have significantly higher heating bills above what they have budgeted for.  Families usually turn the heating off during the day, which they will not now be able to do as they are at home, causing an increase in fuel poverty amongst the poor.  Covid 19 spreads in cold, cramped, overcrowded conditions, and by forcing families into fewer rooms with lower temperatures, they are at greater risk of infection.",
