        "action": "Make public sexual harassment (PSH) illegal",
        "additional_details": "Recent studies prove that 97% of women have been harassed in the U.K. with 96% not bothering to report it since they believed nothing would be done. This shows the gravity of the situation we\u2019re in, and how it is vital that changes are made within the law to protect women across the country. \r\nFrance has already introduced a law to protect women from PSH which has proved efficient and successful, and the fines given out to those guilty must be introduced in this country.",
        "background": "Public sexual harassment (PSH) is not currently illegal in the United Kingdom, and this extremely damaging to the lives of women across the U.K. The government needs to pass a bill that specifically outlaws public harassment, and ensure that the punishment for harassing women is serious.",
