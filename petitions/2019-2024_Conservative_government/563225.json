        "additional_details": "The modelled predictions put forward by SAGE are massively over-inflated compared to models used by other scientific researchers throughout the world and the use of PCR testing to identify positives has and still is being questioned by many in the scientific world which have now resulted in a not fully tested vaccine being used on the UK population. There needs to be a full public enquiry to ascertain whether the Government has been falsely influenced in its decision making.",
        "background": "It appears that much of the information passed to Government regarding Covid-19, especially from SAGE has been somewhat over-exaggerated. SAGE along with other sources of information need to be fully investigated by an independent public body and Government must act on its findings.",
