Their current closure means bedding and perennials will be binned unless sold.  Many of the nurseryman are small businesses and will lose their livelihoods, unless they can be reclassified as supermarkets during the pandemic. Garden centres are on average larger than supermarkets, with a lower footfall, so the risk of transmission of Coronavirus is comparatively lower for shoppers.",
