        "additional_details": "Since the pandemic hit back in 2020 children were asked to remain home from school for almost 5 months of their school year . On returning to school, they have had to do a massive catch up especially for the younger key-stage 1 pupils. Now we are hit with another possible 4 months of no formal education and not even fully caught up on what they have missed previously. This is unfair on all children and their education should not be the price they pay.",
        "background": "Children have missed almost a year of education. For younger years especially this is a major disruption, they\u2019ve missed out on vital formal education on the main skills like reading and writing. Putting all children back a year will help them improve on what they have missed.",
