        "additional_details": "It is unfair for parents of young children to have to reduce their income and hours to look after their children. It can slow down their opportunities for progression at work. \r\n\r\nThese are people who work and pay tax and they shouldn\u2019t need to struggle with childcare and pay outrageous fees, they should get extra help with the free child care early funding for 2 year olds not just when the child turns 3/4.",
        "background": "Extend free child care for all children over the age of 2. Child care costs are too prohibitive for working parents who are struggling to cover this cost of living, whilst those on benefits (on low hours or unemployed) already get free child care from the age of 2.",
