        "additional_details": "The government is under heavy debt due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The government can reduce the amount of debt by taxing Cannabis as it has estimated that this could generate upwards of \u00a33BILLION from the taxation of Cannabis alone.  \r\nLegalising Cannabis would encourage more people to germinate the Cannabis plant. This would make a huge impact on the reduction of climate change due to photosynthesis.\r\nIt is time to let the British people choose what they want, not what the government wants",
        "background": "Cannabis has been used by humans for thousands of years and has been a necessity in some cultures and religions. As a matter of fact, the body and brain both contain cannabinoid receptors, therefore further highlighting that Cannabis has been part of human culture for thousands of years.",
