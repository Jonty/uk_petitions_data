We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the Parliamentary Constituencies Bill 2019-21, the recommendations of the Boundary Commissions for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on redrawing constituency boundaries would no longer require Parliamentary approval. However, the Commissions are already independent bodies, and government ministers will have no power to alter their recommendations under the terms of the Bill.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about the Bill here: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8921/\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for the relevant provisions to be withdrawn from the Bill and for MPs to continue to have to vote to confirm recommendations of the Boundary Commission, if that's something you'd like to see happen."
