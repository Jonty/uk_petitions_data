Post the UK's exit from the EU, many UK nationals resident in the EU have had their UK Banking services removed.  Some of the Banks have withdrawn all services, such as Coutts, Citibank, Barclays and Lloyds, whilst other banks such as HSBC have not. There is a risk that UK nationals resident in the EU will be unable to have access to a basic UK banking service in future.  Government legislation is required to remove this risk.",
