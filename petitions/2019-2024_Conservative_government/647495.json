        "additional_details": "I would like the government or parliament to take care of this as they have the power and voice to change the law or add to the law. I believe this will be the best way to take a massive step to being more eco-friendly and doing our part to stop Global Warming. We can also save 16,000 gallons of water and 20 trees for each ton of stone paper products. My main goal is to make our country more eco-friendly.",
