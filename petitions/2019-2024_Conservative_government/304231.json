        "additional_details": "We are in an unprecedented crisis, both medically & commercially. The consequences for all are far reaching; most people face immediate economic hardship. Basic Universal Income ensures business & self employed survive the current conditions & our economic landscape will not be so damaged. Workers facing long unemployment & self isolation will be able to pay rent & feed families, along with other vulnerable groups in the UK. \r\nDWP should be overhauled, with BUI replacing state pension & benefits.",
        "background": "Immediately pass emergency legislation that creates Basic Universal Income for all. Paid by bank transfer monthly, to all with NI Number & bank account. Amount should reflect cost of living and rent / mortgage payments, i,e \u00a31,500 per month and paid without condition of circumstance.",
