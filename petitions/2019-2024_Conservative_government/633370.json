These people are at home looking for jobs and have to attend the job centre - their kids can go with them! It should be those who are working that get the most help with childcare. My child goes everywhere with me apart from work because it\u2019s impossible to do so. I put into the system like many others and all we get is \u2018tax free childcare\u2019, so you are taking away what you take in the first place",
