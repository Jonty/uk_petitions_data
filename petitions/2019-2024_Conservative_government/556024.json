        "additional_details": "The MP's do not need subsidised food and drink, as the general population of the United Kingdom do not have that privilege. Any expenses for food and drink should be eliminated and any subsidised hospitality (food and drink) should be as a minimum on full cost recovery basis, as MP's receive a generous salary, well above the UK median salary.",
        "background": "Government and MP's should lead by example, while children and citizens suffer from poverty and hunger across the country. We as a nation can't continue to support their lavish food and drink habits. They have become dependent. It is only fair and right that they give up food and drink subsidies.",

            "details": "We have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nIncrease food and drink prices for MPs in House of Commons catering venues: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/555565\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons Catering service does not provide a subsidised service in the commercial sense of the word. Some venues make a profit, while in other venues the cost of providing the service does exceed the income received in sales due to the irregular hours and unpredictability of parliamentary business. The House of Commons publishes details of the cost of House of Commons catering services: https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/foi/transparency-publications/hoc-transparency-publications/catering-services/transparency-reporting-catering-services/\r\n\r\nCustomers of the House of Commons Catering Services include some of the 650 MPs but also around 14,500 other pass-holders, many of whom are staff on lower wages that work irregular hours. In addition, members of the public and non pass holding visitors to Parliament also have access to these services. The irregular hours and the unpredictability of Parliamentary business contribute to increasing the net cost of providing a catering service. To offset this many of the restaurants, dining room facilities and their staff, are used to cater for private events at times when they are not required by the House. This is one of a number of measures used to reduce costs.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government and Parliament aren't responsible for setting MPs' pay or expenses. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) is responsible for deciding on MPs' expenses and pay. IPSA is independent of both Parliament and Government.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about IPSA here: https://www.theipsa.org.uk/about-us/\r\n\r\nMPs may claim for the cost of purchasing food and non-alcoholic drinks where they have stayed overnight outside the London Area and their constituency. This is limited to \u00a325 for each night they have stayed, but the claims can be for purchases made during the day."
