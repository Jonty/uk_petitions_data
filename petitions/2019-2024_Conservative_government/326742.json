        "action": "Petition Nicola Sturgeon & Scottish Government to open Scottish Zoos immediately",
        "additional_details": "With businesses such as clothing retailers being allowed to reopen now, garden centres opened up & pubs & restaurants being discussed with outdoor spaces, it makes no sense to keep our Zoos closed. They are predominantly outdoor spaces who can easily adhere to social distancing rules. The government are prioritising human needs before animal welfare & conservation & need to address this immediately. We need our zoos & they need us.",
        "background": "Zoos are vital to conservation of our wildlife, with extensive rehoming & breeding programmes for endangered animals. The government have suggested they may be able to reopen from 15th July which risks them losing more vital funding for the animals. They should be allowed to open immediately.",
