        "action": "Provide emergency funding for UK Theatres to prevent closures and job  losses.",
        "additional_details": "The world of theatre generates billions for the economy and employs thousand of people throughout the UK. British Theatre is the best in the world. It would be a national tragedy to see it disappear. We owe it to thousands of employees in all areas of theatre to protect their jobs. The West End of London will become a ghost town without theatre and this has a knock on effect for other industries including, public transport, pubs, bars and restaurants who benefit from patrons of the theatre.",
        "background": "The closure of UK Theatres due to the Pandemic, has robbed them of their main source of income. Ticket Sales. Theatres may be one of the last to reopen, and we are already witnessing permanent closures and job losses. Temporary short term funding by the Government is vital to save the industry",
