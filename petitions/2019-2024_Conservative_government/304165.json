        "additional_details": "Around a fifth of staff are not in the NHS Pension scheme as they cannot afford contributions. Government should ensure that they  receive the same lump sum benefits as those payable to members of the scheme if they die due to COVID-19.\r\nAll members of the NHS Pension scheme who succumb to the virus should have their full pension paid for fifteen years instead of the current five and three times their annual salary as death in service benefits. The latter should be tax free for all.",
        "background": "Parliament should realise that HCW are putting their lives at risk while carrying for patients with COVID-19. This is due to inadequate planning, restricted testing and lack of personal protection equipment. Families of those who die should receive greater support from the Department of Health.",
