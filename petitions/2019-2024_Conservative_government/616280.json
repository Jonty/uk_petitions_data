Some have asked trusted friends to keep their children safe. \r\n\r\nThis poses some child protection issues for the visa agency. But excluding these families from applying is not the answer.\r\n\r\nThe UK government must stop excluding these groups from the Homes for Ukraine scheme so that they can be welcomed by the many people waiting to open their homes to them.",

The government has excluded these vulnerable groups from entering the UK.\r\n\r\nSafeguarding these children is paramount.  They must be allowed to enter the UK.",
