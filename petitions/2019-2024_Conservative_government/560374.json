        "action": "Free school meals regardless of houseold income for children upto 16yrs",
        "additional_details": "If free school meals are provided to every child regardless of household incomes then this would in turn reduce stress for parents and they would be able to focus their finances on other essential things needed. In the current times it is already hard for everyone to be able to stay afloat during this pandemic so it would be nice for parents not to worry about how they can afford food for their child.  Please look into creating a new idea of where schools provide meals to every child, which is funded by the government.",
        "background": "Parents should not have to pay for school meals for their children, and kids should not be penalised by this just because their parents income is above the threshold. It should be a basic right that children are able to have access to a good meal whilst on the premises of an educational facility.",
