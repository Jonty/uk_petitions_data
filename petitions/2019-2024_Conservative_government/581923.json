        "additional_details": "97% of woman have been sexually harassed in the UK. These harassment's include unconsented touching, inappropriate sexual comments and wolf whistling to name a few. Woman have to deal with this when at school, work, in bars and walking down the street. This issue needs to be dealt with. I believe that by educating young people on the the harm this can have and the repercussions they can face, it will help to reduce the high percentage of victims.",
        "background": "Woman all over the world are still being treated unfairly and fear for their safety on a daily basis. If schools taught the impact of sexual harassment it would help educate young people before they acted out these behaviours.",
