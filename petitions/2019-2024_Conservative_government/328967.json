        "additional_details": "We have bought a house that is now going to be completed in April 2021 and was meant to be November 2020, which will mean we can\u2019t use the current scheme any longer as the property is more than the new limit that is coming into effect 1st April 2021. We are not the only people that are in this situation and the Scottish Government have already extended theirs so we should do the same to ensure that the housing sector bounces back quickly from this pandemic.",
        "background": "Extend the current Help to Buy scheme to allow people who have put a deposit down on a property to still use the current scheme after their completion date has been moved to within the new schemes dates due to COVID-19.",
