        "action": "Make wearing face masks compulsory where social distancing is difficult.",
        "additional_details": "This petition is brought by the membership body for the over 60s, Silver Voices, as Coronavirus will still be present in the community when lock down is relaxed. Masks give some protection from asymptomatic carriers of the virus, and will save many lives of  vulnerable people of all ages. Mask-wearing will be an important contribution to the lock down exit strategy. Most countries are adopting similar measures. Exemptions for very young children and on medical grounds should be considered.",
        "background": "Legislate to make wearing face masks compulsory in all public places where social distancing is difficult, including shops, workplaces and public transport. Government stockpiling of appropriate face masks should begin now so that they can be provided free or at low cost as the lock down ends,",
