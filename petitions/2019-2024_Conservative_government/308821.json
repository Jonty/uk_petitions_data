        "additional_details": "Covid-19 has closed colleges and teaching has moved to online classes. Students are expected to teach themselves three months of course work with limited help. Work is challenging in college and even harder when trying to do it autonomously and students need their grades to go to university. As a final year student we are worried we will get a lower grade and it will compromise our university places.",
        "background": "I would like the government to give final year students studying A-level equivalent courses their predicted grades. This is due to the fact students will have to teach themselves a three months of course work at home with limited access to teachers and resources.",
