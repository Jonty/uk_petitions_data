        "additional_details": "The government have already thankfully guaranteed three month holidays for mortgage holders. However, the poorest and most vulnerable do not own their homes. Many are now faced with the task of paying their rent relying on statutory sick pay of \u00a394.25 a week. Others on zero hours contracts or who have lost thier jobs have seen their income fall to zero. The average Landlord rents out 6-7 properties and could still live comfortably were they to lose some of their income for a couple of months.",
        "background": "The government claims it will do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to save the economy, but the most vulnerable workers have no protection from the unprecedented disruption caused by COVID-19. We demand rent payment holidays and protection to tenants from eviction as the country grapples with this new threat.",
