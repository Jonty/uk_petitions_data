However with vaping being a safer alternative, I believe it should be made available to the general public. \r\n\r\nResearch has show that smoking is the single greatest cause of preventable illness and premature death in the UK. Smoking kills over 120,000 people in the UK a year. On the other hand the NHS has estimated that vaping is 95% less harmful!",
