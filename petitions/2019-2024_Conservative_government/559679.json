        "additional_details": "This is because sign language would be of more use to us instead of French, Spanish, German etc or to replace one lesson a week with learning it. Making this mandatory could change lives and mean deaf children or adults won't need a specialist or escort as its a norm that everyone or almost everyone is familiar with sign language.",
        "background": "I and multiple of my peers want sign language added to he school curriculum. This would mean implementing one or two sign language lessons a week to teach students how to communicate with the deaf. I am familiar with deaf people but unable to communicate any way other than text.",
