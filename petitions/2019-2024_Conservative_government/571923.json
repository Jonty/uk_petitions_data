        "additional_details": "Children transmit Covid 19.  This is now a known fact.  All school staff should be afforded high priority to receive the vaccine if the Government wants to reopen the schools.  Yes, children are at a detriment not being at school, but the constant opening and closing of the schools because of Staff becoming unwell with Covid and children passing it between one another, is a huge detriment also! \r\nPlease allow ALL school staff to be vaccinated as a priority and BEFORE schools return.",
        "background": "All school staff should be offered the vaccine prior to schools reopening. This should be a priority.  Masks and opening windows is simply not enough.  School staff have the right to be protected as much as Doctors and Nurses if they are forced to work around those who transmit Covid 19.",
