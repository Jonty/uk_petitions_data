        "additional_details": "The NHS has been struggling under immense pressure for a number of years, particularly in the aftermath of covid and the current cost of living crisis. I believe that the vast majority of UK residents recognise the unmeasurable value of the NHS and would like to support it to continue to run effectively. By introducing optional contactless payment terminals, the public could provide funding towards pay increases, hiring new staff and purchasing medical equipment.",
        "background": "I would like the government to install tap and go contactless donation terminals in the waiting rooms of all GP surgeries and hospitals across the UK. As previously trialled in a small number of hospitals, the terminals could have a set donation amount of \u00a35 or provide an option to donate more.",
