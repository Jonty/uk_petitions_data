        "additional_details": "I worked hard and saved to get onto the property ladder. My experience and loss of money has put me off renting to anyone on benefits. In the current housing crisis where there is more people on a list for a council house than available houses the government should support private landlords so they don't fear a loss of income by renting to benefit recievers. What evidence does the government have that people are using the UC housing element to actually pay rent?",
        "background": "I lost \u00a34K to a tenant that left my property with rent arrears and damage. They were in employment and receiving UC housing payments and disabled benefit. They bought items like PlayStation, \u00a33k sofa, wallsized fish tank and many pets; yet couldn't pay rent. I called UC and recieved no help.",
