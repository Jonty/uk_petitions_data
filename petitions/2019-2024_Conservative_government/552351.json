Even with transgender rights becoming more prominent, transgender people often feel uncomfortable with the gender on their documentation - even if it\u2019s changed. In the Netherlands, it is planned to remove gender from all identification to avoid upsetting or making transgender people uncomfortable. Why can\u2019t this happen in the UK? If the UK is truly free why is specifying your gender necessary?",
