        "additional_details": "Calculate MIF on a realistic working year like the employed (inc. holiday & B/H).  Allow the self employed to pay the govenment minimum into a pension (currently 8% of earnings) before considering their income.  Allow the business to have a float of 40% of the previous 3 years earnings to ensure that when the MIF is not reached, the money can be taken from the float to reach the MIF. When income arrives allow that money to be replaced upto that threshold of 40% before deductions in UC are made.",
        "background": "Universal Credit minimum income floor is calculated on 52wks. The Self Employed deserve the same considerations as the employed, 8 bank holidays, 28 days holiday.  Self Employed by its very nature in order to not identify as IR35 should not come as a regular monthly pay so why is UC punishing them.",
