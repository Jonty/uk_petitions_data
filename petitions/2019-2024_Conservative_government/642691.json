        "action": "All senior NHS managers must be regulated by statute.",
        "additional_details": "The government must set up a regulatory body to ensure all senior NHS managers e.g. Executive and Non-Executive Directors can be held accountable for their actions.\r\nRecent events demonstrate yet again how those in position of authority can instil fear in NHS staff, demoralise whistleblowers and ultimately harm patients and families from their autocratic actions, often designed to protect their own careers and the organisation over and above the welfare of patients. This must STOP.",
        "background": "Presently, senior NHS officials are only regulated if they are registered with their professional body such as the General Medical Council for doctors and Nurse & Midwifery Council for nurses. There is no requirement for them to be registered, and many who are not career managers remain unregulated.",
