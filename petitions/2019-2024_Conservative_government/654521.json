        "additional_details": "Selling sites such as eBay and depop are not only a good way to earn money by selling or save money by buying cheap. It's also very good for the environment. These sites encourage cyclical fashion and help reduce the amount of items getting dumped, thrown away or fly tipped. \r\n\r\nThis new taxation rule is both egregious and so disappointing. When we thought things couldn't get worse and there was nothing more the government could do to screw over the everyday person they now try to tax us on this.",
        "background": "Stop taxing people on their side hustle earnings if they earn over \u00a31000 per year or sell more than 30 items per year. \r\n\r\nPeople do this to earn a little extra money during a particularly tough time and taxing them on it is unjust. \r\n\r\nPeople should be able to earn extra money on the side.",
