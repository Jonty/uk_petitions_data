        "additional_details": "I want the government to ensure all key and Critical Workers are paid Hazard Pay during the Coronavirus Pandemic. I think its only fair that those in these positions are paid more for risking the health and safety of themselves and those around them. They still have family to go home to and many won't want to take that risk. As a key worker myself and only on minimum wage I feel like it's not enough to make me want to risk the health and safety of my family 2 of which are high risk.",

Loads of workers are using up holiday in fear of going in and unable to afford not to. They should be paid more during this time.",
