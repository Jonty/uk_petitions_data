        "additional_details": "The UK government is likely to drop plans to ban imports of fur amid cabinet opposition. The measures were due to be included in the Animals Abroad Bill, to be introduced soon but several cabinet ministers have raised different concerns about the proposals.",
        "background": "Fur farming was banned in England and Wales in 2000, followed by Scotland in 2002. However fur products can still be legally imported from other countries and sold here in the UK. Much of this fur comes from countries that have very weak or no animal welfare laws at all.",
