        "additional_details": "Hoax callers cost an estimated \u00a3606,347 between 2015-2019 to London ambulance service. Not accounting the rest of the UK or police forces/fire services also called.\r\nA woman was fined \u00a3165 (of the current \u00a35000 fine/6 month prison time) for making 200 hoax calls costing our emergency services \u00a324,883.\r\n\r\nI believe by enforcement to the law stated and a \u00a310,000 fine alongside the 6 month sentence will deter future hoax callers. This will relieve the time and money of our NHS and emergency services.",
        "background": "Currently the Government offer \u00a35000 fine and/or a 6 month sentence in prison. However callers are rarely caught/convicted. By raising the fine to \u00a310,000 alongside the sentence and funding police forces to catch and convict prank callers will deter future callers, saving lives & relieving our NHS.",
