        "additional_details": "I am a headteacher in Kent. I am always looking for ways to improve learning opportunities for all children in school so that they achieve their full potential. The COVID-19 Pandemic has not only highlighted this issue of lower attainment levels of disadvantaged children but has reversed the progress of some. Lack of access to online learning was a significant factor. The attainment gap between non-disadvantaged and disadvantaged is widening. We cannot let this inequality continue.",
        "background": "We need government funding for disadvantaged families who are unable to afford wifi and a home laptop/computer.  Every school age child should have access to the same learning opportunities. More children are falling further behind their peers as a result of not having access to online learning.",
