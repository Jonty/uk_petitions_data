        "action": "Allow University students on Art courses access to studios during lockdown",
        "additional_details": "Arts courses can\u2019t be taught with lectures alone, and without studios we lack the fundamental component of a creative course. For many of us, University is the one time we\u2019re guaranteed to have access to high level equipment and resources, and this is a big reason we decide to study at University in the first place. Veterinary students aren't expected to complete their studies without practicals and Artists should not be expected to work without the vital studios for which we are paying \u00a39250.",
        "background": "We call on the government to add Fine Art, and other studio-based degrees, to the list of courses eligible to return to campus during lockdown. We cannot complete our degree to the same standards and in some cases, at all, without the vital studios, workshops and equipment only available on campus.",
