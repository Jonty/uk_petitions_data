        "additional_details": "Dairy milk uses more water, needs more land and creates more carbon emissions than all plant-based alternatives (Poore & Nemecek, 2018).\r\n\r\nWhilst, fortified plant-based milks provides children with the same vitamins and nutrients (calcium, B12, protein) in similar amounts to dairy milk.\r\n\r\nSubsidising plant-based milks will provide an option for families and children who cannot drink dairy for ethical, religious or medical reasons and ensure no child is left out of the 'Nursery Milk Scheme'.",
        "background": "Moving towards plant-based milks and dairy-free food choices has the potential to drastically reduce our impact on the climate and ecological crises. However, while many people are adopting plant-based lifestyles, no plant-based milks are subsidised through the 'Nursery Milk Scheme'.",
