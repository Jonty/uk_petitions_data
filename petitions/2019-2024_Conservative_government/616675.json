        "additional_details": "It's unfair on the Northern Irish people to pay the full salaries of MLA's that refuse to take their seats over a protest about the NI Protocol, when more MLA's that support the protocol were elected that MLA's that don't support it, which clearly shows more support from the people of Northern Ireland  for the protocol.",
        "background": "MLA\u2019s continue to be paid, despite not having a sitting assembly over one parties protest over the NI protocol. This is unacceptable, MLA salaries from parties that refuse to form an assembly should cease until a negotiation has been reached and a sitting Northern Irish Assembly has been restored.",
