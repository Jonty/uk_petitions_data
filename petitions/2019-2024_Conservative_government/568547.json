        "additional_details": "Early years settings have played and continue to play a vital role within the fight against covid. They have continued to provide support for so many families throughout this pandemic however at what  cost? \r\n\r\nDue to lack of Government support the sector is now at risk of collapse. \r\n\r\nSo we are asking the Government to act now and make a difference before it is too late.",
        "background": "Early Years settings in the UK remain open without no regard to the financial impact this has on the sector. Therefore we are asking the Government to provide Early Years settings in the UK with the recognition that they deserve; through a clear and comprehensive financial package.",
