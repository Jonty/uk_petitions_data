        "additional_details": "Thousands of trangender teens suffer from the physical and mental torture of gender dysphoria. A really helpful way to relieve this is by getting gender affirming surgeries such as top and bottom surgery along with others. Banning this would be a huge setback for the acceptance of the LGBTQ+ Community and will likely be overall more harmful to these teens.",
        "background": "There has been debate recently about making gender affirming surgeries illegal for under 18s in the UK. There was also an anouncement for the Equalities Minister. This feels like the world is going backwards. Do not illegalise it!",
