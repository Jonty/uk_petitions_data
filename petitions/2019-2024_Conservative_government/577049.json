        "additional_details": "Bottled water is pointless and dangerous. It's suffocating marine animals, leaching micro plastics into our water supplies and contains chemicals that harm human health.\r\nPlastic is not sustainable. Its main component is alkenes obtained from  oil, and it can't be recycled indefinitely. \r\nPlastic is polluting the environment, it\u2019s bad for human health and it\u2019s not sustainable. We have got to stop being so dependent on it and must remove unnecessary plastic items.",
        "background": "Single use water bottles need to be replaced. Fountains could be filled with water supplied by bottled water companies. Customers could be charged to fill up their own reusable water bottles with water from these fountains.",
