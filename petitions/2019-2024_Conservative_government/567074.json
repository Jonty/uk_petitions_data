        "additional_details": "The government needs to take ownership of its decisions and be judged by the people of all the UK.\r\n\r\nPolicies are made, adjusted and dropped leading to serious effects on the economy, peoples jobs and wellbeing. \r\n\r\nThe Government must be held to account in a way that it can truly see if it is acting in the best interests of the electorate. \r\n\r\nThe principles of democracy are eroding under this government. Reelection would confirm support they must accept they no longer represent the people.",
        "background": "The inconsistencies of implementing policy, the lack of public support, the clouded reasoning for decision making and the rapid changes of the current government are damaging faith in elected figures\r\n\r\nThe electorate should be given a chance to support so choose a new government",
