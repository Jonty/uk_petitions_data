Members of parliament including the prime minister, have been reported & fined due to be taking part in illegal lockdown parties. Families could not even attend the funerals of their loved ones, fathers and mothers died with nobody to hold their hand. This government has broken the very laws that they enacted, and have acted with contempt towards the great people of this country. There must be a public decision.",
