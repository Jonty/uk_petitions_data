        "additional_details": "The current regulatory systems contain multiple obligations to report & respond to concerns, but, they haven't achieved their objective with whistleblowers being victimised with open hostility, confirmed by Sir Robert Francis in his report & later reviews. Thereafter self-directed honesty has failed time & time again. This mandate could be incorporated into The Public Information Disclosure (protection) Bill or The Office for Whistleblower Bill which are currently in the Parliamentary Process.",
        "background": "Protect passionate Healthcare staff who dedicate their lives to the care of others by making it a contractual obligation for clinical staff to Whistleblow, and especially for managerial staff to investigate, resolve, & report on the concerns raised & make the same reports available for scrutiny.",
