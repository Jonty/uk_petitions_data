        "additional_details": "As a hardworking British citizen I am furious that if a dog is stolen the police only follow up on 1% of reported dog thefts, Dogs are sentient beings and suffer great distress being taken and often abused, used for greed in puppy farming or sold on. But in crime levels they equate to the same as if a mobile phone was stolen,\r\nThe suffering of the owner and the dog, who most often have a strong bond, being separated is horrific and needs urgent action now, before someone is killed trying to protect their dog",
