        "additional_details": "Because public perception of the lords is that the lords are untouchable to the public unlike the commons and the house is far too big . It\u2019s not for for purpose in its current model. And giving the public a vote to deselect members who fall short of what is expected of them would be a step in the right direction and as would reducing the side of the House of Lords.",
        "background": "I want a new reform in the House of Lords to ensure the public have the power to vote to remove members of the House of Lords who fall short of there duties and ensure the public have a vote to decide how many members can sit in the Lords. This will ensure The public Can have a say on the lords.",
