        "action": "Make the stamp duty holiday adjustment after 30 June 2021 less severe",
        "additional_details": "Softening the proposed stamp duty holiday adjustment is essential if sales and purchases which are 90% or more towards readiness to exchange are not derailed  bearing in mind that most lenders need a week's notice for funds drawdown. The proposed sharp change in stamp duty may mean lenders have to be told of the financial impact on borrowers and be asked to approve the situation causing further delay, and jeopardy in a much wider sense than is appreciated as mortgage offers near their expiry.",
        "background": "Specifically alter the upcoming stamp duty zero thresholds so that the current stamp duty holiday is phased out more gently to take fairer account of efforts already made by buyers and sellers as part of the buying process which is taking much longer these days than most appreciate or understand.",
