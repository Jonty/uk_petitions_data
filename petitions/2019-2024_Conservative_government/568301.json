        "additional_details": "We all agree that COVID has had a major impact on the education of our young people, and that - what ever policies are introduced to mitigate it - this will be a generational experience.\r\n\r\nHardest hit will be those most disadvantaged in educational outcomes pre-pandemic. There will also be 1000s of children impacted by grief, and where long term impacts of COVID disrupt their futures.\r\n\r\nFree Education, available to all, is one clear way to support our young people in creating a post pandemic future we all want to live for and in. So let's make it available",
        "background": "A full grant to be offered to all children currently in f/t education (from R to Y13) for one year free tuition in tertiary education - whether that be in FE, HE or Vocational courses - with no limit on when it can be used. The amount should be index linked to match inflation.",
