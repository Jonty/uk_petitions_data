        "additional_details": "Nurses and Healthcare Assistants are our very frontline medical staff.  They are underpaid for the work they do and the responsibility they carry, especially with Covid-19 and the threat to their health in caring for others.  \r\nThe NHS is top-heavy with highly-paid Directors, Managers and CCG staff, counting beans.  I know money is wasted in these areas - I have seen it when I worked for the NHS and CCG\r\nThese are the staff who are going to treat the nation and they should be rewarded accordingly.",
        "background": "Nurses & Healthcare Workers must have a pay rise which truly reflects their status in our Healthcare.  These staff need salaries which reflect their professionalism, qualifications, experience, knowledge and training in a socialist role to acknowledge their accountability and personal responsibility",
