Women and girls deserve basic human rights, for the simple reason that we are human beings, not objects, nor possessions, nor are we on this earth to serve the wants of men, nor to be anything  other than respected humans who are seen as important enough to have basic rights. Women are not yours.",

End the legalisation of the idea that women are less important than all other things, including men, non-sentient cells, and money; and that the only purpose of women is to submit to that.",
