        "additional_details": "Doctors on Tier 2 dependent visas have gone through the same screening process as a tier 2 visa holder.  Applying for a Tier 2 visa for a Doctor already holding a Tier 2 dependent visa could greatly reduce the strain on families as well as on the NHS. It could streamline the process of commencing training and encourage more Doctors towards furthering their medical careers, ultimately providing a better workforce for the NHS.",
        "background": "Doctors having to return to home country to apply for a new tier 2 visa while on tier 2 dependent visa can result in: \r\n1. Increase risk of exposure to the coronavirus during travels. \r\n2. Increased overall cost of visa application. \r\n3. Reduced number of Doctors on the frontline due to travel.",
