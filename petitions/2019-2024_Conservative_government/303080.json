Keeping non-essential places open is going to further the spread of COVID-19 and put more lives at risk unnecessarily. It is an insult to the efforts of our NHS staff who are working 24/7 and will be put through unthinkable situations in the near future. People are not taking governments advice or their own initiative, and something needs to be done to protect those that are vulnerable to COVID-19",
