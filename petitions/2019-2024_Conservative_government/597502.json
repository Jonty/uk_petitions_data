        "additional_details": "Child Maintenance payment figures should not be based on the amount a parent earns before Tax and NI.\r\n\r\nThis money is not theirs and therefore alot of parents who pay Child Maintenance are struggling to meet the demanding payments. \r\n\r\nWith the NI increase this year looming (2021) and increased cost of living this needs to be addressed!\r\n\r\nAlso the 25% decrease in a persons salary before Child Maintenance payments change also needs to be scrapped as this has been very unfair to parents during Covid.",
        "background": "Child maintenance is worked out on the paying parents wage before tax and national insurance deductions are made. \r\n\r\nThis should be changed to be worked out after tax and national insurance deductions\r\n(Other any other deductions)",
