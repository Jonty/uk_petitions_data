        "additional_details": "Periods are a natural part of a woman's life and period poverty is a very real and dangerous situation. Many women across the country cannot afford basic sanitary products and can often not use proper products, this is not only dangerous towards health it is also very dehumanising. Passing a bill such as the Period Products bill that was passed last week in Scotland, would help end period poverty and provide women with sanitary products who otherwise would not be able to afford it.",
        "background": "Last week, The Scottish government became the first in the world to make period products free for all women. I believe England should follow suit.",
