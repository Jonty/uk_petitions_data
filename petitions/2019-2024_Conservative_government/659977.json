        "additional_details": "Unlike other band 4s, eg. Assistant practitioner, therapy assistants, dental nurse, the NA are registered the same as nurse with the NMC, we deliver medication including I.V., we evaluate care plans providing patient centred care, making us accountable and responsible. We have to revalidate every 3 years same as nurse to remain competent and practice safely.\r\nThe NA role is very unsupported causing alot of negativity and confusion as to where we fit in within the NHS framework.",
        "background": "Nursing Associates is a fairly new role in the NHS, the first cohort being 2018\r\nOnce qualified the main purpose of the NA was to bridge the gap between support worker and a registered nurse.\r\nThe role is basically known as a cheap nurse, with little difference between band 4 & 5.",
