If a band is on a European tour, normally they would have used the UK as a stop-off. They're skipping the UK now because it's too complicated. it's preventing us from having these world famous acts at our festivals and from finding new incredible music. Festivals and concerts generate huge revenue for UK, which will be lost if we don't make it easy for bands to play here.",
