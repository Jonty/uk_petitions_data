I believe Driving Tests can take place safely during lockdown and can be classed as essential especially to people like me. Open windows in the car, face masks worn, sanitised surfaces before commencing the test, it can be done safely.",
        "background": "Im 18 and currently working full time in an apprenticeship during lockdown. Because I haven\u2019t taken my driving test yet I\u2019m forced to use public transport to get to work which I\u2019m getting more and more uncomfortable to use everyday. I believe tests can be completed safely providing masks are worn.",
