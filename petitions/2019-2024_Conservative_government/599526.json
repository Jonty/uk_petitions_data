        "additional_details": "To help meet government targets to curb CO2 emission by 2030, the general public has to be aware of CO2 emission contribution for as many individual products as possible. Making informed decision on either buying local or choosing less carbon intensive products over more carbon intensive products would help to shift the mind set and focus manufacturers and retailers to improve their production and distribution process. CO2 emission labelling must be mandatory similar to salt, sugar, etc labels.",
        "background": "I discovered it is very difficult to identify how eco-friendly individual products are. A clear marking of CO2 emissions during the production process helps the public make informed decisions and encourage manufacturers to improve.",
