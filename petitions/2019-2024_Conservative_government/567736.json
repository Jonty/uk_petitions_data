        "additional_details": "If this is not extended there will be many people who have not budgeted for the additional stamp duty, if their purchase is completed after the 31st March 2021. At least there should be a cut off time for sales that are started before the 31st March 2021 to be honoured with the stamp duty freeze.",
        "background": "Due to the current lockdown in the UK and the amount of current sales in the pipeline we have to extended the stamp duty freeze beyond the 31st March 2021. Every institution involved within the housing market is currently under great pressure to get this extended.",
