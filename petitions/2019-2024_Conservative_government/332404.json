        "additional_details": "E1)You live in a small village that has no need for a secondary faith school, yet one gets built, currently your child has to pay for transport to their preferred school.\r\nAs well as the need to not discriminate we need to provide greater choice of opportunities and benefits for those in education.\r\nE2)There are two grammar schools within 10 miles from your house but one is slightly closer this again removes choice if the parents are not to be financially impacted.",
        "background": "Transport fees currently amount to approximately \u00a3900-1200+ per child per annum.\r\nIf you can afford to pay up front, you pay less, which affects those with lower incomes.\r\nFree transport for all school children within a radius that allows more than one choice of school should be free.",
