Many pupils do not necessarily get the same results in their final exam that is shown through their work throughout the year. Many students also don\u2019t see prelims as very important as they are not the real exam so they don\u2019t achieve their best in it. Many have had difficult circumstances and issues that may have caused them to not produce their best work throughout the year, but exam allows them to  make a comeback almost.",

There will be plenty rooms to do this as schools are closed anyway. Suggestion that parents and other young adults could volunteer to be invigilators as older people won\u2019t be able to.",
