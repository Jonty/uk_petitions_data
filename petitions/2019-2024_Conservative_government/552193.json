        "additional_details": "The government thought it was necessary to shield the most vulnerable from COVID-19 during the first lockdown, yet even though cases are now similar the last few days to then, you aren't going to protect them and expect them to go to work and risk their lives. This shouldn't be the case and shielding should be reinstated.",
        "background": "The level of coronavirus cases is now increasing and back at levels not seen since April, yet the most vulnerable are still required to go to work and are not being protected. The government should bring back shielding immediately until the cases reach a minimal level once again.",
