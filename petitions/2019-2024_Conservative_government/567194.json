        "additional_details": "Making us go into our college during a national lockdown and expecting us to be able to complete an exam to the best of our ability is unfair and a lot of other students I have spoken to feel the same. It is unfair  being in a lockdown and being told \u2018do not go out\u2019 yet then being told to sit in a classroom with many other students from many other areas everyone feels uneasy. The Summer exams should also have alternatives in place such as doing it from home to allow us a sense of security.",
        "background": "Allow college students to have alternatives put in place, making us go into college during a lockdown and expecting us to complete an exam is unfair, shown in A-level years. For example giving predicated results for our anatomy exam, and allow us to sit our cache exam from home with cameras on.",
