        "additional_details": "Not all parents play fair.\r\n\r\nThe current system encourages financial gain & court advantage for the parent who can stop access to the children for the non resident parent.\r\n\r\nThose that have found themselves no longer in the family home have to try to get rehoused while at the same time paying horrendous fees for solicitor and court costs. They are placed at a huge disadvantage in trying to provide a new home compatible with shared contact.\r\n\r\nThis is detrimental to the welfare of children.",
        "background": "Government needs to redesign how child maintenance is calculated in order to stop the disadvantage to non resident parents fighting to have a relationship with their child(ren). The maintenance structure should only be authorised by family courts when court proceedings are ongoing.",
