However, it is already the case that schools and local authorities are required to treat all medical absences as authorised (including those relating to mental health) unless they have a legitimate reason for doubting the truthfulness of the student's claim. We're therefore not sure what it is you want the Government to do differently.\r\n\r\nYou could contact a local councillor who represents you if you have a specific concern about how a particular school or your local authority treats such absences.
