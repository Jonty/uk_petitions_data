        "additional_details": "I want this to be taken into consideration because  the average periods lasting from five days to over a week, it can cost up to \u00a38 a month for tampons and pads, and some women struggle to afford the cost.  This is supported by the Children\u2019s charity Plan International who found that 10% of girls in Britain have been unable to afford sanitary products.\r\n\r\nWith Scotland being the FIRST ever country to make sanitary products free what is stopping us?",
