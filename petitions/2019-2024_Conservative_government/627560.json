In the usa it's set at nearly \u00a3600 before charges as a gift, so can spend a good amount on my aunty in usa, why are we being ripped off in the uk? \r\nI was told once customs apply because in usa items are cheaper, this is no longer the case. eg Shop Disney sell same items as ours prices converted are equal to ours!
