        "additional_details": "94% of IGCSE examinations are taken in independent schools and it's easy to overlook the impact that this will have on the 7.8% of students who attend independent schools. Whilst Independent school students have widely received a larger amount of support from teachers than most State school students have, we are nowhere near in a position to take our examinations this summer and should withdraw along with state schools and be assessed by teacher predictions which would accurately reflect our efforts over the year.",
        "background": "After GCSEs and A-levels were cancelled, we assumed that IGCSE\u2019s would be too as there was no mention of them. The decision for them to continue is completely unfair as there was no mention that IGCSE exams were considered separately and we have missed too much content to be prepared for the exams.",
