Now, we the people are expected to pay higher taxes for a social care scheme that costs 1/3 of the price of a test & trace app, and a 10th of the price of High Speed 2.\r\n\r\nWe need to also end tax havens that people use to not pay UK Tax",

You also needed to be clearer with changes you wanted the Government to make to existing tax rules to end tax havens.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nFor example, you could have a petition like: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/332689"
