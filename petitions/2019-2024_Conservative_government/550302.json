Further, the Fawcett Society reported that gender was the most common cause of hate crime for women; 85% of gender hate crimes in England and Wales were, in fact, reported by women. Women should not have to go through the galling experience of being harassed every time they leave the house!",

These should be punishable by an on-the-spot fine of up to \u00a3750. Street harassment has successfully been criminalised in France, Portugal, Belgium, and the Netherlands",
