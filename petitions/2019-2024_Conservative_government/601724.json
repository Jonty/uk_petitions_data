        "additional_details": "A developer's appeal to build houses in a green field enclave within an AONB was upheld by the Planning Inspectorate, with scant regard to the town's NDP and despite the fact that: quotas for new homes had already been exceeded; the land in question is prone to flooding, and that road access to the site is inherently unsafe.  Another planned development of tightly-packed urban-style housing within an AONB failed to take into account the existing landscape, with dispersed forest smallholdings.",
