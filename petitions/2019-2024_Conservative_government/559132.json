        "action": "Allow vulnerable/elderly non-Covid hospital patients to receive a daily visitor",
        "additional_details": "During the last and the current lockdown, all hospital visitors have been banned. This is very damaging for vulnerable/elderly long-term patients who may be confused or depressed and need daily visits from a loved one to aid recovery. Cheerful, motivated patients get well more quickly than depressed, anxious or disoriented patients, which is better for everyone and saves the NHS money. Additional measures for COVID-security for visitors could be introduced during lockdowns.",
        "background": "During lockdowns, allow a designated family member to visit vulnerable/elderly hospital patients with mental health needs. This rule worked well since the last lockdown ended, and could be supplemented with visitor COVID testing and increased visitor PPE during lockdown without ending all visits.",
