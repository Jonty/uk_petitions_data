        "additional_details": "Due to an increase of deaths and cases of coronavirus within the country. I would like the government and parliament to put more into place. Whether this is to shut all social aspects of day to day routine e.g pubs, restaurants and schools. Reason being, as proven on statistics children are more likely to contract the virus without symptoms and pass this on to another member of the community or family. I feel as if this is the best option to help reduce cases and protect the population.",
