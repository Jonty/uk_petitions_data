Many employers hold unfair exclusivity clauses banning license holders from working elsewhere.",

Decisions about pay for privately employed workers are a matter for individual employers, not the Government or House of Commons,\r\n\r\nIf you want new PPE or training requirements for licensed security businesses we may be able to accept a petition calling for this."
