        "additional_details": "Wearing a face mask in the long run will help protect spreading the disease. Majority of key workers I have seen pictured in the press or at my local supermarket are not wearing masks. Every time I see this I'm extremely concerned, because they are more at risk at catching the virus, I really think the government should act fast and make wearing masks compulsory for all key workers. They are the nations hero's right now, and by not wearing a mask they are putting their lives at risk. \r\nThank you",
        "background": "I would URGENTLY appreciate it,         if this petition could be fast tracked for a debate in Parliament ASAP. \r\nThe government desperately need to supply all key workers with masks, and make it compulsory they wear them whilst working. This will help to protect them, and help prevent more deaths.",
