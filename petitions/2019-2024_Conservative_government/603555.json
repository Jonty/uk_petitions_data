        "action": "Ban the practice of Ability Grouping in English Schools.",
        "additional_details": "There is overwhelming research evidence that the practice of Ability Grouping has a negative impact on children in the 'lower ability groups', yet only offers negligible benefit to children in the 'high ability groups'. Its practice has a damaging impact on the emotional, social and educational development of children. Children who start off in 'low ability groups' most likely remain there all their educational lives. Certain ethnicities are disproportionately represented in lower groups.",
        "background": "I want the government to safeguard the wellbeing and education of children by banning the practice of Ability Grouping in Schools. The issue must be debated in parliament, experts invited to shed light on it, and government to follow up by taking action to ban it.",
