        "additional_details": "With schools closed, thousands of hungry children across Britain who usually get free school meals need other food to see them through the week. The government is paying private caterers Chartwells to provide this, but now it has come to light that their 'meal boxes' are painfully inadequate. The government should provide the \u00a330 in vouchers to the parents so they can use them at the local supermarkets to buy sufficient food for their children.",
        "background": "Instead of the \u00a330 voucher many parents were receiving before, they are now being sent boxes that barely contain \u00a35 worth of food. This is nowhere near enough food to last for the school week. The contract should be taken away from these private firms and parents should be given the \u00a330 instead.",
