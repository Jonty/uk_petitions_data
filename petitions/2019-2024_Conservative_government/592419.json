But if you have a category c1 or c why should we be penalised and still not be able to tow when you have proved with another test to be a professional driver. But previous pre 1997 people who haven\u2019t even driven a 7.5ton can and can also tow on a van or a car Liscence. I personally think it needs a review and updating.",
