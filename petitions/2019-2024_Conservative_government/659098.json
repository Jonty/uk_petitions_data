        "additional_details": "As long as water companies keep profiting from discharging raw sewage into our rivers, lakes, and seas, they will keep doing it.\r\n\r\nAnd the longer they do it, the greater the harm to the planet, wildlife, and us.\r\n\r\nIn fact, 75% of UK rivers now pose a risk to human health.\r\n\r\nIn an election year when MPs need us \u2013 let\u2019s demand something in return. Let\u2019s demand they stop raw sewage dumps for good.",
        "background": "This petition calls for the government to put concrete targets in place to eradicate all raw sewage dumps in UK water. \r\nAt least 11 billion litres of raw sewage is dumped a year in the UK. That\u2019s equivalent to 4,352 Olympic pools.\r\nMultiple parliamentary votes thus far have allowed it to continue.",
