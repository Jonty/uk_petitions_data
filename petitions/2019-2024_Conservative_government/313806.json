        "additional_details": "It is becoming common place for employees to be dismissed from their employment because they are lawfully expressing views that their employee disapproves of or that their employer fears the wider public may disapprove of.\r\n\r\nThis can stifle free speech, as employees may feel inhibited from expressing their opinions and from sharing information and ideas. \r\n\r\nThe protection for the free speech of employees currently offered by the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Equality Act 2010, is inadequate.  The former requires two years\u2019 service and the latter does not protect specific opinions.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to pass legislation preventing employers from dismissing employees, for any lawful communications made outside of their employment, which have no direct bearing on their employment.",
