        "action": "Make cyclists wear/display on their bicycle, identification(e.g. a number plate)",
        "additional_details": "For this reason cyclists must wear some variety of identification similar to a number plate on a car to stop them getting away from crimes they commit, a crime that a car driver would be severely punished for, but as cyclists are so similarly dressed frequently on black bikes in luminos clothing they are impossible to distinguish from one another. Many cyclists cause accidents and get away penalty free or play victim as they are smaller & slow, and as a car driver I feel this must come to an end",
        "background": "With the ongoing push for drivers to be safe with cyclists I feel cyclists must also be delt with, often cyclists run red lights, cut up drivers, nearly hit pedestrians mounting the pavement and mount pavement at red lights to avoid stopping at said lights, but cyclists are similar & unidentifiable",
