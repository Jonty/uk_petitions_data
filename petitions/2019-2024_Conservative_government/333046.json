        "action": "Prevent mandatory calorie labelling of menus",
        "additional_details": "Calorie counting often leads to an unhealthy obsession with numbers when eating, instead of focusing on what is healthy and enjoyable. It is estimated over 1.6 million and up to 7% of the UK population could suffer from an eating disorder and calorie counting doesn't address the root cause of the disorder. It has also been found that calorie counting apps exacerbate eating disorders, the same could be expected from calorie counted menus.",
        "background": "Do not make including calories on menus mandatory, it is hugely dangerous for those with eating disorders - the most fatal mental illness. All restaurants should be able to have these available but including them in the majority of restaurants is against guidance from eating disorder specialists.",
