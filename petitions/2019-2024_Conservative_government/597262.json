        "additional_details": "We either would like the Government to put Bangladesh on the amber list allowing us to travel and to quarantine in our respective homes or to make the hotel prices more reasonable and competitive around \u00a329-\u00a335 per night. \r\n\r\nIt is unfair that Bangladesh is still on the red list however the cases are 1862 as of 16.09.21 but it\u2019s neighbour India is on amber list with cases of 30,570 as of 15.09.21. Please understand we have loved ones to see, dead ones to go mourn and family weddings to attend.",
        "background": "Take Bangladesh off the red list. Many of us have loved ones who are in Bangladesh and since COVID began we have been unable to see them. They cannot come to the UK as hotel costs on arrival are too high and we cannot go there as we would also have to pay these excessive hotel costs on our return.",
