        "additional_details": "In future years, people who sat their exams in 2021 will obviously have worse results than those who didn\u2019t sit them due to the 6/7 months missed because of Covid. This gives an unfair advantage to the rest of the countries in the UK rather than making the people in England equal to the rest and giving them equal opportunities. If these countries are supposed to be \u2018United\u2019 then everyone should be equal. So cancel exams for 2021 and use CAGs.",
        "background": "The rest of the countries in the \u2018United\u2019 Kingdom have decided to cancel exams whereas England refuse to. Why? Other people will be competing for the same roles as those who had to sit exams and got worse results than those who used CAGs. Cancel exams in England and use CAGs for the Y11 and Y13s.",
