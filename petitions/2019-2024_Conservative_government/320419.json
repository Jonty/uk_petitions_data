        "additional_details": "Now more than ever, we need direct access to the religious services such as Mass, Sacraments, and other forms of public prayer. First and foremost, churches have a duty of care for the spiritual wellbeing of their people. Therefore churches should be allowed to reopen so that priests and pastors can minister to their congregations. This can be handled safely according to the capabilities of each church in line with government guidance.",
        "background": "We are writing to ask that all churches and places of worship are allowed to open immediately. It is essential for people of religious belief to access the places of worship and their priests. Indeed churches should not have been closed in the first place.",
