        "additional_details": "Asthmatics are clearly vulnerable to serious health risks compared to healthy adults, which is why we\u2019re offered the flu jab each year. The majority of us who have non-severe asthma take long term, steroid based medication to manage our condition. Catching Covid could make us very ill compared to non-asthmatics. We need to be prioritised alongside steroid tablet users.",

We are clinically vulnerable and have chronic lung conditions and we are at risk so should be prioritised over healthy adults.",
