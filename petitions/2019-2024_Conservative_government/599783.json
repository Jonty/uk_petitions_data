        "additional_details": "Last year, my MP blocked me on Twitter after I made factual and polite comments about her voting choice on the Free School Meals issue.    I now no longer have visibility of my elected representative's views on matters affecting me and the community in which I live, and cannot engage in debate on these issues on this key forum.  Twitter is a widely used channel from which many get information on important issues and if our MPs choose to use it, their message should be available to all.",
        "background": "If MPs have a presence on Twitter, which they use to present their views as an MP or of the party they represent, then they should not be able to block users from viewing their tweets, unless of course those users violate the rules of the Twitter platform with offensive or threatening tweets.",
