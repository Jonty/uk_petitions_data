        "action": "Revoke the Higher Education Reform consultation",
        "additional_details": "The Higher Education reform that's under consultation is looking to put in Minimum Eligibility Requirements (MERs) for student finance. Students who fail maths/english GCSE or who get 2 E grades or lower at A level won't be able to access student finance. This discriminates against prospective students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds where schooling isn't as good - people from these backgrounds already find it harder to get into uni and this policy will make it impossible.",
        "background": "I want this revoked because it discriminates against people from disadvantaged backgrounds, people with dyslexia/dyscalculia and people where English isn't their first language. By stopping people from accessing student finance if they get low grades at GCSE/A level it will stop people going to uni.",
