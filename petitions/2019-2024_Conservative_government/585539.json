        "background": "Stop penalising pupils and students in exams for making spelling mistakes. \r\nBeing able to spell a word isn't a measure of understanding its meaning or knowing how to use it in context. \r\nBeing able to spell does not reflect either ability or knowledge, it is simply a matter of luck.",
