        "additional_details": "Black history should be taught as part of the national curriculum. It\u2019s imperative, if we\u2019re ever to see sustained change, to educate young people about race, racism, the history of racism, the slave trade, white privilege and what this history means for society today.\r\n\r\nThis affects us all. It affects all of our futures. It is imperative in overcoming inequity, inequality, and injustice to make Black History a compulsory component of the National Curriculum.",
        "background": "Racism is inherent and structural. It is built into society. One of the biggest forces we have for change, over the long term, is education.\r\n\r\nYoung people in schools shouldn\u2019t just be taught about tolerance and respect for all. \r\n\r\nThey need to understand the history; Black history.",
