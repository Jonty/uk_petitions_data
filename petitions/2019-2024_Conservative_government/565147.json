        "additional_details": "Nigel Farage was the driving force behind a long campaign to free the United Kingdom from an international organisation about which many people in the United Kingdom were sceptical. It was a project designed to create a United States of Europe which was to be done by stealth. Nigel Farage saw at first hand the workings of the European Union and knew that it was not compatible with the views of the majority of the British people.",
        "background": "Her Majesty's Government should recognise the achievement of Mr Nigel Farage in keeping the question of the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union in the fore-front of our political affairs. His tireless leadership and campaigning deserves the award of an honour.",
