MPs are also expected to go into these environments to ensure residents are safe and correctly looked after. Therefore, all MPs should be following the very rules they voted by majority for.",

Therefore for them to enter care homes they will need to be fully vaccinated in the same way any other person working in that environment has been mandated",
