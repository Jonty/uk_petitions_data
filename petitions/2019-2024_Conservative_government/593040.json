        "additional_details": "As government has enforced, UK retunurnees coming back from a Red List country have to abide by a 10 day quarantine period in a managed quarantine hotel. It makes sense for anyone with symptoms or proven diagnosis of covid 19 to comply. However, before being the subject of this law, it is logical for a person to undergo a test prior to being placed into quarantine. Why should anyone have to pay for a quarantine that may not need. If their test is negative, they shouldn't have to quarantine, but rather quarantine at home as a precaution.",
