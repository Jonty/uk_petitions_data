        "action": "To keep the Equality Act the same and protect transgender rights.",
        "additional_details": "By removing this act, transgender people would not legally be the gender they identify as. For example, transgender women would have no legal access to women-only facilities. This may not seem like such a big difference however this is setting us back so many years and is degrading to all transgender people. We need the government to stop Rishi Sunak from amending the Equality Act and removing transgender rights.",
        "background": "Rishi Sunak is trying to amend the Equality Act so that transgender people are no longer protected. Currently the Equality Act protects people from discrimination and means trans people can access single-sex spaces such as shelters, bathrooms and hospital wards.",
