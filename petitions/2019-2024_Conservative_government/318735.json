        "additional_details": "When lockdown went into place many businesses went into panic due to cash flow issues, many staff were made redundant with no option of furlough (mainly due to a delay of the furlough scheme via HMRC) Those affected should be treated equally to those lucky enough to have been furloughed and granted government support of 80%. Many hardworking people have been left with UC which doesn't even cover rent payments. Make this FAIR FOR ALL not just the select employees lucky to have been handpicked.",
        "background": "Make furlough compulsory OR allow employees who were made redundant due to COVID 19 access to a scheme which entitles them to 80% of their salary. Do not leave this \"scheme\" in the hands of employers as this is an unfair system. Make the scheme accessible to all eligible hardworking taxpayers.",
