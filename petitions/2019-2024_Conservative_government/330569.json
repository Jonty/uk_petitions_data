Over 24 million people, 80% of the country\u2019s population, need urgent humanitarian aid and protection, including food, drinking water and healthcare. I feel as a country benefiting from being a developed nation, we have a social responsibility and moral obligation to care for the less fortunate internationally.",
        "background": "Through setting up a scheme unifying organisations such as UNICEF and the NHS we can reallocate the wasted medical supplies to provide relief. If a system is put in place to ensure the prescriptions have not been contaminated then the supplies can be used to assist with humanitarian crises.",
