        "additional_details": "We would like the government to mandate every trust around UK to provide free parking to their trust colleagues, so that they dont have to pay such a huge amount every year after taxes just for commuting to work. Lot of trusts give these benefits to their employee hence it is something which is possible to do and not something which would effect their budgets.",
        "background": "With cost of living and fuel prices going up, it is really difficult and a major expense to pay for parking. Parking tickets costs anywhere between 35-40 pound per month and places like Q park charge 75-80 pounds for the first month.",
