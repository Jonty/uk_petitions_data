        "additional_details": "It\u2019s unfair to expect students to do standardised exams, when we have all been taught different content and with a different quality of remote learning. Considering everything else that has happened during our exam years, the only true reflection of what we could have achieved would come from our teachers, who know us and have been working with us for the last two years. No standard paper will be able to account for the circumstances we have all been though. Please use teacher assessed grades.",
        "background": "This year\u2019s GCSE and A-Level year groups were finally promised Teacher Assesed Grades after months of uncertainty and mixed messages about our exams. Now it\u2019s been suggested that we might have mini-assessments, which are basically just exams with a new name, making things uncertain again.",
