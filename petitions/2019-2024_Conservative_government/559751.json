        "additional_details": "The main stress of November is not knowing when and how long fireworks will be going off. We can endure hours, days, weeks of random fireworks! Just when you think they've finished for the night - BOOM! We all know the stress this causes animals and people. I'm not asking for a ban, I'm asking for set times and dates so people KNOW when they'll be going off. Money is still made from firework sales and animals have less stress time to panic as too do us humans. A truly great compromise.",
        "background": "Fireworks let off (pro and at home) between 7pm and 8pm on Nov 5th and nearest Sat to Nov 5th (8th if 5th falls on a Wed) between 7pm and 8pm. Everyone still get their fireworks, money still made and 2 hours of dealing with noise/stress/worry instead of potentially 20+ random hours over weeks.",
