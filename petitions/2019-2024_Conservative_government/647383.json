        "additional_details": "In a country that prides itself on prioritizing public health, it is disconcerting to witness schools inadvertently contributing to potential health problems among our young learners. Regrettably, in some educational institutions, toilets are physically locked or access is severely regulated. Restricting toilet access disrupts focus. Biological needs unmet lead to distraction, hindering learning. It's essential for sustained concentration and academic progress. \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.",
        "background": "In the United Kingdom, the issue of restricting students' access to toilets during school hours has come to the forefront. Denying individuals the right to attend to their bodily needs is tantamount to turning a fundamental right into an unwarranted privilege. This also poses a health risk.",
