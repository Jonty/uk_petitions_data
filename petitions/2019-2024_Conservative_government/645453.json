        "additional_details": "The government has destroyed the value of the Pound. According to the Bank of England, 66.7% of all British pounds in circulation were printed in the last 10 years. The resulting inflation is destroying the value of our salaries, our savings, and our investments. Inflation pushes people into higher tax brackets, and more people are turning to crime and the black market for income. Many high earners and innovators are even leaving the UK, taking tax money and jobs with them. Up the allowance now.",
