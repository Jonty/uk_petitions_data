        "additional_details": "The sale of loud fireworks within the supermarkets have resulted in a lot of animals leaving homes, dying of shock or being in so much discomfort they needed medical attention from the vet. I personally have lost a few pets during the whole month of November. \r\n\r\nAlso some people including those who are autistic or a war veteran can't cope with the loud sounds of fireworks and can result in them being in high levels of distress and make their mental and physical health drop drastically.",
        "background": "The sale of fireworks should only be 0 or very little sound or all together banned completely!",
