        "additional_details": "Forecourt fuel prices have always been a source contention, however, given the recent unprecedented highs that the country and world has seen, more must be done in order to curb excessive prices. A method I believe would aid reductions in market price of crude oil reaching the consumer quicker would be a national platform that would allow customers to easily shop around for the best deal and thus helping drive competition. Given the recent cost of living crisis and high inflation rates this is a simple remedy for a long standing issue of fuel court customers not receiving a fair deal.",
        "background": "Creation of an easily accessible website and/or smartphone app which will host LIVE prices for fuel across the country that retailers MUST update. This will allow customers to shop around for the best deal and improve price reduction through competition.",
