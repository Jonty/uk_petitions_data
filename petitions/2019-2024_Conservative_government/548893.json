        "additional_details": "In addition of the campaign \"Tackling obesity: empowering adults and children to live healthier lives\", a \"work out to help out\" scheme would have a huge impact on local communities helping people to get active to improve health and mental wellbeing. For sport facilities and clubs it will allow a smoother resuming of activities going out of the Covid-19 pandemic.\r\nImportance of physical activity on getting a balanced lifestyle is too often neglected, there should be a national policy for it.",
        "background": "The same than the government implemented in August 2020 the scheme \"Eat out to help out\" to support pubs & restaurants, it would be an amazing opportunity to do the same with the sport & leisure industry that suffered a lot from the lockdown.",
