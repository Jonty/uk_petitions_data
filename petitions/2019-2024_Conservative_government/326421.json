The Government shouldnt be ordering the removal of ANY statue and should not be allowing people to remove a statue 'because they dont agree with it' after all this is criminal damage and a destruction of property. This has all gone too far and the government needs to step in and protect our statues, our history and our heritage. Stop people removing amd vandalising statues and hold the individuals responsible for damage accountable.",

They should not be removed or damaged. After all damage to them amounts to criminal damage and a destruction of property. The government should protect them!",
