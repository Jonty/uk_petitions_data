Many students are also in a situation where their student finance only covers rent, parental support May also be hindered due to the nature of the economic situation, students are still being asked to pay rent with many private landlords still expecting rent payments. \r\n\r\nThe current year assessment option offered by SFE is not fit for purpose.",
