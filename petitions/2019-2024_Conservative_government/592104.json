        "additional_details": "There is much concern that the teaching of Britain's history is one-sided, with too much emphasis placed on Britain's role in the slave trade which omits the positive contributions the empire made to the world. It is essential that an unbiased account is taught to children and teenagers so they can form a rational and reasonable conclusion that is not influenced by individual tutors in the education system. We ask UK government to ensure that a fair and unbiased account is taught in schools.",
        "background": "We request that the government includes positive elements of the British Empire in the education system, notably:\r\n1) How Britain spent 150 years of its existence wiping out the slave trade\r\n2) Its role in defeating Nazi Germany in WWII\r\n3) The spread of democracy, education, and other benefits.",

In history at Key Stage 3, under the theme 'ideas, political power, industry and empire: Britain, 1745-1901', students are required to learn about 'the development of the British Empire with a depth study (for example, of India)'. How that is taught is left up to individual schools and teachers. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more about this here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/239075/SECONDARY_national_curriculum_-_History.pdf\r\n\r\nMore broadly, all schools are required to teach 'a broad and balanced curriculum in all subjects': https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1003469/Teaching_a_broad_and_balanced_curriculum_for_education_recovery.pdf"
