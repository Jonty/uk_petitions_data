        "additional_details": "The main issue with a Thursday vote is people don't get time off work to vote. We have seen in the past that some polling stations become crowded before the 10PM cutoff as they couldn't vote earlier in the day. New Zealand and Australia vote on Saturday and this hasn't affected their democracy. In fact, they both have a signifcanlty higher voter turnout than the UK. New Zealand's election in October 2020 had a 82.50% turnout compared to the British Election in 2019 having a turnout of 67.3% .",
        "background": "The Government should make elections more accessible by moving voting to weekends. This will allow more people more time to participate in elections, increasing voter turnout and the quality of our democracy.",
