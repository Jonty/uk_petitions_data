        "additional_details": "Loud fireworks cause a lot of distress - they terrify pets; can be difficult for people on the autistic spectrum; and disrupt sleep.  Yet they traditionally mark celebrations and bring joy too. However, we have slipped into a situation where we effectively have an Oct to Jan 'firework season': in the last 3 weeks, there have been fireworks every night.  \r\n\r\nWe need to find a balance between celebration and distress.  \r\n\r\nRegulating dates/times and promoting silent fireworks is a good compromise.",
        "background": "There are many petitions asking for a complete ban on fireworks.  A better approach is for them to be regulated - many countries do this very successfully.  They could be allowed on days such as 5th November, Diwali, New Years' Eve, between certain times.  Silent fireworks could be exempt.",
