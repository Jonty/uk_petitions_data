        "additional_details": "Free sanitary products should be a human right. None of us chose to have a period each month and are unable to control our bodies to prevent them from occurring. Therefore, it is disgusting that women are expected to pay an average of \u00a310.24 per month on menstrual products which results in \u00a34,910 in their reproductive lifetime. Some women even use a single tampon or pad for too long because they do not have extra or cannot afford them, this leads to them experiencing medical difficulties, such as Toxic Shock Syndrome which can often be life threatening.",
        "background": "The Government must take women's health into consideration and come up with a system surrounding periods and how free sanitary products can be available for ALL women across the country.",
