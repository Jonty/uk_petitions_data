OFCOM, the UK's communications regulator, is responsible for enforcing the Broadcasting Code.\r\n\r\nThere are also regulators for print media, although these are not government regulators, and their codes do not require members to report the news with impartiality. We could accept a petition calling on the Government to introduce statutory requirements for all news to be reported impartially, if that's what you want to happen."
