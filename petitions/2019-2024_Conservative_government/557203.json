You can play with someone from your household. You are in fresh air and do not need to mix with other people. It is ludicrous that you can go and sit on a park bench, which someone else will sit on after you and potentially spread the virus, but you can\u2019t walk round a golf course on your own or with someone from your house. Please change this",
