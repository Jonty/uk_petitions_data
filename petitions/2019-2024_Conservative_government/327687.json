        "action": "Make it compulsory for High Schools to educate pupils on racism within society.",
        "additional_details": "Recent events here in the uk and globally have highlighted an unfortunate lack of understanding and education on the subject of racism. My belief is, if we want  our children to grow up in a society free from racism and racist attitudes, we must begin to teach our younger generation the history of racism so they can have a better understanding of it. It is essential that schools acknowledge the existence of racism in society and that young people are affected by it. It is the responsibility of schools to oppose all forms of racism.",
        "background": "I would like our Government & Parliament to make it compulsory for all high schools in the UK to educate children on the issues of racism within our society. Pupils would attend lessons which openly discuss the history of racism, anti-racism and the role it plays in society today.",
