After each England loss, cases of domestic abuse rise by around 35% to 40%. As providers of media in which these cases can be attributed to, TV channels should be held accountable to some extent in ensuring the safety of viewers and those close to the viewer, in order to help reduce the strain on police and fire services, and to protect the public.",
