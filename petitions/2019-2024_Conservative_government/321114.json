Many people have expressed their fears and concerns on sending children back to school on the BBC News. It is completely unacceptable behaviour to send children back to school when they\u2019re at risk of catching the Coronavirus. Primary schools should remain closed until this pandemic is under control.",

Children are incapable of abiding by social distancing rules. This could put children, families and workers at risk.",
