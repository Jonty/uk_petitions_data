        "action": "Close the UK borders urgently to limit the spread of Covid-19",
        "additional_details": "New Zealand have used a strict approach to travel bans and are now enjoying a normal way of life. The UK Government has failed to impose any such restrictions, and limitations that have been brought in have failed to control the virus effectively. We are now the only Country with the new variant spreading rapidly. Strict measures need to be put into place to stop the virus from entering the Country and spreading. No-one should be allowed in or out of the UK unless it's an emergency.",
        "background": "UK borders have remained open during lockdown, even at peak infection rates. We want the Government to close borders urgently to cease all travel in and out of the UK for at least the duration of the current lockdown for 2021. This should then be reviewed depending on infection rates.",
