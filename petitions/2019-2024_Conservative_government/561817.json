        "action": "Make reselling of electrical goods illegal above RRP for 1 year from release.",
        "additional_details": "Scalping is a deliberate selfish act and people doing it often use bots to purchase bulk quantities of in demand items. Normal consumers miss out on releases have to pay x2-x3 the price on ebay or other such sites or wait several months for supply to finally outstrip the initial demand. The only people profiting are the scalpers and websites. The practice is anti-consumer, corrupt and amoral. Banning reselling of items for a year from release will help stop this.",
        "background": "Make it illegal for people to purchase new goods and then resell for ridiculous mark up prices. A practice known as scalping. It is already illegal to do this with concert tickets but this should extend to high value and in demand electrical goods like video game consoles. Ban reselling for 1 year.",
