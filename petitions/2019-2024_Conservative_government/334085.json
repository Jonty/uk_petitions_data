        "additional_details": "The overall system that is being used to calculate GCSE grades for all candidates is deeply unfair and may negatively affect all students, and specifically those from a lower-class background. It is very well known that various teacher-predicted grades will be dropped due to \u2018generosity\u2019, thus potentially causing thousands of students-particularly those that come from lower-income backgrounds and those that go to lower-performing schools (including me) will be penalised for very little reason.",
        "background": "Since 2020 GCSE grades will be incredibly inconsistent and may have a high proportion of grades lowered, i believe the government should advise universities/employers to not weigh 2020 GCSE grades at all when considering applications, as \u2018our\u2019 results will not be indicative of our abilities.",
