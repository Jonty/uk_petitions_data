Last year, the CQC found that the DNRs had caused avoidable deaths but the practice is still ongoing. This is a form of eugenics and is not acceptable. The government needs to do all in their power to prevent this practice.\r\n\r\nRead more here:\r\nhttps://bit.ly/3tYL34u\r\nhttps://bit.ly/2NxhW7r",

In some cases, these DNRs are issued without the patient or their carers even knowing.",
