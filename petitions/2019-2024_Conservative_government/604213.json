        "additional_details": "Because only the government and parliament can make this happen.  The general public are somewhat divided.  Stop people mingling if they haven't had their jabs but don't make the rest of us suffer.  We as humans are social creatures by nature and need the social interaction that locking us down would prevent.  Please consider my proposition here and end lockdowns for good.",
        "background": "If we keep getting locked down the country will fall into ruin beyond any repair.  Mental health issues have raised to an all time high, people have lost their businesses for good, people have ended up out of work because of lockdowns they don't help at all.",
