However the problem is nationwide and should be dealt with by the Government. These travellers move onto a piece of land and the owner or council has to go to the courts to get eviction orders. Then once the travellers have left the owner or council has to pay the cost of removing rubbish, including the human waste that has been dumped. Yet there is no penalty to these tresspassers.",
