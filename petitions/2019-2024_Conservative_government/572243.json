        "action": "University international students should get a 50% tuition fee refund.",
        "additional_details": "The government is committed to a sustainable funding model that supports high-quality provision, meets the skills needs of the country and maintains the world-class reputation of UK HE. We can see it is not the case. Notwithstanding universities ensure that courses are high-quality with blended-learning, it is unlawful for students to attend face to face classes during the lockdown. As the UK is the most affected country at this moment, it is impossible to forecast a promising relaxation of lockdown and the quality of teaching significantly deteriorates. Such inflexible tuition fee adjustment weakens international students' confidence in the UK education system due to the indifferent attitude of the UK government, which critically damages the reputation of the UK educational system.",
        "background": "We demand the government should request university to refund at least 50% of the school fees to international students, which is a compulsory and immediate action.",
