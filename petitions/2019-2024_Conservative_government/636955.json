The payment periods at present are arbitrarily and punitively short. \r\n\r\nIssuing a fine of up to \u00a3100 for forgetting to pay \u00a35, or \u00a32.50 within 24 or 48 hours should be illegal and there should be consumer protections in place to prevent such practice.",
        "background": "Change law to provide protection to consumers against arbitrary fines. Change to law to require 7 days for payment until fine is issued for airport drop off charges, ulez, congestion charge, dartford crossing and other driving charges.",
