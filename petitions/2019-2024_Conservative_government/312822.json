        "additional_details": "Public enforcements are in place to encourage people to stay indoors, limit interactions and only leave the house for necessities, 1 form of exercise and work - only if unable to do so from home.  However, Airlines are still operating from London Heathrow Airport daily.\r\n\r\nLHR needs to enforce screening of passengers embarking and disembarking flights to and from the UK, in aid to help prevent further spread of the virus. \r\n\r\nPlease join me in signing this petition to further protect us from Covid-19.",
        "background": "London Heathrow is one of the UK airports to remain open amidst Covid-19. \r\n\r\nIn attempt to get stranded Brits home, London Heathrow has now become a hub for transmission of Covid-19 - with lack of safeguarding for workers, other passengers and the general public.",
