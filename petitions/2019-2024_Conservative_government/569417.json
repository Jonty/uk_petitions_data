        "additional_details": "The Government chose to try to live with the virus, which has resulted in long restrictions on freedom, and one of the worst mortality rates and economic performances in the world. Countries that chose to eliminate the virus have greater freedom, fared better economically and suffered less loss of life.\r\n\r\nThe emergence of new variants risks jeopardising vaccines. Adopting a Zero Covid strategy increases the chances of vaccines succeeding, and is the quickest way of getting life back to normal.",
        "background": "Social freedom, economic prosperity and public health are better served by Zero Covid. Countries like New Zealand, Australia, and Taiwan implemented Zero Covid strategies to eliminate Covid-19. The Government should learn from them and implement effective measures to get life back to normal.",
