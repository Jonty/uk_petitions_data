This being closed will mean longer more congested routes, adding time onto an emergency call out. \r\n\r\nAnstey Lane/Blackbird Rd are often congested main routes. Blackbird Rd provides an alternative route onto Groby Rd which reduces pressure on Anstey Lane/Blackbird Rd. The closure will cause additional traffic in these congested areas. \r\n\r\nParking for the primary school will impact on Anstey Lane/Avebury Av residents with the closure.",
