We have already had loads of time off where we haven\u2019t been learning anything so now we also have a big chunk of our education missing. So if you actually care for students mental health then you will cancel exams like Scotland and Wales have. How is it fair that we have to sit there worrying about our exams when last years yr 11s didn\u2019t have to go ahead with their GCSEs but they already had the knowledge they needed to know so they could have possibly done them however for this year of yr 11s we are missing half of our education but it\u2019s ok to go ahead with our GCSEs and stress us out even more to the point we can\u2019t cope.",
