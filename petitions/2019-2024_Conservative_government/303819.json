It is also not possible for the Government or the wider population to have a clear idea of how fast it is actually spreading.\r\nFor example there have been cases of people that have been told that they do have the virus, but will not be tested to fully confirm it.\r\nThese people are working with small children that could then carry the virus to someone vulnerable or be vulnerable themselves or indeed have a family member or friend that falls within this category.",
