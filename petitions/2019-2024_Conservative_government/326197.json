        "additional_details": "Thousands of couples have been left devastated, financially and emotionally, by the COVID-19 pandemic. Those with wedding dates from March - June have already been forced to postpone or cancel their day. Many of those who postponed changed their date to late summer or autumn 2020. \r\n\r\nThose couples are now at risk of being forced to postpone again and those with original dates in late 2020 are in limbo due to the lack of government guidance.",
        "background": "We ask the government to provide guidance or a roadmap for the wedding industry. This will allow couples and suppliers to plan around restrictions that might be in place on wedding dates or allow couples to decide to postpone now rather than at the last minute, reducing their financial burden.",
