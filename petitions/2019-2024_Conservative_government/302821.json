        "action": "Reinstate widespread coronavirus testing in line with WHO guidance.",
        "additional_details": "It is clear that the World Health Organisation thinks the UK is wrong to stop mass testing. For example, on March 13th, the WHO's director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: \"You can't fight a virus if you don't know where it is\". As he went on to explain, \"find, isolate, test and treat every case to break the chains of Covid transmission. Every case we find and treat limits the expansion of the disease\". All other wealthy nations are testing outside of hospitals. The UK should too.",
        "background": "The Government should reverse its decision to stop testing those who report coronavirus symptoms but do not need hospital treatment. Without such testing, we will have no knowledge of hotspots. Nor will such individuals know if they are likely to have developed immunity.",
