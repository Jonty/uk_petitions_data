        "additional_details": "Due to the recent earthquake, aid has been unable to reach many areas in Syria that have been affected, which is detrimental at a time when people\u2019s lives were at risk. With Syria already recovering from war, in addition to the sanctions regimes placed, they have very limited resources like electricity, water and food . The delay/lack of aid from states and charities meant more lives were at risk/lost. A sanction regime should not be a detriment to civilians human rights.",
        "background": "Currently,Syria is under a sanction regime which heavily restricts humanitarian aid from reaching those impacted in Syria. The UK had contributed by further sanctioning Syria alongside the US and the EU. We want Parliament to lift the relevant sanctions in order for humanitarian aid to be delivered.",
