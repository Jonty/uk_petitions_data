        "action": "Ban all animal testing in the UK",
        "additional_details": "This petition aims to put a stop to all animal testing in all deparments across the UK. By ending animal testing means that animals cannot be used to trial medicine, development of products and scientific experiments. The current unethical treatment of millions of animals by causing them severe pain  reflects an inhumane system that needs to change. Instead more modern and effective methods such as In Vitro testing that does not cause unnecessary deaths should be put in place.",
        "background": "Animals are still used in what is deemed to be scientific studies. Not only are these procedures outdated,they are also irrelevant as anatomical standards are species specific,therefore all the data collected from studies cannot be transferred onto improving medical understanding for human beings.",
