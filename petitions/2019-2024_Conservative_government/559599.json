        "additional_details": "The DVSA have decided to close motorcycle training and testing facilities during the lockdown period, I believe that motorcycle riders, play an important role in keeping the country moving in times such as these. DVSA's stance on closing/stopping motorcycle training during this lockdown period is irresponsible at best. We urge them to reconsider their position and reopen the training centres so that essential workers can get the training they need as it\u2019s so easy to social distance on a bike",
