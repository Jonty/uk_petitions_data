        "additional_details": "It\u2019s better for Childs mental health, I mean. I think no one wants to stay 6+ hours in a building, teachers would be soo dried and so tired. Later kids have to do homework and study and teachers, have to think more things/homework for the next day, it\u2019s really necessary! SIGN THIS PETITION.",
        "background": "I want the UK to put less time in school hours, they are really long and uneccesary, but don\u2019t delete the recess for this! Breaks and recess are necessary to talk, play, be social, and discover. They are good so they have more energy in the break time! :)",
