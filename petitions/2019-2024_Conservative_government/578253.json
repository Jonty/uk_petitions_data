        "additional_details": "Happier children and teachers would provide better results, more focus on creativity and critical thinking would be more fun and be a greater stepping stone to high school whilst giving children a love of learning. The jobs of the future require imagination, rote learning is redundant in a world of computers, machine learning and AI. Confidence and creativity must be fostered, as well as optimism for the future and what the children can achieve.",
        "background": "The primary curriculum neither prepares children for secondary school nor improves their ability to write well. The grammar taught is pointless and dissuades a love of writing and literature. Children and teachers are left bored and frustrated by the current content.",
