        "additional_details": "It\u2019s important to plant seeds for trees of shadows we will never sit in. The desperate decision to open this coal mine is the same short term thinking we had in the early 2000s when we didn\u2019t invest in our own energy resulting in a massive energy crisis now, because we are dependent on other countries.\r\n\r\nI understand that there will be a reason why the government has done this, but I think fundamentally as a country we should take the harder route if it means standing up to climate change.",
        "background": "The Government has decided short term thinking is the best strategy to combat the energy crisis. Being dependent on other countries is of no means a good position to be in but, as a country of influence, by opening this mine, we are indirectly stating \u201cclimate change is no threat\u201d.",
