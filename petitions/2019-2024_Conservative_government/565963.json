They will potentially administer an Oxford vaccine to those who have had their 1st Pfizer jab if there are no Pfizer jabs available. They assume that it is likely this second dose will boost immunity however there is no data to support that the two different vaccines will work together, be safe or cause a new mutation of covid which is resistant to our vaccines.",
