        "additional_details": "Some form of abolition or reform should happen to the exam system. In 2020 exams were abolished because of CV-19 and teachers graded students. Grades were higher and for a simple reason. Writing on a piece of paper doesn\u2019t determine the personality and how smart someone really is. Teachers know how their students act and can grade fair. Letters on a piece of paper doesn\u2019t determine if they are a good human or bad. We call for reform! Stand up with us!! #ReformExams!!",
        "background": "Every year, 16 year olds (mainly) go through the most pressure of their lives. They have to sit for days and weeks upon end both revising and sitting exams. These exams determine their future and one wrong thing and their life could be in ruins. It is not right we still follow this same system.",
