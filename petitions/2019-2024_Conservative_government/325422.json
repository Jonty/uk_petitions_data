        "additional_details": "Government must ensure that capable pupils attending under-performing state schools are not unfairly disadvantaged by their school's previous performance. Parliament should hold them accountable. Some universities (e.g. UCL) do not allow Autumn retakes to join in 2020; they must reapply in competition with 2021 applicants. This could widen the class divide within top universities and make socially distanced teaching in colleges more difficult, as many Year 13 pupils may have to repeat the year.",
        "background": "Government should review how Centre Assessment Grades have been adjusted by Ofqual to ensure total fairness. They must also review the impact Ofqual's current standardisation will have on the 2020 intake into HE. The Government must be held accountable in ensuring that 'no pupil is disadvantaged'.",
