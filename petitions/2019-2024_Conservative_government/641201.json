Think about actors, musicians, artists. Expressive arts need to be considered as important as maths, English and science.",
        "background": "At the moment, the expressive arts aren't considered very 'important' in schools. At my school, we have 4 hours of expressive arts out of 50 hours of lessons per fortnight. We need more expressive arts - it helps people who might not be academic to express themselves.",

We could accept a petition calling on the Government to require schools to teach additional subjects, or to require schools to teach art and music at key stage 4.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
