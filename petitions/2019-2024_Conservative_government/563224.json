It has been awarded collectively to the people of Malta and the Royal Ulster Constabulary. It is very appropriate in the case of the NHS during the present pandemic. I want the British Government to award the GC, or, if the award is the prerogative of Her Majesty the Queen, to recommend that she does so.",
