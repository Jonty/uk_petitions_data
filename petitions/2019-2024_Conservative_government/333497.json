        "action": "Abandon plans for 'calorie labelling' on restaurant, cafe, and takeaway menus",
        "additional_details": "Evidence suggests that practices like calorie labelling and calorie counting exacerbate and create eating disorders and promote a physically and mentally unhealthy method of weight loss. The focus should instead be placed on food education and accessibility. Calories are not a measure of healthiness and a calorie-controlled diet is not necessarily a healthy one. Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any other mental health condition and the danger these new measures pose is very real.",
        "background": "The government should revoke their proposed 'calorie labelling' plans due to the risk it poses for the health and lives of the UK's 1.25 million eating disorder sufferers. The government should consult eating disorder experts before they go forward with this potentially harmful measure.",
