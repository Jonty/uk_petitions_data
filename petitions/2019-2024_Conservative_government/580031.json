Nicola Sturgeon claimed she wanted to prioritise the health of the country, however gyms have been consistently closed during restrictions. Opening gyms on April 28th along with indoor hospitality shows they are not being prioritised as they should. Surely it's more important that people can exercise rather than go out to eat? And surely more important than getting a haircut?",
