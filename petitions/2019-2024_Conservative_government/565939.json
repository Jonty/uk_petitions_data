        "additional_details": "Diabetics were originally on the shielding list but removed. This forced millions of diabetics to carry on working or lose pay if they chose to shield and put their health at even greater risk while those on the shielding list were protected and given help. It was announced that a third of all the Covid deaths were diabetics and has left people with diabetes terrified. Diabetics are in group 6 on the priority list and it is essential they are moved up the list as they have had no help so far.",
        "background": "To look at the information and facts proving people with diabetes will suffer a worse outcome and more likely to die if they contract coronavirus and recognise more needs to be done to protect diabetics.",
