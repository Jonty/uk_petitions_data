        "additional_details": "Many businesses are taking unfair advantage of their customers. Saving money by not employing enough people to answer the phone costing customers time and money while they\u2019re on hold for very long periods. Many have a recorded message that gives no indication of how long the wait will be. The NHS is just as bad. This week I waited for 3.5 hours to make an appointment. I eventually got through only to be told there were no appoints left, and to call back the following day and repeat the process.",
