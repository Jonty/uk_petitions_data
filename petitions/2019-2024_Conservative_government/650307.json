        "additional_details": "\ud83d\udea8 These letters use threatening language, creating fear and stress among recipients. We firmly believe that there are better ways for TV licensing to communicate with the public.\r\nWe call on TV licensing to reconsider their approach and adopt a more respectful and informative method of correspondence. By doing so, they can effectively communicate without causing undue stress and anxiety.\r\nWe propose the exploration of alternative communication methods, such as digital platforms and online.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, are deeply concerned about the distressing and intimidating letters that individuals across the country are receiving from TV licensing. We believe that this communication approach is unnecessary and causes unnecessary anxiety.",
