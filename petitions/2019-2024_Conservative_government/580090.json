However, there needs to be a serious side.\r\nYoung teens may not realise they have been sexually assaulted or may not realise they have assaulted someone. \r\nWith a larger focus on these crimes, it could benefit teens in the future. \r\nTeachers need to address these topics to protect their students and to also educate them on issues in the world.",

They teach us things about \"how to put a condom on a banana\" but not what is classed as a \"yes\" / \"no\" when it comes to consent. There needs to be more in depth sex education lessons including topics on rape, sexual abuse/assault verbally and physically",
