        "additional_details": "The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has told MPs on the Commons Treasury committee that the economic cost of a no-deal Brexit would cause more long term damage than Covid-19. It is not enough for the chancellor to hope that the UK will \u201cprosper in any eventuality\u201d if there is no deal before the December 31 deadline \u2014 the livelihoods, health and career prospects of millions of Britons depend on it. 2020 has brought increased child poverty and left a generation of young people out in the cold: Britain deserves a deal.",
        "background": "The Covid-19 crisis plunged Britain\u2019s economy into the deepest recession on record, but a no-deal Brexit will be even more harmful to the UK\u2019s future prosperity.
