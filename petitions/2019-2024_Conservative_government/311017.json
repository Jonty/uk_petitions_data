        "additional_details": "I believe that in the current 'Corona Virus' situation where the government are about to disperse billions of pounds into the UK population, it is completely inappropriate to have TV and Radio advertising for gambling. People are at home at the moment and will fritter away money that is aimed at providing social relief in difficult times. We should minimise any temptation by ceasing these adverts. Gambling is endemic in the country and although the government reap a fair amount of tax from it, the misery, depression and financial difficulties that gambling causes to families and individuals far outweighs any financial benefits that the government may obtain.",
