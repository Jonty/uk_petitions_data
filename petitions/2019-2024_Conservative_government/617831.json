That\u2019s why May is the peak for global carbon dioxide emissions. Plants in the northern hemisphere start sucking up more carbon dioxide in the summer as they grow.\r\nAllotmenteers are helping to fight the excess CO2 emissions by growing but it is becoming a very expensive hobby with the cost of everthing going up.
