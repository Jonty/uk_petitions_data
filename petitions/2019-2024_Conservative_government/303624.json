        "additional_details": "We would like the the government to forcefully make companies issue refunds. It\u2019s not their fault this has happened but it\u2019s not the customers fault either. The human thing to do is issue refund and be back to square one. Travel places are refusing to give any sort of compensation for this situation and so I feel it needs to be taken further. It is running pockets of thousands of other people who have booked holidays who will be in the same position.",
        "background": "Due to COVID-19 a Natural Disaster. Landmarks are forced to close, meaning holidays that people have spent lots of money on aren\u2019t even been made available. For example a Disneyland Paris trip can no longer be attended due to the resort closing however companies aren't wanting to issue refunds.",
