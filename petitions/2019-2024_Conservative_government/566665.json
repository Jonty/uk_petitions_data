        "additional_details": "We have had repeated lock downs and restrictions for many months but we will never combat the virus if travel is not strictly monitored at the same time. There are currently no tests carried out at airports and this is not a logical policy. Countries that have successfully controlled the virus have strict quarantine and testing regimes in place. I cannot understand why visitors are not screened. It is like emptying the bath and leaving the taps running, in the words of one epidemiologist.",
        "background": "Bring in strict testing, quarantine and enforcement measures for all travellers to the UK (apart from essential logistics). There are currently NO MEASURES AT ALL in place to screen passengers arriving at airports and national lock downs won't combat Covid-19 without screening those entering the UK.",
