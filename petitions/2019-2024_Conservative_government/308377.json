        "additional_details": "I cannot get milk, bread or toilet rolls from 5 supermarkets where I live because of people panic buying. I am Type 1 diabetic and I am having really bad hypoglycemic attacks because I cannot get food from shelves. I will end up in hospital soon because of my illness and probably many more diabetics will. This will be another strain on the NHS because of people been selfish. The only way to stop this would be to introduce food rationing stamps/books so people can get food to buy.",
        "background": "I would like the government to start rationing food just like after world war 2 to prevent supermarkets running out of food. Panic buying is leaving shelves empty and people are starting to starve because of this.",
