        "additional_details": "It's hard to breathe properly with a face mask and top scientists have proven how detrimental it is to your health to breathe in your own oxygen. The classrooms are ventilated so there is no point of a face mask when there is open air in the room. Masks can be a killer if you wear them too much and students won't be able to work to their best ability if they are damaging their own health. Also, tests should be left to the parent as parent's have a right to make these choices for their child.",
        "background": "We want the government to overturn this decision of having to wear face masks in classrooms of colleges and schools. Also, we believe that tests should be used on pupils with parent consent.",
