        "additional_details": "The situation where a Prime Minister is their own Judge and jury in cases where their own conduct is called in to question is simply undemocratic. In order to be truly democratic, there must be some way of holding a Prime Minister to account. A cross party committee should be able to refer, by majority decision, a Prime Minister to the offices of the Monarch, to investigate the allegations and report back to the committee for them to take action to admonish, remove or prosecute as needed.",
        "background": "The Ministerial Code sets out the standards of conduct expected of ministers and how they discharge their duties. Prime Ministers must be refferable to a higher authority than that of the Prime Minister whose conduct is in question. The monarch already has certain powers, these should be extended.",
