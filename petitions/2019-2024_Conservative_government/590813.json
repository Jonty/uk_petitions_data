        "additional_details": "With the number of infections of the Delta variant continuing to grow and with us seemingly now in a third wave of the virus its the wrong time to remove mask wearing on top of the ending of social distancing rules. If you don't keep mask wearing mandatory the virus is going to spiral out of control putting many vulnerable people at risk. This will lead to many of those people from avoiding social interactions, this will not allow people to get their freedoms back, it will take them away.",
        "background": "I call on the Government to keep mask wearing at indoor public places mandatory after July the 19th, especially on public transport, in shops, theatres, cinemas and other indoor venues where lots of people may gather. This will reduce the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable people.",
