        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson has said that the NHS may spend up to \u00a32.4 million a day on private hospital beds to ease the strain on NHS hospitals (up to \u00a3300 per day per bed).\r\nAs an NHS doctor I have seen that before Covid19 even hit we were working at full capacity with no 'buffer'. More beds must be created, but the cost of renting private beds will compromise our capacity to provide testing and treatment. We must act now in the best interests of the public, rather than private companies' profits.",
        "background": "There are over 500 private hospitals in the UK with around 8000 beds. We should follow Spain's example and re-nationalise private hospitals as an emergency measure in response to the huge demand on both ward and ITU beds set to come in the following days.",
