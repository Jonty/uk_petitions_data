        "additional_details": "In recent years, whilst companies are publicly proclaiming their support for equality, NDAs are still being used to cover up the same issues of harassment, discrimination, abuse and victimisation, and in many ways the matter is worse because it's more important than ever for companies to adhere to a culture shift, and not only are many failing to address these issues, but they are covering them up relentlessly with NDAs to prevent harm to their brand at the expense of employees.",
        "background": "In 2019 the Women and Equalities Committee outlined the severe harm caused to not only victims of harassment forced to sign NDAs, but the perpetuation and immunity it provides in failing to address these behaviours and holding people accountable.",
