        "additional_details": "Many voted for the conservative party as they were told the NHS would not be on the table for trade deals. MPs voting against this trade bill which would protect the NHS highlights a blatant lie to the British public. The NHS is a public health service and should remain a public health service with no input from outside the UK.",
        "background": "MPs voted against the trade bill that would protect the NHS and publicly funded health and care services after the conservative party claimed the NHS would not be sold and there would be no privatising of the NHS. The government or parliament should hold this accountable.",
