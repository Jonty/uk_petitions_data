I am a student doing the Level 3 Animal Management Extended Diploma and I have been waiting for weeks and weeks for an answer about my course. Although these courses may be vocational, there are students who plan to attend university, such as myself who has a place for vet med at Nottingham. It is increasingly difficult to work from home given different circumstances and we should receive a decision about grades by April 30th.",
        "background": "Students around the UK have been provided with reassurance about whether or not they will receive a calculated grade for their course. City and Guilds has provided reassurance that technical qualifications (that have exams) will be given a calculated grade.",
