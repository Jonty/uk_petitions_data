        "additional_details": "British theatre, especially London theatre, is the envy of the world. Many venues, having been forced to close since March, are at risk of permanent closure if the government does not help. Social distancing measures do not lend themselves to theatre and opening at reduced capacity will simply not be viable. Please look more into how the government can step in and help this essential part of British culture to stay alive.",
        "background": "British theatre is on the brink of lasting damage and possible collapse owing to the the devastating effects of COVID-19.  We urge Rishi Sunak to look at ways of rescuing this vibrant and precious industry from ruin.",
