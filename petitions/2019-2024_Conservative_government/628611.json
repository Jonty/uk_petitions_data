        "additional_details": "In 2020, Scots bought enough alcohol for everyone aged over 16 to drink 18 units of alcohol every week. This is equivalent to around 23 bottles of spirits, or around 90 bottles of wine, per adult each year; which is 28% more than the UK Chief Medical Officers\u2019 low-risk guidelines of 14 units per week.\r\n\r\nThats an average of 700 people are hospitalised and 24 people die each week from illnesses caused by drinking alcohol. Each one of these deaths is tragic and entirely preventable.",
        "background": "Young people in Scotland, as well as people in recovery and their families, have told us directly that they see a lot of alcohol marketing and want us to take action to tackle this.",
