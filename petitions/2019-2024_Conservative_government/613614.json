        "action": "Make property offers legally binding in England, like they are in Scotland.",
        "additional_details": "The current process of buying and selling property in England is flawed and means the buyer and seller are losing out. The current system allows the buyer to spend money on searches/surveys and valuations just for the anyone to pull out, up until exchange with money & time lost. The Scottish system offers to buy and sell are legally binding at the point the offer is made and accepted. This ensures trust in the process and speeds up the process of housing transactions, once offers are agreed.",
        "background": "I want the UK Government to enact the process for buying and selling houses as already exists in Scotland, across England and Wales. Reducing the stress, time waste, money loss and uncertainty resulting from the current process. Quickening sales of the housing and boosting the economy.",
