        "action": "Immediately resume UK (Chevening) scholarships for Afghan students",
        "additional_details": "As an academic from a developing country, I am fortunate to have previously received scholarships from Japan, USA and UK for my studies. I would never have been able to study abroad and pursue my dreams without this support. These scholarships changed my life and I know it can change the lives of these promising Afghan students. I would like to stand by them for humanitarian reasons. These students did not contribute to their country's crisis and deserve to have a better future. Let's help them.",
        "background": "We must resume the Chevening scholarlship for Afghan students. 35 talented students were awarded life changing scholarships and it is completely immoral to now take this promised opportunity away. The worsening situation in Afghanistan is further reason to immediatly restore these scholarships.",
