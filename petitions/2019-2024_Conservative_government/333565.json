        "additional_details": "Introducing calorie counts on restaurant menus will not only take away the pleasure of eating out, but it will also be dangerous for those with eating disorders. Exposing children to calorie counting from a young age could cause long-term damage with their relationship with food. I would like the Government to scrap plans to put calorie counts on restaurant menus because I fear that this will only result in a rise in mental health problems - a problem that already needs to be addressed urgently.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to focus on our mental health and overall health rather than just our weight. The better we feel in ourselves, the more we will care for our bodies. We need to be educated about what our bodies actually need in terms of nutrition, as well as the importance of exercise.",
