        "action": "Scrap the tax cuts that were announced in the 'mini-budget'",
        "additional_details": "Tax cuts announced on September 23rd shredded financial confidence in the Govt and the value of Govt bonds needed to finance Govt debts fell.  The Bank of England (BOE) bought bonds to stop their value from declining (and their yields increasing). But the BOE cannot carry on this indefinitely. Without urgent action to withdraw the tax cuts the Govt will be forced to approach the IMF to stop the country going effectively bankrupt and suffering very high interest rates and very high inflation.",
        "background": "The Government must at least defer indefinitely any plans to cut the taxes that it has planned in its 'mini budget' of September 23rd",
