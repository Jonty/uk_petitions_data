        "additional_details": "The UK needs strong leadership and continuity through Covi 19 and Brexit. The government needs to be held to account, it also needs the flexibility to get things wrong without fear or favour. Industry teaches and encourages openness where problems exist.  Problems can then be investigated and solved.  No jobs are lost; just learnIng from mistakes. The press operate a blame culture often without evidence. Asking the same question over and over again expecting a different answer is utter madness.",
        "background": "The press are destroying people\u2019s lives with negativity and untruths leading to trial by media.  Innocent until proven guilty still remains in this country but is being eroded at an alarming rate. The country needs strong leadership and stability with the support of press not continued negativity.",
