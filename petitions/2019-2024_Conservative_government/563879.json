        "action": "Schedule a strict and complete UK lockdown in January for at least 3 weeks",
        "additional_details": "This would seem to be the only route to conquering Covid 19 or at least dramatically reducing its spread. If we continue to go in and out of lockdown or have partial lockdowns or tier systems the virus will continue to spread and the economy will suffer much more in the long run than if we had a carefully planned closure of ALL services for a short time. A planned lockdown would enable people to plan ahead, stock up with food and medicines and not mix at all for the duration of the lockdown.",
        "background": "I want the Government to plan a very strict, short-term lockdown. All but absolutely essential services and shops to close. All non-essential international travel should be suspended and schools and universities closed. Anyone needing to enter the UK should be carefully quarantined for 2 weeks.",
