        "additional_details": "Families have missed out on the free school meals that would have been provided during lockdowns.\r\nSome schools had provision to collect lunches but this was not consistent and not always practical or economical to collect lunches.\r\nFor many families school meals allow their child to eat a healthy meal that they may not otherwise get, of great importance given the increase in sedentary lifestyles as a result of lockdowns.\r\nThe provision should be extended to Years 3 & 4 for the next two academic years.",
        "background": "In England, children in KS1 (Reception, Year 1 & 2) are entitled to free school meals regardless of household income.\r\nThis petition requests that this provision is extended for Years 3 and 4 for the next two academic years to compensate for the loss of access to healthy meals during lockdowns.",
