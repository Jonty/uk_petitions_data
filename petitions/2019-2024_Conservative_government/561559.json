        "additional_details": "It is clear that Government funding, though welcome, is totally inadequate. Leaseholders bought flats in good faith, thinking house builders were selling good flats. Increasingly they are being told that they will have to find huge cost of 24 hour \u00ab\u00a0 waking watches\u00a0\u00bb , potentially for years to come, as well as fund the cladding removal costs themselves. They are completely trapped, as they have no way out, but many cannot possibly afford these huge costs.",
        "background": "Government\u2019s fund for cladding removal is inadequate, perhaps a million people are trapped  with no solution in sight. Lives are being ruined by the impact of living in an unsellable flat, usually with huge costs to fund \u00ab\u00a0 waking watches\u00a0\u00bb . Government has known building regulations are inadequate",
