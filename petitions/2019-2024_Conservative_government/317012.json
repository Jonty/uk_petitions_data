        "additional_details": "I think the country needs to recognise and remember for years to come  all of the sacrifices everyone made during this unprecedented period in our lives. It will become a part of our history and needs to be remembered. Young and old, healthy and frail died. We could not visit the dying or attend their funerals. I believe the remembrance day should be the day the first death was recorded. We need the government to recognise this so it is remembered for 100\u2019s of years to come.",
        "background": "I want the government to formally recognise a National Remembrance Day for all the victims that sadly died of Covid 19. To remember our beloved NHS, Carers and Key Workers and how the country came together to conquer it by staying at home, protecting the NHS and saving lives.",
