        "additional_details": "Free speech and the right to protest is the backbone of British democracy. From the chartists' movement to the suffragettes, Britain prides itself on being a safe place to make one's voice heard.\r\n\r\nUnder this new law, the government can justify shutting down any protest which causes noise that impacts upon an organisation or even a single bystander.\r\n\r\nSuch an attack on free speech and the right to protest is unprecedented. Whether you are left or right, we must come together to protect our rights.",
        "background": "The Police, Crime, Sentencing & Courts Bill 2021 aims to give the police sweeping new powers to restrict protest. Currently, police can restrict where there are negative risks such as 'disorder and damage'. Under this law, they could stop protests where 'noise' causes a 'significant impact'.",
