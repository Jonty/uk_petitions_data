        "additional_details": "I think it is very important to note that nobody in history is perfect. Over the years, attitudes have (rightly) changed regarding a myriad of different issues, but it is crucial that we do not look to the past with unfettered disdain. With plans being drawn up by civil servants to remove many statues and memorials depicting Britain's historical figures, many of us look on with despair. Mass hysteria from a loud few should not give way to mass erasure and censorship.",
        "background": "In light of the tragic events that have occurred in the USA, we are experiencing an attempt in this country to remove the statues/memorials of anyone who, by today's standards, may be seen as controversial. No one in history is perfect, and removing these memorials is nothing more than censorship.",
