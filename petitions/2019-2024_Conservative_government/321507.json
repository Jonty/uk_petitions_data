This will lead to a large gap in attainment between the rich and the normal. This promotes the wrong idea that money is the way to success, in order to keep faith in the education system, the boundaries must be attainable for the students stuck in lockdown with little help",
        "background": "In light of COVID-19, students around the country that are facing exams next year are all left to teach themselves with little support. The government must work alongside exam boards to cut the specifications and subsequently lower grade boundaries to ensure students have a fair chance.",
