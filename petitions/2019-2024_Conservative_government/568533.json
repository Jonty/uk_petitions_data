        "action": "To abolish ground rent payments on existing residential property leases",
        "additional_details": "1)Ground rent is a form of exploitation, particularly when it is set to double over the life of a lease every 10,15,20 or 25 years\r\n\r\n2)The government supports setting ground rent to zero on new leases: a disparity of treatment between old and new leases would put existing leases at disadvantage\r\n\r\nSetting ground rent to zero would likely reduce rent charged to tenants by leaseholder landlords\r\n\r\nLeasehold properties with increasing ground rents are more difficult to sell as lenders are reluctant to approve mortgages to buy these properties",
        "background": "I want the Government or Parliament to abolish the ground rent payments on existing residential properties due to it being a pain when it comes to selling your house or even buying one. Simply, ground rent prevents you from doing work to your house without splashing out on thousands of pounds.",
