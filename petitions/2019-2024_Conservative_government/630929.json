It will improve road safety and save funding from emergency services being called to potential Road Traffic Collisions. It simply is not safe under the Road Traffic Act for this to continue.",
        "background": "Our tax money is not being spent wisely. Instead of focusing on the government\u2019s initiative for a cycling infrastructure, by actually focusing on filling pot holes will benefit all road users including the most vulnerable cyclists and motorcycles.",
