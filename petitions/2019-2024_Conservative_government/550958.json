        "additional_details": "The rule is incoherent with the epidemiology. It is a simple rule designed for ease of enforcement rather than actual impact in stopping COVID-19.  In aiming for simplicity, it is actually permitting riskier activities whilst curtailing less risky activities. \r\n\r\nThis is an affront to fundamental liberties, and hasn\u2019t been subject to proper parliamentary scrutiny.",
        "background": "The government should reconsider the rule of 6, as it prevents a family of 5 from meeting with 2 grandparents as an example. Whereas a much riskier meeting of 6 people from 6 separate house holds is allowed, potentially giving rise to much wider spread.\r\nNo changes to local lockdowns are suggested.",
