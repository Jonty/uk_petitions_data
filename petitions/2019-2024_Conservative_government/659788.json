        "additional_details": "Currently 1/3 of teachers leave the job after working for 6 years. The pressure put on to teachers is at an all time high. Teachers are currently: educators, nurses, parents, dietitians, counsellors, all in one role. To add onto this role, schools are increasingly criticising and overworking teachers to the point of leaving due to mental health. Currently, this is not a job that people can stay in for a long term amount of time.",
        "background": "The government needs to have stricter rules for schools in regards to supporting and helping teachers in schools. The government needs to put clear boundaries in place for schools, so they cannot put pressure upon pressure onto teachers who are already overworked and overwhelmed.",
