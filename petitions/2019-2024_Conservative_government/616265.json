        "action": "Require local Aerodromes to change training circuits at least every five years",
        "additional_details": "We have lived close to a circuit route for 11 years and have asked the aerodrome to make minor changes but they refused.  Trainee pilots do not always adhere to the routes and the noise from up to 40 planes an hour is very disruptive.  If schools are to be allowed, the burden must be shared and that requires a government mandate.  Nobody wants planes over their property but nor should the same properties live with this for more than 5 years at a time.",
        "background": "Impose a requirement on all aerodromes that operate flight schools to adopt new training circuits at least every five years.  Absent mandates, given that any change will cause some properties to have more noise, aerodromes will not implement any changes and it is not fair.",
