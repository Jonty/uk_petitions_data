        "additional_details": "It is the artery of London, which connects both commuter and tourist to their destination. The effects of the dirt and noise pollution on the network are experienced everyday and pose a H&S risk to all that use the network. Passengers are often forced to plug their ears to avoid the extreme volumes of noise, reaching decibels that will probably cause chronic harm when exposed to on a daily basis. Compared to other networks around the world there is much to improve on the service we receive.",
        "background": "Carry out an audit across the Underground network, measuring the noise pollution between each station and hygiene on each train. Resolve the cause of associated noise and hygiene issues. Then setup a department in the TFL to regularly clean and maintain the network above current standards.",
