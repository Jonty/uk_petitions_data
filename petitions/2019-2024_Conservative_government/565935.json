        "additional_details": "Fireworks disturb wildlife, pets and normal family routines.\r\nFireworks cause distress to pets, with nervousness (barking, shaking, stress) and bolting two of the main issues.\r\nFireworks harm nesting birds and wildlife. It is not just loud noises but the litter and potential for misuse to cause fire damage too.\r\nFireworks disrupt families as they are not restricted to specific times, so young children who are scared of the noises find it difficult to settle, which causes distress.",
        "background": "Parliament should ensure that fireworks cannot be accessed by members of the public, unless pre-approval is sought from their local council.\r\nFireworks used in a professional way, with pre-approval, mean the public are pre-warned and can put things in place to lessen the impact of the loud noises.",
