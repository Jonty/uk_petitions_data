It's therefore not clear if you want a referendum, or simply for the use of such certificates to be banned.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nStop discriminating against the unvaccinated in Covid 19 policy: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/597239\r\n\r\nDo not require a Covid passport for access to any services, jobs or events: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/593122\r\n\r\nOutlaw discrimination on the basis of vaccination status: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/596004"
