        "additional_details": "Students should not have to sit on small, ill-fitting, uncomfortable chairs which damage spine health and reduce attentiveness during lessons.\r\n\r\nFurniture that supports better posture should mean that students should not experience back pain, and increased blood flow helps increase cognitive performance and prevents cramps.\r\n\r\nBackcare Awareness recently announced that 1 in 4 secondary school students in the UK suffers daily back pain. Providing funding for new furniture could help tackle this.\r\n",
