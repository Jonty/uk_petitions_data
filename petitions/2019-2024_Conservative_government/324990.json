Autistic children and adults will find life even harder and will become further distressed.\r\n\r\nFace masks have not been proven to be effective, and this new 'condition' for travel poses more problems than its trying to prevent.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you repeal this decision and let people make their own choice about wearing a face mask. \r\n\r\nThank you.",
        "background": "Face masks should not be mandatory on public transport. This is OUR choice. \r\n\r\nThis just makes way for more problems and acts of discrimination. People who depend on lip reading to communicate will not be able to cope. People with breathing difficulties will be expected to 'prove themselves'.",
