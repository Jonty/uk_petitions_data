        "additional_details": "I believe the decision to label calories will be incredibly damaging. Not only those struggling with eating disorders but also the general public - especially in a society so engrained in diet culture. \r\n\r\nFrom my point of view this will only cause more people to relapse & more eating disorders to be formed which will affect the already underfunded mental health services.\r\n\r\nWe should be striving for everyone to have a healthy relationship with food, not for everyone to become calorie obsessed.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to rethink the decision of publishing calories on restaurant and takeaway menus.\r\n\r\nAlthough well-intentioned, this has dangerous consequences that the Government are failing to see.",
