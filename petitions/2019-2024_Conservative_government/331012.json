        "additional_details": "For years we battle, cry and fight for someone to believe our symptoms. I myself have been blamed for my own health . Judged by eye not by ear. \r\nIts insulting,  degrading and disgusting. \r\nEndometriosis is a silent disease that causes lives to be ruined.\r\nPCOS not only affects our outside but our insides. \r\nMental health is left  demolished by these conditions yet everyday women walk around suffering in pain. \r\nNow is the time to end decades of agony.\r\nMore research , More understanding, More care",
        "background": "I , along with millions of women suffer everyday with  long term debilitating conditions PCOS and Endometriosis.  \r\nIt is disgusting that it takes up to 10 years for many many women to get diagnosed. \r\nGive these women a voice . A voice that will be believed not judged or neglected. End the agony.",
