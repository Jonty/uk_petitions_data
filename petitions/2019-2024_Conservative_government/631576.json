People and children are not influenced down a path in life because of their education. But they are given the knowledge to know themself; to have compassion for others and become more tolerant of people who are not the same as them. It is the governments responsibility to ensure everyone is given the opportunity to learn and understand EVERYONE living in the UK",

Heterosexual; LGBT; Single parent; Adopted. Promotion of family as a concept irrespective of the make up of that family should be learned at all ages.",
