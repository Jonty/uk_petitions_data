        "additional_details": "Countless lives have been saved by NHS nurses over the past year. A 1% pay rise is an insult to those who have been exposed to the most horrific consequences of the coronavirus. While many of us begin to return to some semblance of normality, nurses and other NHS staff will continue to deal with the aftermath of the virus. We must show our gratitude NOW and provide any support we can to these heroes.",
        "background": "The government have proposed a 1% pay rise for NHS nurses. For the average nurse this equates to approximately \u00a328/month before tax. I want the government to increase this pay rise to at least 3% or 5% if they truly value the NHS and its heroic workers.",
