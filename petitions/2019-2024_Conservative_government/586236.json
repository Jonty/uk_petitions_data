        "additional_details": "Curcumcision has been known to cause erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation.\r\nI call on the government to outlaw this practice including with religion UNLESS it is for medical purposes ONLY.\r\nA child should have a choice in his own bodily autonomy. If parents are worried about cleanliness then they should educate themselves on proper hygiene. Not cleaning your son is child neglect.\r\nNot just circumcision but any person who amputates a mans penis and testicles or any abuse to the mans genitals.",
        "background": "FGM is a criminal offence and so should MGM. Circumcision can have life long complications such as: penile amputation, testicular removal (both), too much skin taken can pull the penis back into the body resulting in a shorter penis, a botched curcumcision will lead to a second circumcision.",
