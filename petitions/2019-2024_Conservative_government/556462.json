        "additional_details": "I\u2019m not suggesting a ban on fireworks. But loud bangs aren\u2019t necessary to enjoy a firework display and there has been the technology to quieten them for 30 years! Not only does it affect people with health conditions like anxiety, autism and PTSD. It also affects pets (like dogs), wildlife (deers/birds) and children as it frightens them. The world health organisation lists 120 decibels as threshold for sound. Fireworks can reach between 150-170 decibels! Low noise fireworks can reach around 70-90 decibels and can be brighter in colour. Half the noise! Imagine how much better that\u2019ll be? The technology is there and it will help many. Let\u2019s stop the loud, unnecessary bangs!",
        "background": "Everyone enjoys fireworks for the creativity and colours. Not the loud bangs that affect my anxiety and also my dogs! Standard fireworks should be made illegal to manufacture and sell across the UK. They should be replaced with low noise fireworks and made a legal requirement across the country.",
