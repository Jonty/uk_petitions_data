        "action": "Get rid of mandatory school uniforms in UK schools.",
        "additional_details": "There are no real benefits to uniform. The main arguments for them are that they make everyone equal - they don't promote certain people showing off wealth to people that aren't as lucky as them. I know a lot of people (me included) who feel a lot more comfortable and confident wearing their own clothes. This would make school a lot more appealing to a lot more people, as they wouldn't feel so restricted by school life, and encourage a more positive learning experience for everyone.",
        "background": "I want schools to get completely rid of school uniform rules - to maybe install other rules in schools such as no designer brands, or limits on jewellery if you're scared of disparity in cost between people's choice of clothes.",
