Social media took it forward in connecting the masses, encouraging them to share their hopes and dreams, aspirations and worries for all to see.\r\n\r\nSadly we now see large tech companies limiting the right to self expression.  This will only lead to further polarisation of opinion which left unchecked can be explosive.  We need free speech!",
        "background": "The government should look to enshrine the requirement for social media companies to uphold freedom of speech and expression where no law is being broken.  Penalties should be imposed where this is impinged.",
