        "action": "Hold a public referendum on the continued pursuit of Net Zero",
        "additional_details": "We the people have never been consulted on whether or not we want to be subjected to ludicrous legislation and massive changes to our lives in order to achieve Net Zero, which for all intents and purposes is a vanity project. The UK achieving Net Zero will have next to no impact what soever on the planet as a whole, but it will destroy our lives and our freedoms - enough is enough - the people want the chance to have their say on whether we as a nation continue to chase this unicorn.",
        "background": "It has been said that achieving Net Zero will cost up to \u00a3100,000 per person, and disrupt our lives forever. Even if we do achieve Net Zero By 2083, the world average temperature might be at 15.51 C instead of 15.52 C. This nonsense must be stopped. It will destroy the economy and our communities.",
