        "additional_details": "The current system causes a lot of unnecessary stress. The entirety of the exam period is a very stressful and in some cases upsetting time for students as so much can rely on the exams. This has caused increases in mental health issues that can be stemmed to this stress that students go through. Moreover, since we have the same teachers for years they will get an accurate account of how we work and what grade we deserve.",
        "background": "The current exam system is outdated and ineffective, centre assessed grades keep students working hard the entire year and is consequently more effective. The current system is unfair as many students can revise effectively and still leave with an average mark and not feeling proud.",
