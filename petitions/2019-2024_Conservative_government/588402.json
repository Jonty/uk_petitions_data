It's not clear if you want offshore processing facilities to be used to process all asylum seekers, or immigrants who have entered the UK through illegal means, or some other group of people.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, how to establish any offshore processing facilities would be an operational decision for the Home Office, so we couldn't accept a petition calling for a cruise liner to be used for this purpose, but could accept a petition calling for offshore processing facilities to be established.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
