        "additional_details": "During the covid pandemic, hospitals have quite rightly had to in-force some tight restrictions. But denying any parent access to their child is unacceptable in any circumstances. Some hospitals have been preventing both parents from being with their child causing a significant amount of depression and stress. Parents cannot \u2018visit\u2019 their own child. Parent and child\u2019s well-being has been dramatically impacted and not always taken in to consideration. I am now asking the uk government to stop it.",
        "background": "The government should make it impossible for paediatric and neonatal wards from denying both parents access to their children while they are in hospital. As it stands on most wards. Only one parent is allowed in at a time despite family circumstances.",
