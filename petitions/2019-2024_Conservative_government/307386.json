        "additional_details": "The government has said they have an aim to soon be testing 250,000 people per day which is 1,750,000 people per week. Times that by a factor of 40 and you have all 70,000,000 inhabitants of the UK being tested each week. Such a ramping up by a factor of 40 is perfectly feasible if the government assumes wartime powers. Look what happened in WW2. This is the only truly proactive action we can take. All other actions are essentially reactive because they are based on partial information.",
        "background": "Recently, a whole Italian town was tested for COVID-19. 90 positives (3%) including 12 with no symptoms. These 90 isolated, remainder tested. 0.3% positives. 0.3% isolated, remainder tested. No positives. This approach worked for a town. With wartime mobilization, it could work for a country.",
