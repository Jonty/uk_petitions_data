        "additional_details": "Over the past year, football has provided a bright light in a period of immense darkness. Football in Britain was already going down the wrong path in terms of finances before the pandemic. The super league to facilitate owners in lining their own pockets, with these pockets already full at the expense of hardworking people who love the game. If the owners of these clubs think they can exclude Britain's football pyramid, then we should exclude the big six owners from the English game entirely",
        "background": "I want the government and or Parliament to support the notion that the 'big six' premier league clubs who plan to join super league should be banned from participating in English domestic football competitions. I want the government to support the FA, FIFA, UEFA and Premier/EFL in doing this.",

The Culture Secretary said that the Government would back the football authorities to stop this move, and if the football authorities couldn\u2019t act, the Government would. The Culture Secretary said the Government would \"put everything on the table to prevent this from happening.\"\r\n\r\nYou can read the Culture Secretary's full statement on the European Super League here: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-by-oliver-dowden-on-the-european-super-league\r\n\r\nYou can read a report of the English clubs' withdrawal from the ESL here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/56823501\r\n\r\nFurther, on 19 April the Government announced a 'Fan-led review of football governance', which will explore ways of improving the governance, ownership and financial sustainability of clubs in English football, building on the strengths of the football pyramid.
