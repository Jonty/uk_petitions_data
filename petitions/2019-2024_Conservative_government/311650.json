        "additional_details": "During lockdown and self-isolation it is very hard to find two witnesses to watch you sign your Will act as witnesses without (a) putting yourself or the witnesses at risk or (b) breaking the lock down rules. \r\n\r\nVideo conferencing and messaging exists and is reliable. The Government are using it themselves to run our country.\r\n\r\nAllow responsible, self-isolating people to use video conferencing during lockdown so their Wills can be witnessed. Bring the Wills Act 1837 up to date.",
        "background": "Right now people are dying without being able to update their Wills. \r\n\r\nThey are going to hospital without the peace of mind that their loved ones will be cared for or their wishes carried out.\r\n\r\nAllowing Wills to be witnessed over video link during lock down would give peace of mind to thousands.",
