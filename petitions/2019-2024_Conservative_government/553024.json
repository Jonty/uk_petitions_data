        "action": "Ban use of shark squalene in any human vaccine production",
        "additional_details": "Many shark species are already critically endangered and in desperate need  of protection not further exploitation. Globally we are already killing 100 million sharks annually, with 75% of these being used to make shark fin soup. This is not sustainable and if it continues many shark species will become extinct in my lifetime. Killing an extra 500,000 sharks to provide squalene for vaccine research is completely unnecessary as sustainable plant based alternatives are available eg from olive oil",
        "background": "To legislate to stop pharmaceutical companies from using shark based squalene (liver oil) in vaccine research or to create vaccines and instead only use plant based squalene alternatives which are just as effective.",
