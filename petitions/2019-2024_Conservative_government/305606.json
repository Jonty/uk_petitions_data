        "additional_details": "Our NHS nurses will multiply their efforts against the virus, double their shifts and fight to save our loved ones. They will be tired, overwhelmed, worried for their own families, and yet they will show up every day, volunteering for more. As a grateful nation, we ask Parliament to give NHS nurses an immediate morale boost in the form of economic support.",
        "background": "We are sending our NHS staff to war with the biggest threat to public health in five generations. Some of our NHS staff may die in that battle, and they know it. They are going in to fight for all of us anyway. Let us show them that the nation supports their selflessness and spirit of service.",
