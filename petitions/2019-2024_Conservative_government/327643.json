        "additional_details": "In the 2018 government consultation document on GRA reform the government stated their recognition of the significant barriers that trans people face daily and their commitment to improving trans lives. The consultation asked specifically about reform to the Gender Recognition Act, aiming to remove barriers trans people face in gaining legal recognition of their gender change.  More than 100,000 responses were received and were overwhelmingly in favour of improving lives of trans people.",
        "background": "The 2018 GRA consultation results were overwhelmingly in favour of reform. However, the government have now decided to ignore the consultation results. This is unfair and undemocratic. The government owe it to the trans community to uphold the results and reform the Gender Recognition Act 2004.",
