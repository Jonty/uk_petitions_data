        "additional_details": "It seems the government have failed in their efforts to control the spread of covid, resulting in more than 100,000 deaths. In Boris\u2019 recent address, he failed in my opinion to mention anything to remember the memory of those who have died, rather instead telling the public to follow the rules. Given the seriousness of covid, I felt what Boris\u2019 suggested was very insensitive and it didn\u2019t seem sincere. I feel a day of mourning is the least the government can do to honour those who have died.",
        "background": "I want the government to set up a day and time so we can remember the memory of those who have died as a result of the pandemic",
