        "additional_details": "The rule of 6, designed to discourage large house parties and raves, actually disproportionately affects families with young children. For parents in a larger household, this means they can no longer have social contact with their friends; this will have an effect on their mental well being. Children who have, only recently been able to meet with grandparents, friends and cousins, can now no longer do so if they number more than 6 in total. Please follow Scotland and Wales and exempt children.",
