        "additional_details": "Students returned to university in september with the promise that  courses would include face to face teaching, hence many signed private tenancy agreements. Once actually back at Uni many students like myself found that courses were being taught mostly online before completely going online from December onwards. Thus, Students are now stuck paying rent on property they do not need and although landlords and businesses are getting support students are expected to continuing to pay as usual.",
        "background": "allow students stuck in tenancy agreements till late summer the opportunity to give landlords 1 months notice to end a tenancy agreement early as has been done in Scotland. The hardship fund set up is meagre when taking into account the student population and does not go far enough at all.",
