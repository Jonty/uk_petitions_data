        "additional_details": "As a single parent, I cannot afford to bear the additional burden of feeding and extra cost on my utility bills by having my adult child home for 15weeks from now until end of June. This is because he cannot cope with the lockdown as every other student in the entire hall has left which is a mental torture to him. This will help bring financial relief to low-income/struggling parents and single parents who will forced to accommodate their adult child/children and minor consolation to memories that will be lost by students. This will not in any way compensate fully for the experiences with friends that students will miss as a result of the lockdown/closure during this pandemic. Refunds can be pro-rated.",
        "background": "I would like the Parliament to intervene and have universities and accommodation providers refund fees for the duration of the lockdown and student not required to pay for the last semester of this session.",
