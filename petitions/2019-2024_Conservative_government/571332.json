        "additional_details": "It\u2019s a form of scare mongering. People that are hit by a bus or commit suicide will go down as a Covid death if they have tested positive, this is ludicrous. The general public will see the daily deaths and live in fear as they believe over 1000 people daily have been killed by Covid, and not died of other causes and simply had Covid. This will stop people living in fear and will improve the mental health of the general public.",
        "background": "We want you to stop telling the UK the number of deaths of people \u201cwith Covid\u201d and instead tell us the deaths caused \u201cby Covid\u201d. Make that the main death count broadcasted to the general public.",
