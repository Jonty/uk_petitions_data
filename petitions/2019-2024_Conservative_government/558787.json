Having one exam determine it all seems unfair and lazy.",
        "background": "Taking a singular exam to determine ones outcome of life seems unfair and a poor determiner of proper knowledge. Having teacher input, as seen from the recent COVID-19 exams, aswell as coursework, mock exams and oral/written class work should all be examined to fully produce a final grade.",
