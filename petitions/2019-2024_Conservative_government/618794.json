The excess monies the companies are holding is preventing people from using all their disposable income to buy food and pay other bills and is helping to create food poverty and debt when there could be no need for it.

This is to protect the energy company, OVO in this case, form not getting paid in the future. Having got \u00a3117 in credit I had to ask for this to be refunded.",
