        "action": "Prioritise key-workers in the Covid vaccine rollout.",
        "additional_details": "Vaccination according to age (reflecting clinical need) makes sense, however this ignores the crucial contribution of working-age people whose work is essential to the continued running of society, and are at increased risk of exposure to Covid due to their contact with the public. Thus these key workers should have priority receiving the vaccine over the general population, including older people, to ensure their work can continue without interruption and without further risk to their health.",
        "background": "Prioritise the vaccination of workers in essential services, after the over-70s, health care workers & the clinically extremely vulnerable (i.e, before vaccination of the under-70s). This would include teachers, public safety, delivery/warehouse personnel, essential retail, animal welfare, & others.",
