        "action": "A support scheme for refugee students to complete their education",
        "additional_details": "Putin\u2019s devastating war has already forced over 2.8 million Ukrainians to leave their homes and many students had to interrupt their studies, abandon their degrees. This means future careers are ruined and dreams shattered for many young talented people leading to a future deficit of highly skilled specialists. The support scheme will alleviate the impact of war on young lives, aid post-war recovery, and build strong international bonds, thus, reinforcing Britain's global position.",
        "background": "To help refugee students and to strengthen the scholarly international UK interactions, a scheme is needed that would open up opportunities for refugee students to complete their studies in their chosen disciplines in UK universities with tuition fees as well as IELTS exam fees waived.",
