        "additional_details": "Coronavirus restrictions are doing enormous harm. Billions of hours of face to face education have been lost. People are missing contact time with loved ones and friends, fun and joy. Testing and quarantine for international travel and their high costs are keeping families apart. Businesses that were the livelihood of many families have been destroyed.\r\nLife cannot be put on hold. Children grow, adults get older. We won't get back the years that coronavirus restrictions are taking away from us.",
        "background": "The Government should end all coronavirus restrictions now. This includes ending: any mandates on social distancing and self-isolation; any restrictions on indoors/outdoors meetings and events; testing and quarantines for international travel; mandates on face coverings; vaccination requirements.",
