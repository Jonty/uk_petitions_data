        "additional_details": "According to the Higher Education Policy Institute, International students provided nearly 43 billions to the Uk economy last year amongst other invaluable benefits. \r\nHowever this new draconian government restriction that restricts them from bringing their family to live with them is inhumane. According to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life. International students\u2019 rights to a family life needs to be protected.",
        "background": "An alternative solution to crack down on them using the student route as a back door to work in the UK could be restricting the numbers of dependents they can bring to live with them and tightening the application process by vetting their dependents vigorously or applying other alternative measures.",
