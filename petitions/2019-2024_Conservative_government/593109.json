As Torsten Bell of the Resolution Foundation says 'Continuing the uplift is the only right thing to do.'\r\nIf the government needs to save money then it should look closer to home.\r\nTo MPs \u00a320 is loose change, to a claimant it is literally the difference between eating and going hungry.\r\nThe British Government has a moral duty to support our most vulnerable members. We call upon them to do so.",
