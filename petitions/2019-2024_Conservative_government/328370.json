        "additional_details": "The UK is complicit in war crimes which buttress, reinforce, and escalate Yemen\u2019s civil war, a primary cause of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. Millions are suffering. \r\nThe Yemeni crisis is our moral responsibility, given our complicity in the war. Without urgent, and immediate action, there may be no Yemenis to speak of by the end of the year. Britain has the material capacities to intervene in a meaningful and powerful way. Yemen can not handle a war, economic collapse and 4 pandemics.",
        "background": "The UK must: \r\n\r\n1. stop supporting Saudi Arabia\u2019s Military Campaign by ceasing the sale of weapons and planes to Saudi Arabia. \r\n\r\n2. intervene to stop the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. \r\n\r\n3. provide the basic necessities of food, water and medicine for Yemenis.",
