        "additional_details": "Ambulance services, having worked throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, are now seeing the start of winter pressures. Staff are increasingly stretched for a number of reasons: volume of 999 calls, lack of staff, response times over 24 hours in some cases, late finishes, hospital handover delays, cuts to public services leaving ambulance personnel to pick up the pieces and pay rises below inflation to name a few. Let MPs see first hand what the ambulance service and NHS as a whole is experiencing.",
        "background": "Insist all Members of Parliament complete an observation shift for 12 hours on an ambulance within their local constituencies. This should be established as an annual requirement, preferably during the winter pressures experienced by NHS Trusts all over the country.",
