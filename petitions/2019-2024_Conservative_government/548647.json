        "additional_details": "Barbecues sold most frequently in supermarkets in tin trays have become a nuisance.  They cause polluting smoke on busy beaches. They are a significant cause of litter.  Often left buried on beaches causing a serious burn hazard if walked over in bare feet. Fire hazard on heaths and commons.  Fire ha,ard in municipal litter bins.  Altogether anti-social and potentially dangerous.",
        "background": "A child of 2 on Exmouth beach received 2nd degree burns walking on sand covering a tin foil barbecue which had not been extinguished.  Many examples exist of the anti social nature of these convenience barbecues, fire risk and danger to wildlife and farm animals.",
