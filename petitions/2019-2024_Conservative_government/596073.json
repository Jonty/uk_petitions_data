        "additional_details": "Once girls/women become sexually active, they can get HPV (human papillomavirus) which is very common. For some people, the virus goes away by itself. For many, the virus makes cells abnormal which can develop into cervical cancer. If treated early, this may be easily treatable. However if left until the age of 25, these cells can turn into high grade dyskaryosis / CIN3 (the stage before cancer) or cervical cancer. You should be able to have a smear test from when you are sexually active.",
