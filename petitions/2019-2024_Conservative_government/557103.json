        "additional_details": "The attempt of the British Government to fight Corona virus via national lockdown between March and and July 2020 has had an irreversible effect on the economy as well as mental health of the nation. Many businesses will never open again. There has been increase in the cases of domestic violence and increase in the alcohol consumption of the society during quarantine. Millions were left without a job and are still struggling to find one. Many are still fighting stress and depression.",
        "background": "A national lockdown goes against human rights and freedom. If such a radical change in humans' livehood is attempted that should happen through referendum. People are not given freedom of choice and that should not be happening in a democratic country such as UK.",
