        "additional_details": "The importance of swimming is evident to the young and old, keeping them away from medical care, and supporting both their fitness levels and most importantly their mental wellbeing. I have 'hidden' illnesses, but these are kept at bay by swimming daily. Swimming is safe, no incidents of Covid as a result of pools being open, it would help thousands of people across the country to keep going during lockdown and not add to the numbers going to hospital.",
        "background": "The Government understands the importance of fitness and health in the population. Swimming is an exercise that many can enjoy, supporting wellness and wellbeing. Swimming pools have shown to be Covid safe environments. Please consider people's wellbeing in mind, and keep swimming accessible.",
