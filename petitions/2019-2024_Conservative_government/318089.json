        "additional_details": "It is not fair on these children as they will have to go through a lot more than any other year group and due to the current circumstances the children may have issues related to covid 19 which will directly add to their problems as they are already putting in all the extra work for the months of learning they will have to catch up for. As we do not have a set date for the end of the lockdown we should play it safe and save the children alot of work, time and stress",
        "background": "The year 11s that had their gcses canceled had already learned most of what they needed to whereas the year 10s miss out on months of learning which could put them under extreme stress psychologically and could directly effect their learning and grades more then they already will be.",
