        "action": "Ban the use of dogs in toxicity testing for pharmaceuticals and chemicals.",
        "additional_details": "The practice of using dogs, mainly beagles due to their docile nature, in laboratory toxicity testing is both antiquated and inhumane. These tests often result in severe suffering, including long-term health issues and, in many cases, euthanasia of the animals involved, without providing substantial benefits to human health and safety.\r\n\r\nModern science has evolved and now has alternatives like computer modeling, cell cultures, human tissue-based studies, and sophisticated analytical techniques.",
        "background": "1. Enact regulations to end dog use in toxicity tests.\r\n2. Collaborate with experts to fast-track non-animal test methods.\r\n3. Offer incentives for adopting alternative tests.\r\n4. Partner with global agencies for an animal-free testing shift.",
