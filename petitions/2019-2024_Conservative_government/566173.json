        "additional_details": "The country has long been bitterly divided into \"leave\" and \"remain\" camps and an easily understood ceremony where the Prime Minister (and later other ministers) are seen to be delivering on their promises (week after week) could only serve to unite us all. I would hope to see different front line workers represented each week - surgeons, doctors, nurses and support staff.\r\n\r\nNow that I would clap for!",
        "background": "Now we have fully left the EU, the people of the UK want to see the tangible benefits delivered. A short weekly televised ceremony of a minister (the PM going first of course) handing over a cheque for \u00a3350m (representing additional funding) to an NHS representitive would motivate the whole country.",
