        "additional_details": "Raise awareness about having to cancel exams that will take place in 2022. Many student\u2019s mental health has been affected during the pandemic and lockdown. Many students have been finding it hard to focus on their learning and having to take enough content. I don\u2019t feel as though it\u2019s fair for them to be taking National exams. They are already stressing enough about whether they will get the qualifications and grades due to coronavirus. The demand of getting into uni is to high which is making them even more stressed and their anxiety high.",
        "background": "I want both the parliament and government to cancel any national exams that will take place in 2022 such as A level exams and other exams. This is not fair for any students who have started college in September 2021 as enough content wasn\u2019t taught efficiently and effectively.",
