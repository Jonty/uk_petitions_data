As us tradesman and other skilled workers are being underpaid and the companies who we work for are allowed to get away with paying the minimum. There are not enough companies out there that pay fair wage, and pay what people are worth.. for example, in fordthorne the main dealership for fords in Cardiff, pay a tyre fitter (minimum qualification) the same as a 30 years experienced technician (higher qualifications).\r\nAnother point is that for years to get to the experienced level that we\u2019ve got to, we must start as an apprentice, which the wages for a couple of years is around \u00a33 an hour.",
