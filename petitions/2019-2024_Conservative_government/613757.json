        "additional_details": "Schools don\u2019t allow students to use the toilet during class. If a young girl was on her period and the school do not let her, it is causing her pain, uncomfort and its unhygienic. It is a normal human right to use the bathroom when needed and it\u2019s strictly taken from students unless they have a medical problem. Prisoners have more toilet rights than student and alot of people find this absolutely horrendous! It needs to be sorted so i made this petition to help student out.",
