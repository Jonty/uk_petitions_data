        "additional_details": "In cases of school closures and social distancing, some UK families will need to provide up to 5 extra meals per week per child. This is especially difficult for families with young children as necessary supplies are decreased in shops. \r\n\r\nFood charities in England will quickly be overwhelmed trying to fill extra need of families during the crisis. More volunteers will be required to deliver food, reducing the benefit of social distancing aimed at stopping the spread",
        "background": "We must help feed families (especially those with young students or with low income) to carry individuals through the COVID crisis.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the government should fund grocery staples, directly from shops, rather than overwhelming food charities.",
