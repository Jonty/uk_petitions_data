Many people are overwhelmed by the conflicting and confusing advice that is available and this is the way to sign-post them in a more efficient manner.  At the moment there is nothing of this sort, and it will become even more necessary as this Covid19 outbreak progresses.  This should work with foodbanks, supermarkets and local services.",
