        "additional_details": "Due to COVID-19, many Universities have made the decision to move all large scale lectures online. As most lectures are large scale, this means that the campus is almost completely off limits. As we have now experienced this way of teaching, we do not believe it lives up to the high quality of teaching that is promised and that this level and quality of teaching is not worth \u00a39,250. COVID-19 is effecting the lives of thousands, including students. We are asking you to reconsider the yearly fee.",
        "background": "Students should not have to pay the same high priced tuition fees (\u00a39,250) for a reduced use of facilities. It is also seen that online use of teaching, is not as effective as first hand interactive teaching. Which can effect student grades drastically. We need help from our government to do this.",
