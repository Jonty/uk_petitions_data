        "additional_details": "To give all parties and all voters a fair say in which government is permitted to the lead the country as I feel there have been too many errors of judgement in many major decisions regarding people's safety during the COVID pandemic, the meagre funding for schools and the NHS over the last 12 years of government.\r\n\r\nThe freezing of nurse and teacher pay for another year despite inflation rising above the average wage & people struggling financially due to the decision making of this government.",
        "background": "I would like a snap general election to take place in April/May 2022 due to the government's lack of consistency/investment and care for central services i.e. NHS and Education. I have no confidence in the way the country is being led at this point in time, therefore a general election is required.",
