When this pandemic is over perhaps a way can be found to reward each of them in some tangible way. But in the immediate term our nation could show our collective gratitude by awarding the NHS a George Cross as we did previously to Malta and The Royal Ulster Constabulary. Such award would boost the morale and esteem of the whole NHS team.",
