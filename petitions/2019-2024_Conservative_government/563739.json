Ive been an unpaid carer for years and care 24/7 often with only 2 hrs sleep a night. During the pandemic ive isolated since February to ensure I do not pass it on to my bedbound mum or that I get it which means I can't provide care. Yet again now the vacinne is here, were neglected again. If we catch this how can we provide the intense care we need to provide 24/7?",
        "background": "Unpaid carers provide care 24/7 without any support. We have provided care constantly during the pandemic, including being housebound ourselves since February to ensure we don't pass it on to our loved ones. In turns means we have not had a break even an hour. Isolated and alone.",
