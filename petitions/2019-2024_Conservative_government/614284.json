        "additional_details": "Calorie information can be extremely triggering for those with eating disorders and be detrimental to their recovery. There is little to no evidence that calorie displays help individuals to live a healthier lifestyle. All this law will do is create more mental turmoil for those suffering from eating disorders when they eat out and it is abhorrent that clearly no consideration for this has been taken.",
        "background": "A law was recently passed that required businesses (such as restaurants, cafes and takeaways) with more than 250 employees to display calorie information on their menus. This petition calls this unnecessary and harmful law to be scrapped immediately so that it is not a legal obligation.",
