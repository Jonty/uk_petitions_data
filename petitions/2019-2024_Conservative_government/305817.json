Insufficient stocks of ventilators etc... \r\nWhilst the Prime Minister was enjoying his winter break in the sun, could more have been done to mitigate the damage from this virus? Why did the UK wait until the last minute? could lives / economy have been saved if the government started its preparation earlier? Parliament should open an independent inquiry to find out.",
        "background": "Parliament needs to investigate whether the government should have responded to the Covid 19 crisis earlier. Germany started preparing in February. China were experiencing problems with the virus in 2019. Aside from small scale testing and monitoring, no action seems to have been taken.",
