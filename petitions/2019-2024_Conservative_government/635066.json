Your petition refers to taking each case on its own merits, but it's not clear how you want this to work in practice.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to increase the seven-day period after which a stray dog becomes the property of the relevant local authority, and calling for a cap on kennel fees for stray dogs, but if you want the Government to make other changes to legislation governing stray dogs you'd need to be clear how you want this to work."
