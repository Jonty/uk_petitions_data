The EU has open borders for them, only the UK has a separate regime. This is something the UK should definitely join the EU. Despite Brexit we still have much in common. Stopping Ukrainian refugees at the border would be an international embarrassment for a country which has the Ukrainian flag over the PM\u2019s office.",
