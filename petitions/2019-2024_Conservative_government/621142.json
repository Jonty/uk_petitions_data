Students entitled to free school meals are entitled to free meals, but do not receive an amount of money to spend on food. The Government provides funding to schools for students who are on free school meals, to help cover the cost of providing these.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to increase what students entitled to free school meals are entitled to be given by their school, or to increase funding for free school meals, to improve the quality and amount of food that is provided, if either of those are things you want to happen."
