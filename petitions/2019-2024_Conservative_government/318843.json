This is because people rely on these facilities to get some fresh air & exercise. Shutting golf courses limits opportunities to exercise which could affect people\u2019s mental and physical wellbeing.",
        "background": "The goal is to get the government to rethink their decision to close golf courses and to come to an agreement to reopen them. As myself and many people rely on golf as part of general exercise or a source of happiness I think it would be beneficial for all to reopen them.",
