It's not clear what you want a \"British Space Institute\" to do that the UK Space Agency is not already responsible for.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about the UK Space Agency here: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-space-agency/about\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, we could accept a petition calling on the Government to fund space missions to the moon, if that's what you want to happen."
