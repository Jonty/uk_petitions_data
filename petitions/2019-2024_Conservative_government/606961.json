        "additional_details": "Old rules state that a vehicle has priority at a junction. New rules coming into effect give the pedestrian the right of way. This to me is madness & is asking for accidents to happen. So said pedestrian is walking out in front of car with headphones on or using phone & distracted & hit by car = drivers fault. This will also add to vehicles getting rear ended & also pedestrians being verbally abused by the vehicle driver. This new Highway Code is ridiculous & must be stopped.",
