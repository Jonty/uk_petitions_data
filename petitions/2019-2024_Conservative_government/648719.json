        "additional_details": "It is not healthy for kids to be getting there hands on vapes and it isn\u2019t healthy for the adults either so I think that banning vapes once and for all would make it a better environment and stop people from getting addicted to nicotine in the first place: most young children get addicted to nicotine through vapes and that would lead to them smoking once they get older so if they keep on smoking vapes this will lower our avg life expectancy rate to under 60 which might lead to the UK becoming an NEE instead of an HIC",
        "background": "To many young kids are getting there hands on vapes these days and as we all know they are equal to a back of cigarettes and are just as addictive. So I think that we should bring a police officer to do daily checks on vape shops that may be under suspicion of selling vapes to minors.",
