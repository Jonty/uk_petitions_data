        "additional_details": "Healthcare students such as nurses, paramedics, pharmacists, midwives, doctors etc are only students. They do not deserve to be given hundreds of hours of unpaid work as part of their course whilst this virus is effecting people rapidly. It is impossible to completely avoid the virus but if we are given the opportunity to make up our hours later down the line we can at least be safe and free from corona. Students deserve the choice to attend placement or not in situations like this.",
