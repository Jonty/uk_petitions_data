I think there needs to be a base line that all employers need to adhere to so there is consistency for everyone. Not the company\u2019s choice on if they want a policy for workers undergoing treatment. \r\nFertility treatment still isn\u2019t discussed very openly and the impact on the couple going through it is huge. It\u2019s even more difficult to bring this up with your employer.",

I\u2019ve found there is lack of guidelines and lack of policy within work. 1 in 6 couples experience some kind of infertility and the impact physically and mentally is massive.",
