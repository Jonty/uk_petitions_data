        "additional_details": "I have witnessed first hand the ongoing struggles through my stepdaughter, she suffers with anxiety, depression , and over thinking, she is under the doctor and Camhs , but there is no understanding from the school even though they have received all the paperwork regarding her condition, and instead they issue detentions most days for things she can\u2019t control which again heightens her emotional state , for a teacher untrained in mental health it\u2019s easier to send a kid out of class , as proved",
        "background": "I\u2019d like  a specialist teacher training program in place in every secondary school on how to deal with mental health so as not to treat them just like a naughty kid or a specialist teacher working alongside the main teacher to focus on helping and guiding the children who are struggling",
