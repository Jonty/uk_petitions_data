        "additional_details": "The Government\u2019s own data shows that two thirds of people arriving in small boats across the channel come from countries where war and persecution has forced them from their homes.\r\n\r\nSending people seeking asylum to be processed abroad will do absolutely nothing to address the reasons why people take perilous journeys to find safety in the UK, but will only lead to more human suffering and chaos.",
        "background": "We urge this Government to immediately rethink its plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda for processing, which are in such stark contrast to what previous UK governments have sought to do by providing a fair hearing on British soil for those who claim asylum.",
