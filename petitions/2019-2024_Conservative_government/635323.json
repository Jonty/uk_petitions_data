        "action": "Refrain from sending uranium munitions to Ukraine.\r\nMove towards peace.",
        "additional_details": "Apart from the potential health implications of using such weapons, the use of Uranium munitions can be like opening Pandora's box and the west should be setting an example that no nuclear weapons should be tolerated or used as doing so could encourage Russia to consider using nuclear munitions.\r\nWe think the UK government should also be more open to communication and not to provoke the situation further and attempt to move towards deescalation rather than escalation.",
        "background": "We request that the UK government reconsider sending uranium containing munitions to be used within Ukraine. There are many health considerations with using such weapons which have been known to contaminate and harm soldiers, the environment and future populations.",
