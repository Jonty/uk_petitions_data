        "additional_details": "My practical driving test has been cancelled countless times, none of which were my fault and most of which due to Covid-19. My theory certificate runs out in August, meaning I took it in mid-late 2019, not \"early 2019\" as stated in the government response to a previous petition.\r\nMany people are in similar situations, and many in this situation are young; with minimum wage/apprentice or no income and will struggle to afford the retest which we are having to take even if it is beyond our control.",
        "background": "A petition named \"Extend driving theory test certificates expiring in 2020/21 by 12 months\" was rejected by UK Government due to safety concerns.\r\nWhilst this is intelligible, those whose theory certificates have run out during the pandemic should have the cost of retaking the test fully subsidised.",
