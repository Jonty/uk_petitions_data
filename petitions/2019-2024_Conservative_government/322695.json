Not only is the reuse of the famous LGBT pride flag disrespectful to LGBT people but some could find it disrespectful to the NHS staff who didn\u2019t get something that had true meaning or background. The LGBT community has by far already suffered enough- why make it worse? Get a new logo of flag for the NHS, something original, unique and has actual meaning behind it. Thank you.",
