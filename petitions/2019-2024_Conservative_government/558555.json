        "additional_details": "The majority of people on the roads did not have to sit a theory test as they did not come into action until 1996, therefore students should be allowed to have an extension for these very particular circumstances.",
        "background": "Extend theory tests in the UK as students were not able to take their practical driving test from March - July and now will not be able to take it all through November. There has also been a huge back log of driving tests so students have not been able to book a driving test until 3+ months",
