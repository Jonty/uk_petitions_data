        "additional_details": "The secretary of health is important to secure the quality of care provided by health services and NHS. It is inappropriate to have a secretary with little to no experience in healthcare making decisions without the necessary knowledge.\r\n\r\nFailures in the outbreak response have cost lives. Decisions were not critically assessed by M.H. due to inadequate knowledge:\r\n\r\n- Herd immunity approach \r\n- No airport screening\r\n- No awareness of existing diagnostic lab services in the NHS",
        "background": "All health secretaries appointed should have relevant qualifications i.e. health/scientific degree and healthcare experience. \r\n\r\nM. Hancock is qualified in economics & philosophy with previous roles as Secretary of Digital, Media and Sport. This is inappropriate experience for a health secretary.",
