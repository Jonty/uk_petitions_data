        "additional_details": "Shop workers, those in hospitality and transport, anyone public facing as well as the general public will be put at risk if the rule on mandatory face coverings is lifted.\r\nCases will rise, there will be more deaths, more lives will be disrupted, but these numbers can be kept down if face coverings continue to be mandatory.\r\nWhy should those who want to wear a face covering be put at risk of catching and spreading COVID-19 to our loved ones because others don\u2019t want to wear a mask to protect us?",
        "background": "It is reckless to allow the public to choose whether to wear a face covering.\r\nNot all adults will have received two vaccines by July 19th and despite being double vaccinated, COVID-19 still poses a risk to everyone. Not everyone is ready for the lifting of restrictions and face masks should remain.",
