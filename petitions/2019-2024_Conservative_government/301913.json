        "additional_details": "The government appears to be taking a \"wait and see\" approach to the prevention of coronavirus. This is dangerous and can lead to people dying needlessly. The world health organisation has made it very clear that some countries' approaches are inadequate. The UK needs to be doing much more. The UK's measures are lacklustre and ineffective. If the government had acted more quickly and decisively we may have not had any infections at all. Saying that this is the biggest public health challenge of a generation and then telling people to \"stop going on cruises\" is unacceptable",
        "background": "Take tough action on coronavirus, such as closing borders, grounding flights, testing anyone with respiratory symptoms, enforcing quarantines and closing schools, universities and non-essential shops etc. As has been done by other countries around the world. This needs to be done quickly.",
