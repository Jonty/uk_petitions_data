        "additional_details": "It's simple-because it's discrimination of people who didn't get the vaccine.In world's leading democracy like UK there's no place for it.Everyone is equal and must be treated equally.It's a threat to our freedom and leads all the companies to over usage of their power and creating their own \"law\".\r\nIt's unacceptable and it's biggest threat to human rights ever and it's vaccine segregation.It must become illegal instantly to stop it right now before it will cause more damage to the system and us.",
        "background": "The government must clearly state that any attempt by anyone to discriminate not vaccinated part of society will be illegal and prosecuted.Like we can see,airlines,ferrys etc.ban people without proof of vaccination from accessing their services.It must be dealt with as an example for other companies",
