        "additional_details": "The new regulations tell people to leave their homes for healthcare, work and essential food shopping. As a McDonald\u2019s worker, I can speak for a lot of us when I say McDonald\u2019s doesn\u2019t fall under any of these categories so we shouldn\u2019t be open. It\u2019s risking all our well being as it\u2019s a struggle to maintain social distancing. I believe if it\u2019s a lockdown like March, it should be a full lockdown and nobody should be in this compromising position.",
