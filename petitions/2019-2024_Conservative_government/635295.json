        "additional_details": "Why should a child & their parent who has excellent attendance be penalised for missing a small amount of school.  It isn't about paying out money for a fine but should be completely re-evaluated. If you are honest and but a request in that is declined because the school doesn't see it as an exceptional circumstance then we are fined. Yet if we lie and tell school they are off sick it doesn't get issued! The Gov guidance Sept 22 doesn't seem to be applied  by the schools to look at all evidence",
        "background": "Currently a fine can be issued for just 1 days absence. The rights of parents are slowly being removed. We should have the choice over our children",
