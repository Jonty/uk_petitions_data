        "additional_details": "Showing the number of calories a meal has on the menu will impact people struggling with eating disorders, and will be detrimental to their recovery.  According to the eating disorder charity Beat, roughly 1.25 million people in the UK suffer from an eating disorder. Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder, and only 46% of people with anorexia fully recover. Encouaging calorie counting is a dangerous path, especially when our mental health survices are so underfunded.",
        "background": "Information about a meal's nutritional value on the menu will be significantly more useful in helping people pick more nutritious options. Macdonalds is an example of how showing calories in fast food does not prevent people consuming it, but can stop those with eating disorders from eating at all.",
