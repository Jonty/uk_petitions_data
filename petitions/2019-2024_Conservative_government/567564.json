        "additional_details": "In both Scotland and Northern Ireland, 100% of supply staff were given \u2018furlough like\u2019 compensation, it is only fair that England and Wales get the same equal treatment. Supply teachers are left unexpectedly without any financial support after the recent new Lockdown Measures, which will continue for as long as schools are closed. Agencies are refusing to furlough their staff because it is not mandatory. As a result, supply staff continue to suffer from severe financial hardship.",
        "background": "The Government should make Furlough Mandatory for Education Supply Staff instead of a flexible one to support supply staff and help retain as many experienced teachers in the profession as possible and provide more support for the employees.",
