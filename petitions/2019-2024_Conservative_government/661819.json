        "additional_details": "The Tory government has been in for 14 years and it is time for change. Today shows the point that we as a Country are sick and tired of their regime. \r\nOnce again we see the Tories ever declining in their power over us and the trust is lost. \r\nWe don\u2019t want another Tory fronting the party that none of us have voted in. \r\nWe want change and the people have had enough which is why we now need to hold a general election to bring confidence back in our Countries politics.",
        "background": "It is time for the government to act and realise that the Tories are not what the country needs or wants. The last two local election have clearly proven this. \r\nWe want the government to assess the realisation of this country and give a general election for who the people actually want.",
