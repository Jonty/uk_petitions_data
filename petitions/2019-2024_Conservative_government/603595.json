The action you have requested would therefore not achieve what you have set out in your petition.\r\n\r\nWe also cannot publish petitions that contain false or unproven statements. This includes unsubstantiated speculation about the effect of the UK's membership of the European Convention on Human Rights on specific domestic policies.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
