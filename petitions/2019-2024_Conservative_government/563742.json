        "additional_details": "Every day I read about the grief families are going through having had their dog stolen. Ask anyone who\u2019s had a dog, they will agree that their dog is very much part of the family, and during the Covid pandemic, and self isolation, it could be their only companion. \r\nThis is IMPORTANT, the law needs to be changed urgently to deal with the heartless bullies that are tearing the hearts out of so many families, and lone dwellers, like the elderly lady who had her dog taken from her as she walked it.",
        "background": "Dogs being stolen in the UK is now an epidemic.\r\nDogs are not just property, they are members of the family.  The agony caused to both family and dog is unbearable.\r\nPresently, the theft of a dog is reported as Theft of Property. \r\nLet\u2019s change to a more serious offence with a stiffer sentence.",
