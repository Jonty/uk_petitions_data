        "additional_details": "There is no clinical evidence to suggest that singing increases the spread of covid-19. This gagging of the church needs to stop. Worship is an integral part of our services and relationship with God. It is so inconsistent when our pubs, restaurants, exercise classes and gyms do not have this requirement that the church has to wear masks and not sing. Worship is required to allow us to fulfill our duties as a church. It improves mental health as well as our spiritual health and wellbeing.",
        "background": "I want the government to allow churches to be open, with singing and loud music allowed with no requirement for wearing a mask when 2 metre social distancing measures can be adhered too.",
