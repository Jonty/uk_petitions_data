        "additional_details": "Glue traps - also known as 'glue boards' or 'sticky boards' - consist of a sheet of cardboard, plastic or wood coated with non-drying adhesive which are used to trap rodents legally. They cause immense suffering to rats and mice but also to many of our wild animals and birds many of which are protected and vulnerable species. Animals have skin torn off, legs torn off as they struggle to free themselves and endure agonising deaths. There is no place for them in today's Britain!",
        "background": "These inhumane traps cause enormous suffering to any creature that gets caught on one. Slow, painful deaths and terrible injuries await not only rats and mice but wild species like robins, hedgehogs, voles and pets who are caught on them. Please ban these incredibly cruel, indiscriminate traps now.",
