        "additional_details": "The Government must trigger plan B now to introduce vaccine passports to require entry for pubs/restaurants, sporting venues, nightclubs and crowded venues. This will prevent a 4th lockdown thus preventing more harm for businesses and the economy. Unvaccinated people are 63% more likely to spread Covid. It is also vital that masks are made compulsory on public transport and in shops. This is a small ask but must be done to prevent future lockdowns, especially going into winter.",
        "background": "The Government must trigger plan B now to keep Covid infections under control and to prevent a 4th lockdown. Having seen the waves of Covid hitting Countries in Europe, It is highly likely that The UK will see a rise of infections,resulting in stricter restrictions beyond plan B.",
