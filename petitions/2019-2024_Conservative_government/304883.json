        "additional_details": "Universities are making widespread decisions to suspend face-to-face teaching, and moving assessments online. These exams cannot be administered fairly, with some students moving to take advantage when others simply cannot devote the time when caring. Students who are not in their final year of university should be awarded a \"pass\" mark in respect to their previous marks and have the academic year end, allowing students to use time elsewhere in response to COVID-19 nationwide and worldwide.",
        "background": "Where universities have suspended face-to-face teaching, students are already traveling home. It is unfair to attempt to assess non-essential students (not in the final year) when they're out of the country, in self-isolation, or otherwise caring, and these students should be awarded a 'pass' mark.",
