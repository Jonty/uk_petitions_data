However, for subjects such as psychology it is overwhelmingly clear that this is not the case. For reference, in 2019 an A* in A level psychology was 205/288. In 2023 an A* is 219/288 which is around a 4% increase. This will have and has had a ripple effect on many of students grades in a pure attempt to eliminate top grades due to wanting to return to \u201cpre-pandemic levels\u201d.",
