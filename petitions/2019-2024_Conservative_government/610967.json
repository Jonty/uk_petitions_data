If we are going to decrease the shortage of NHS staff not only do nurses need to be paid more, student nurses deserve to be payed to.",
        "background": "We\u2019re often working 37.5+ hours a week to make up the 2300 hours of placement we have to complete to qualify. Though yes we are still learning and being taught how to do things, we\u2019re learning on the job. Just like we would be if we were doing an apprenticeship, yet we are doing this with no pay.",
