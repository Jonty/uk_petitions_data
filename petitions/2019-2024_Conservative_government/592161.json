In England we have been encouraged to get the vaccinations done. I have had both doses done for a couple of months, unfortunately the dose I had injected into me is not accepted for travelling abroad. This is not fair as we do not pick what vaccination we get injected with. Please can someone consider changing the rules and letting us travel.",
