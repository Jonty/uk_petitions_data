        "action": "Ban the use of all inhumane glue traps in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Glue traps are a commonly used, inhumane, and cruel method of repelling insects such as moth and flies. Tree glue traps, pheromone traps, and fly strips are just a few of these abominable methods of repelling insects, and all cause long, slow deaths for the poor creatures that succumb to them. The traps are also reducing biodiversity within our natural environments, by removing reliable food sources for creatures like owls, birds and bats.",
        "background": "To prevent the suffering of harmless insects, and to ensure the biodiversity of our natural environments, I am campaigning to ban all glue traps in the UK. These include pheromone traps, wardrobe glue traps (for harmless clothes moths), fly strips and ant traps.",
