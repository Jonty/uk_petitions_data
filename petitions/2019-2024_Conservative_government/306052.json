        "additional_details": "The people of this country are facing an unprecedented challenge, when the banks needed our support in 2008 it was given to them, it is now their turn to help the public cope with this challenge. At a time when the Bank of England's base rate is 0.1% it is inappropriate that such punitive interest rates should be passed on to those who are struggling to make ends meet.",
        "background": "Most banks increased their interest rate charged on overdrafts to 39.9% in February this year. The government should compel banks to reduce these excessive rates during this period of national crisis, closer to 0.1% (The Bank of England base rate) for a period of 6 months.",
