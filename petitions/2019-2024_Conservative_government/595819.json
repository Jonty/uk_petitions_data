No school should be allowed to vaccinate a child under 16 without the consent of the parent.\r\n\r\nChildren have a natural active immune system and scientific studies have already proven children can adapt and evade covid and other strands of SARS without medical intervention. \r\nThe mass evidence showing deaths and adverse reactions can be seen on the government covid yellow card.\r\nLEAVE OUR CHILDREN ALONE!",
        "background": "Schools are scheduling children's covid vaccinations without parental consent. \r\nThe covid vacinne was created in under a year. A vaccine has never been developed this quickly and with no liability. The mumps vaccine was the second fasted vaccine to be rolled out and this took 4 years to develop.",

Those aged between 12 and 16 do also require parental consent but if the consent is not given there is an option for those children to prove what is called \"Gillick Competency\" and receive a vaccine without the consent of their parents. Those between the ages of 16 and 18 don't need parental consent as they are deemed able to consent as per Family Law Reform Act 1969.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about the different levels of consent for vaccinations here:\r\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/138296/dh_103653__1_.pdf\r\nAnd you can read more about the Family Law Reform Act 1969 here:\r\nhttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1969/46\r\n\r\nYou may wish to sign this petition calling for a similar action:\r\n\r\nDo not vaccinate children against COVID-19 until Phase 3 trials are complete\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/586017"
