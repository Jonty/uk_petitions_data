        "additional_details": "So far we have taken away their education, friends, family, birthday parties, and now they cannot even sing at school. Evidence suggests children under 11 do not spread the virus, and it\u2019s extremely rare for them to be adversely affected. So why are we stopping children singing at school?",
        "background": "It\u2019s a sad state of affairs when your 7 & 4 year olds are told they are not allowed to sing at school! Today I have discovered that has happened. After speaking to a number of parents, it seems to be something affecting many schools due to the interpretation of government guidance around singing.",
