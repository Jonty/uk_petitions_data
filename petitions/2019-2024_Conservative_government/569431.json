        "additional_details": "The unlawful prorogation of Parliament in 2019 showed us that our constitutional rights in this country are open to multiple interpretations and are only protected by the legal interpretations of a small elite. We are one of very few states in the world that has no written constitution and instead we rely on an outdated system of legal interpretation and constitutional convention that is insufficient in our modern world. It is time for a written constitution that will protect the rights of all.",
        "background": "Our outdated constitutional system is no longer fit for purpose. We need a public and parliamentary debate to establish a written constitution to protect the rights of the people and prevent the further erosion of public confidence in our system of government.",
