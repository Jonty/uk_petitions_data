        "action": "Make teaching BSL mandatory in the UK, between the ages of 5-18.",
        "additional_details": "11-12 million people in the UK are deaf or hard of hearing, and there are approx  150,000 BSL users. It has been proven that there is a link between deafness and poor mental health, due to lifelong experiences related to social exclusion and isolation. It\u2019s important to create a knowledgable and inclusive society, that accommodates the deaf community. This can be achieved by teaching BSL in the UK which would create more opportunities for deaf people in society, including employment prospects.",
        "background": "British Sign Language (BSL) should be included within the National Curriculum from Early Years to Further Education in the UK. Deaf people face obstacles in many aspects of a hearing society, due to communication barriers and discrimination. Teaching BSL to hearing people can alleviate some issues.",
