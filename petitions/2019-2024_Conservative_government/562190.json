The intrusive tests are considered a violation of human rights by the WHO and United Nations. They involve a vaginal examination to check if the hymen is intact, and are unscientific, and cannot prove whether someone is a virgin. Women can be subject to honour-based abuse, disownment, and / or forced marriage. This happens to girls of an extremely young age, on UK soil.",
