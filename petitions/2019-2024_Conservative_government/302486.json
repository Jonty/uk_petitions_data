        "additional_details": "Limiting the amount of essential items being sold per customer will prevent babies, the old & the disabled from struggling to get essential items. It would mean that everyone would be aware that this behaviour is unacceptable & leads to widespread concern & a \u2018snowball\u2019 effect where everyone behaves selfishly. Babies should not be going without milk, the elderly should not have to walk to multiple shops to find what they need. Stockpiling is antisocial and should be made more difficult.",
        "background": "During times of crisis, like the spread of COVID 19, \u2018panic buying\u2019 causes widespread alarm & difficulties for the old, young & less mobile. Retailers should be legally compelled to limit shoppers from buying unreasonable multiples of essential items, such as hygiene items, formula milk & medicines.",
