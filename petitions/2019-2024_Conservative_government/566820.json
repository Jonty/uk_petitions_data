        "additional_details": "Many students are already under great stress and their mental health is rapidly declining, stuck in small rooms often without light, or some stuck at home without the correct resources to complete exams. Creatives are asked to perform over zoom, and placements have been cancelled. This isn\u2019t fair. We want extensions to make our exams worthwhile and to perform to the best of our ability for our moneys worth",
