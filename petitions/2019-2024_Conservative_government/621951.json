However, we're not exactly sure how you'd want a cap on profits to work, or what that cap should be. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining what you'd like to happen. For example, you could start a petition asking the UK Government to increase its current energy profits tax to a certain level, if that's something that you'd like to see.\r\n\r\nYou may also wish to sign this petition calling for energy companies to be nationalised: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/621719 or this petition calling for a not-for-profit state owned energy provider to be created: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/617446\r\n\r\nYou may be interested to know that the current energy price cap sets a maximum that suppliers can charge per unit of energy, and caps the level of profits an energy supplier can make to 1.9%.
