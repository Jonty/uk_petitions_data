As we are set to leave the EU, on 1st January 2021, it is essential that the NHS receives the money that would have otherwise been paid to the EU. \r\n\r\nThis promise should be made into law to ensure that the NHS receives this cash injection as soon as possible.",
        "background": "I want MPs to debate and discuss how best to ensure that the NHS receives the \u00a3350 Million pounds a week that was promised as a result of leaving the European Union.",
