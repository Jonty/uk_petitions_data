        "additional_details": "My choir's committee has been planning Covid safe rehearsals for several months, complying with the guidelines set out for all other performing arts. Every detail has been considered, and every possible measure taken to ensure the safety of all involved. I strongly believe that Covid safe choral singing can happen indoors, and that singers should be allowed the opportunity to return to their art in line with the performing arts guidelines afforded to all other amateur artists.",
        "background": "Choral singing has a huge impact on my mental wellbeing. As part of Step 3, I, like many others, was looking forward to a return to choir, only to find from guidance issued on 18th May that 'non-professional singing indoors should only take place in a single group of up to 6 people'.",
