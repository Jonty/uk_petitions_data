        "additional_details": "For 50 years, UK Homecare businesses have faced an unfair VAT challenge, unable to charge VAT yet forced to pay it to suppliers. \r\n\r\nOriginating from our EU membership, this policy costs the sector \u00a3600 million annually, threatening many firms operating on slim margins. \r\n\r\nThis isn't just business; it's about vulnerable individuals' care. \r\n\r\nWith the UK free from EU rules, it's time to address this VAT inequality, ensuring sustainable Homecare services for those most in need.",
        "background": "1. Reevaluate the long-standing VAT policy impacting Homecare and Domiciliary Care businesses.\r\n2. Take decisive action by:\r\n   a. Exempting these businesses from VAT payments to suppliers or \r\n   b. Allowing them to reclaim the VAT they've disbursed, aligning with the practices of other industries.",
