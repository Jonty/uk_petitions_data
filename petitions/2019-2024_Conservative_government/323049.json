Specifically, members of the public who suffer from debilitating illnesses such as Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. At this time, they are either confined to their houses, or suffering great fear when they do venture out for work or exercise. This could be having a detrimental effect on mental health. In normal times it is a lot to deal with. With this current pandemic it's so much worse. The usual places they know they can go are not an option. Supermarkets have long queues and cafes are closed. Please consider this important matter.",
