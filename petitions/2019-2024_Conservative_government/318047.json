        "additional_details": "We feel that is morally irresponsible to assist businesses that have purposely avoided paying their fair share in UK tax. If the UK financially assists companies registered abroad for tax avoidance purposes, then these companies must be forced to pay their tax in the UK and this should be backdated to the time of registration. It would be highly unfair to put a financial burden of this nature on the UK taxpayer.",
        "background": "We want the UK government to categorically promise that no firm that has registered offshore for the purpose of avoiding or lowering its tax responsibility will benefit from any government assistance for losses incurred due to the Covid-19 epidemic when this assistance is funded by the UK taxpayer.",
