        "additional_details": "Pupils must be treated fairly and inline with the government's position to cancel Exams, having pupil's evaluated the same way as the cancelled GCSE's. The government is working with Ofqual (who controls GCSE's but not IGCSE's). IGCSE boards have released statements stating their plans to continue with exams. This is causing unwanted ambiguity for students in a turbulent time. If this continues this will cause a grade disparity between GCSE's teacher assessed results and the IGCSE exam results.",
        "background": "We want to see a statement by Gavin Williamson (The current Secretary of State for Education) stating whether IGCSE will happen this summer and if they do, why are Year 11 students taking IGCSE's being treated differently to other students this year taking GCSE's and also last years students.",
