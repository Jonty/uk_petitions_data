        "additional_details": "People who need to self isolate who have SSP rather than company sick pay are likely to be in low paid work without savings to act as a \u2018buffer\u2019. Increasing SSP would mean people who are symptomatic would be more likely to follow advice because they could afford to still pay rent/bills/buy medication etc. The money would go back into the economy and would prevent hardship at a time of crisis.",
