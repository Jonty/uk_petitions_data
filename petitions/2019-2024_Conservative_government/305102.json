        "action": "Regulate the food supply and make 'profiteering in a pandemic' a criminal act.",
        "additional_details": "A consistent food supply is the best way to reduce panic & save lives. Most panic buying is by frightened people, who make selfish choices. Yet a subset are profiteering by hoarding essential items, before selling at inflated prices. Undernourished people have weak immune systems; a good diet will help reduce the numbers succumbing to Covid-19. Some supermarkets have voluntary restrictions in place: at a time of pandemic it is lamentable that this policy is not being led by Government.",
        "background": "1) An emergency policy to regulate the supply of food and other essentials, based on both need and the actual capacity of the supply chain. 2) Recognising 'profiteering in a pandemic' as a serious criminal offence with fines proportionate to its heinous nature, with an accessible means of reporting.",
