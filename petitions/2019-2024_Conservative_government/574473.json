        "action": "Allow Learner drivers to continue with lessons during lockdown",
        "additional_details": "For weeks many have had their driving lessons and tests cancelled and subsequently many have forgotten what they have learned which means starting over and paying more. To add to insult, transport minister stated \u2018those whose certificates have reached their two-year expiry date will have to pay a further \u00a323 to do it again\u2019. This is not good enough, learner drivers may need to learn for a new job they are applying to or to carry out caring duties. They can go ahead with the right measures in place",
        "background": "During Lockdown the Government has shown no compassion or understanding towards hopeful learner drivers who were taking driving lessons to broaden their opportunities. Why is this important? Students need to reinforce their theory with practice behind the wheel - it is as a simple as that.",
