        "action": "Completely Scrap the proposal of schools annually weighing pupils",
        "additional_details": "I want the government to do something about it as there are many risks and dangers to making children constantly be weighed at a school where they go to feel comfortable and be educated not to be weighed and told that they\u2019re too skinny or too fat. This whole proposal could be so damaging to a child\u2019s mental state. The NHS suggest that you are more likely to get an eating disorder if \u201c you have been criticised for your eating habits, body shape or weight\u201d which the proposal will put on children.",
        "background": "The whole idea of weighing children needs to completely be scrapped and the The National Obesity Forum need to propose a new idea which isn\u2019t going to be damaging to any children. If this idea isn\u2019t scrapped then this could lead to a rise in eating disorders in children and teens.",
