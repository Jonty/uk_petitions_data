        "additional_details": "The islands are very safe to travel into as they have relatively few cases of Covid-19, not like Mainland Spain. \r\nHolidaymakers returning from the islands have expressed that they felt safer during their stay on the islands than at home in the UK. Everybody is adhering to the rules of social distancing and mask-wearing.\r\nMany families booked their holidays without accounting for the 14-day quarantine, such as mine and now will either have to cancel the holiday, which some people have saved up all year for and lose approximately \u00a3300 deposit or agree to 14 days unpaid leave from work which for some could be around \u00a3700. It is unfair to limit holidaymakers from travelling to safe islands when they have worked hard to save and need to relax after an awful and unprecedented 2020.",
        "background": "Please reconsider the 14-day quarantine from the Balearic and Canary Islands. I am currently in Gran Canaria on holiday with my family. Gran Canaria is closer to Africa, and Spain is closer to Aberdeen than Gran Canaria is to Spain, so it is unfair to quarantine us when we get home as it is safe.",
