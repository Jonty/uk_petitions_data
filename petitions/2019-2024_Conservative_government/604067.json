        "additional_details": "Each year, millions of sentient birds are blasted out of the sky by the minority who enjoy shooting them for \u201csport\u201d. Out of the 67.22 million people in the UK, only over one million people shoot game birds.\r\n Shooting does create jobs for people, but just because something creates jobs doesn\u2019t necessarily make it moral. Also, if game bird shooting was banned, some of its participants may turn to clay pigeon shooting and other alternatives, perhaps, boosting employment in those industries.",
        "background": "57 million game birds are released to be shot in the UK each year. Some of these birds are cruelly reared in cages. Many of these birds are thrown on heaps; shot for sick \u201csport\u201d and then thrown away. Vital birds of prey are persecuted and killed by those who enjoy this sick bloodsport.",
