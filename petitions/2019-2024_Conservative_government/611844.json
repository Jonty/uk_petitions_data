Everyday\u2019s delay because of this system, is causing untold stress & anxiety for people who are traumatized. \r\n\r\nMany children will not have passports & must be allowed to travel with parents without the need to get one pre-travel, Visa offices are overwhelmed already . This would relieve this pressure & stop people having to travel long distances to acquire one. We need a timescale to manage expectation.",

You could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nWaive visa requirement for Ukrainian refugees: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/609530"
