        "additional_details": "We, students, aim to make the most out of our degree. However it is becoming unendurable to produce quality work under the stress, anxiety, and uncertainty imposed by the pandemic. We are seeing more young adults building an unhealthy relationship with drugs and alcohol in order to cope. Our mental health is greatly affected and have seen deaths due to the lack of support. This begs the question whether if we push through, will our grades be reflective of our capabilities or worth losing lives?",
        "background": "We would want the government to consider the detrimental effect of this pandemic on our future as it is affecting us, both academically and mentally. Postponing University seems fair for us who are expecting quality teaching and with the hope of producing work we are truly capable of.",
