        "action": "Remove Electricity/Utility Company Standing Charges",
        "additional_details": "With the current UK housing stock at around 24 million dwellings, this means that Utility/ Electricity firms are due to earn over four billion pounds. An outrageous amount of money. \u00a3163 could help feed or heat thousands of the poorer families across the UK. For myself this constitutes at least a month's electricity and part towards our food bill. This would constitute a far better system of cutting the cost of heating and eating rather than the \u00a3200 proposed by the Gov. Which requires payback.",
        "background": "Why do Electricity/Utility Companies have a daily standing charge? The Government needs to look at this in depth, the standing charge is soon rising, from 24.88p to approx 45p. A cost of \u00a3163 per annum without using any energy. This really needs to be scrapped for all.",
