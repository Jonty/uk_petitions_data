        "action": "Pay teachers in England for marking assessments & providing evidence for grades",
        "additional_details": "This means that most teachers with GCSE & A-level students who were due to sit external exams this summer, have had to gather evidence to substantiate the grades they will award to students. It has been left entirely up to schools & teachers to decide what material they should use to assess their students. It has thus been down to teachers to mark the additional assessments resulting in a huge increase in workload. Teachers should be paid for this increase.",
        "background": "Teachers should quite simply be remunerated for the extra hours worked to provide evidence for grades. The huge burden of providing centre assessed grades has been placed on schools again this year, the difference this time around is that teachers have to provide the evidence for those grades.",
