        "action": "Ban all alcohol advertising in the UK, including corporate sponsorship.",
        "additional_details": "In 2020, there were 8,974 alcohol-specific deaths in the UK , according to the Office for National Statistics. Alcohol consumption also has further far-reaching consequences for our society, including a huge effect on violent crime, road-traffic accidents, mental health and youth influence. This petition further argues that the revenue generated by tax-duty on the sale of alcohol is offset by the estimated costs of alcohol abuse on UK society. All these claims are backed up by official research.",
        "background": "Ban all alcohol advertising, including corporate sponsorship. Research shows that advertising restrictions do not prevent exposure to harmful messages, especially among young people. The cost of alcohol abuse on society far outweighs the income generated by tax duty.",
