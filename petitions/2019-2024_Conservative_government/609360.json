Mothers get:\r\n\r\n- 90% of their average weekly earnings (before tax) for the first 6 weeks\r\n- \u00a3151.97 or 90% of your average weekly earnings (whichever is lower) for the next 33 weeks\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for changes to these rules, but you would need to be clear what you wanted the new entitlements to be.\r\n\r\nYour petition refers to people getting full pay for six months when they off sick, but people are only entitled to \u00a396.35 per week Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) if they're too ill to work. This is paid for up to 28 weeks. Workers may be entitled to more maternity pay or sick pay in their contract."
