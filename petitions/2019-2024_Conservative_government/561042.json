        "additional_details": "Statistics show that 6% of the UK is made up of people who are LGBT and the National LGBT Survey concludes that 2% of individuals have undergone conversion therapy in order to 'cure' them and 5% have been offered it.  This should not be the case.",
        "background": "Even though it is condemned, conversion therapy is still legal in the UK which puts many individuals at risk of being exposed to psychological and emotional abuse. Conversion therapy needs to be made illegal so LGBT members do not experience this.",
