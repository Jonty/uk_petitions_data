        "action": "Remove gendered terminology from rape laws.",
        "additional_details": "Firstly this current law is very sexist. Furthering the idea that women are weak and men are always strong. As it currently stands, it is  'embarrassing' to be raped by a female, especially for males, And this change in law would allow for there to be less negative stigma around the subject, As well as holding female perpetrators accountable. As we progress into more gender equality - it is only right that a male and female committing the same crime should receive the same punishment.",
        "background": "The goal of this is to have the rape laws in the UK changed, As it currently stands, only a male can rape someone. The new law would be less gender specific meaning that females can also be held accountable for rape - as oppose for being charged for a more minor crime.",
