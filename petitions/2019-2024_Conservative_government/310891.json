        "additional_details": "NHS and essential workers are front line troops in the war against Coronavirus. They are risking their health and lives and those of their families to protect public health and keep the country running. Their efforts are way beyond the reasonable expectations of their employment contracts. Many are suffering abuse and many lack the time the rest of us have to respond to the crisis. It would be inequitable to expect such huge sacrifice from our key workers without reward and recognition. That\u2019s why the nation should send a big thank you to our key workers in the form of a big bonus. Such a measure would boost the morale of our key workers and put our money where our mouth is to show how much we appreciate their sacrifice.",

This payment would be a thank you from the nation for risking their lives to Coronavirus, in short a danger money payment for working beyond the call of duty. Payment to be made on 1 December 2020.",
