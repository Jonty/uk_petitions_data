        "additional_details": "Communities for individual neurodivergences are full of advice for people to get a formal diagnosis for various reasons; for their own understanding, to aid how they navigate work and education, and as a means of accessing support and legal protection are just some. \r\n\r\nUnfortunatley, much of this is qualified by the fact getting diagnosis can take years, even though the process can be very simple. Legislative action would address this problem.",
        "background": "The Government should guarantee that diagnosis of a neurodivergence is done within 2 months of a GP referal. This is to ensure that people can avoid misdiganosis through self-assessment, be sure what condition they have to manage, and can simply begin to access treatment in a reasonable timeframe.",
