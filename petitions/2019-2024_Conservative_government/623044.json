        "additional_details": "Government should end food and drink subsidies because taxpayer money should not be used to subsidize MPs' salaries, expenses, and subsidies on top.\r\n\r\nIf not to buy their own meals, or drink alcohol (at work curiously), what is their salary meant for exactly?\r\n\r\nMost UK citizens do not have the luxury of a salary and expenses, let alone have other people pay for their basic needs. That is the purpose of a salary.\r\n\r\nIt's disrespectful to taxpayers.",
        "background": "MPs earn approximately 4x the UK Minimum wage, plus expenses (for travel, staffing, and a 2nd home - the latter already a questionable concept).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, MPs receive subsidies for food and drink in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Government should stop these entirely.",
