In addition this costs the economy billions each year. This would offset any cost of implementation. In 2020/21 stress, depression or anxiety accounted for 50% of all work-related ill health cases (source: Health and Safety Executive). Evidenced by the prevalence of these issues, there must be improvement in the legal framework and support available to employers.",
        "background": "The duty on employers to manage employee mental health and wellbeing at work falls under the Health and Safety at Work Act. Introduce secondary supporting regulation and detailed guidance that sets out the framework, expectation and detail of how this is best achieved.",
