        "additional_details": "A large section of the British public embrace the British Bank Holidays to enjoy UK music events and nightlife. Equally, the nightlife and events sector of the UK is heavily dependent on the extra income generated by Bank Holiday weekends.  \r\n\r\nUsing up Bank Holidays when the nightlife sector is closed seems like a terrible waste of rare and precious public holidays, depriving millions of people their usual enjoyment & would be better used as a celebration that the nightlife sector has re-opened.",
        "background": "Postpone any Bank Holidays scheduled in 2020 whilst the nightlife sector of Britain is closed in the fight against Covid-19, and reschedule them for within 10 weeks immediately after the nightlife sector reopens, whenever that may be.",
