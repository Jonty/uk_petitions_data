        "additional_details": "Medical advice at the moment states that vaping is less harmful than smoking, which obviously means it's still harmful. So why should people who are non vapers or e-cigarette users be subjected to the residual vapours that are blown into the air when inside a building.\r\nPassive smoking was the driver behind banning smoking inside and should also drive this ban to. \r\nThere is an increase in the number of adults and youngsters who vape but never smoked. Are we trading 1 dangerous habit for another?",
        "background": "To ban the use of vape and e-cigarette devices in line with smoking.\r\nVaping especially can be very intrusive with some devices designed specifically to emit large clouds of vapour and often accompanied with various scents which is not good for people with asthma and other similar conditions.",
