        "additional_details": "Businesses operating out of industrial units that wouldn't be classed as retail, leisure or hospitality are also suffering yet being excluded from rate relief and forced to take out loans that will be interest chargeable after 6 months. We feel it should be a level playing field for all businesses. This will enable the back bone of Britain to continue building, manufacturing, paying tax and employing. Not all small businesses benefit from rate relief so dont get the grant nor any rate saving.",
        "background": "Business rate relief should be rolled out to all sectors during COVID-19 outbreak.\r\n\r\nAll businesses are in the same boat and should get equal support - big or small. Currently the small to medium size businesses are being ignored. Only the smallest and the biggest are being helped.",
