        "additional_details": "The UK has left the EU and needs to be accepted. But this is not a time for ideology or filibusting to prove a point. This is not a time for petty politics or point scoring. Business, society and people's lives are at stake. An extension to the transition period would be a political win, not a loss. Over 50% of the British public, in a survey held merely days ago, support this. Listen to the electorate and make a wise choice based on logic but also compassion. History will judge you on this.",
        "background": "The UK economy is on its knees, with the worst indices for 300 years. The COVID19 pandemic is far from over and it is likely a second wave will hit the UK in Autumn. Now, more than ever, Europe and the UK need to join forces, put political differences aside and focus on health and the economy.",
