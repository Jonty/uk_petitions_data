        "additional_details": "The current testing requirements disproportionately affect all nationals who wish to travel to the UK from China, particularly those who are studying, working or doing business here. This is especially against the backdrop that our allies, including the U.S., EU and Japan, have scrapped, or plan to scrap such an unnecessary requirement in the coming days.\r\nScrapping this unfair requirement will send a positive message to the Chinese community here that we value their contributions to our nation!",
        "background": "This pre-departure testing requirement unfairly discriminates against passengers from China, while ignoring the fact that there is no scientific proof that passengers travelling from China impose a higher risk in the transmission of Covid-19 than passengers from other countries in the world.",
