        "additional_details": "Do not punish the breed and the competent owners who love and cherish these animals. Any dog that isn't socialised correctly, taught basic obedience and how to react and behave in buplic can be unstable, fearful, anxious and aggressive, not just bully's. I want the government to prosecute irresponsible owners instead. I could take a German shepherd or a chihuahua and if treated like these owners treat their bully's it would turn out the same that doesn't mean they should be banned and persecuted.",
        "background": "It's the kind of people that want to own these dogs that creates the problem. They were bred to be a family companion breed and nothing else. It's irresponsible, uneducated owners that do not socialise these dogs that creates an unstable animal. It's not the breed it's the owners fault.",
