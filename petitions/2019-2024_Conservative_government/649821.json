        "additional_details": "I have recently been looking into insurance prices on cars and motobikes for when I turn 17 however I feel that the cost of insurance for both is absolutely despicable and I am expected to pay \u00a31900 on insurance to not be able to get legal protection and that is on a motobike on cars the cost is anywhere from \u00a32.5k-\u00a34K with a black box I feel as though this needs to be thoroughly assessed and fixed as young people are being forced to use public transport instead of having their own freedom",
        "background": "Something needs doing about insurance prices ,many 17 year olds and older are expected to pay \u00a32500+ this aswell as the cost of a car can push well over \u00a35-6k aswell as paying for lessons and other costs is impossible for someone on low income",
