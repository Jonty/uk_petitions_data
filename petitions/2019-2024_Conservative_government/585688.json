        "additional_details": "The UK has now left the EU, the British people has made it clear that EU and non-EU citizens living in the England should be treated equally. Yet, EU citizens were able to vote in the recent local election, but not non-EU citizens. This is inherently discriminatory. Issues in local elections affect non-EU citizens living in England as well. Many pay taxes and contribute to the economy, but receives no representation. Also, non-EU citizens cannot register to vote in any election thus affecting credit scores.",
        "background": "Currently, EU citizens can vote in local, mayoral and police and crime commissioner elections. However, Brexit has happened. The Government should grant the same right to all non-EU citizens living in England, not just Commonwealth citizens. Election issues affect everyone.",
