        "additional_details": "We feel that Boris Johnson has consistently failed to protect the British public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and will continue to do so unless public pressure forces parliament to hold him accountable. We feel that thousands of people have died unnecessarily as a consequence of his inaction and ineptitude. An unfettered assessment of the failings which brought us here is urgently required. We feel let down and unsafe, and we want this to be recognised in parliament.",
        "background": "In our opinion the government has failed spectacularly in its primary responsibility to protect lives. We feel that the decisions made by the government since January require urgent investigation, and we would like our concerns voiced in parliament.",
