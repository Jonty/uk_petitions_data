        "action": "Make it law that all food is only sold in compostable or recyclable packaging",
        "additional_details": "Because you make the law and a law is what is needed! My mum spends time carefully selecting our food from many different, often small and clever businesses, and is able to buy almost everything in compostable or recyclable packaging. Right down to crisps and sweets! This is not possible in the supermarkets, people don\u2019t stay up at night like my mum does trying her best to find better alternatives.  They say they are too busy or have other problems of their own, this is everyone\u2019s problem.",
        "background": "People believe their own issues are greater than those of the world around them and do not make conscious decisions when they buy their food and household products. Why should it even be a conscious decision? How can manufacturers and retailers be able to sell packaging that destroys our planet?",
