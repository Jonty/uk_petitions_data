        "additional_details": "As soon as the schools have reopened in the beginning of September, there have been immediate cases of students and teachers contracting the coronavirus. This has not helped in any way to reduce the cases of COVID. If the 6 people rule applies to everyone that goes out, then shouldn't it apply to students also? Students are people and are definitely surrounded by more than 6 individuals, so this is contradicting the rule of 6. How is this helping?",
        "background": "Shutting down schools will reduce cases of COVID. It is still important to continue with their education. Therefore, children should attend online classes instead. There are apps like 'Zoom' to help. If not, then they can be sent folders of work in order to stay at home.",
