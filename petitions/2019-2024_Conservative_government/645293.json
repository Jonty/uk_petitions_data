I believe you should be able to own and insure a Car at 17 to make our travelling to places of education a lot easier and I think people will agree.",
        "background": "I believe 17 year olds are mature enough to drive.Me being 17 i am mature enough to be driving on the road. It would make getting to college a lot easier for college students around the United Kingdom. Seen a petition to change it to 15 and I think that is just insane. 15 is too low. 17 is better",
