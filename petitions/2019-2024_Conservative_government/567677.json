Schools are closed but we are open at full capacity, we are told to have limited contact with others yet we are expected to have contact with a minimum of 20 different families in the baby room alone. Now add all the other families coming in and out of the nursery. All that with no protection. Why? Because we are passionate, Selfless.",

Nurseries are being kept open to full capacity in the new lockdown whilst everything else, including schools are closed. Yet we are expected to work as normal with minimum protection.
