However it is compulsory to learn about this in teaching and a classroom can end up being a hostile environment. Children with these conditions who fail in school end up costing the state in terms of social care and a higher increase in criminality etc. Also If teachers were trained then they could identify the conditions earlier allowing for earlier support and success",
