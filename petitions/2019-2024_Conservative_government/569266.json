        "additional_details": "When the UK promised to back the ban, Michael Gove, then the environment secretary, said: \u201cThe weight of evidence now shows the risks neonicotinoids pose to our environment, particularly to the bees and other pollinators which play such a key part in our \u00a3100bn food industry, is greater than previously understood...Unless the evidence base changes again, the government will keep these restrictions in place after we have left the EU.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe evidence base has not changed, retain the ban.",
        "background": "Bees are essential to the world\u2019s ecosystems. We need bees to fertilise many of our crops. However, they are under pressure around the world from habitat loss and pesticide use. \r\n\r\nA pesticide believed to kill bees has been authorised for use in England despite an EU-wide ban two years ago.",
