        "additional_details": "I urge the government to make it a legal requirement for private health insurers to cover pre-existing & genetic illnesses as the vulnerable would rather pay a fee each month for help they need than try to find thousands of pounds just for the answers & help they need by drs who understand their conditions. Having illness & disabilities takes away so much from people already they shouldn\u2019t be left to suffer alone but be treated equally as their lives matter just as much as anyone else\u2019s.",
        "background": "The chronically ill & disabled make up a large portion of the country & most were born with conditions that as they grow can get worse or cause comorbidities with. However, most of the specialist drs for many conditions are based in the private health setting so they can\u2019t get access to basic needs",
