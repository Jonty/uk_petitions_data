        "additional_details": "We want parliament, the government and the exams regulator, Ofqual, to review and change the way exams are to be sat for 2021.\r\nThe decisions that have been made are poor for our mental health and the time it is going to take to review content learned over the 6 month lockdown and new content for our final year.\r\nIt appears that the government have not benefited us by any of there decisions so far, but has ensured that Year 10 (September - Year 11) have a smaller curriculum in content heavy areas.",
        "background": "Current Year 12 students are to be in there final year of education when they return in September. \r\nWhen we go to sit our exams in the newly proposed exam season of June/July, we are still expected to have been taught all the content and sit the exam with 6 months of knowledge possibly having gaps.",
