We have not heard of the 40 new hospitals after Brexit. Atleast can we build one new hospital and name it after him? This will be the least that the nation can do to recognise him.",
        "background": "Captain Tom Moore has become a Hero and Legend in his activism to donate money to the NHS. At the age of 100, he is inspiring millions to donate millions! He deserves to be recognised nationally forever. Please build a new hospital with the money he donates and name the hospital after him.",
