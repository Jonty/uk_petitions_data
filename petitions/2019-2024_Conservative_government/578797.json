        "additional_details": "To know that a senior member of the royal family was allegedly worried about how dark the skin tone of Archie would be and to deny Archie with the title \u2018Prince\u2019 because of their race is racist. Additionally, with Prince Andrew's terrible accusations and past history and the establishment's failure to provide Meghan with the help she sought and needed, it is clear the royal family is not fit for purpose. If the royal family can't serve their own family, how can they serve the United Kingdom?",

We the people, should have the chance to vote whether the United Kingdom should continue as a constitutional monarchy.",
