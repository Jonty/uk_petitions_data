        "action": "Stop the merger between the FCO and DfID.",
        "additional_details": "At a time when  Covid-19 threatens to push 71,000,000 people into extreme poverty this government has abandoned its commitment to help the world\u2019s poorest. This merger will undermine years of hard -won gains in child survival, equality, female empowerment, literacy and poverty across the world. By returning us to the dark days of tied aid, there will be a completely avoidable rise in death and suffering across the developing world. This is a humanitarian crisis in the making and must be stopped.",
        "background": "Parliament must hold this government to account over this ill-informed decision to jeopardise the UK\u2019s world-leading humanitarian work. The merger must be reversed and the government should take additional steps to ensure development aims are further enshrined in the government's agenda.",
