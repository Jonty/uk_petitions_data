It's not clear if you want the Government to make free school meals available to all school students, or change the rules about the type of food schools are required to provide.\r\n\r\nThe Government produces the school food standards that apply to all maintained schools, and academies that were founded before 2010 and after June 2014. You can read these here: https://www.gov.uk/school-meals-healthy-eating-standards\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. If you start a new petition you'd need to provide your full name."
