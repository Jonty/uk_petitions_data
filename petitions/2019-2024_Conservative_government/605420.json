        "additional_details": "Once upon a time, the UK could set its own VAT on certain things, and energy bills didn\u2019t have a huge VAT bill added to them, but then the EU insisted we should all be charged the same VAT rate on fuel bills all over The EU state.\r\nDuring the Brexit campaign, the Prime Minister pointed out that this is one of the things our government could change when we left the EU.\r\nSo now energy prices are spiralling out of control and every day families are suffering with all sorts of other tax rises, this could help with the burden of paying the bills.",
        "background": "With energy bills now spiralling out of control, we need the government to scrap VAT on energy bills .",
