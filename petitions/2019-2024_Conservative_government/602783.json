        "action": "Remove new ruling that restricts Drug Users to their right of freedom.",
        "additional_details": "Removing UK passports, enforcing night curfews and travel bans impact people lives negatively and will lead to more problems then solved. For example, medicinal marijuana users who use drugs to help anxiety, chronic pain and insomnia are now punished for treating themselves. By taking their UK Passport, you stop them from seeing family abroad whilst legal alternatives such as prescription medication with mental health side effects and alcohol which is linked to deaths and violence is deemed safe",
        "background": "People should have say whether Drug Users should be stripped of their freedom rather than be forced into rulings that have not been voted for. This is a democracy not a dictatorship. Before any laws are imposed the people should always have the ability to vote as MPs do not represent the population.",

It's not clear if you want there to be a referendum on certain proposals, or for these just not to be introduced.\r\n\r\nThe Government's plan states that a White Paper next year will consider a series of escalating sanctions such as curfews or the temporary removal of a passport or driving licence, and increased fines. These measures have not yet been introduced.\r\n\r\nYou can read the Government's 10-year drugs plan here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/from-harm-to-hope-a-10-year-drugs-plan-to-cut-crime-and-save-lives/from-harm-to-hope-a-10-year-drugs-plan-to-cut-crime-and-save-lives\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
