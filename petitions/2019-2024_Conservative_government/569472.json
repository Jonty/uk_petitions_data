        "additional_details": "To have private school students taking iGCSE's is unfair, as we will have iGCSE results compared to everyone else's predicted grades, which is inconsistent, and therefore creates disadvantage for both those taking iGCSE and those not. Furthermore, the uncertainty of when the current lockdown is going to end means it's likely these exams will be cancelled anyway, meaning a certain cancellation of these exams will encourage consistency and reduce anxiety among private school students at this time.",
        "background": "While GCSE's and A levels have been cancelled in the UK, iGCSE's, predominantly taken in private schools, are still theoretically going ahead. I call for the cancellation of iGCSE's for a more consistent and universal approach to this year's exams.",
