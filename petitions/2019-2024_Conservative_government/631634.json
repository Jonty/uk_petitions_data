        "action": "Make non-binary a legally recognised gender identity in the UK",
        "additional_details": "There is no option of \u2018Non-binary\u2019 on legal forms, ignoring members of the population. This requires the government to pass a law that publicly recognises \u2018Non-binary\u2019 as a part of the GRP under the Gender Recognition Act, a.k.a a legal and valid gender identity option. By recognising Non-binary as a valid gender identity, it would aid in the protection of Non-binary individuals against transphobic hate crimes, and would ease Gender Dysphoria experienced by Non-binary people.",
        "background": "Have non binary be included as an option under the GRP (Gender Recognition Panel)/ GRC (Gender Recognition Certificate), in order to allow those identifying as non binary to be legally seen as their true gender identity. As well as having \u2018Non-binary\u2019 be seen as a valid transgender identity.",
