        "action": "Support university students who are renting private accommodation",
        "additional_details": "Students feel that they have been largely ignored throughout the pandemic. Private landlords are still entitled to charge full price for rent, despite the universities telling students not to travel back until late April - which means, if Christmas is included, students will have paid for 5 months rent despite not being allowed to move back. Students feel that this is exploitative, and being unfairly charged for circumstances out of their control.",
        "background": "During the pandemic, particularly in the last week, students were told they should avoid travelling back to their universities, whilst still paying full price for their rent. We want the Government to assist privately renting students, whether that be financially or legislatively.",
