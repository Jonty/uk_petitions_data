        "additional_details": "Because there are people with elderly people at home or high risk family members that if we go to school see the 300 in our school year and then end up getting covid we will be bringing that home to them and it could potentially kill them. It needs to be optional for making students go back in the pandemic as its still really bad is corona. By doing this it will help out with more room in schools and less stress on staff. Some students find online learning easier and its much safer at the moment",
        "background": "Make going back to school on the 8th of march optional for people that feel unsafe with the envioroment in schools being so close, people all this time have been trying to be safe with covid not going out and not seeing anyone but now all of a sudden they are meeting up with 300 people in their year",
