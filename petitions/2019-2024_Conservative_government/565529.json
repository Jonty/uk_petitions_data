        "action": "Allow learner drivers theory test leeway",
        "additional_details": "The DVLA have refused theory extensions as well as providing a free retest. I believe that learner drivers in the same predicament should be entitled to at least an extension on their theory test as it is not their fault that their tests have been cancelled. This would provide them enough time with the current situation to complete their driving practical.",
        "background": "Due to lockdown laws, driving instructors have not been permitted to go ahead with lessons or tests. The effect of this has been that so many learners theory tests have ran out or nearly ran out before they've had chance to do a test which they would have been able to do if it wasn't for lockdown.",
