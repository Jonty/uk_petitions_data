        "action": "Introduce flexible working hours to all UK companies stop the daily rush hour",
        "additional_details": "The Government have final say on how these companies operate or guide the companies laws - introducing this to companies will allow CEOs to make an executive decision which is suitable for their company. Also, everyone can be given set work hours, they have to complete weekly but they don\u2019t need to do it within a daily standardised time. Germany is a prime example as their big companies have flexible working hours and their workers have a better work/life balance and perform better at work.",
        "background": "To enforce flexible working hours to all UK companies that require office work, this can be bankers, lawyers, head offices etc. Abolish the standard 9am - 5pm to prevent a second peak of the Coronavirus by minimising the amount people travelling at one time.",
