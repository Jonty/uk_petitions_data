        "additional_details": "Because electric cars take to long to charge but hydrogen fuel cell cars are clean and also take about a minute to fuel up making it superior but there aren\u2019t many so it would be good have lots more.",
        "background": "By 2030 the government has proposed to stop the production of petrol and diesel cars leading the way for cleaner cars. But hydrogen fuel cell cars have barely any fuel pumps making it nearly impossible to go anywhere with one so if more were added it would allow more of these clean cars to be sold.",
