        "additional_details": "Everything has changed since the Coronavirus outbreak. Supply chains, businesses, public services and jobs are threatened by the outcome of the Brexit negotiations at a time when Coronavirus is highlighting why food security and supply chains matter.\r\n\r\nOnce the Covid-19 outbreak has gone, the British people should have the opportunity to think again - via a referendum - on whether they want a hard Brexit which diverges from EU rules or a soft Brexit which keeps frictionless trade with the EU.",
        "background": "Government should suspend Brexit/EU negotiations immediately and request a long extension to focus on combating the risks to citizens, services and businesses of Covid-19.\r\n\r\nGovernment should then consult further with the people on what kind of Brexit is best for Britain via another referendum.",
