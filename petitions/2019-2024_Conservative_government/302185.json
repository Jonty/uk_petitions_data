Take a stand, if people cannot sell these items on there will be much more supply of them which will then allow people who need it more, such as elderly and people with pre exciting illnesses.",
        "background": "I feel that in the current situation and the unknown phases that we will enter shortly, that is is unfair for anyone to be profiting from household essential items. EBAY & AMAZON are allowing products to sell for 300% more than what they normally would. Hand wash, Hand gel, Antibacterial items.",
