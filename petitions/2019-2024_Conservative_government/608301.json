        "action": "Make social class a protected characteristic from discrimination",
        "additional_details": "79% of people, according to a 2021 social mobility commission poll, believe there is a large gap between social classes. The working class occupy only 18% of senior roles. Sometimes pay is less for working class people for equivalent jobs, some professions are virtually off limits to people from working class backgrounds. And only 4% of doctors say they are from working class backgrounds.",
        "background": "The European Convention on Human Rights, in Article 14, contains protections against social class (origin) discrimination. This being mirrored in the 2010 Equality Act would be a recognition of class inequalities, and would legitimise positive action which aimed to reduce social class inequalities.",
