        "additional_details": "please lift this ban and allow us to fish again. it will help to keep us healthy from exercising. it can help with our mental health issues including cabin fever. it can help autistic and depressed people to have some down time. it would allow parents to spend quality time with their children and even teach them to fish etc. the health benefits from fishing are beneficial to us all.",
        "background": "fishing is a sport and a good form of exercise, with minimal travel. it's unfair that we are not allowed to fish, but others can walk round the lakes, rivers and beaches etc. but we cannot sit there quietly and fish. when fishing we are always social distance ourselves from others",
