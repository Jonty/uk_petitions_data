For those of us with pre-existing mental heath problems this pandemic has, for one reason or another, accentuated the struggles we've already been dealing with. We've lost a significant amount of term time, and there are clear discrepancies in the level of education different colleges are able to provide to their students. It would be nothing short of immoral to make us sit our exams like usual.",
