        "additional_details": "There is currently an issue where private hire vehicles operating outside their area cannot be properly checked due to the sheer volume of out of district cars. \r\nLicensed areas do not have the budget because the departments aren't properly funded because they are funded by issuance of license in their district - this budget is hit by private hire vehicles circumventing this by acquiring a license from an alternate area - this is developing into a public safety issue and aids county lines issues.",
        "background": "Include a stipulation within the framework of an issued license, which limits the amount of work received by a private hire vehicle to accepting no more than 20% of its work outside its locally licensed area.",
