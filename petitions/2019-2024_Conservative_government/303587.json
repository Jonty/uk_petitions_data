        "additional_details": "The impact of CoVID-19 is going to be long-lasting and severe for many, particularly those on low incomes, in insecure jobs and those ineligible for SSP. The current advice for many is to apply for Universal Credit, or similar government assistance. This seems unlikely to be feasible, as these assistances are difficult to obtain at the best of times, let alone during a crisis. \r\nThe Government should, therefore instigate a short-term solution of UBI, providing stability and security in crisis.",
        "background": "The Government should provide a payment to each UK adult, in order to support everyone through this time of crisis. Rather than a patchwork approach of Universal Credit, Statutory Sick Pay and other benefits, provide a single payment to everyone.",
