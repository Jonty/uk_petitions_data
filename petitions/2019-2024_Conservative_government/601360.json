        "additional_details": "The government has consistently stated that they want to increase the number of apprenticeships, yet attracting more people to them has proved problematic. The number of people starting an apprenticeship has continued to fall, whilst the apprentice drop-out rate has also remained high. By offering more part-time apprenticeships, we can help to boost social mobility by reaching more people who require flexible working practices such as carers or single parents.",
        "background": "Apprenticeships have given many people a fantastic opportunity to train for a job whilst earning a real wage, yet most are only available full-time. Let\u2019s change this by opening up the opportunity of apprenticeships to more people by providing them on a part-time basis.",
