        "additional_details": "The coronoavirus lockdown has reduced reliance on many industries whose activity is harmful to the climate. \r\n\r\nPeople have made huge changes to their daily lives during lockdown, for instance becoming used to video conferencing. We have learnt it is not always essential to commute to work, or travel to meetings abroad. \r\n\r\nWe would like to see policies encouraging a 'green recovery', with  lasting environmental benefits. Dramatic change is needed, and the country has shown we are capable of it.",
        "background": "The climate is in crisis. While devastating, the covid-19 pandemic has changed public behaviour in ways which have been beneficial to the environment. \r\n\r\nWe would like to see the government use the coronavirus lockdown as a springboard to introduce more climate-positive policies across the board.",
