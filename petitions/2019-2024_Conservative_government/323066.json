They failed, but it appears that the press are now determined to remove Dominic Cummings. This press extension of their news remit is a major concern. It is important that the Government is made aware that there is a solid level of public support for them, in this time of press hostility.",
        "background": "We wish for the Government to resist political pressure from the press in respect of its Agenda. The press are going beyond news and have political objectives, such as sacking Dominic Cummings. This is wrong and we do not want the press to decide policy.",
