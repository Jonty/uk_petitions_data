        "additional_details": "Blue swimwear makes you less visible from the surface when you go under water, making it harder for someone to see you if you get in to trouble and need help.  \r\nThere are countless example videos available online that show how a child can appear totally hidden underwater if they are in blue swimwear yet for boys especially, it is the most common colour of swimwear available.",
        "background": "A ban on blue swimwear for babies and children would help to ensure they were wearing more visible colours when in water, so in the event of  getting in to trouble they could be identified and helped more quickly.",
