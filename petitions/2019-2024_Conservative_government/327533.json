        "additional_details": "UNICEF has declared it the largest humanitarian crisis in the last 100 years. They say that if they don\u2019t receive $30 million by the end of June they will have to stop water and sanitation services to 4 million people in Yemen. The UN has said that 30 of its 41 programmes in the country will close in the next few weeks if they don\u2019t receive funding. Despite all this there is little news coverage and little action taking place. These people NEED US to do what we can so that Yemen survives.",
        "background": "Yemen is fighting a famine, a war, a cholera pandemic, a Covid-19 epidemic, a water shortage and sanitation issues. 80% of their country need humanitarian assistance, that\u2019s 24 million people. 18 million don\u2019t have access to clean water. 2 million are malnourished. A child dies every 10 minutes.",
