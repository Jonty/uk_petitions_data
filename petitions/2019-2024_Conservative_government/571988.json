        "additional_details": "I feel as we are all suffering some restrictions with regards to earnings the expenditure we're all enduring has significantly increased! With our children being home schooled, personally I have 3 extra mouths to feed at lunch time and 3 lots of school supplies to pay out for in order to assist our children as best we can on their educational journey at home. It is an expensive undertaking and is forcing more children closer to the poverty line with regards to their home environment.",
        "background": "I along with many parents would appreciate an increase in child benefit to help with the cost of home schooling during lockdown, this would assist in the payment of schooling supplies such as paper, pencils, printer ink etc. And also extra food which would've been provided to the children by school",
