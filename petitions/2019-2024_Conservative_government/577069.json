This is the day families and friends can reunite after being apart for so long. It would allow for street parties or parties hosted by the hospitality sector which has suffered throughout the pandemic. This would mean a huge collective boost for the nation's morale ajd an economic boost for the hospitality sectors. Followed by a national clap for heroes at 1700.",
