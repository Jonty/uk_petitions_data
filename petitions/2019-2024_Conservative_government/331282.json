        "additional_details": "The government believes that singing in churches is a risk due to the corona virus and had decided that it will be banned and is banned in some places. I strongly passionately believe this is all an act to stop religious practises otherwise Call centres, pubs, clubs and any other place where people gather and socialise for hours would be banned too but that\u2019s not the case, this is what leads me to believe it\u2019s an attack against religious practises, remove the ban we have rights.",
        "background": "To remove the ban of singing in churches, there is no reason for it. I think it\u2019s just a way to shut down people\u2019s religious beliefs and practises and that\u2019s not right at all, how can bars and pubs be allowed but singing in church not? The ban needs removing, it\u2019s unfair, and disrespectful.",
