It\u2019s ridiculous that we have not followed Scotland\u2019s example. It is unjust that we suffer consequences for situations we didn\u2019t choose. It\u2019s not the same as toilet paper or food, bleeding isn\u2019t something the entire population deals with. It\u2019s painful. This doesn\u2019t even begin to cover how common PCOS, Dysmenorrhea and Menorrhagia is. Do better.",
        "background": "One would think we pay for being women enough by the blood we lose out of our control. Menstruation is natural, every woman has to spend thousands in her life time on products men will never have to even think about whilst contraception can be free. Sex isn\u2019t compulsory, we have no choice.",
