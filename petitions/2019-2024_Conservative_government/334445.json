However, they do nothing for the mental health & wellbeing of millions of couples who cannot live together and do not meet the criteria to 'bubble'. Couples keeping to the rules are suffering due to prolonged separation with no acknowledgement and no end date, in a country whose guidance says they may have a beauty treatment, go swimming or board a busy train, but not even hold their partners' hand.",
        "background": "Non-cohabiting couples in England who cannot form a support bubble are currently expected to socially distance from each other indefinitely. Please address this publicly and update the social distancing guidance for partners living in different households with a view to helping them reunite safely.",
