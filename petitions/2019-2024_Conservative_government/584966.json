Make them free for the fully vaccinated adults, and \u00a35 for a once a time test for non vaccinated adults in both green/Amber coming countries",
        "background": "Stop this madness. The travel industry is on its knees. Whilst some European countries are on the green list and others on the Amber we are being forced into a corner to be tested and to pay for expensive tests to return to the uk which are not reliable or affordable.",
