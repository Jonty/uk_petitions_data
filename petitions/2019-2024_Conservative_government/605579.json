        "additional_details": "The Government have designed a ridiculous policy of 'no jab, no job'. How have they got the power to decide what people put into there body. The Government work for the people, the people do not work for them. Stop these ridiculous policies, they do not stop the risk of contracting Covid 19 as 90% of cases lie in the vaccinated. You say your following the scientists, well those scientists are not on the shop floor, seeing patients medical history and the adverse effects this has on them.",
        "background": "Recently a wonderful GP voiced his opinion on the mandatory vaccination to the Health Secretary. He was speaking for the majority of the NHS. Allow all NHS staff to be heard regarding the mandatory vaccine policy 'no jab, no job'. They should not be bullied, threathened or harassed into having it.",
