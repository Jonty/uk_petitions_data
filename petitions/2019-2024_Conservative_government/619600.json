        "additional_details": "The sugar tax that was introduced on soft drinks in 2018 hasn\u2019t worked, it\u2019s just filled up a load of drinks with chemicals, with the cost of living going up as well, the last thing people want is to be going hungry, the government should be helping out, I think everybody is allowed to have what they want in moderation, the laws that are planned in October should be scrapped too, instead of making unhealthy food more expensive, healthy food should be cheaper.",
        "background": "The British Public should be able to eat and drink what they want, let people be in control of what they want instead of the government forcing them to, some people need to have sugary foods and drinks for health reasons, people can be allergic to sweeteners including Stevia.",
