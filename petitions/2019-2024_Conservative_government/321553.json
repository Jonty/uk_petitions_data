        "additional_details": "The future success of each generation rests on the results of these pivotal exams and as parents we are asking for a fair and equal footing for our children. These two student batches have faced the most disruption because routine class room teaching has been severely curtailed for 3-4 months.  The teachers need this extra time to finish the GCSE and A/L syllabuses and we are asking the Government and the DOE to move the exams back to a later date in 2021 to help the teachers complete this task.",
        "background": "The parents of GCSE and A/L students taking exams in April-June 2021 implore the UK Government and DOE to delay the exams to enable the students to catch up on 3-4 months of schooling missed due to COV-19 closures.  Syllabuses must be completed if these children are to have a fair chance at success.",
