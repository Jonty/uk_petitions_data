        "additional_details": "school uniforms are also extremely climate unfriendly. the only time they are good in is in winter when its cold but it doesn't cover the fact they are just too uncomfortable. \r\n\r\nThey also strip students of their identity and doesn't allow students to truly express how they want to look in public. \r\n\r\nTherefore i request to either abolish school uniforms or make more non-school uniform days like perhaps every Friday to end the week on a good note in the students eyes and brighten their day.",
        "background": "school uniforms are expensive. with your children growing rapidly its extremely hard to keep spending so much money on their uniforms while also spending money for their equipment that they will use to learn inside school.",
