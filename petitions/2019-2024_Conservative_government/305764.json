        "action": "Nationalise all private healthcare providers to tackle COVID-19",
        "additional_details": "Following in the footprints of governments like Spain - the UK could acquire the equipment, beds and resources of private healthcare suppliers by nationalising them. This is a necessary step because the NHS is currently struggling to distribute limited hospital beds, ventilators and treatment resources for the rising wave of COVID-19 sufferers. Even before the arrival of COVID-19 the NHS has been under devastating strain after a decade of austerity and healthcare funding cuts. We must act now.",
        "background": "As we prepare for an exponential rise in cases of COVID-19 the NHS is underprepared after a decade of austerity. The government is currently renting private hospital beds for \u00a32.4million a day. This is a waste of precious resources - nationalising private healthcare providers will save lives.",
