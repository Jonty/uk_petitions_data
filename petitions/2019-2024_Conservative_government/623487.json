        "additional_details": "It would also help boost morale following the outbreak of COVID-19 and the resulting deaths and hardships. This new national holiday would celebrate the perseverance and dedication of the British people.\r\n\r\nThis would have the additional benefit of bringing the UK further into line with the amount of bank holidays many Europeans receive. This would be a huge necessity at a time when morale is low for many, and would recognise the need for better mental health and work-life balance.",
        "background": "Aim: To provide an additional national bank holiday to celebrate Her Majesty as well as to have a day of remembrance for those who died during the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nSince Queen Elizabeth II was the longest-serving UK monarch, it would be a wonderful way to remember her for years to come.",
