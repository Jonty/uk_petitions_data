        "action": "Legalise cannabis for recreational use",
        "additional_details": "The government continues to ignore that there do exist benefits to legalising cannabis. The US states that have done so have seen a boom in tax revenue - money which would otherwise go to the black market - and a decrease in crime rates. Furthermore, legalisation would serve to reduce the dangers associated with cannabis, by providing consumers with clarity (e.g. about the THC level of a strain), ensuring it is regulated, and making it harder to acquire illegally (e.g. no sale to under 21s).",
        "background": "The Government should legalise cannabis for recreational use. It should thoroughly consider the benefits of legal cannabis, rather than just repeating the same 'default' answer that it gives to such petitions. Canada and several US states have successfully implemented a legal market; why can't we?",
