        "additional_details": "A lot of suffering has been inquired due to Mr Blair sending in our troops. Not only buy us but also by the people of Afghanistan as well. Even a report by  Sir John Chilcot in 2016 which found he overplayed evidence about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. This is why I believe he should be stripped of this Honour before he receives it.",
        "background": "I am Ex Army and I strongly disagreed with the way our troops where sent into Afghanistan. A total of 179 British Armed Forces personnel and Ministry of Defence civilians died serving during the Iraq campaign, while a further 457 were killed during deployment to Afghanistan.",
