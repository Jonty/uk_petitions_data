        "additional_details": "Invasion of Ukraine by Russia requires political unity of Western world in responding to it. There should be no discrepancy between military unity which NATO demonstrates now and political unity of liberal democratic countries. In current circumstances UK voters have a right to reconsider their decision to leave EU. Through a war in Ukraine it has been clearly demonstrated that unity of main values among liberal democracies is fundamental while differences are of secondary importance.",
        "background": "Whole liberal world is currently united against threats which Russia and other illiberal countries are posing to us. All unnecessary internal divisions between us should be removed to underline unity of common values. Referendum to re-join the EU should be held in UK as soon as possible.",
