        "additional_details": "Before qualifying as a teacher I held two consecutive posts in the NHS for 9 years. These roles are all paid on a national scale which would have been enough to get me on the housing ladder in other parts of the country. Based on the current system of a mortgage of up to 5x your salary, I would still need a deposit of around \u00a3150,000 to be able to buy where my job, support network and my daughter's dad are. This is impossible and I am far from the only one in this situation.",
        "background": "Mortgage companies are still offering mortgages at rate of 3-5 times the applicants salary, despite that fact that across the UK the difference between house prices and average salaries are far greater. At the very least, rent history should be taken into account when it comes to affordability.",
