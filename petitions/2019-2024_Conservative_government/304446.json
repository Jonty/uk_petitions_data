Shortage of FFP-3 masks will soon require health care workers to provide life saving treatment to Covid-19 patients without adequate protection risking their lives in the process. \r\n\r\nInitiating life support is a high exposure process and requires an FFP-3 mask for all health care workers involved. Many of the the public will have purchased these masks. They do not require them if they stay at home and follow guidance.",
