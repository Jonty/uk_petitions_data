        "additional_details": "As the number of cases of COVID-19 has decreased and the UK is seeing more facilities open to the public, it is time to reopen zoos to allow them to raise money to care for their animals.  Zoos are predominantly outdoor attractions and can implement social distancing and limit visitors.  If people are allowed to go to parks, beaches, return to school and open car showrooms there is no logical reason that zoos cannot be allowed to reopen.  Keeping them closed puts the animals there at risk.",
        "background": "In light of reduced cases of COVID-19, zoos should be allowed to open to provide them with revenue.  When other outdoor areas are open and areas like parks and beaches where numbers are uncontrolled are open, it is illogical to keep zoos closed.",
