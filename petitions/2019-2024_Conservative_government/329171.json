It can also be a stressful and worrying time for those ladies who have previously suffered miscarriages or complications in pregnancy.  All I am asking is for all hospitals to allow 1 person to attend scans with the expecting mother for emotional support and would have to following current guidelines for face coverings, social distancing, etc.",
