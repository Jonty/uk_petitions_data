We work hard all year just to pay the bills and put food on the table and I am on a well paid job but still struggle. We save for 2 years to be able to take the kids on a 15 day holiday and after all that saving and hard work the government then want to fine us for spending time with the family! It\u2019s not governed in school holidays so prices go up and it impossible to go away. Stop fining us or cap the company\u2019s!",
