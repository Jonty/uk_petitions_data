        "additional_details": "Brexit is currently proving to be a flop.  Nothing good is coming from it and daily all we see are stories of how it's making things worse and causing problems. Polls show the weight of opinion is now against Brexit and as such, the very small minority want to celebrate a disaster.  Instead, we could save that \u00a3120m and put that towards a bonus payment for the frontline NHS staff as a thank you for everything they've given and sacrificed throughout this pandemic.  It seems a better use of money.",
        "background": "It would seem impossible to hold a Festival of Brexit when it has yet to demonstrate one tangible benefit.  Why not cancel the Festival of Brexit and instead put the \u00a3120m towards a bonus for Frontline NHS staff as thanks for their efforts and sacrifices throughout the Pandemic.",
