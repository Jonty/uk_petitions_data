Supermarkets are financially rewarding their staff with bonuses during these exceptional times and NHS/Emergency/Care workers have been exploited and undervalued for too long. What price would the rest of the population put on risking their lives to fulfil their job role?\r\nTheir commitment and devotion has been undervalued and abused by poor remuneration for too long. It must stop.\r\n\r\n'Clapping for carers' is the correct sentiment and recognition of their sacrifice but a few pounds more in their pockets would help them enjoy a better quality of life in return.\r\n\r\nImplement the change in this coming tax year to reward these low paid, vital members of society.",
