We understand that Russia is bombing and shelling hospitals. Nothing indicates that Russia will not attack chemical plants, power plants or even nuclear reactors. The President of Ukraine referred to the Russian actions as genocide on 26/02/2022. The Ukrainian air defence is the weakest link. Air strikes hit military and civilian targets and cause destruction, panic and death.",
