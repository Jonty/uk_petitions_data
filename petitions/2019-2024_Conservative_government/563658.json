        "additional_details": "\u00a3350m a week for the NHS, project feat, Turkey joining the UK, a European army, members of EFTA, a customs union, a  Canada++ deal. We hold all the cards. The easiest deal in history. The German car makers won't let no deal happen. They need us more than we need them. It was all a lie, smokescreen and mirrors. The great British public were misled and now face food shortages, delays to medicines, Kent = car park, the breakup of the union. We demand the right to change our minds.",
        "background": "Brexit won't deliver on any of the promises made during the referendum campaign. A good deal looks virtually impossible. Therefore the government should apply to extend the transition period and hold a referendum on the deal, with the option to remain firmly on the ballot paper.",
