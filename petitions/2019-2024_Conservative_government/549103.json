The government is relying on charity to provide funding for research but the task is so large this can never raise enough to make much difference.The small improvement in prolonging life of Cancer patients is purely by earlier detection, this is not a cure and often leads to brutal treatment for very little benefit with fatal results.Cancer is diagnosed in 50% of people and 8million die/yr in the world with 168,000 in the UK",
        "background": "Discuss it and urgently come up with a plan to attack this disease with passion as we are making very little progress and still relying on poison chemotherapy with lack of success and fatal side effects.",
