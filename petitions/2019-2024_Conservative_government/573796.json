        "additional_details": "Gender Dysphoria is the mental \u201cillness\u201d associated with being transgender. More often than not, transgender people get referrals to gender clinics to seek treatment to alleviate their dysphoria but spend years on a long waiting list to get their first appointments and even longer waiting for medical treatment. I have been out as transgender for two years and have only just gotten a referral. The last two years for me have been a struggle and many people don\u2019t make it to their first appointments",
        "background": "In the UK, there are around 200,000-500,000 transgender people. Just under half of this population are still waiting for their first gender clinic appointment. The waiting lists for NHS Gender Identity Clinics are between 18 months and 5 years.",
