Gyms have strict measures in place that adhere to the government guidelines, all equipment is clean and social distancing measures are put in place properly. Closing something that makes you healthy during a time when people need to be healthy just seems absolutely backwards, we should class gyms as essential, not just for physical health but the mental health of the people which is on a rapid decline.",
