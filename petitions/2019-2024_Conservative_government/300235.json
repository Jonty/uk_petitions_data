        "additional_details": "Women deserve reproductive choice. Egg freezing is growing rapidly: more than tripling in the last 5 yrs but the 10-yr limit pushes women to delay egg freezing until their 30s when egg quality is declining; 60% of women freezing eggs are >35. Fertility charity PET wants the 10-yr storage limit extended as it doesn't have any scientific basis, discriminates against women, limits women\u2019s reproductive choices, harms women\u2019s chances of becoming biological mothers and promotes poor clinical practice.",
        "background": "The best time for a woman to freeze her eggs is in her 20s but under UK law women who do this for non-medical reasons can only store eggs for 10 yrs. If she doesn't use them in this time frame, she must: destroy her eggs, become a parent before being ready or transfer her eggs to a clinic overseas.",
