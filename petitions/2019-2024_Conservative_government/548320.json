        "additional_details": "Pupils from poorer schools, with lower results historically, are due to get automatically marked down. The algorithm system unfairly penalises pupils who live in disadvantage areas and/or attend schools which have not historically performed as well. Their individual efforts and performance and their teachers predicted grades have been ignored - this is grossly unfair and robs them of potential opportunities that could benefit their future",
        "background": "Almost 40% of A-level assessments have been downgraded. All results that were downgraded should be withdrawn and be replaced with original estimates. Students should then be given the opportunity to challenge their results free of charge and without needing the permission of their school.",
