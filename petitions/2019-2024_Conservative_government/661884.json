        "additional_details": "The GLA's one-size-fits-all approach often fails to consider the unique needs and circumstances of outer boroughs, leading to policies that may not be beneficial for these areas. For instance, housing policies designed for inner city areas may not suit suburban or rural communities in outer boroughs. Additionally the Ulez expansion is totally inappropriate to the outer boroughs and has negligible effects on pollution while penalising the poorest members of the community.",
        "background": "I would like the government to give a referendum on the outer London boroughs reverting to self governance and leaving the GLA.",
