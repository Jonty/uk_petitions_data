Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen and Ukraine wars. TBTF bailouts. Unsustainable population growth. Foreign ownership or control of Food, Transport, Utilities, Health, Education, Security, Justice. 99% loss of purchasing power and cost of living crisis.",

Except for emergency responses that would require subsequent ratification all policy decisions would be made by the electorate rather than by representatives - MPs, Councillors, HoL members.",
