        "additional_details": "The government recently announced they're rejecting plans to allow transgender people to self-ID their gender - with approval from a doctor - despite 70% of 100,000 responses in favour. Countries such as Ireland, Belgium and Norway have implemented these changes, leading to a positive impact on the lives of transgender individuals, without any increase in abuse or crime in single-sex spaces. This change is vital for the livelihoods of transgender people, and to reject it threatens their safety.",
        "background": "Transgender people currently need to go through the outdated Gender Recognition Panel to allow for an 'official' gender change. This is costly, inefficient, has no recognition for nonbinary individuals, and is necessary if transgender people want to get married or access their pension.",
