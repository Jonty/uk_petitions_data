        "additional_details": "I would like the government to make this change because Sir David is the most influential climate & wildlife activist in the world. His work has been shown across the globe & he is dearly loved for his powerful messages by all. By having the UK put Sir David's face on the \u00a350 note, you will not only be recognising his dedication but you will send the world an important message that individuals like Sir David must be honoured, supported and recognised. Especially in light of the climate crisis.",
        "background": "The climate crisis is very evident and to honour Sir David Attenborough's life-long dedication to the environment, wildlife and marine life, he should be honoured further for this by being the face of the new \u00a350 note.",
