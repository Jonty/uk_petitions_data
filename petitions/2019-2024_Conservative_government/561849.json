        "action": "Maintain the UK's 0.7% of GDP spent on foreign aid",
        "additional_details": "As one of the wealthiest economies in the world we have a moral duty to assist those less fortunate than ourselves. Furthermore, as the world economy is ravaged by the effects of the Covid crisis we need to be supporting countries around the world to allow them recover from this unprecedented crisis that will continue to affect the whole world unless all countries can get it under control. This is a political decision designed as sop to the Conservative core voters that has zero justification.",
        "background": "The UK government must maintain the foreign aid budget at 0.7% of GDP. There is no fiscal rationale for reducing this budget at a time of unprecedented suffering around the world due to the Covid crisis, rather we should be helping now more than ever.",
