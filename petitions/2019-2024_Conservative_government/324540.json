        "additional_details": "During the Covid pandemic many working age people have lost their jobs.  They have young families to support.  Most people of around 60 years of age do not have young families to support.  It would cost the Government less to pay a pension than it would to support an entire family through Universal Credits.The full new State Pension is \u00a3175.20 per week  whereas the Universal Credit amounts start at \u00a3488.59 (couple under 25) - \u00a3594.04 (couple over 25) + \u00a3235.83 per eligible child.",
        "background": "When I started working, the retirement age for women was 60: for men it was 65.  Now I cannot retire until I am 67.  I will be 60 this year and feel very aggrieved that the goalposts have been changed.",
