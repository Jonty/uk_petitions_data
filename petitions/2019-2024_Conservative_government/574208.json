We are paying massive fees for these 2nd homes/holiday homes and that money is being wasted as most are not entitled to refunds. It will help with mental health being able to have a change of scenery and most holiday homes are surrounded by better walks for excercise and healthier living. Allowing people to use their holiday homes will improve mental and physical health with no extra risks to being at our permanent residance.",
