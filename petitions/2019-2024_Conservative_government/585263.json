Providing free rebookings for 2022 is not an acceptable alternative- especially when most of the 2021 holidays are reschedule bookings from 2020 (often at an additional cost) and 2022 are increasingly more expensive.\r\n\r\nTravellers have left their money with tour operators for over a year and should be able to cancel without penalty if they are unable to quarantine upon return.",
