        "action": "Hold a referendum on the government's proposed reforms to the Human Rights Act",
        "additional_details": "If these proposals are implemented then the government would have supreme unassailable power to do whatever it wants without challenge, the courts and people would be powerless. This country would no longer be a democracy. The ability of courts to challenge 'bad' law would be removed and individual basic rights only upheld if the government decides it is in the 'public good' to do so. This vague condition could, and probably would, lead to massive abuse. Open and national debate must take place.",
        "background": "The proposed reforms to the Human Rights Act represent a major shift of power from people and courts to the government, effectively placing parliament above the law and unable to be challenged. Such proposals should be discussed and scrutinised nationally",
