        "additional_details": "Research into including calorie information on menus shows that it -at best- has no/little effect, and -at worst- can be damaging. Furthermore, it wrongly promotes calorie counting, and the idea that a lower calorie food is healthier, when it in fact just provides less energy. If this plan goes ahead, the information should be available on a separate menu or online, to make it possible to be avoided.\r\nIssues and sources can be found here: https://1drv.ms/w/s!AlXHZGFP3hTOikZvn_hhgK_fnIjh?e=BR8aFX",
        "background": "The proposed measures of making calorie information mandatory on menus could be incredibly damaging to the 1.25 million people in the United Kingdom who suffer from Eating Disorders, including Anorexia Nervosa, which has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder.",
