        "additional_details": "This will slow the spread of covid cases as well, but only for people who actually would prefer online schooling. Covid cases have shot up ever since schools and universities are open. It seems that the government is very eager to keep the schools open, and this seems like a compromise that will be effective and pleasing for everyone.",
        "background": "Although there is a national lockdown and universities and schools remain open, I and numerous others believe that there should be an available option for students to complete their course online if for example there are vulnerable people at their home, or they are more at risk",
