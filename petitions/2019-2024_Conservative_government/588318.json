Your petition calls for people who are not a child's primary carer to have parental responsibility removed, but goes on to say that parental responsibility should be removed from anyone who spends less than 75% of the year with a child. This would mean that in cases where a child spent half of their time with each parent, both would lose their parental responsibility. We don't think this is what you want to happen.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
