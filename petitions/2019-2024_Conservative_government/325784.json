        "additional_details": "After witnessing the recent Black Lives Matter protests in London on social media, I saw police horses being used as a form of crowd control. People were throwing bricks, tear gas & bottles at the horses & it is completely inhumane. Not to mention that the situation is generally distressing to the horse, with the loud noises & general commotion, causing the horses to throw off their riders and trample people. It goes against animal rights completely & it needs to stop!",
        "background": "I want to ban the use of horses as crowd control in the police force. It is animal cruelty & the danger that these animals are exposed to isn\u2019t humane, as they can\u2019t comprehend what is happening & do not have a choice.",
