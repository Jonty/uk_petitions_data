        "additional_details": "Teachers are trained professionals who know us better than anyone else regarding our education. They have watched us grow and develop into the individuals we are today and are confident in their centre assessed grades, and we trust them to give us the grade we are truly able to attain. We should not be forced to fall back on mock results in appeal as they are only a practice run for the final exam, for which we have less time to prepare and cannot be standardised across the country. COVID 19 has already had a detrimental effect on everyone, so please do not make it worse by giving us a disadvantage with respect to our grades.",
        "background": "As a part of the appeals process, students should be allowed to opt for their Centre Assessment Grades calculated by our schools. 39% of teacher predicted grades have been downgraded by Ofqual's adjustment process leaving students like myself in distress as we are forced to settle for less.",
