Additionally, 29% of health workers experienced \u201cprobable emotional distress\u201d, which has also been predicted to be the outcome of this pandemic. Reducing mental health care will lead to worsening symptoms and relapse, which, combined with the care that those on the frontline will need, will place mental health services under immense strain post-pandemic.",

Kempton, The Independent) showing adequate funding and staffing in services is vital now more than ever.",
