        "additional_details": "It is only fair that students set to sit exams in 2021 have the option to chose if they would like to receive their predicted grade as their education has been interrupted greatly. There should be an option for students to sit these smaller version of exams or whether they would rather sit an external exam making the process fair for all students.",
        "background": "With the first national lockdown in March, students have missed physical learning with teachers and support in order to sit exams. Now in another national lockdown students haven\u2019t had enough preparation such as mock exams to prepare for any type of exams/testing and to learn the entire course.",
