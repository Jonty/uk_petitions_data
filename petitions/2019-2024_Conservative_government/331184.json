        "additional_details": "One can go to a hairdresser to have their fringe trimmed, or to the barbers to have their beard trimmed. Both of these treatments are on the face, yet in the beauty sector an eyebrow thread isn't permitted.\r\n\r\nThe High Risk Zone relates to the area around the nose and mouth on the face. Treatments carried out above the nose would NOT be in the high risk zone. The majority of treatments on the face can be adapted so they are carried out from behind the customer, which would reduce the risk further.",
        "background": "On Thursday 9th July, the culture secretary announced that Beauty Salons could safely re-open on Monday 13th July. However we have been restricted from carrying out ANY treatments on the Face. \r\n\r\nWe request the Government to enable Beauty Salons to re-open fully so we can survive.",
