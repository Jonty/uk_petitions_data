        "additional_details": "Individuals with intellectual disability (for example, those with an IQ under 70 or those who are unable to look after themselves due to severe developmental delay) are being denied services and support because there is not a clearly designated pathway for assessment and diagnosis of this condition. The system is currently a lottery, with diagnoses being given out at random. Those without a formal diagnosis are not getting vital support eg mental health and behavioural support. This must change.",
        "background": "There are currently no NHS guidelines for the assessment and diagnosis of intellectual disability (learning disability). The NHS must create a clear pathway for parents, carers and guardians to follow in order to receive an assessment and diagnosis for their child (of any age).",
