        "action": "Allow gyms and leisure centres to reopen",
        "additional_details": "The gyms are a huge benefit for users, not just physically but mentally too. There are studies that show physical exercise can be a great boost to the immune system and releases endorphins which can prevent stress and a chain of mental illnesses. In such a stressful time people need a viable way to exercise. Using home equipment just isn\u2019t sufficient, unless every person in the UK has hundreds of pounds to pay out on equipment (much of which has increased in price since the pandemic).",
        "background": "Allow gyms and leisure centres to reopen\r\nThe goal is to get the government to rethink their decision to close gyms and leisure centres and to come to an agreement to reopen them.Many people rely on gym as part of therapy or a source of happiness, it would be beneficial for all to reopen them.",
