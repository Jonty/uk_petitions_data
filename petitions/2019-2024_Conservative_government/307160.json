        "additional_details": "There are nearly 5 million self-employed people in the UK who need and deserve equal support to those who are employed. Government must act with a focus not just on the interests and preservation of businesses, but people.\r\n\r\nIf it's fair and reasonable for HMRC to calculate and demand payments on account from the previous year's tax return, it's equally fair to assume this as a regular average salary and cover it to 80% with a cap of \u00a32,500pm, as has been promised to employed workers.",
        "background": "Another petition has called on the government to extend statutory sick pay to self employed workers, but this doesn't go far enough. The government's vow to cover 80% of private sector employees' wages up to \u00a32,500pm must be extended to help the self-employed.",
