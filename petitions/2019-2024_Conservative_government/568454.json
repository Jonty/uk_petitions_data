The PM shouldn't be standing outside Downing Street to clap if he is not willing to recognise that our key workers are criminally underpaid.",
        "background": "Rather than just clapping for heroes, we need to show how key NHS healthcare and care home workers are, right now and always, by paying them what they deserve. The Prime Minister has condemned 'empty gestures' in the past, and should do so again now - by putting his money where his mouth is.",
