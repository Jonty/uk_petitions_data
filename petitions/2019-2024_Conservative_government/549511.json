        "additional_details": "After recent events, such as, COVID-19 developments,South China Sea aggression, breaking agreements of Sino-British Joint Declaration in Hong Kong, concentration camps in Xinjiang holding local citizens/Muslims for cultural identity \"crimes\", organ harvesting, and aggressive actions on the Indian border, China is proving itself to be a unreliable, unsustainable partner.\r\n\r\nTaiwan is a democratic nation which treats its citizens and allies with respect (unlike China). UK Gov should embrace Taiwan, and help it shine on the world stage.",
        "background": "By accepting the One-China policy, the UK government chooses to officially ignore the nation of Taiwan, its 23 million citizens, and its democratically elected government. By recognizing Taiwan as the independent nation,Taiwan will have the chance to represent itself in numerous world organisations.",
