        "additional_details": "The government considers an individual as an adult when they are 18. \r\n18 is the age a person can legally vote. 18 is the age a person can buy a home. 18 will soon be the age a person can buy a lottery ticket. So why at 16 can a child legally can be a parent?\r\nThis needs to change in order to protect vulnerable children being groomed and exploited due to the legal age of consent. In England a child is defined as anyone who has not yet reached their 18th birthday. Our laws on consent should be changed.",
        "background": "Raise the legal age of consent to 18. This will be in line with the way the government deems an individual as child or adult. The social attitudes around sexual exploitations of children will change if the age of consent is raised. A person is held legally accountable for their actions at 18.",
