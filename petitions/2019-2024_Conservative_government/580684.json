Council investment is often targeted and does not deliver any added value to the majority of tax payers. Services are poor, crime and antisocial behaviour is on the increase, local infrastructure is degraded. \r\n\r\nCouncil tax is pernicious and unfair. Why does a HMO of 10 residents pay the same as a family of four. Why is a band C in Westminster cheaper than a band C in Portsmouth\r\n\r\nCouncils need to innovate better",
