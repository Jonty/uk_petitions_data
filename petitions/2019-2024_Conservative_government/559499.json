        "additional_details": "My health and mental wellbeing is important to me and my family. Many other people are in the same position and find that exercise and in my case weight training and exercise keep me sane and healthy. after not being able to train for 116 days during the last lockdown I was wrecked but determined to get back to where I was prior. I have managed this to some degree and this 4 week lockdown is just the biggest kick in the teeth (We don't believe it will just be 4 weeks). Reopen the gyms",

Infection rates from Gyms cannot be quantified but the evidence suggests that the rates are far lower than schools, supermarkets and pubs and restaurants",
