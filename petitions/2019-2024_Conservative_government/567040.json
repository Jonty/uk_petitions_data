        "additional_details": "87% of those killed by an ex or partner in 2017 (England and wales) were killed within the first month of leaving.\r\n\r\nIt is the most dangerous time for all when leaving an abuser.\r\n\r\nIf it was a crime more survivors would be protected or able to leave plus help prevent/stop further escalation.\r\n\r\nPost-separation abuse takes many forms from physical, threats, stalking, harassment, coercive control, financial/ economic abuse, revenge porn and much more.\r\n\r\nOften post-separation abuse is minimalised or dismissed.",
        "background": "As survivors we call upon the government to make post-separation abuse a crime. \r\n\r\nCurrently domestic abuse does not cover post-separation, it should!\r\n\r\nAbuse rarely ends with the relationship and is a factor for escalation resulting in domestic homicides.",
