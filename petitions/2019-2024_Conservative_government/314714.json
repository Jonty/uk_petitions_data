        "background": "After listening to the Queen's COVID19 speech on Sunday the 5th April, the comparisons to our historical military campaigns were obvious. \r\n\r\nA medal should be cast for all front line key worker staff to recognise their efforts in the face of adversity, going above and beyond the call of duty.",
