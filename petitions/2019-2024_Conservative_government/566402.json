        "additional_details": "I work at a school with 10 Autistic children in class that are going to be coming in next week onwards. I have old vulnerable grandparents at home and my 2 children, with 1 having underlying health condition. I do not want to risk their lives. Being a key worker I am obliged to go into work risking mine and their lives.\r\n I request a complete closure of schools untill we are vaccinated.",
        "background": "Focus more on vaccinating the population rather keeping schools open to key workers and vulnerable children and risking their and teaching staff lives. This will also protect the NHS being overwhelmed with  rising number of cases.",
