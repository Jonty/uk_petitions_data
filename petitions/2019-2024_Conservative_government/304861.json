        "additional_details": "We need the government to support all the self employed people who are a great force within this country. These workers keep the country going, apply many long hours of their time and get no support when times are hard. The main reason I am doing this is for my daughter, but by helping her, I\u2019m hoping to help others in the same situation. Please find it in your hearts to sign this petition and support these people.",
        "background": "We want government to provide financial support for self employed people, who won\u2019t be able to cover their expenses after the loss of earnings after the first two weeks of not being to work. Most events are being cancelled.  Social gatherings, parties & celebrations. Many different types of workers.",
