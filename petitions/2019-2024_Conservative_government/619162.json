        "additional_details": "Lost, damaged parcels are a common and growing problem,  consumers are even finding their goods for sale online or at auctions, that still have address labels on them. Parcels are damaged due to the way they are handled. The sender has to cover the cost and is expected to pay for the reshipping, which the courier profits from.  Regulation should cover the main market failures, fines imposed based on the number and the value of parcels, or removal of their license to operate a parcels business",
        "background": "Parcel loss, theft, and damaged parcels cost businesses and consumers \u00a3770m a year & complaints have tripled \r\nyet the industry fails to address the underlying issues when it comes to  compensating customers losses, regulation is the only way to address the market failures and rebuild consumer trust",
