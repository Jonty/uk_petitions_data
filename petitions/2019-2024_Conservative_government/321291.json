We get the same mistruths and inaccuracies trotted out day after day from Government mouthpieces. Screened questions are asked so as to give the Government a chance to twist facts and supply easy answers. It's time that the Prime Minister and his Government heard the true feelings from the public. He needs to hear how out of touch he really is.",
        "background": "The public need to be able to have a conduit to the heart of Government, our MPs can only do so much yet our voices are not heard. A petition to show the depth of feeling against Boris Johnson and the Conservatives is a logical choice.",
