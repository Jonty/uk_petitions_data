        "additional_details": "What you don\u2019t realise, HM Government, is that you NEED US. WE are your entertainment when you aren\u2019t working. If you can let people sit on full aeroplanes, in a tiny, cramped space, then you can let theatres (which have massive open auditoriums) open immediately. Get actors on film sets, musicians in recording studios! Let the arts get back on track! PLEASE! We help the economy in just about every way possible! Do the right thing, before we lose faith in you completely. Thank You.",
        "background": "On behalf of all artists and industry specialists everywhere - dancers, singers, actors, musicians, technicians, prop departments, costume designers, stage managers and many many many more - ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!! Let Theatres reopen. Let every creative person get back to doing what they do best!",
