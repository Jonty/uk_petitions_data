        "additional_details": "If the government does not fall through with their package to protect workers and vulnerable people in our community then it is a must that they support them through direct financial means.\r\nThe Coronavirus outbreak is going to cripple our economy if we do not get the help the people need. Those laid off have no means of secure income and SSP is \u00a394/week which is not enough to support families and the elderly.\r\nA one off payment will provide a lifeline for many to buy medicine, food and pay bills.",
        "background": "The US government has pledged a package to give every adult a one off cash payment of $1000. The UK government should do the same in order to help the most vulnerable people during the Covid-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic. Workers are made redundant and a \u00a3300 payment will help them buy necessities.",
