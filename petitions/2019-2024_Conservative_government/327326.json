        "action": "Oppose Annexation of Palestinian Land",
        "additional_details": "From July 1st steps will be taken to formally annex illegal israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley. Annexation is an illegal act and violates international law. By annexing the west bank, Israel would be taking over occupied Palestinian territory and it is estimated that 300,000 Palestinians will be displaced. Thousands would be granted neither citizenship not equal rights.",
        "background": "We urge the UK to take a strong and clear stand against the planned annexation as it would further the disenfranchisement of Palestinians and cut off chances of a viable, contiguous state.",
