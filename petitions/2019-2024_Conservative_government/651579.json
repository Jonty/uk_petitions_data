        "additional_details": "This nation has suffered too long in the grip of a duopoly where both parties are ideologically bankrupt & internally divided.\r\nWe swing from one extreme to another with each party spending half of its energy undoing what the other party did & the other half trying to quell its internal divisions.\r\nA coalition government was elected in order to enact reform, but the reform they offered was a reform that nobody wanted.\r\nThe division in the ruling party since has brought the nation down very low.",
        "background": "Polls suggests that the Conservative Party will be almost completely wiped out at the next election.\r\nThe prospect of a Labour government with a majority as big as predictions suggest is frightening for many people, even if they relish the prospect of the end of the Tories.\r\nPR should mitigate that.",
