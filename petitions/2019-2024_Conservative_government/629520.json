        "additional_details": "We are told that the salary for MPs (which is much higher than that of nurses and many other professions in the NHS) is to attract the best candidates. As we should also be trying to attract the best to work in the NHS as nurses, doctors, scientists, radiographers, physiotherapists etc the same logic applies. If nurses and other professions in the NHS are only given a below inflation pay settlement, then MPs should similarly receive the same level pay settlement",
        "background": "As MPs and government ministers are also public sector workers, any pay rises they are awarded should be no greater than the rises given to NHS staff",
