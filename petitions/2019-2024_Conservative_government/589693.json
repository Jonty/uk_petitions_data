We are highly skilled at what we do and train for 3 yrs to gain our certification. We are constantly put down & it\u2019s time to stand up for our amazing industry after all we are one of the industry\u2019s that\u2019s worth billions per year and it\u2019s not fair we are put down constantly. If there was a professional register for us to join I believe it would make our industry safer & weed out the \u2018lays\u2019.",
