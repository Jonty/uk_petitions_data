        "additional_details": "There is not point of lockdown if the frontliner looking after a patient gets infected. By doing this it will give time to have the frontliner recover and be well again to work instead of leaving it too late. There are already cases of healthcare workers ending up intubated because it was too late for them. We cannot manage to lose more of the healthcare workforce. Screen them, treat them so they can get back up in the frontline again.",
        "background": "Make it mandatory for doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers who come in direct contact with patients to be tested for COVID-19 in both NHS an private sector. The NHS is overwhelmed with this pandemic and the private sector has stepped in with an agreement to lighten up the NHS load.",
