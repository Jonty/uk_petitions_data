At present it's up to schools how long the school day is, but we could accept a petition calling on the Government to limit this to a certain number of hours a week (or day).\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nRequire schools to make Friday a part of the school weekend: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/597715"
