Exercising alone or at home is not sufficient. Most people do not have the equipment at home to exercise properly plus the mental benefits of attending a facility to exercise and interact safely with others is never more important than now. Gyms and pools should be kept open to boost national morale and help fight covid spread.",

Evidence shows gyms are low risk environments for covid spread. Benefits far outweigh risks of keeping gyms open. Keep them open.",
