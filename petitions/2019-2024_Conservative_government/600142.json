        "additional_details": "I am sure Winston\u2019s throat must be so sore, I know my head is. People that don\u2019t own pets cannot understand the trauma that these animals go through every year when people let off fireworks randomly. I don\u2019t want to spoil the fun for kids but there has to be some way that kids and animals can have a piece of what they want. At least firework displays are controlled and only last so long but people setting off fireworks from the start of October to the middle of November is ridiculous.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to ban the use of fireworks on behalf of all household pets. I know that when the halloween period comes around and people are setting off fireworks maybe 2 weeks prior and another 2 weeks past my poor dog goes through the roof constantly barking .",
