There are a number of offences that could apply to cases like this, and each will have different maximum sentences. Decisions about Sentencing Guidelines are a matter for the Sentencing Council, but we can accept petitions calling on the Government to increase minimum and maximum sentences for specific offences, as these are set out in legislation.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
