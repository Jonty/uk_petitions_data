        "action": "Increase focus on K (dispersion) for coronavirus rather than just R0 / Rt",
        "additional_details": "A measure of dispersion allows for a significantly greater understanding of how the pandemic works, how the virus spreads, why, and how to control it. e.g. The mean infection rate solely tells you how many people on average an infected person will transmit the virus to, but it doesn't tell you only a small fraction of the infected are responsible for a majority of transmissions or that the virus tends to spread in large bursts, which is crucial for deciding the best way to control the spread.",
        "background": "Currently, the government is actively monitoring COVID-19's R0 number, which is the mean infection rate. Alongside this, the government is educating the general public about it actively. The focus should be shifted to publishing and educating about the K variable, which is a dispersion measure.",
