Instead of enjoying the time with the baby new mums are sat stressing how they will pay bills and like myself actually debating not having maternity leave and returning to work 4 weeks after having a section!",
        "background": "I have just gone on maternity and unfortunately have not been in my current job long enough to receive smp missing out on it by 3 weeks, I have had to claim maternity allowance however this is classed as unearned income and deducted from my universal credit award leaving me in a deficit.",
