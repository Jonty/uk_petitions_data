        "action": "Prevent the proposed cut of humanitarian aid to Yemen",
        "additional_details": "2 million Yemeni children are  acutely malnourished, and 20 million Yemeni people depend on aid. The UN chief described cutting aid as a 'death sentence'. The government says COVID has squeezed government finances - the proposed cut of \u00a387m is relatively small for the UK, but invaluable for Yemen.",
        "background": "Parliament has committed 0.7% of GDP to aid budgets since 2013, but this was recently slashed to 0.5%. Yemen desperately needs aid - the current government has undermined British aid by merging DFID and the FCO, and now threatens lives by cuts. I beg this government to show some compassion.",
