        "action": "Make mental health medication free to all UK taxpayers and children.",
        "additional_details": "Prescription charges are going up yearly at a higher rate than pay rises. The charge is per item and sometimes mental health meds can be 3 or 4 items per month. This can be around \u00a340 for each person suffering this horrific demon. Working people should get access to free mental health meds to avoid more people taking their own lives because they can\u2019t afford the medication to control these episodes. It\u2019s ok to not be ok and mental health awareness is a major subject finally but it\u2019s not enough. Help our citizens be ok again.",
        "background": "Mental health medication should be free to everyone living in the UK. We should not have to be in a position where we cannot afford prescription charges for medication to help chemical imbalances. To stop us wanting to harm ourselves or our loved ones to be safe.",
