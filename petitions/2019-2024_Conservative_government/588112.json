        "action": "Stop the vaccination of children until critical workers overseas are vaccinated.",
        "additional_details": "It is immoral to use vaccines here to slightly reduce the change of transmission when abroad the same vaccines would have a far greater effect, saving easily 10x the lives they would if deployed here. As a wealthy, developed nation, which has already got plans and means to vaccinate its entire adult population, it is immoral and irresponsible to prioritise vaccinating children over vaccinating health workers and the elderly overseas.",
        "background": "The Government should donate the vaccines planned for use by British children (12-17) to the global COVAX foundation or some similar plan. We should only vaccinate low-risk children here once higher-risk people in less developed countries (medical workers, the elderly, etc.) have been vaccinated.",
