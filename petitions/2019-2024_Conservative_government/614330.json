        "additional_details": "I have approached insurers, customer services and the high level executives for consideration of refunding my payment for a service I didn\u2019t receive due to clear mismanagement of the Airport facility. I believe the airports and airlines should be enforced to address this properly rather than list out excuses for why they are under performing, and blame each other for the issues we face. They should be enforced to evolve their policies and refund services they cannot fulfil.",
        "background": "There are major flaws in the airport and flying experience and many customers are missing flights due to extreme over crowding that cannot be managed effectively. This is not covered by insurance and the airports and airlines are dodging responsibility. How do customers get their money back?",
