        "action": "Amend the planned COVID 19 vaccination schedule, to greater prioritise Teachers.",
        "additional_details": "Headteachers, Teachers, parents and teaching unions have all expressed their concerns that schools are NOT safe, due to the fact that even if children are unlikely to contract COVID 19 themselves, they can still carry / transmit the virus to their Teachers and other adults.\r\nThe Prime Minister also acknowledged this in his message to the country yesterday - so it makes sense, scientifically, for Teachers and other school staff to be vaccinated as soon as possible, to allow schools to stay open.",
        "background": "In light of the Government's insistence that children attending school is a very high priority for the Government, all Teachers and relevant school support staff should be vaccinated at the same time / in the same priority grouping as front-line Hospital and Care workers.",
