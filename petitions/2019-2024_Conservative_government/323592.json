        "additional_details": "The Chancellor today announced that the Self-employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS) is to be extended for a further three months, with this final payment to be made in August. This means that there are still two months which are covered by the Job Retention Scheme (for employees), but for which no payment will be made under SEISS. This discriminates against the 5 million self-employed workers in the UK.",
        "background": "Provide an additional two months support under the SEISS, to bring it in line with the Job Retention Scheme, which is supporting employees wages from March-October incl. A second and final SEISS payment will be made in August, but will only cover a period of only three months.",
