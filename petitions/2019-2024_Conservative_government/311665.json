        "additional_details": "Evidently, it is quite an issue as the year 11s and year 13s are getting their predicted grades so where is the support for us ? This is especially important for households such as my own where I\u2019m a young carer. I have much bigger responsibilities in this time of crisis than trying to teach myself and failing through no fault of my own but because I don\u2019t have a qualification in teaching as I\u2019m a student.",
        "background": "I think it\u2019s unfair for year 12 and 10 students having to learn content at home from a book or PowerPoint without a teacher from now until the foreseeable future. It means we are disadvantaged when going into our exams as we didn\u2019t have the proper teaching especially at a-level sixth forms.",
