        "additional_details": "Discussions directly between these councils and the artists and creators means we find the best level of support to keep this vital economic sector going.\r\n\r\nThe arts provide so much of modern culture and without it, a large part of our culture and international character is reduced. Thousands depend on the arts for work and asking us to retrain and give up on what is a huge contribution to society is insulting and wrong, especially seen as how financially viable the arts is in terms of contributing to the economy. We need to talk directly to the artists affected and create a long term plan for regrowing the arts in our cities.",
        "background": "Coronavirus has affected everyone in the arts differently. Creating region specific arts councils, similar to the old Arts Boards, would allow focus on safely re-growing local performance and arts. ",
