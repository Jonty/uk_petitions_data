        "additional_details": "A serial offender regularly parks untaxed, unregistered, and sometimes SORN-registered vehicles in the private, residential car park where I live. Residents pay for these spaces. The owners of the building and car park have placed notices warning of fines, but it doesn't help as the vehicles aren't registered. The local police, local council, and the DVLA refuse to get involved because the car is on private land. So, basically, the offender can get away with it. This simply isn't fair or just.",
        "background": "There is almost nothing in place to stop people parking on private land without authorisation. This lack of legislation protects those who violate the law, not the people trying to obey it. There should be proper channels to allow private landowners to have unauthorised vehicles clamped or removed.",

For example, we could accept a petition calling for this to be made a criminal offence, so that offenders face criminal sanctions."
