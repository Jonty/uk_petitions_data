        "additional_details": "Help the hard-hit hospitality and tourism sectors: A national bank holiday would give these businesses a much-needed boost. \r\n\r\nBritain needs a break: Our country has been juggling homeschooling, illness, financial uncertainty and grief for the last year \u2013 as well as a withdrawal from the European Union. A break has never been so necessary.  \r\n\r\nA worthwhile investment: The UK currently has fewer public holidays than any other G20 nation \u2013 if ever we needed to introduce another one, it\u2019s now.",
        "background": "The COVID 19 crisis has impacted every person in the UK. Our response to this national trauma will shape our future, for better or worse. That\u2019s why we propose making March 23rd (the first day of the original UK lockdown) a national bank holiday. A day to learn, reflect and move forward together.",
