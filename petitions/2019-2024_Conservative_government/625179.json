        "additional_details": "As a student, I am talking about all students, but we need a 3 day weekend. We suffer through 5 days of 7 hour long school days, just to be bogged down with 3 hours of homework. And, we get even more on the Weekend. Just 2 days isn't enough. We are so excited for the weekend to arrive - then it ends so suddenly. We had no time for what weekends are really for. Fun. We only had time for homework. We saw Saturday pass, and thought 'still one more day', but that day passes faster than the first.",
        "background": "I want the Government to make it so that all schools in the country are legally obligated to have at least a 3 day weekend, and if this law is broken then something happens to the schools in question. Anyway. Example: Timmy is studying. The weekend is his free time. Too much homework. No fun at all.",
