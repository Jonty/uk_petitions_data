As well as me, my whole year group across the nation also shouldn't be affected or have the doubt of failing because of an extended break for an important health matter. Even learning at home doesn't give us the correct level we need, we need teachers and people who can guide us, which the Internet can't always do.",

We've suffered a big loss to our education and as a result, should only be tested on covered content.",
