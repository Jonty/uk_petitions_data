        "additional_details": "The wedding industry is a strong community in the UK and there is significant uncertainty regarding the costs and agreements in place and whether they will be fulfilled. We need clarity on how to proceed and not suffer financial losses from the Coronavirus. Many couples are being forced to make difficult decisions about how to proceed and postponement will save events and the businesses whilst providing a way to ensure that everyone stays at home and waits out the peak of the virus.",
        "background": "Wedding industry suppliers are being significantly effected by this unprecedented event. They are being very generous to reschedule appointments  with long standing commitments but the time is booked far in advance so they will suffer significant loss in the future.",
