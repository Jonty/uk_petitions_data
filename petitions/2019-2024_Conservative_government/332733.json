In the letter, the Committee asks for more detail on proposals for ending so-called \u2018conversion therapy\u2019, and an update on when changes to the law might be brought forward.\r\n\r\nCatherine McKinnell MP (Chair of the Committee) and Elliot Colburn MP (a member of the Committee) highlight in the letter that, in addition to the current petition with over 200,000 signatures, there have also been two large petitions on this issue in previous years. They also note that despite its inclusion in the Government\u2019s 2018 LGBT Action Plan, legislation has still not been introduced.\r\n\r\nYou can read the full letter here: https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/2172/documents/20109/default/"
