        "background": "We want to be able to postpone wedding ceremonies due in the coming month or two, however, many venues are stating \u2018business as usual\u2019 because they are not classed as restaurants or pubs/bars. We need you to include Private Wedding Venues in the list of businesses that must close during COVID-19.",
