        "additional_details": "CAGs were predicted on varying and inconsistent criteria by individual Schools which has caused bias to creep in which is not fair like varying combinations of end of year 12s, mocks, topic tests, etc were used with no standards across the subjects or the schools.\r\nThe Uni Offers were based on predicted grades which the same school and teachers produced and the Uni applications were filed by 15 Jan. Those who got lower CAGs than predicted grades, pl award predicted grades so they get Uni offers.",
        "background": "Govt did a U-turn on A level results BUT that has not fixed the issue for students who were given lower CAGs than the predicted grades on which the Uni Offers were awarded. \r\nWant the govt to fix the issue for the remainder of the students who are still suffering. Award predicted grades.",
