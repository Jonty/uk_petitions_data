The Police cannot be everywhere at all times and we do not believe we should have to be vulnerable should we not have the time or means to call for and wait for the police. We ask that all police officers be routinely armed to better equip them to do their job and protect us at their end.",
        "background": "We ask the government to relax the laws surrounding possession of firearms including handguns to allow possession for self defence and defence of property at any place or time, with no duty to retreat. We also ask that all police officers be routinely armed.",
