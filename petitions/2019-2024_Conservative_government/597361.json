Compounded by the fact that HMRC is not open on Saturdays and Sundays you are forced to take time off work to contact the HMRC as communication with them takes at least a couple of hours.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to navigate the HMRC website to find each department which takes lots of time, in some cases this information doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nIt is essential that communication between HMRC and the people is faster and more transparent to avoid delays and even missed opportunities to collect the support granted by the government.",

Send all requests of information in one letter and not multiple ones. Provide an alternate communication method such as Email instead of sending letters through the post,",
