At such a time when national unity is required it seems in poor taste to attack those that use this most. Especially given it is used in such seasonal applications. It will have larger implications on the country with the rise in prices for food and outdoor entertainment.",
        "background": "Stop the Chancellor from axing the use of red diesel. While we all understand that greener measures must be made to help in the climate emergency, it must not come at the expense of our farmers and show heritage.",
