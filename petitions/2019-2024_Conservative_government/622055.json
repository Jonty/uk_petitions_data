        "additional_details": "We are a democracy. We are currently supporting countries like Ukraine in the name of democracy. For only 200,000 of us to select our country's leader, completely flies in the face of this & all democratic ideals. Yes, we are a parliamentary democracy; the new leader, however, will be able to freely & radically change party policy and shift the governing party away from its electoral mandate. For this reason we must have a general election as soon as possible after the new leader assumes office.",
        "background": "The UK will have a new leader in September, a Prime Minister chosen by only 200,000 people.  Accordingly, the new leader should be subject to universal suffrage in a UK-wide General Election within six months of assuming office.",
