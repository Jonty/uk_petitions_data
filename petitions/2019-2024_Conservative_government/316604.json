They have continued to provide the nation with high standard care and compassion. It is now the time for the Government to rethink their commitment to the public health sector and pay them back what they always deserved. Agenda for change has recently been reviewed with extensive controversy and discussion will need to continue until overall agreement.",
        "background": "NHS workers have seen a increase of only around 1% per year over recent years, which had an impact on their wages and living standards. NHS workers should be respected and paid equally. Many workers in the private sector have received an annual increase in wages of 5% against around 1% in NHS.",
