        "additional_details": "The idea is to allow UK nationals to enjoy their summer as well as adhering to the rules  of course. If any state or country that is safe right now, it is the UAE.\r\nWe have list a lot of money in regards to rebooked holidays from last year. Its become inexplainable. If they do not want to move UAE or parts of it, out of the red list, then is holiday makers want the government to reimburse us as no holiday company is offering refunds\r\nThe UAE is safer than a some countries that are even in amber",
        "background": "I feel the government decisions are completely absurd. The countries they have put on the green list do not make any sense. The UAE, itself as a state has clear knowledge of how to control COVID. It had had a drop of covid cases and a positive move on regards to the vaccine, more than most countries",
