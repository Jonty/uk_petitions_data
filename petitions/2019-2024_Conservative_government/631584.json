        "additional_details": "The current process is distressing and humiliating. The method of self-determination makes the GRA process more accessible and humane, reducing mental stress and protecting trans lives. This results in fewer costs to the NHS. \r\n\r\nAn updated GRA should clarify that the Equalities Act 2010 is not affected, so gender-appropriate spaces are respected and that the principal purpose is to enable trans people to update their birth certificates so to marry and die in their\u00a0true\u00a0gender.",
        "background": "Reform the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) 2004 to allow transgender and non-binary people the right to legal gender recognition by self-determination, without needing a medical diagnosis, to streamline the administrative process in line with international best practice.",
