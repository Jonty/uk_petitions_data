        "action": "Introduce a ~5% SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY tax to all workers and corporations",
        "additional_details": "The UK need to react quicker to e.g. floods and COVID 19 response. Having a social tax separate to income and corporation tax would help to build and provide a fund to assist and finance recovery from unplanned disasters better and faster without it being \"wasted\" in other areas. It would also offer a buffer and allow other government functions to operate without having funding pulled so much or the country going into more debt.",
        "background": "Separate to the obvious Health Issues and challenges, COVID 19 has also stopped people working, putting companies and families at financial risk and stopped taxation revenue. Support is now being pumped in but the country is also in a bad situation with deficit and debt and this will only get worse.",
