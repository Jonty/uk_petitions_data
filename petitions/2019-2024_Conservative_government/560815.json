        "action": "Give British GCSE and A-Level students Centre assessed grades, due to absences.",
        "additional_details": "Due to the absences earlier in the year, most students are falling back drastically and the pressures on students to recover lost ground is gaining knowing that the end of year exams are still taking place. The mental health of students is also generally declining, which is a main cause for lack of motivation within subjects and ineffective revision methods. I would like the government to see the issue from the perspective of the students that the issue is effecting the most.",
        "background": "I would like the government to deeply consider the possibility of Centre assessed grades for all British A-level and GCSE students, from the perspective of the students. Centre assessed grades based off of written work would ease pressure from all students.",
