We feel that SATS cause unnecessary levels of stress in mainstream pupils, pupils with additional needs and teaching staff,  leading to behavioural issues and school refusal.",
        "background": "We would like SATS testing in primary schools to be abolished and replaced by incremental monitoring by teachers, in order to reduce stress on both pupils and staff and provide a more accurate means to measure educational achievement.",
