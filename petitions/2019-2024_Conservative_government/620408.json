        "additional_details": "A divorced woman will have a final order from the court stating her marriage has ended. To change her surname back to her maiden name she can give her marriage certificate and the final order to organisations such as DVLC to do this. \r\nA woman who is still married can only change her surname by deed poll and must attach a permission letter from her spouse stating they have no objection. This allows a spouse to control an ex-partner. This disproportionately affects women.",
        "background": "If a woman in an acrimonious divorce that is taking time to finalise wants to change her surname back to her maiden name she can only do this by deed poll. She must attach a consent letter from her spouse to the forms in LOCO19 pack. \r\nWe at iamlip.com want to remove the need for this letter.",
