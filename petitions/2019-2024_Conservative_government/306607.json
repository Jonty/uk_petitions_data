        "additional_details": "All most of schools and universities have closed but student nurses still need to go to placement. They have families with vulnerable people still. It\u2019s unfair for them to go and work as frontline to save save lives yet they are not getting paid or they won\u2019t get paid for sick leave when they have contacted the virus. At the end of the day who will look after their families. They should not go for placement or they should get paid minimal wages as this pandemic disaster is going on.",
