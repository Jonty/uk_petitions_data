        "additional_details": "The extinction of the domestic cat needs to be consider has a realistic conseqence if this law was passed. Yes it outlines breeders will be exempt however the best breeders will not only give the kitten the required vaccines but also have the kitten spayed or neutered before finding them a new home. Their are many breeders only there to make money not for the welfare of the cat. All breeders should be check to make sure they follow best practices not just left to their own devices. I, like most cat owners do not want to see cats in a zoo.",
        "background": "Take into consideration the consequences of such a law, when you consider the live span of the domestic cat the extinction of domestic cats within 25-30yrs could well be a realisation, putting the cat on the endangered register within 20-22yrs, making the only place you will see a cat is in a zoo.",
