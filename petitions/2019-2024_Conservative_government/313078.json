        "additional_details": "It is imperative that a public inquiry now be held, so the UK might be better prepared for the inevitable next pandemic. It is therefore also vital that we understand the reasons why our NHS went into this crisis with one of the lowest number of ICU beds per 100,000 people in Europe, why NHS Supply Chain seemed unable to deliver vital equipment to frontline NHS staff, also if pursuing policies like herd immunity were a mistake, and if additional lives were lost because of any decisions made.",
        "background": "With mounting evidence of NHS staff having been put into harm\u2019s way due to a lack of PPE, and failures in the procurement of testing materials and ventilators, it is important that the actions of all officials involved are scrutinised, so that lessons can be learned for the future.",
