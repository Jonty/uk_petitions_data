This is becoming more frequent as is almost impossible to commute anywhere by car if you live in the surrounding areas. It\u2019s taking people hours to get to A - B for journeys which should take 10-30 minutes. With more houses going into the area something needs to change as things will only get worse. The automated toll has made things worse.",

Such as dedicated emergency services on hand for when an accident happens which is almost daily at present. A review of lane organisation for cars and lorries.
