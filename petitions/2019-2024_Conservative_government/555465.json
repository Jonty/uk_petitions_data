        "additional_details": "The mental strain of running on no sleep, having no adult face to face interaction due to the current restrictions means that softplay areas play an essential part to creating a healthy wellbeing for parents. This allows them to be around other adults at a safe distance and prevents them from being stuck at home. With winter approaching park visits will be very few and far between due to weather conditions therefore it is vital that these remain open as an escape for both parents and children.",
        "background": "I would like the government to re-open soft play areas. I gave birth to a baby boy during full lockdown and found it very difficult being stuck inside the house all the time without the exception of going for a walk however with winter approaching it leaves nothing for children to do.",
