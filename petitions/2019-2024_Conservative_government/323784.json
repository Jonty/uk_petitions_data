        "additional_details": "Thousands of black people have encountered racism in many forms, whether it be through micro-aggressions, discrimination or other hate crimes.\r\nReports of race hate crimes are increasing each year in the U.K. by approximately 10,000 which must come to an end.\r\nRacism is caused by prejudice, ignorance and conformity to racial attitudes in society. The best way to tackle this is to educate in depth about the impact of racism to help change racial attitudes of the future generations to come.",
        "background": "Teaching of Black History should be compulsory in schools. The current approach towards awareness of racism is inadequate, as it fails to clearly explain the inequality which black people have faced. Students should be taught in depth about slavery, the civil rights movement and British colonialism.",
