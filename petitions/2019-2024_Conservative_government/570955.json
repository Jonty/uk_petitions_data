        "additional_details": "In actual exams, a student predicted to fail may pass and one predicted to pass may fail. This makes the process too spontaneous to predict in a teacher assessment, especially for students spending 2 years at home.\r\n\r\nGCSEs were cancelled to prevent underachievement due to mitigating circumstances, so why are we failing any child when they all fall under mitigating circumstances and should all be offered the opportunity to progress unhindered? A temporary pass allowance will solve this issue.",
        "background": "No child should be failed by Teacher Assessment. Any student given a fail for core subjects should be given a temporary pass grade of 5 instead with a 3 year allowance to retake the exams to keep the grade, allowing them access to higher learning in the meantime.",
