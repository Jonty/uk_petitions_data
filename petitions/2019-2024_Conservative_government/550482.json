        "action": "Ease restrictions on Sunday opening with safeguards for workers",
        "additional_details": "We believe Sunday trading laws are outdated and not fit for purpose. In a culture of predominately '9 until 5' working, Sunday trading laws can be an obstacle to those doing their shopping at weekends, rather than evenings. The issue is exacerbated by exceptions to the rule (like restaurants and petrol stations being able to open 24/7) that create inconsistency. Allowing more flexible Sunday trading could also help boost our economy, as more are able to shop at times most convenient to them.",
        "background": "The Government should reform legislation on Sunday opening to remove restrictions on opening times but provide workers with the right to refuse to work on Sunday. This change would bring the position in England and Wales in line with Scotland, which we believe is much more progressive.",
