We understand the COVID-19 visitation rule is for all hospitals, but these cases are different.\r\n\r\nIf this means family members & carers must even get a COVID-19 test before arriving, wear PPE & social distance, then so be it. Symptoms of inpatients can improve with communication with those they trust so they know they are safe, & not totally isolated from the world & from improving faster (allowing more beds to be available).",

By not allowing support, & with an increase in admissions with psychiatric related issues, the government causes family & personal distress, a delay in recovery, & one less bed for someone else who needs it.",
