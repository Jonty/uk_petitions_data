        "action": "Withdraw the proposal for the BTEC Performing Arts Course removal",
        "additional_details": "The BTEC PA continues to give access to Higher Education for thousands of actors, musicians, dancers and technicians every year. They become valuable members of the performing arts community both on and alongside stage and screen. They also use their transferable skills within a wider range of jobs. It is not a 'part time/ additional' course. It takes hours of time & dedication to perfect. Removing the BTEC Performing Arts courses would be a disaster. We are pleading to withdraw the proposal.",
        "background": "The Government has suggested that the BTEC Performing Arts may be reduced down to a small course or taken away completely. By removing the BTEC/Level 3 qualifications, they are obstructing and insulting those from a working class or unacademic background to the availability of excellent courses.",
