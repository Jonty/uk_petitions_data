        "additional_details": "Modify the legislation to eliminate this discrimination in the way of awarding free court legal aid support on family related issues which are based on the person and should be awarded based on the case.\r\nThis type of case related legal aid procedure is already followed in the mediation phase so this can be extended to the court proceedings.",
        "background": "The fees with the solicitors can easily mount up to 20K pounds in the court proceedings in familily related matters which is totally prohibitive for a UK medium wage of 38K pounds a year. On the other hand, if the other part is not in employment and claiming benefits is entitled to free legal aid.",
