        "action": "Change the GCSEs from exams to a moderated teacher assessment to award grades.",
        "additional_details": "We believe that the current method of grading is an unjust one, that relies solely on the intelligence of a student, and not the student's effort or dedication to their work. We are experiencing an uncertain time, one that has not been seen in history before, but we are confident that the Government have made the right decision for our education. So confident, that we believe that this new grading system should be used in the future, not to benefit ourselves but those who come afterwards.",
        "background": "We, as students in year 11, urge the Government to change the way in which GCSEs are graded, similar to that of which the Government has established due to the unforeseen outbreak of COVID-19.",
