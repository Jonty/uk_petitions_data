        "additional_details": "Those who have worked through the pandemic have at risk, had no time off. They have not accumulated holidays whilst been at home. This includes NHS staff, emergency services, carers, transport workers as well as many others.\r\nTheir continued work whilst at risk has not given time with their families or accumulated annual holidays, they we have continued to do their jobs.\r\nWhilst \u201cwe are all in this together\u201d, key workers bills have already been paid in full and should not be penalised financially.",
        "background": "At the next budget, the chancellor should ensure that front line key workers should suffer tax rises. Those who have worked throughout the pandemic have gained nothing and should not have to pay to cover the costs of furlough, whilst others have had family time and holiday accumulation.",
