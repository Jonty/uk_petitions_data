        "additional_details": "The reason for this temporal ban is to suspend the use of tobacco/shisha products which entail groups of customers smoking breathing from one hose pipe and potentially sharing it on. Smoking not just inhibits the human body\u2019s immune system, but this method of pipe sharing can lead to the contamination and spread of the Corona Virus infection; whether somebody is unknowingly the carrier of the virus and could pass it on to others.",
        "background": "Introduce a new temporary ban for the sale, use and testing of tobacco products including shisha (hookah) in all licensed UK commercial premises such as shisha bars, clubs, restaurants.",
