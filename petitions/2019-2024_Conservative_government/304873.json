        "additional_details": "It will help in getting more accurate numbers of those that do actually have it rather than those that are simply self-isolating because they are displaying the symptoms but may not have COVID itself. It will help to alleviate stress on the NHS particularly as people will stop just attending hospital because they think they have it, NHS workers may be self-isolating but not need to be and will help keep the workforce at work. Psychologically it will help reduce panic because people will know if they have it or not and hopefully prevent panic buying and anxiety.",
        "background": "Those that are self-isolating may not even have COVID-19, if there was a website created you could log on to confirm you are self-isolating, then you would receive a swab in the post to get tested. If it is positive stay in isolation, if not you can return to work.",
