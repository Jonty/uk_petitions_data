        "additional_details": "Each student applies Tier 4 student visa pays almost  \u00a3500 per their applications. If you think that they are mature students with their family it is very expansive for them. They also pay \u00a3300 for health services per year they study. This even harms students more than ever during this pandemic. The government or Parliament can help students to reduce this fee or remove it for this special time period. It can contribute to students during these hard times and in the future as well.",
        "background": "Decreasing the fee of the Tier 4 student visa application is vital. Government may consider free visa applications for affected students who would like to apply/extend their visas their dependent' visas.
