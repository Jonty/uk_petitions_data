        "additional_details": "This is a national emergency.\r\nThe current Covid19 strategy is placing huge strain on the economy, business, our way of life and on people\u2019s mental health - there is no clear exit plan.\r\nUnchecked, the current strategy will have long term, significant implications for the future of the UK and for its people with the cost of recovery likely to be paid disproportionately by our young people.\r\nWe need Parliament and all of its expertise and resources to establish the best strategy to beat the virus.",
        "background": "Immediately recall both houses of parliament.  \r\nThe ways to do this safely are widely used and have already been largely set out in the open letter from the MP for Swansea West to the Leader of the House dated 3rd April.\r\nParliament should sit continuously until the Covid19 emergency is over.",
