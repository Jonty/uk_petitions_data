        "additional_details": "Everyone should go vegan to stop animal slaughter. We also need to try to make a vegan world possible without having to kill any remaining animals, and keep a vastly smaller number of farm animals around. They could be cared for in refuges.\r\n We also need to rewild as much of the rest of the land as possible, to help restore our planet, tackle climate change and save wildlife. If it weren\u2019t for animal agriculture, it would also be easier to reintroduce native predators like wolves and bears.",
        "background": "Each year, around 80 million fish and 1.2 billion land animals are killed to be eaten in the UK alone each year. Worldwide, 77 billion land animals and around 1 trillion to 2.8 trillion fish are killed each year. This has to stop. We all need to go vegan, for the planet and the animals!",
