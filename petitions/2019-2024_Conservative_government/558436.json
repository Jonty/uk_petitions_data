        "additional_details": "Tennis is naturally a socially distanced sport, especially singles. It doesn't follow reason for outdoor tennis courts to be closed when singles tennis could continue, still following guidelines of meeting one person from another household whilst distancing. \r\nThis isn't just the closure of someone's hobby; coaching is a job which will unnecessarily be stopped and tennis for some people is extremely important for their mental and physical health, both important in a pandemic.",
        "background": "Allow singles and one-to-one coaching to continue on outdoor tennis courts. This will still follow government guidelines and protect people's jobs and mental health during this uncertain time.",
