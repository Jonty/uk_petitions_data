        "additional_details": "Dogs are often returned home with serious health conditions or underweight whilst some have inexplicably passed away. We believe seized dogs are not being cared for in accordance with Section 9 of the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and Section 3 of the Animal Welfare Act 2006, because the kennels of seized dogs are not currently inspected by an independent team like the Animal Welfare Independent Visitors Scheme which is used for police working dogs. Families should be allowed the same reassurance.",
        "background": "To create an animal welfare scheme made up of a team of independent experts from animal welfare organisations, k9 behaviourists, and veterinarians to visit, observe and inspect the conditions of kennels where seized dogs are being held nationwide.",
