        "additional_details": "I have no personal issue with people wearing or not wearing masks. From what I've seen when I've been into a shop, I've not seen anyone too close to each other and people have been respecting boundaries. As a Nation so far, we have done immensely. And we shall carry on! \r\nTelling the general public to wear the mask within a week is like taking protection for the bedroom, to a baby shower! \r\nIf people are still worried about going outside, our communities have hubs set up to support this.",
        "background": "We want the UK Government to reverse their decision to make wearing masks in shops mandatory. A lot of people are saying this is a 'ploy' to make people feel safe to come out and spend money in shops, where others are wearing masks, to better the economy. The economy needs help but not like this.",
