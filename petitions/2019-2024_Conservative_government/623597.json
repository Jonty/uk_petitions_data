        "additional_details": "The general consensus of the UK population is against these items on the chancellors mini-budget. Why should the top earners, bankers etc get more money when they are the ones consistently putting the UK in recessions through bad investments and the like. The government shows no respect for the workforce as a whole or the frontliners who worked right through the covid pandemic. It's disgraceful",
        "background": "To acknowledge that the bankers bonuses increase, abolishing income tax on earners above \u00a3150k is detrimental to the majority of the workforce within the UK. This is escalated by the wish to remove trade unions. The workforce should be looked after first and foremost to make the UK prosper.",
