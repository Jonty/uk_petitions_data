        "additional_details": "Early Years and Children\u2019s Social Care has had a positive influence on every British person's life, as it is the building blocks for children to move into Primary/Secondary education; as well as establishing social and communicative skills. \r\nThe Nursery Nurses & Carers are just as important to our society as any Teacher is. They deserve all of our support as they have done so for us, for decades. We need them.",
        "background": "This restructure will result in providers ceasing to operate due to no guarantee of stability and support. I want the Government to consider emergency legislation to protect all early years & children's social care jobs, whether Public Sector or Private.",
