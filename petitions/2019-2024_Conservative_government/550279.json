It was hindering the maintenance for the grass cutters. We argued that we maintained our grave and had many compliments on how beautiful it looked. They didn't care. A month later on our visit we were greeted by an empty pile of mud. Everything removed. I'm heart broken that I can't visit my daughter in a beautiful place. \ud83d\udc94",
