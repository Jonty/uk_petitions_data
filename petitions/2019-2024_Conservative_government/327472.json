        "additional_details": "The current Conservative government have an obviously anti-trans rhetoric and are failing to protect our community. Plans were introduced under Theresa May to ease the process of self-identification for trans people, though documents show that PM Johnson plans to reverse this. Trans people are constantly attacked by politicians, media and citizens, and it must stop. Our existence is not up for debate. We are here, and are going nowhere. So I urge the Government to do their job and protect us.",
        "background": "Plans have leaked that reveal the Government's proposed legislation to scrap plans for self-identification for transgender and non-binary people. We must act now to ease the process of self-identification for trans people and stop the Government from continuing their clearly anti-trans rhetoric.",
