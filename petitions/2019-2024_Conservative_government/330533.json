        "additional_details": "The law barring men from donating blood within 3 months of homosexual sexual contact is discriminatory. According to nat.org, the transmission of HIV between homosexual men (46.4%) is only 0.2% higher than between heterosexual couples (46.2). These statistics prove that this law is outdated and useless. Removing this law would also increase the amount of blood donated, saving many lives. This would be a big step in LGBTQ+ rights in the UK and could pave the way for other countries to follow.",
