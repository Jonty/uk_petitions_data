        "additional_details": "COP26 is being hosted in Glasgow. If the government were to extend an invitation towards all international parties to stay another two weeks or meet again soon, it would be seen not only as a sign of cooperation and intent to the international community, but it would also show the people of the UK (and the world) that the UK government takes the climate crisis seriously. Most importantly, it would increase the chances of concluding a multilateral deal ensuring the 1.5 degree limit is achieved.",
        "background": "Extend the progress of COP26 until all parties agree upon a detailed and effective deal that will ensure that world temperatures will not rise above 1.5 degrees Celsius in comparison to pre-industrial levels. Two weeks is obviously not long enough to negotiate such an important goal and crisis.",
