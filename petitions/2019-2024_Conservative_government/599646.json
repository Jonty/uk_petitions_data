It was their birthday shortly after the funeral and loved ones left birthday gifts and flowers only to find someone had been and stolen their birthday gifts from their freshly made resting place, leaving their family heart broken and not wanting to leave gifts for her in case they were stolen. There are no cameras to identify who has done it. No family should feel they or unable to leave gifts for at their loved one's resting place.",
