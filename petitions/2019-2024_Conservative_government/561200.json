        "additional_details": "You are killing our industry. When open we can only run at 50% capacity. We are essential for peoples mental health and wellbeing. Sage reports state we contributed less than 0.05% of cases. We have not had the same support as others, i.e. VAT relief or eat out to help out.\r\nForced closures will create more debt , unemployment ,and will increase the amount of benefits paid out by the state. This will cost the government more in the long term, if we dont get the help we need .PLEASE KEEP US OPEN.",
        "background": "WE CANNOT sustain being forced to close?\r\nSage reports show that our industry is one of the safest, it is backed up by the latest report by PHE. We are safer than supermarkets and schools. We provide a covid safe place for our staff and clients. Our industry is not the problem we go above and beyond",
