        "additional_details": "We feel that our communities and our freedoms will be severely damaged by the actions taken by this government to stop the virus. There are many people in the scientific community outside of the government and SAGE who believe there are better solutions to this pandemic that will alleviate the collateral damage to our society, the social and mental wellbeing of the nation and the national monetary backlash that will follow as a result. We feel this is not a decision that should be made for us.",
        "background": "The people of the UK need to know the reasons for another lockdown. The scientific community is not in agreement on this matter and the ramifications of doing so are severely destructive to our communities and freedoms; we feel a public discussion between experts is needed to justify these actions.",
