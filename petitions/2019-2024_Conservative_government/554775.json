        "additional_details": "Recently councils have closed/restricted roads to all blue badge holders. Disabled people need access to all roads for mental health ,mobility and health safety reasons. They have carers that help them within their community, they have carers that take the burden off the NHS and help people with disabilities live in a predominantly abled bodied society. public transports sadly isn\u2019t good enough for some disabilities most trains/tubes can\u2019t  be accessed with wheelchairs or mobility issues.",
        "background": "Don\u2019t discriminate against Disabled Blue badges, councils are closing roads off and penalising disabled ppl who can\u2019t walk or cycle enough to get around. Camera reading like in the congestion would be better option for disabled ppl. Also black taxi access when carrying disabled passengers.",
