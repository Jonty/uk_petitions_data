They don\u2019t need to be working 12 hour shifts then desperately looking for food and other essentials.\r\n\r\nSome shops have already imposed restrictions to allow older shoppers in before others. They can do their shopping just after a shop clean and minimise the risk to themselves.",
        "background": "The government could request that supermarkets reserve essential items for NHS workers and introduce dedicated shopping times for people in at risk groups, eg early morning when the store has been cleaned and restocked overnight.",
