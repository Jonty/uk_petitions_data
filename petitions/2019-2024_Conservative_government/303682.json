        "additional_details": "As we have seen in the news and social media, there is widespread pandemonium with regards to stockpiling of essential products. We feel this will leave the elderly etc in a precarious position, and call upon the Government to introduce safe shopping times away from the hoards of panic buyers. Not only will this give them the opportunity to stock up on food and medicine, but will also assist with their physical and mental wellbeing during a very difficult time.",
        "background": "We propose that the Government implements a set period of the day (8am to 10pm) for the elderly and other high risk groups to do their shopping in the event on a Covid-19 lockdown.",
