        "additional_details": "My brother is fit and active but lives with Leukaemia, he is classified as \u2018extremely vulnerable\u2019 and needs to self isolate for a minimum of 12 weeks. There are no delivery slots available for online shopping, so he will be forced to rely on the generosity of his friends in his local area. He should be able to immediately book a regular weekly food delivery, which won\u2019t be cancelled to give him the security of knowing that he can eat (and feed his dog).",
        "background": "Food retailers, who offer home delivery, should set up slots for people who are classified as being \u2018extremely vulnerable\u2019 and are having to self isolate for a minimum of 12 weeks. These people should have first priority and be able to access a minimum of a weekly delivery service.",
