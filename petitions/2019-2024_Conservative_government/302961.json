I think it would be extremely useful to standardise the English working week to around 35 hours. Baring in mind most people travel up to 1 hour to work, thats still 7.5 hours each day at work and adding the travel time, people can still be out of the house for 9+ hours each day. If jobs require more than the standard then they must be advertised as full time+.",
