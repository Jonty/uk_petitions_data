        "additional_details": "we should be allowed 1 week holiday for anytime during term time after this, holidays helps busy working families and those on lower earning incomes to re-connect but due to the high prices during school holidays so many families are missing out, after all many children are not getting any education at all, 1 week of missing education can easily be gained by children rather than none at all for weeks on end.  I want the school to only fine one parent after 5 days absence to allow family time.",
        "background": "to change the rules to only fine parent after 5 days absence amid the corona virus outbreak.Yes it is vital for schools to shut BUT many children are not getting ANY education at all at home and family time is important and with term time holidays so expensive families are missing out that bond.",
