Children\u2019s mental health\u2019s are suffering massively during this pandemic and this will set them back further. Plus the dance industry has been one of the hardest hit in the pandemic with massive uncertainty and insecurity. Allow dance schools to remain open and children\u2019s sporting activities continue.",
