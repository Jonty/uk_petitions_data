        "additional_details": "The decision to cease \"drive-in\" testing for coronavirus is simply unacceptable and the British government MUST act to prevent yhe virus from spreading to the most vulnerable people in society such as babies, young children, the elderly and people with existing health problems. People need to know if they have to self isolate or if they just have the flu or other less severe illness and the only way to know for sure is by testing. This is especially true if employers need proof for missing work.",

Because coronavirus is a virus that is contagious before any symptoms develop (Incubation period), people can unknowingly become carriers and spread it before any sign of symptoms.",
