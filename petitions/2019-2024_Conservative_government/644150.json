        "additional_details": "XL Bullies are known for their friendly nature towards humans; they are often described as affectionate family pets with excellent temperament. On the other hand, Pit Bulls have historically been bred for fighting purposes but can still be loving companions when properly trained by responsible owners. Numerous studies have shown that a dog's behavior is primarily influenced by its environment, training, and socialisation rather than its breed alone.",
        "background": "Differentiating between XL Bullies and Pit Bulls:\r\nIt is crucial to understand that there is a distinct difference between XL Bullies and Pit Bulls. While both breeds share some physical characteristics due to their common ancestry, they possess different temperaments and behaviours.",
