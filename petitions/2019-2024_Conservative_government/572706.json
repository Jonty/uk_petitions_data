        "additional_details": "Some children have suffered with anxiety, lack of resources, lack of help, low mood and poor motivation to complete all work at home for the majority of the academic year 2020-2021. \r\nThe year needs to be written off and repeated as a mandatory measure to take away the stress from children and their parents. This includes nursery level up to universities. Our countries children\u2019s mental health is more important and learning should be re-visited again in 2021//2022 once the virus is under control.",
        "background": "All children should have to repeat their current school year next year across all years. This will give all children the same opportunity to progress equally, as there will be lots of children that have not progressed through homeschooling. This is not their fault and need to be given a chance.",
