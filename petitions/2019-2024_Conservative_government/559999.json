With all involved in securing a new job, research/applications/phone calls/virtual or physical interviews, and managing the needs of young children are not always possible. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the cost of childcare is unjustifiable with the loss of an income. The furlough scheme is in place for the employed and I feel childcare should be offered for people looking for work.",
