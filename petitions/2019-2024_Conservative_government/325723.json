        "additional_details": "In the past 10 years, 163 people have died in police custody in England & Wales according to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. Of these 163 deaths: 140 were white, 13 were black and 10 were from other minority groups.\r\n\r\nBased on the number of the UK population, if someone is black/minority, they are over 2x more likely to die in police custody. \r\n\r\nNo-one should die in police custody. Paramedics should be the first port of call for mental health. Restraining suspects must not end in death.",
        "background": "We cannot overlook the fact that people continue to die in police custody. A high percentage of those that do, have mental health problems and or have been brutally mistreated. \r\n\r\nThe arrest of mentally unstable people and brutality against *suspected* criminals must change before it\u2019s too late.",

Using excessive force would constitute assault, and police could be prosecuted for this offence.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if someone dies in police custody, charges can be brought against individual police officers for assault, manslaughter or murder. Decisions about whether to bring any charges would be a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nReview the use of force against BAME people by the police: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/329599\r\n\r\nRequire police to capture Body Worn Video in all interactions with the public: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/324133\r\n\r\nMake failing to stop or report misconduct by other police officers an offence: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/323802\r\n\r\nRequire all police forces to conduct Unconscious Bias psychometric testing: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/325398\r\n\r\nAll police officers to undergo mandatory de-escalation training every year: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/321185\r\n\r\nIf you want the Government to take a specific action which is not covered by the above you could start a new petition, but it would need to be clear what action you want the Government to take."
