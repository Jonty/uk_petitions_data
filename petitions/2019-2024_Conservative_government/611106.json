        "additional_details": "Every day, instead of waking up feeling happy, you can often feel miserable when you think about all the homework you have to do even after you have trudged through 6 hours of school. You are supposed to rest when you get back from school, so you are bright and ready for school in the morning. So instead of performing at a B to C level because you had to stay up late to finish an essay, you perform at an A level after getting to bed on time.",
        "background": "Work set to do at home, otherwise known as 'homework' shall be terminated. The choice to set homework is not optional. It is illegal to set any type of homework. This includes private schools. Revision for end of year exams and GCSE s and A levels will still be allowed.",
