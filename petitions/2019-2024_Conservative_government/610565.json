        "additional_details": "In my past work I have been involved in the Asylum system and I know that housing 200,000 refugees is not possible without the UK people's help. A new temporary system should be created that allows the people of the UK to house Ukrainians fleeing their homes. We overcame COVID with new quick measures to save ourselves, lets do this to save them. We may not be able to or want to pick up a weapon from here but we can put an arm around those that need us and provide them shelter.",
        "background": "The UK has quite rightly said it will help Ukrainian families and refugees fleeing the Ukraine due to the Russian invasion. This petition is asking government to review current processes to allow UK families to volunteer in housing Ukrainian families and refugees if they have the space to do so.",
