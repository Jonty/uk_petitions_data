        "additional_details": "Recently, prices of puppies have risen to extortionate amounts, for example a cockapoo puppy in 2019 would sell for around \u00a3900 these same puppies are now selling at between 2500 and 4000GPB.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we live amongst cruel people who will use these new prices to their advantage and to make profit despite the retribution of their acts. The prices will see it that more puppy farming will take place and more pets will unfortunately be stolen.",
        "background": "Over the last year, breeders have increased the prices of puppies by an extortionate amount. More and more puppies and dogs are being stolen so they can be sold for very very high prices. This petition demands the breeders to sell puppies at the correct rate and that there are breed price bandings.",
