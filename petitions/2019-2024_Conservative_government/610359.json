You can find out how to claim compensation if your vehicle has been damaged by a road here: https://www.gov.uk/claim-for-damage-to-your-vehicle\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do to make it easier to claim compensation for damage caused by potholes."
