        "additional_details": "'Length of time taken from booking to the appointment itself' has already widely been misrepresented as a 'waiting time' as it fails to capture patients given no option to book at all/in advance - or patient preference or urgency. Judging performance using invalid data and non-contractual govt 'expectations' may lead to reduced pre-bookable offerings at the expense of both patient convenience and appropriate triage; worsening 8am booking pressures and demand generally and delaying urgent care.",
        "background": "Stop the release of this data and the narrative of it as a performance indicator as this is extremely misleading and could have unintended consequences of increasing inappropriate demand and practices having to reduce patient convenience and quality care provision to avoid unfair media criticism.",
