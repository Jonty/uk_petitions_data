The case may be the same here, with a potential 7,500 deaths from COVID-19 in UK care homes.\r\nThe public deserve to know the disaster that the disease is causing and how it's impacting Britons. Releasing these stats will help make the public more aware on the state of the spread in Britain.",

The government has been releasing statistics of cases & deaths from the disease, of individuals in hospitals, but not cases & deaths in places outside hospitals. The government should include every case and death in the country in the stats.",
