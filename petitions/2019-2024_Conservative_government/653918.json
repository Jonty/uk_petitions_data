        "additional_details": "in these times of austerity it is yet another unjustified hardship placed on the public/consumer for the sole benefit of the insurers, no insurer can specify why the extra premium forced on a consumer for a \"no fault accident \" benefits anyone or reduces any accidents! it is purely for extra profit over an extended period of years, the consumer has no option other than pay it and no recourse to claim it back from the person causing the accident !",
        "background": "anyone who is hit , by a third party and it is not their fault are still penalised by the vehicle insurance providers under the guise of a no fault claim which must be notified to them, this incurs an extra insurance premium over 4 years that the non responsible person has to pay !",
