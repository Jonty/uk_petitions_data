        "additional_details": "I feel it\u2019s unfair that a lot of people have had to use the grant money to live off, yet takeaways, construction company\u2019s with offices etc have all had grants for premises and were allowed to work almost immediately and worked all the way through.  \r\nThis was practically a gift to them and Takeaway businesses have been booming. Speaking to other business owners that are still closed, it\u2019s unfair we cannot return to work now on the 4th of July and won\u2019t receive any further financial help",
        "background": "Although funding has been very generous for the uk, business owners that are unable to work are still having to pay bills and premises especially the self employed only receiving 80% of profit and not gross like the employed",
