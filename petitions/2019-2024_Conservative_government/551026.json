        "additional_details": "The Portsmouth defence is defined as justifying \u201cassault brought on by an alleged sexual approach by the victim or another person which so angered them that they assaulted the individual concerned\u201d. The Portsmouth defence, whilst now obsolete, is too big a risk to leave - with only CPS guidance advising against its use, a pre-emptive ban must be put into law.\r\nThe use of the Portsmouth defence has already been formally banned elsewhere. The UK should follow these examples.",
        "background": "This petition calls for Parliament to formally ban use of the Portsmouth defence as while it is obsolete, it is too big a risk to leave usable in our courts.",
