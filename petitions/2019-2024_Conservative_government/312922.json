        "additional_details": "The government has announced many financial rescue packages for people who are unable to work during the pandemic. I think that those who continue to work as front line workers and only receive minimum wage should be paid a bonus during the pandemic in order to reward their essential work and to give some financial compensation for the risk they are taking to their own health.",
        "background": "Frontline key workers continue to provide essential services to the public. Many such workers take significant health risks in particular care workers. Many receive minimum wage which seems unfair considering that they are providing essential services.",
