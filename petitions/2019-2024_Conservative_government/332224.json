        "action": "Reopen universities fully in September, as opposed to partial or online learning",
        "additional_details": "As lockdown is easing further, the UK government has announced the reopening of schools, hair salons, cinemas, and theme parks, to name but a few. However, universities across the UK have still not been deemed safe to either partially or fully reopen, despite tens of thousands of students still being expected to pay their full tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative for the livelihood of both the universities and students that unis are reopened and full learning is properly restored.",
        "background": "Instead of unis announcing that they are partially reopening or continuing with online learning, they should be allowed to fully reopen and restore a pre-lockdown standard of learning and access, with the appropriate health and safety measures in place, which have been put in place everywhere else",
