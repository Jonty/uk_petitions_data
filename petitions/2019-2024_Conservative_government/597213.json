        "additional_details": "The recent cull of 1428 white sided dolphins represents a loss of about 1 in every 150 of this species globally, a huge impact. The practice demonstrates a complete disregard for nature which is linked to behaviours that threaten our long term existence. By not actively opposing this, other efforts to protect the environment made by businesses and individuals feel futile by comparison. The continued practice also may legitimise other\u2019s negative behaviours toward our environment.",
