        "additional_details": "Because campaigning this solely would not gain the attention or addressed notoriety in comparison to putting this through parliament, this is a crucial campaign in the same respect as the partial reimbursement from university halls treatment of paying students during the pandemic. \r\nIf this petition is put through parliament it may receive the fair judgement to enforce such reimbursement, that is truly deserved to the students of universities.",
        "background": "Enforce the university to subsidize the total tuition fee for universities across the country. Due to the pandemic university experience has not been the same, it is crucial that students pay for the \"full uni experience\" which has not been met during the corona virus.",
