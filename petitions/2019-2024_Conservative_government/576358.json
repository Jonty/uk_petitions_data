        "additional_details": "It makes no sense to risk teachers and support staff as opening schools will see parents going back to normal and this would potentially mean spread of the virus amongst those not yet vaccinated. \r\nOpening schools should mean vaccinating staff or risk a generation of educational professionals being disillusioned as the only front line workers to be excluded when protecting their health and wellbeing.",
        "background": "Safeguard our Teachers by allowing them to receive the covid vaccine if you plan to risk their health by reopening schools on 8 March 2021. SEND services have received support as council employees. They are front line key workers like any other health and social care staff.",
