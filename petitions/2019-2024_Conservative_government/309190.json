A lot of assignment work is based on practical, in college assessment and work that we now won\u2019t be able to carry out. This will have a negative effect on our grades overall as many BTEC students will have no basis for their assignments from which they will be graded on. Ultimately meaning that our grades at the end of this year will not be an accurate representation of our true academic ability.",
