        "additional_details": "Since March 2020 the USA has denied people travelling from the U.K. entry via Presidential Proclamation due to high COVID numbers and low vaccination rates. These two components have now flipped yet the travel ban is still in effect in May 2021. This makes NO sense and doesn\u2019t follow current data. It\u2019s effecting peoples mental health and well-being by needlessly keeping people separated for no reason when we have all the right resources to reopen a transatlantic travel corridor safely.",
        "background": "Demand that the US join the U.K. in showing global leadership by opening a travel corridor between the two countries, reuniting loved ones with family and friends safely by following covid compliance ending this ridiculous travel ban that Biden reimposed and hasn\u2019t even given a timeline for.",
