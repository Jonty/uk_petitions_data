        "action": "Oppose Israeli annexation of the West Bank",
        "additional_details": "Israel\u2019s government is now planning annexation of the West Bank and Trump\u2019s administration in the USA is also encouraging Israel to take most of the land in the West Bank, if not all of it.  This plan is entirely against the human rights of the Palestinians, against international law and numerous international judgements. It will be a decisive next step in the dispossession of Palestinians.  Israel has no intention of giving the Palestinians equal rights or a vote; this annexation will cement in the apartheid inequalities already created by the Israeli occupation.",
        "background": "We call on our representatives to make to take a clear stand based on human rights and respect for international humanitarian law and make it clear both to Israel and to the United States that Israeli annexation of the West Bank is not acceptable.",
