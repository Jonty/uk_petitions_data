We are no longer \u201cpregnant women\u201d but \u201cpregnant people\u201d. We don\u2019t \u201cbreast feed\u201d we \u201cchest feed\u201d. And now \u201cwomen\u201d don\u2019t have menopause, \u201cpeople\u201d do? This is a breach of human rights and women\u2019s rights to the core. Everyone has a right to be who they want to be and do what they want to do. But the day we take away something that is biological fact is the day we have gone too far. Women create babies. Women have periods. Women have menopause. Women breast feed. Don\u2019t take away my rights as a woman.",
        "background": "Why must we remove women\u2019s rights to give equal rights? Gender equality is a very important issue, however this does not mean that we can demean or take away from the rights of women/females. Stop the NHS removing the word \u201cwoman\u201d from their vocabulary.",
