        "additional_details": "I am a recently single mother, with a 3 year old and and new baby. Just finished a degree and I am receiving MA, however this has made me worse off financially. When I spoke to UC to say I would return to work (as I would be better off) as this is not deducted pound for pound they replied with they would still deduct the money from MA I was entitled too even if I was not claiming it. This is outrageous, working mothers in the UK are being penalised and this must change if not for me for the next",
        "background": "The UK government must enable a more equitable system for mothers claiming Maternity Allowence. It is unfair that MA is treated as unearned income and leaves mothers worse off financially. UC penalise us and prevent us from returning to work while being entitled to MA.",
