        "additional_details": "I want pupils to get back what they should have been entitled to during term time if it had been a normal school year. When these pupils were in Year 1 they missed out on these meals between March 2020 & June 2020 then once they returned as Year 2 pupils in September again they missed out on the meals between January 2021 & March 2021. Some parents are not entitled to extra funding so rely on the fact that all infant state school pupils are entitled to free school meals.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to extend free school meals for all current Year 2 pupils during term time for another year. (September 2021 - September 2022.) These children have missed out on meals they should have been entitled to from the Government due to home learning and lockdown.",
