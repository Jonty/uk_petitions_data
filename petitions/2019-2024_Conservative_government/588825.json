As a working mum, I would love to avoid this and keep him home for 10 days but that\u2019s not possible. After the 4th test, I\u2019ve now started to question 1) what is happening with vaccinations for young children 2) is there a less intrusive test that can be used (copious amounts of saliva won\u2019t work for toddlers) and 3) could we say they only get tested if they have 2 or more symptoms?",
        "background": "I\u2019ve just taken my 19 month old son for his 4th Covid test. He started nursery in November and has picked up numerous bugs which have given him a temperature. Bugs are good for children\u2019s immune systems but why is nobody talking about the subsequent impact they have in terms of Covid?",
