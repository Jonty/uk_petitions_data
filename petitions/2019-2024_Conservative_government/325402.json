        "additional_details": "The history of black people have been erased in our country and it is not right, people in our country are not being taught about the racism that occurred here, e.g. the murder of Stephen Lawrence, and that is still occurring here making people believe that the UK is exempt to racism when that is not the case. By teaching our children, it will bring awareness to the oppression, discrimination and lack of protection that these community face in their day to day life and we can stop that.",
        "background": "This petition is to call for British Black History to be made mandatory throughout schools in the UK. Despite the role Britain had in  colonialising black counties and the growing population of people of colour and mixed children continues, it is a shock that it is not part of our education system.",
