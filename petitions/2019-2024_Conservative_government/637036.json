        "additional_details": "Update planning policy around creation of private outdoor space for already converted flats. Policies need to give weight to the quality of life enhancement it brings to the owners in brent as I have applied several times and the refusal baffles myself, my architects and planning consultants.\r\nFirst floor flats without access to private outdoor space need to have clear guidance on creation of this space and this needs to be seen as a positive addition and as bringing it up to modern standards.",
        "background": "Planning policy for flat conversions takes into consideration creation of private outdoor space however policy about alterations or additions to already converted flats is lacking and these benefits can't be realised. For example, brent policy around creation of roof terraces is inadequate at best.",

We could accept a petition calling for changes to the National Planning Policy Framework, but it would need to be clear what changes you want to be made.\r\n\r\nIf you are concerned about the policies and decisions of your local authority you could raise this with a local councillor who represents you.
