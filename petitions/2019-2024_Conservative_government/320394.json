        "action": "All schools should remain closed until September, or until proven safe to return",
        "additional_details": "Because the current proposals are ludicrous, and will most likely put the youngest children in danger, the schools should be the last to return, not the first, and the government should ensure employers agree to flexible working for all parents and grandparents (once it is safe to do so) to provide adequate childcare. The governments current proposals are just a way to get parents back to work with little regard for the safety of the children, families and teaching staff.",
        "background": "Eldest Children should return first (exam years11,12&13) as they are able to follow social distancing, gradually followed by the younger years. Primary Schools should be the last to return, \r\nand this should be September at the earliest for all years, except exam years (via safe Social Distancing)",
