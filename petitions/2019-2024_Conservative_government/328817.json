        "additional_details": "We want the government to change its decision and allow Beauty salons and nail bars across the UK to reopen. This is because people rely on these facilities to help with making them feel good and it massively helps with mental health and well being. Allowing pubs to re open where there is far more risk involved than in a salon where we have maximum hygiene procedures in place. Beauty Businesses will suffer if they do not open soon, many salons will not survive this if they are to stay closed",
        "background": "The goal is to get the government to rethink their decision to keep beauty salons and nail bars closed and to come to an agreement to reopen them. As many people rely on beauty and salon services as part of therapy or a source of happiness I think it would be beneficial for all to reopen them.",
