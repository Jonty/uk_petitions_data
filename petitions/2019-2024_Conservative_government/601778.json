Actually, it is not. The government should cap prices to \u00a350/certificate and create a portal that allows for an even quicker way to create certificates for vets so that practices can no longer justify charging \u00a3200/certificate.",
        "background": "Since Brexit, travelling in and out of the UK has become even more difficult and expensive. Pets passport was a one time cost of \u00a360. Now vets are carghing \u00a3150-\u00a3200/certificate, and even more for rushed service. The government should cap the prices to protect consumers from vets' absurd charges",
