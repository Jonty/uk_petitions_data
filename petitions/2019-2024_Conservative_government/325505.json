        "action": "Ban the prohibition of wearing face masks in school",
        "additional_details": "I want parliament to instruct schools that that the choice to wear or not wear face masks in the school environment should be left to personal choice until such a time as government make it mandatory. Prohibiting the use of face masks may have detrimental effects on children\u2019s health both physically and mentally. Scientific evidence is changing to show it can reduce transmission of Covid especially in the pre-symptomatic stage. This decision is against civil liberties and needs to be reversed.",
        "background": "Currently some schools are prohibiting the use of face masks for students and teachers. This should not be a mandated prohibition. This should be personal choice. Health decisions should be made by individuals and not by the school administrators.",
