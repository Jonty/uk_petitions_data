        "additional_details": "Trans people are one of the most vulnerable groups in society and face discrimination and violence at a disproportionate rate. Especially considering the consultation yielded overwhelming support in favour of improving trans people\u2019s lives, the government has a duty to follow through, no matter the personal views of the individuals within the party. Trans lives are as valuable as any other person\u2019s and deserve to be treated accordingly.",
        "background": "The government have decided to scrap the results of the consultation regarding the Gender Recognition Act because they \u201cbelieve the results were skewed by an avalanche of responses generated by trans rights groups.\u201d, which is blatantly undemocratic. They MUST act on the results.",
