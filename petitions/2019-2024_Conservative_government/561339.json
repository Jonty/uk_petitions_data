        "additional_details": "As I'm sure there are many other ways in which to recuperate funds in said \"budget hole\" then enforcing this new \"idea\". If this were to be put into place, thousands of road users would no longer be on the road which would have a massive impact in said idea. Some people from poorer backgrounds simply could not afford to make journey's to see family, make distance journey's for medical reasons, for work purposes, the list goes on. The whole idea would backfire due to peoples lack of income.",
        "background": "To over rule the ridiculous idea of charging vehicle users a 'per mile charge' spoken about by Rishi Sunak to \"fill a government budget hole\". The idea of this is completely immoral and would mean many a people who rely on cars for their work to feed their families would be out of a job.",
