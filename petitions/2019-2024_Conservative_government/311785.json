        "additional_details": "The base rate is now 0.1% but interest on credit cards and loans are up to 20% and above. Authorised overdraft rates have just increased to around 30% which is 300 x the base rate. Incredibly it now costs the same to have an authorised overdraft as unauthorised. Pressure is also being applied to force people to reduce their credit card borrowing by paying more. Without the excessive interest charges the same monthly payment would soon reduce the level of public debt and help those most in need.",
        "background": "Cap interest rates charged on credit cards, loans and overdrafts at 5% over base rate so that the banks would still make large profits (they receive commissions from retailers and cash withdrawals in addition) but the levels of public debt would be reduced.",
