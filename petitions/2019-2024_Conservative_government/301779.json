It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death.\r\nWe have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus. This is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus.\r\nAnd we have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled, at the same time.  \r\nWHO has been in full response mode since we were notified of the first cases.  \r\nAnd we have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action.\r\nWe have rung the alarm bell loud and clear.",
