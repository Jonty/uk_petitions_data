        "additional_details": "However I also realised that postponing BTECS will waste students time as some students might want to go university straight after college or sixth form, so i thought of an alternative for such as cancelling 1-2 units for BTECS as we won't have the ability to reach our academic maximum with less time then previous students and same work load. This will allow BTEC students progress in many ways. Many BTEC students around the country are confused on what is happening with BTECS.",
        "background": "I want the government to consider postponing BTECS because students won't recieve support needed from teachers and some student don't have have have software needed to complete assigned task and some students might not have computers to laptops to do work on.",
