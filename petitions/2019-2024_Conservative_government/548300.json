        "additional_details": "Almost 40% of A-level assessments have been downgraded, impacting the futures of thousands of young people. This can\u2019t be right. For many pupils, the algorithm doesn\u2019t even consider what our own teachers predicted we\u2019d get and There isn\u2019t a proper appeals process. Worst of all, pupils from public and state schools are due to get automatically marked down because of where they live and the school they go to, with their individual efforts totally disregarded.",
        "background": "I\u2019m calling for Boris Johnson and to help ease the discourse surrounding results by taking into accountability our teachers predictions, as they are a fair judge of our character, not downgrade our results based on if our school is state or private, and create a free appeal process",
