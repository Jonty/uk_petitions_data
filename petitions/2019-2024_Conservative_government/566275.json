        "additional_details": "The clinical trials are undertaken for a reason. The UK has already been criticised by the manufacturer (Pfizer) themselves for not following the clinical trial data. The UK government is taking a huge risk, they do not know the efficacy of this 12 week dosage interval. I am personally not happy that I have received the first dose with the intention to get the second dose 3 weeks after as per the product license, for it to be changed by the government.",
        "background": "Please reconsider the recent advice which had been published about changing the vaccine dosing regimen from 21 days which is recommended by the Pfizer manufacturer to 12 week. There have been no trials undertaken to prove the efficacy when the dosage interval for the vaccine is 12 weeks.",
