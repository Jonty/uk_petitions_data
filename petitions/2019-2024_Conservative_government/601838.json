        "additional_details": "To ban them. They are pollutant and are a nuinsance for the public. With COVID numbers increasing most people are back working at home. But working at home becomes impossible due to the noise.\r\n\r\nMost mid-range leaf blowers, can expose users to up to 112 decibels. The low-frequency sound they emit fades slowly over long distances or through building walls. Even at 800 meters away, a conventional leaf blower is still over the 55 dB limit considered safe by the World Health Organization.",
        "background": "The inefficient gas engines typically used on leaf blowers generate large amounts of air pollution and particulate matter.  The noise they generate can lead to serious hearing problems, including permanent hearing loss.",
