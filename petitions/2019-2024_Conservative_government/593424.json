        "action": "Do not make Covid 19 vaccinations mandatory for students to attend university.",
        "additional_details": "I believe that this demand goes directly against the concept of body autonomy and as a result, I will be deprived of my dream to learn and experience university. This is a very unfair request as many individuals currently feel uncomfortable with taking the vaccine however this should not mean that we suffer as a result, especially in regard to education. I want to continue to achieve well in my academic life in order to eventually make the world a better place for all. Please do not ruin that.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to not make Covid 19 vaccinations mandatory for students, like myself, to attend university lectures and be present on campus. This should not be a requirement and instead, the use of PCR tests should be the solution to ensure safe learning environments.",
