So many agencies pocket a big chunk of what they charge, and most will agree it\u2019s absolutely disgusting, unnecessary and inhumane! Please help us bring this issue to Parliament/Government to ensure there is a cap on how much agency can earn off these vulnerable people, but also help us ensure all carers are being paid correctly\u00a0and\u00a0fairly for the job and hours we are working!",
