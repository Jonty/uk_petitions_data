        "additional_details": "Because all non league clubs need the money and they need it now before it is too late. These clubs provide a great source of entertainment, community cohesion and most importantly the opportunity for players from the very young to the older players to keep fit and keep occupied and ensure good mental well-being.\r\n\r\nIt is a no brainer when all around big groups are congregating at cricket, the beaches, protests etc.",
        "background": "To allow non league football fans back watching football as fans are the lifeblood of the non league clubs. Without fans, many clubs will cease to exist as their revenue has been cut but outgoing costs still exist.",
