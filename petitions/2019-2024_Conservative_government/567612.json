        "additional_details": "Schools and children have faced unprecedented challenges due to Covid. The education secretary, working with the unions and the standards and assessment agency should produce clear criteria for robust assessment of children in core subjects: Maths, Reading and Writing. Teacher assessments should only be used to inform next steps for learning, as children and schools cannot be judged against any norms in the current circumstances, where their education has been interrupted for a sustained period.",
        "background": "The Education Secretary should cancel SATs this year, to avoid putting schools and children under additional pressure. Teachers\u2019 assessments should only be used for schools to identify needs, share with children and parents and inform the next stage in their education.",
