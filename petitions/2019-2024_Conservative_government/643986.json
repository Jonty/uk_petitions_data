        "additional_details": "It appears that we are approaching dog attacks in the incorrect way, banning one breed will start the breed of another maybe more powerful dog, it is illegal to drive a car without a licence as it is having a child and not sending them to school therefore why is it allowed to own a dog without a licence and without proper education?",
        "background": "Introduce dog licenses as other countries do and regulate that owners attend training classes to ensure that the owner and their dog are educated. It should also be made illegal for dogs to walk in public places without a lead.",
