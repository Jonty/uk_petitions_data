        "additional_details": "Since austerity began over a decade ago, Our Health Workers have seen real world reductions in wages, year on year. During the CV-19 pandemic, they proved themselves to be fundamental to UK Society. Remuneration should be commensurate with daily efforts and sacrifices. They are risking death to keep the people of the UK alive. A Thursday applause is not sufficient recognition. Their wages should be increased immediately to compensate and future wage level increased, relative to other UK workers.",
        "background": "Increase the wages of our NHS, Emergency & Care Workers immediately, to compensate for a decade's lack of relative pay increases and commit to sustained, above inflation increases over the next decade, in order to financially elevate them to the position in society, they have proved they deserve.",
