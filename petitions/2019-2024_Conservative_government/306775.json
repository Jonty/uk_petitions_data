        "additional_details": "It is a stressing time for everyone in the UK, but we must maintain some sort of routine and social justice regardless of spending; citizens need to stop buying in such unnecessary hoards and be made to exist a normality which does not deprive both young, senior and disabled citizens the chance to buy what they need. The government has acted slow thus far, enforce a limitation to help decrease the anxiety people face from each other, let alone the COVID-19 pandemic!",
        "background": "In light of COVID-19, citizens are stocking up on supplies to endure the coming months of quarantine; however, that does not excuse people to over-buy and render others with lesser resources; settling for little to no supplies. The government must enforce a limitation on buying food goods in shops.",
