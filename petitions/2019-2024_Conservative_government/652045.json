        "action": "Revoke changes to the benefits system, which deny vulnerable people benefits.",
        "additional_details": "Many disabled and sick people are unable to work. When you are unable to earn money to feed, clothe and house yourself you are in a very vulnerable position. Cutting off income to people whose bodies do not allow them to work is inhumane and will lead to extreme poverty, homelessness and starvation. The UK can do better than this. Those who cannot support themselves must be supported. The DWP have a history of abusing benefit sanctions and this must be stopped. All lives matter, disabled or not.",
        "background": "Revoke the changes to the benefits system, which will cut off vulnerable people from receiving social security, if they cannot find a job they are able to do in 18 months, or attend the government's mandatory placement. This is dangerous and discriminates against sick and disabled UK citizens.",
