        "additional_details": "Its a Monday night and at just after 12.30am the fireworks in and around my residential area have only just subsided. It's Diwali which by all means I respect but the fact I have been consoling my terrified dog for over 6 hours seems unreasonable as i have been doing this for the past several days and will continue to. The 1am cut off for fireworks seems highly inconsiderate. Residents have work, pets, babies and children all of whom are affected by this continues display of deafening fireworks.",
        "background": "Change the time you can set fireworks to a time much more socially acceptable for example 11pm. NYE is understandable an exception as it is 1 evening a year but for celebrations such a Diwali which run over several days it seems more respectful to have an earlier cut off time.",
