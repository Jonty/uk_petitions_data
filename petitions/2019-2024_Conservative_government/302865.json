        "additional_details": "The main reason I believe parents should get a choice is because what if the schoolchild has a sibling or parent (or even grandparent) in the high risk category? Exposing them to COVID-19 means it's almost certain they will pass it on to their vulnerable relative. Or what if the child themselves is in the high risk category? We are the parents and we should ultimately be the ones to make the decision regarding our childrens health. If necessary, keep schools open but give parents the choice!",
        "background": "I initially thought the best course of action was to close all schools. While that probably still is the best course of action, the very least that should be done is to give parents the power to choose whether they wish to send their children to school or not without worry of fines or court action.",
