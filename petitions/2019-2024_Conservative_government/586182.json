        "action": "The Electorate demands rolling CRB, Credit Scoring &  Toxicology Tests for MPs.",
        "additional_details": "The Electorate deserves leaders who pay more than lip service to The Nolan principles. By using the same tools as the Finance sector, we can go some way to ensuring that our politicians are free from criminal influence. Consideration should also be given to Blood/Alcohol levels whilst in the chamber. We deserve sober politicians making decisions that have global consequences. I would lose my job if I was under the influence, why are our MPs not employed under the same terms?",
        "background": "In most workplaces where people are employed in a position of trust, and especially in the Banking Sector, Background, Credit and Toxicology tests are required. It is time our Leaders are held to the same standards, to reflect the responsibilities they are trusted with by their constituents.",
