        "additional_details": "Not enough research has been taken as many children have not yet returned to school. Once schools are taking a higher number of children only then will we know if it is safe. For those who wish to and able to continue homeschooling they should have the right to continue to do so until schools are proven safe. We do not yet know the long term affects of the virus for children and the risks they could cause to the vulnerable. Subjecting children to induced illness is unlawful and inhumane.",

We as parents have the right to keep our children safe and should not be penalised by fines or risk Childs placement at school should we choose to homeschool.",
