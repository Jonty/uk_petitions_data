        "additional_details": "As well as having a pared-down university experience, students are going through lonely, frightening experiences which are likely to take a toll on their mental health.  They're having to pay around \u00a320,000 a year for this experience.\r\n\r\nMy daughter is doing a degree at the National Centre of Circus Arts which requires hours and hours of physical training.  From February, there was no physical training and now it's minimal.  She's having to pay even more money to train in other places.  She's really not getting what she's paying for.",
        "background": "I want the government to recognise that students have had a really raw deal and are not getting value for their money.  I want them to cancel repayments for all the loans that students have taken out for this academic year and the last academic year.",
