        "action": "Criminalise the use of automated 'bot' software towards extorting shoppers.",
        "additional_details": "A 'bot' is an easy-to-acquire and easy-to-use piece of software that allows users to navigate online checkouts many times faster than humans. Unlike people, bots can also tirelessly refresh product web pages 24/7 to make sure it is the first in line when a sought-after item becomes available. \r\n\r\nThis leaves honest tax-paying shoppers empty handed - or worse, obliged to pay multiples of the item's RRP - while unscrupulous and tax-avoiding scalpers reap a profit, and gloat online.",
        "background": "The government should introduce legislation requiring retailers to introduce anti-bot software on their e-commerce websites.\r\n\r\nThe government should also consider prosecuting those who mark up and re-sell sought-after items acquired with bots, on grounds of extortion and/or tax evasion.",
