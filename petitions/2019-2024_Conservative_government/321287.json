        "additional_details": "Many of us agree that our children\u2019s lives are much more important that their attendance at school or their education at this moment in time. They are capable of studying at home as witnessed already. We know that children are less likely to get this deadly disease however it is still wrong to put their lives at risk. Children can spread this disease to people around them that could have serious health issues. By keeping schools shut the spread will be minimised and lives will be saved.",
        "background": "The government should consider keeping schools shut for the rest of this academic year and reopen again as normal in September. They should still remain open for the children of key worker but only if it is absolutely necessary for them to attend.",
