        "additional_details": "A recent incident involved off-road bikes killing a working sheepdog and riding away without stopping. Cyclists can be seen running red lights or a stop sign, failing to yield the right of way, not obeying directional or traffic control road markings, riding through pedestrian crossings on red lights which can have fatal consequences (see https://www.london.gov.uk/questions/2018/0721 ). Without an identifying numberplate these people can often not be called to account.",
        "background": "Some users of off-road bikes, cycles etc use their vehicles irresponsibly, which in some cases has caused severe injury or death. Traffic laws are not obeyed or vehicles are used where they are not allowed eg scrambler bikes in parks or farmland. Pedestrian/cyclist collisions are well documented.",
