        "additional_details": "So far, the government has taken a minimalistic and reactive approach to combating the SARS-coronavirus-2 outbreak. The phases contain, delay, research, and mitigate, feel like an inevitability. Rather than seriously try to stop the progression into the next phase, the government spends most of it's energy planning for it. Stricter travel restrictions should have been implemented weeks ago, now it is just a case of damage control. But with proactive action, there is still a chance to save lives.",
        "background": "US President Donald Trump has recently cancelled all travel from 26 countries in the Schengen area of Europe, and the United Kingdom should do the same in order to slow the increase in cases of coronavirus (COVID-19). This will lessen the strain on the NHS and reduce the number of casualties.",
