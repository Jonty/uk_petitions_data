While the evidence shows that children are not particularly vulnerable to the effects of the virus, they are certainly able to spread it. It would be selfish to allow these families to put themselves at risk.",

We are still not where we could be with regards to this virus and it would be irresponsible to open the schools, especially since children will spread the virus to their respective households. This will certainly cause problems.",
