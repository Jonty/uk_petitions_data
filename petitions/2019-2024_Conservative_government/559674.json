        "additional_details": "There are no justifications for these mushrooms to be class A - there is more evidence to support their contribution to mental well-being than as a cause of psychosis. There is no evidence of addiction or dependency, unlike heroin or even alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe argument that they can be confused with poisonous mushrooms is fallacious as all mushrooms would have to be made illegal as the same risk applies.",
        "background": "We want the government to decriminalise psilocybin containing mushrooms which are currently classified as class A alongside heroin and cocaine, yet there is no evidence to support the risk of addiction and dependency that other class A drugs can lead to.",
