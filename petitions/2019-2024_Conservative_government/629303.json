        "action": "The UK Government to refrain from introducing vaccine passports and digital ID.",
        "additional_details": "The introduction of vaccine passports would be the start of the process of creating digital identities for citizens. Such digital identities would permit government to exert considerable control over citizens, not only with respect to international travel, but also domestically by restricting access to public and private facilities to those who meet certain criteria, such as vaccination status. \r\nThis would amount to making medical procedures or other requirements mandatory by the back door.",
        "background": "The UK Government should not introduce vaccine passports. Section 23 of the declaration of the 2022 G20 summit, acknowledged the importance of shared standards to facilitate international travel, interoperability and recognizing digital and non-digital solutions, including proof of vaccinations.",
