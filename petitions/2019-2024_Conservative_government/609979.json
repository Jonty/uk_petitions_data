        "additional_details": "Accept Ukrainian nationals as refugees into the UK. Allow all - not just British Passports Holders - the opportunity to be reunited with their families, offer them safety, & a chance to rebuild their lives in safety & security. \r\n\r\nThere are roughly 38,000 Ukrainian nationals living in Britain - supporting all sectors of our economy. There's numerous others from Eastern Europe & wider International Communities with family there too. Be the Britain that showed such love in previous wars in Europe.",
        "background": "Many countries have showed humanity, empathy, & altruism in their response to the war in Ukraine. Many Ukrainian nationals/expats living in the UK have family in the country who have nowhere else to go but to family in the UK.\r\n\r\nOpen up the refugee routes to save these lives.",
