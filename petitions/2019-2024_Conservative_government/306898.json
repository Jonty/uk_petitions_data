        "additional_details": "We are entrepeneurs that make a significant contribution to this country's economy, respect that. Rishi went against the shadow chancellor & trade unions advice, in that claiming should be outside the universal credit system. We will be forced to continue working untill we receive SSP in our bank accounts and thus risk spreading the virus further. The current message we receive is that the self-employed are willfully being left out in the cold by this government, we are an after thought.",
        "background": "15% of UK workforce is self-employed. Chancellor announced that self-employed will receive Statutory Sick Pay  (SSP) at \u00a394/week, accessed via universal credit system. That's 5 week wait & comes with conditions. Make claiming SSP easier by letting us claim via a seperate more efficient HMRC channel.",
