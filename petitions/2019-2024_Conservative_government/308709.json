And not with 'thoughts and prayers' or tweets of support, but in putting cash in their pockets to let them know very clearly how necessary and appreciated they are.",
        "background": "NHS workers are being tested to their maximum, and the COVID-19 pandemic has not even reached its peak on the UK shores. Their current salaries are insufficient, and during this difficult time they should know that they are being looked after financially.",
