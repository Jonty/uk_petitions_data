        "additional_details": "Since the tax has been imposed being a minicab driver has become more difficult, as \u00a311.50 has to be paid once a day every time a driver receives a job request that involve driving through central London.\r\nNow, PHV drivers already pay a per year fee for the vehicle inspection which amounts to \u00a3140 (not counting an eventual recent increase of the fee).\r\nIt doesn\u2019t seem to be fair for drivers to pay the fee, first of all because they don\u2019t go to Central London by their own choice but because the client needs to, and second because they already pay an expensive fee to Transport for London to get their vehicles eye-checked every year.",
        "background": "Ask Transport for London to make a regulation change exempting PHV drivers from paying the Congestion Charges when driving through Central London, as it used to be before April 2019.",
