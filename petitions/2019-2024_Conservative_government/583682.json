        "additional_details": "The average woman spends around \u00a36,000 in her lifetime on tampons and sanitary towels, not including money also spent on pain relief (a further \u00a32,000).\r\nThe NHS spends roughly \u00a368,000 a year on free contraception.\r\nSex and periods; both are equally important and need to be treated as such.",
        "background": "Menstruation is a natural part of life for almost every female on the planet. The fact that women have to spend thousands of pounds on their periods whilst free contraception is handed out is absurd and needs to be changed. Menstruation is a lot harder to refrain from than sex.",
