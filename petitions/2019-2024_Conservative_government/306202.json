Cancelling rent payments for the duration of the Covid-19 virus pandemic would relieve financial pressure of international students. We don\u2019t have any kind of social protection here, all that they had addressed is for citizens. Our health insurance is unreliable. Suppose that we contracted the virus , we got sick , who\u2019s gonna care for us, no one lives with a family. If anything happens to us no insurance at all. Everyone deserve equal rights and equal help by government.Our federal government should act in a similar fashion to Italy\u2019s and mandate the suspension of rent payments during the Coronavirus pandemic.",
