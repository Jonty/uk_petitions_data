        "additional_details": "Ukrainian citizens are suffering under an unprecedented and brutal attack on their country, their freedom and their lives. Many countries, including Ireland, have lifted visa restrictions so Ukrainians fleeing the mayhem can enter a safe country. It is not right to expect Ukrainians to follow the usual bureaucracy of entering the UK, as this is a state of emergency. The easing of measures so far is not enough. Now is the time to offer assistance and sanctuary to people in need.",
        "background": "All Ukrainian nationals should not need to obtain a visa prior to travel to the UK. Ukrainian nationals who arrive in the UK should be permitted to stay for up to 90 days to obtain legal immigration status through work authorization or other residence rights.",
