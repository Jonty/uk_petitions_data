Meaning vaccinated or not you can attend events with unlimited numbers and no longer need to wear a face mask. But tell me why my partner has to sit in a corridor when attending antenatal appointments? Or once put on an postnatal ward my partner can only visit for 4 hours a day? Why can\u2019t I give birth at home? Because many restrictions still won\u2019t allow for this to happen! Remove NHS restrictions for Maternity Services!",

The country has now returned to normal but why are restrictions still in place around the NHS and the maternity services? Why should we allow clubbing when women can\u2019t even have their partner stay on a ward with them?",
