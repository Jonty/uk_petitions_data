        "additional_details": "Many shops are running low on food. There is enough food to supply the country if people don't over/panic buy. In practice, people are buying up their item limits in one store and then moving on to the next or even revisiting the same store later.\r\n\r\nUsing technology to limit this will put a stop to sequence panic buying and keep everyone to a sensible limit by monetary amount in a single day at food shops. This will benefit the millions struggling and open up home delivery for those at home.",
        "background": "Work with credit and debit card companies, and the shops themselves, to impose restrictions on people simply buying their allowance of items in one shop and then moving on to another shop to buy it, and more, again in sequence.\r\n\r\nThis is rationing that could easily be done with tech we have today.",
