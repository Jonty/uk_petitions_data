        "additional_details": "Many small shops (especially food and hospitality related) will suffer enormously after the lockdown is being lifted, trying to get back on their feet financially. Many won't be able open again due still having to pay (although they can't make money) their biggest fixed cost - RENT. Landords, if not  instructed by government /law otherwise, will get 100% of the rents one way or the other (forcing the business take out a risky loan, withdrawing deposits, mounting debts etc). They're the winners?!",
        "background": "Small businesses which can not operate/trade from their physical premises whilst being shut due covid 19 are still expected to pay commercial rents in full. Please implement a law which will make landords to share 'the financial pain', ideally 50/50 with the tenant; a) whilst the lockdown OR after.",
