In January 2020 the DIO erected new gates and extra fencing so they could enclose part of the ranges named \u201cAsh Range Complex\u201d or \u201cRange Floors\u201d. They then subsequently closed this to the public. This makes accessibility to the open parts of the ranges by local residents difficult.",
