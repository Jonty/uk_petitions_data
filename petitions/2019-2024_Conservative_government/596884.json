        "additional_details": "I have seen miscarriage of justice first hand and police manipulated the press with lies and false information to cast doubt on an accused and hinder any chance of future appeal at at poss retrial . There for it will be an unfair trial if an appeal goes through . Especially if the accused maintains there innocent and has new evidence to help in the appeal . However the press have already printed lies and made false allegations which In turn will definitely have a impact on a fair retrial . This should not be allowed everyone should have the chance to a fair trial / retrial and the chance to maintain there innocence until conviction and after there\u2019s been a final decision on the appeal . Only then should the accused details of the person should be made public . After conviction .",
