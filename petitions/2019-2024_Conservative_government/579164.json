        "action": "Legalise Pepper Spray in the UK as a Form of Self Defence",
        "additional_details": "Women are being kidnapped, murdered and assaulted. Young people are being stabbed. Elderly are being attacked in their homes. The current law states that you may only defend yourself with reasonable force. How is someone at a physical deficit able to defend themselves with reasonable force? They can\u2019t, so we need the legalisation of pepper spray to come into effect. If the police can\u2019t protect all of us, we need to protect ourselves against the ever increasing crime in our once safe country",
        "background": "We call onto the government to consider an amendment to Section 5(1)(b) of the Firearms Act 1968 to allow use of controlled amounts of pepper spray to be used by vulnerable individuals as a deterrent and form of self defence",
