I'm starting to feel like an introvert because i dont leave my room just revising. As I'm a muslim ramadan meets easter holidays this year, fasting and revising at the same time is a problem and im writing this on 2:55 am because i just finished revision and im still not confident enough about the end of yeas exams.",
