        "additional_details": "The two means suggested as driving licenses or passports.  A passport can cost up to \u00a385 (or \u00a375 for an online application).  A new driving license costs at least \u00a343 on paper and \u00a334 for an online application.  This can be higher depending on the circumstances.  Making the possession of one or the other mandatory for voting effectively introduces a poll tax, makes people much less likely to vote and may make it impossible for some people to vote.",
        "background": "Under plans announced in the Queens Speech, the government wants to introduce photo identification requirements for people trying to vote to solve a non-existent problem of voter fraud.  This is profoundly undemocratic and looks very like deliberate voter suppression of a kind common in the USA.",
