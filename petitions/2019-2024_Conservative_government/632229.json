        "additional_details": "E.g there are stories of people waiting ages in hospital to be seen. As a junior doctor on 12 hour shift I could see 12-15 patients. Each sheet of paper & form must have the patients full name, date of birth & hospital number. To fully label 6 sheets of paper & 7-10 forms takes 5-7 minutes. A \u00a330 labels printer printing off 30 labels on admission can cut that time to 1 minute saving 72-90 minutes per shift so you can see 2-3 more patients! They may not do that partly for this reason.",
        "background": "In many government departments if you don't spend your allocated budget this financial year, you don't get the money the following year. This commonly leads to overspending & wastage of public money. Those trying to save money can be fired thus many are too afraid to do so. This must be changed.",
