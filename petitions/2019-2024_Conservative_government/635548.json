        "additional_details": "Annabel Goldie, Minister of State for Defence, recently announced the UK\u2019s intention to supply depleted uranium armour piercing shells to Ukraine. Ukraine is a major exporter of agricultural products and polluting its farmland would render its crops unusable. Although more expensive, armour piercing shells made with tungsten alloys are just as effective and don\u2019t pollute the environment for generations to come.",
        "background": "When depleted uranium shells explode, the uranium goes to fine powder. When it is breathed in or otherwise ingested it can cause cancer. Increased cases of cancer have been observed in NATO troops and citizens of Iraq and the former Yugoslavia, where these weapons have been used.",
