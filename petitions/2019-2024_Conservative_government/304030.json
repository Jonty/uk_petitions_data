        "additional_details": "\"The PM has advised the public to turn their back on the NTE & Events sector and save the Insurance companies the expense of an 'official closure'. Thousands of businesses will close their doors, and hundreds of thousands of jobs will be lost across many sectors, leaving many in financial difficulty. We ask that the government support an 'official closure' of pubs, clubs , restaurants and social gatherings so that businesses don't suffer, and can rely on business interruption insurance'",
        "background": "We demand that government make a decision to 'Officially Close' Pubs, Clubs, Restaurants and Social Gatherings as part of the social 'distancing strategy' rather than decimate businesses within the sector, placing many owners at risk and unable to claim insurance through business interruption.",
