Often these accidents are fatal ,and it's been known that these are online before all next of kin have been informed. \r\n\r\nWhy any news publication thinks it is right to post horrific photos just to gain extra clicks on their website is beyond belief,nobody needs to see these photos. \r\n\r\nMore respect needs to be given in these sensitive cases.",
