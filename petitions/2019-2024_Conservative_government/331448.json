It even says on the packaging of some that this will not protect you from covid-19.\r\n\r\nThe government websites and guidance literature has often said that masks provide very little protection.",
        "background": "Recently it was mandated that a mask be worn on public transport and very shortly inside shops also. Even though those who are most vulnerable with health conditions are exempt from wearing them. Yet healthy people are required to do so, I don't believe this makes sense.",
