        "additional_details": "The time during lockdown is the time lost in class.Online classes are available but the vital, valuable teaching aspect is still being missed. Learning may not seem different, but for BTEC, GCSE and A Level pupils, self teaching is increasingly challenging and requires more hours than an average school day. The enhanced pressure on students means less time for ensuring positive mental health, extra work and revision and will create unrepresentative results in 2021 which will define their future.",
        "background": "Recognise the significance on the education lost in year 5, 10 and 12 due to COVID-19 and the enhanced impact it will have on the A Level and GCSE grades in 2021. This then should be reflected in the examinations which will be sat next summer, potentially postponing them or changing their format.",
