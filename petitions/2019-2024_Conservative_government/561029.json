For some of us, December is the only time in the year we get to see and celebrate with our family members.\r\n\r\nDue to Second Lockdown and restrictions in travel, December 2020 is looking less cheerful if you forbid us to travel for Christmas. As there is a lot of uncertainty regarding the end of the second lockdown, please allow at least international travel to see our family members.\r\n\r\nHelps us make December 2020 a little better by not forcing us to cancel our holidays during Christmas Season.\r\n\r\nThank you",
