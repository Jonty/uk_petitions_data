        "additional_details": "We believe more crime education in school is crucial to the curriculum. Children often get wrapped up in theft, assault, drug abuse, criminal damage and possession of weapons. with the rise in gangs and with the internet it is so easy for people to contact children and involve them in illegal activities. From March 2020 to 2021 there were 38,500 proven offences committed by children which resulted in a caution or sentence in court.\r\n \r\nChange needs to be made to the curriculum to spread awareness and take children out of the dark and put teenagers in the real world.\r\n",
        "background": "To make pupils aged 11-16 more aware of crime in this country, and taught how to stay away from it and how to notice signs of people that they know that might also be involved in crime, especially criminal exploitation like county lines.",
