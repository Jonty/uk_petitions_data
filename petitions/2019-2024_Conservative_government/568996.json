        "additional_details": "The NHS is on the brink of collapse and we now have a more transmissible variant of the virus. As a result of the extensive \u2018key worker\u2019 list more people are required to work in person during this lockdown which causes unnecessary mixing. This also puts additional strain on public transport and schools which has already been reported this week. The lockdown should be more effective by reinstating the restrictions we saw in March and allowing only \u2018essential workers\u2019 to go to work.",
        "background": "Reinstate the restrictions from March and bring back the March definition of a \u2018key worker\u2019. Too many non-essential workers are going to work. The guidance is saying lockdown, act like you have the virus and stay at home. Then on the other hand it\u2019s saying go to work if you can\u2019t work from home.",

For example, you could start a new petition calling for certain businesses to be closed, if that's what you'd like to see. \r\n\r\nYou may wish to sign this petition:\r\n\r\nClose all non-essential businesses: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/566706\r\n\r\n"
