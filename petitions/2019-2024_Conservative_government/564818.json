        "additional_details": "Current restrictions take away all physical aspects of a relationship. For many, socially-distanced exercise is the only way they can meet.\r\n\r\nCommitted couples have now had to endure many months apart, severely struggling - with very little idea of how long this may continue.\r\n\r\nMuch like the \u2018bubble\u2019 system, this would allow two individuals within a committed relationship to spend time with one another within each of their households. This change is crucial for the mental health of those affected",
        "background": "For many couples, moving in together isn\u2019t possible due to financial, practical or moral reasons - leaving 1000\u2019s of people across the UK unable to see their partner outside of socially-distanced restrictions or conditions. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s time for the government to address this.",
