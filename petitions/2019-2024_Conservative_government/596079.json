        "additional_details": "Due to increased automation and unregulated AI innovations, a PWC report forecasts up to 40% of job losses by 2030.\r\nProtecting people's intelligence acquired over time and allowing them to negotiate the terms of automation will create a harmonised ecosystem.  Enabling a balance between hyper-automation, human rights and potential socio-economic welfare.\r\nLack of governance for highly sophisticated technologies leads to a \"monopoly\" for technology firms and higher levels of unemployment for many.",
        "background": "Government should:\r\n-Ask businesses, innovators to assess the risk\r\n- Show evidence of the impact of automation on society and workers. \r\n- If it impacts over 5,000 jobs, approval should be required\r\n- People should have the right to withdraw from sharing their knowledge for automation purposes.",
