        "additional_details": "The public is unhappy with not just Boris Johnson, but the Conservative party as a whole. Allowing them to usurp the current PM and elect another leader/PM is just another way of allowing them to shrug of the events of the past few years without any real consequences. They continue in power despite the fact they abused/supported/ defended or ignored what was happening within their own party. It was a betrayal of the electorates trust and they should be allowed the opportunity to rectify that",
        "background": "Hold a general election; the current government is in chaos, and although the PM has now agreed to step down, he is to be replaced by another party representative who was a supporter and defender to the chaos of the past few years.",
