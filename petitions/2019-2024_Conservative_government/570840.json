        "action": "Legalise and Regulate All Illegal Drugs",
        "additional_details": "Legalising and regulating all currently illegal drugs will eliminate all illegal activity associated with them. The current way illegal drugs are attained usually involves meeting with an aggressive person in an unsafe environment. In addition to this, you will have no idea what ingredients are inside the product you have bought nor be able to know how much to take. This is why nearly 5,000 people died from drug poisoning alone in 2019. Regulating drugs would prevent these deaths and save lives.",
        "background": "Ex-police officers and community leaders believe that the war on drugs is futile. The illegal drugs industry generates upwards of \u00a310 billion per year and causes \u00a320 billion in economic damage. Legalising and regulating drugs would potentially introduce a further \u00a330 billion into the UK economy.",
