A home office does not cost \u00a310,000 per person to set up, what equipment are they purchasing? I would honestly like to know as my home office didn't cost anything more than what I already own.\r\n\r\nThis government truly ridicules the people of the UK by actually even suggesting that this is ok behaviour. Seeing as MPs are paid more than the average household in the UK, it is enigmatic.",
