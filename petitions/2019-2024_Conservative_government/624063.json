        "additional_details": "On Friday 23rd September 2022, the Chancellor of Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, announced a set of economic policies, which have wreaked havoc on the UK economy in the days since. The policies have been criticised by many respected economists, much of the financial sector and many ordinary citizens. It has put at even greater risk the aspirations, well-being and prosperity of the vast majority of current and future generations. We must learn from this and it must never be allowed to happen again.",

All policies must be evidence based, risk-assessed, fully-costed and demonstrably in the best interests of the vast majority of the UK\u2019s citizens.",
