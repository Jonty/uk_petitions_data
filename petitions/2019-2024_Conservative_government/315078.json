        "additional_details": "My wife and I are considered vulnerable people. The staff of the NHS expose their vulnerability every time they go to work; let's acknowledge their bravery. \r\nTheir continued commitment to going to work, with or without PPE, their stoic attitude to danger. These things deserve recognition.\r\nIn time, I expect that a close family member will need their care, the Prime Minister is currently being cared for by the NHS, the Prince of Wales has been in their care. \r\nI want the Government to recognise an institution that, like Malta, has stood firm against an enemy that threatens us all.",
        "background": "The NHS has been incredible in its response to the COVID-19 crisis. I want the Government to acknowledge the incredible contribution they have made. In World War 2 the island of Malta stood resolute and firm against the Nazi threat. We recognised that commitment and sacrifice with the George Cross.",
