        "additional_details": "Antidepressants can be very harmful to those on the bipolar spectrum often triggering rapid cycling and manic episodes. \r\n\r\nIt takes an average 9 years to get a correct diagnosis of bipolar and there is a misdiagnosis an average of 3.5 times.\r\n\r\n1% to 2% of the population experience a lifetime prevalence of bipolar and recent research suggests as many as 5% of us are on the bipolar spectrum.\r\n\r\nToo many people with bipolar are suffering unnecessarily, whilst missing out on the vital treatment needed.",
        "background": "In 2017 to 2018, 17% of the adult population were prescribed antidepressants, that's 7.3 million people. \r\n\r\nPeople with undiagnosed bipolar often present to doctors during an episode of depression and are prescribed antidepressants as monotherapy without being adequately screened for bipolarity.",
