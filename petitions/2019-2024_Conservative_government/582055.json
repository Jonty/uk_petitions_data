        "additional_details": "Enrolled deed polls put trans, non-binary and other vulnerable people at risk, making their change of name public and searchable: their old name, new name and home address will appear in The London Gazette.\r\nWhile there is a different process of name change for vulnerable victims of crime, not every vulnerable person is considered a victim of crime, and a deed poll is the quickest and easiest way to change name, potentially preventing vulnerable individuals from ever becoming victims of crime.",
        "background": "UK Law does not prevent private organisations from having policy requiring enrolled deed polls, however these policies discriminate against vulnerable groups.\r\nPlease make organisational policies regulated and standardized, preventing companies from refusing unenrolled deed polls.",
