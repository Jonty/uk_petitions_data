You could also class this as risk pay, as these workers along with NHS staff are most at risk of catching COVID-19 as they serve over 400-500 people a day. Ans this over a working week could add up to more then 4000+ people",

This means that they are at higher risk at catching the Corona Virus. Most workers are on minimum wage, should they really receive minimum wage to risk their life?",
