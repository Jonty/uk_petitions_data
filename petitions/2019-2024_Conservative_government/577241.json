        "action": "Create a law that makes abducting a pet/animal as illegal as abducting a human",
        "additional_details": "Pets, especially ones within a family household, are considered to be a member of a family. To have one's pet(s) abducted causes untold grief and mental trauma to the victims, not to mention what the pet goes through. In my opinion, pet abduction is one criminal act that serves to allow the abductor to conduct further criminal activities. But primarily, this petition for creating such a law is to deter criminals and give peace of mind to pet owners.",
        "background": "I would like to see a law created, with appropriate consequences applied to breaking that law, regarding the abduction of pets inline with the laws in place regarding the abduction of humans.",
