        "additional_details": "Many firms will delay redundancies until March. This is amazing for those individuals kept on, but we will all pay the cost of this furlough in our future years. It is not right that there are gaps that leave some people behind. Restructure and simplify the support to a universal allowance. This will allow business to put staff on unpaid leave, protect self-employed and assist recently unemployed. It will also better distribute support into the economy and prevent ongoing fraud. Better Together.",
        "background": "The government will extend furlough until March, but there is a large population missed who need help. People have already lost their jobs that now get no support or have a chance of finding new jobs in a lockdown. Some may not be eligible for benefits but still need help.",
