        "additional_details": "The roads are now shared with more cyclists and e-scooters than ever.Yet as a criminal and road traffic lawyer of 40 years cyclists are not currently held accountable due to lack of ID for dangerous activity on the road.The same is true of e-scooters.Cycle lanes are safer yet often ignored - as is wearing of helmets.A licence scheme and penalty points system would encourage responsible cycling.I welcome growth in cycling but this must be tempered with legislation to make roads safer for all",
        "background": "Introduce compulsory form of ID for cyclists and e-scooter riders such as a numbered tabard registered to users not the bike or e-scooter.Also make mandatory use of cycle lanes when available and wearing of helmets. Introduce licence for cyclists and penalty points system to reflect transgressions.",
