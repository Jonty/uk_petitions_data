        "action": "To urgently designate all school staff as high priority for flu vaccination.",
        "additional_details": "It is assumed that schools should commission their own flu vaccination service as a staff benefit, or that staff should pay private fees. Not all schools are able to do this due to budget constraints, nor should less well paid staff be expected to pay themselves. Free vaccination for all school staff will reduce sickness absence from flu, and reduce the risk of complications if staff should fall ill with both flu and COVID-19 at the same time.",
        "background": "The Government has rightly decided that schools should remain open during the COVID-19 pandemic to protect the wellbeing of children. Schools can only do so if sufficient staff are available. Certain groups are already designated high priority vaccination programme, school staff are not.",
