        "additional_details": "The Tesco meal deal was famed for its \u00a33 price point which was a saviour to many students and the general public, however with the prices rallying up to \u00a33.50 (\u00a33 with a Clubcard) and now \u00a33.90 (\u00a33.40) with a Clubcard) we can no longer stand and hold our peace as the economy crumbles before our faces. Many of us are already facing the question of heat or eat, don\u2019t take them both away from us",
        "background": "We demand that the government caps the price of Tesco meal deals at no more than \u00a33 to ensure people can still enjoy a meal deal without paying more than they should in this cost of living crisis",
