If schools and colleges are allowed face to face teaching then why aren\u2019t university students able to have this as well? A lot of students have already dropped out already as they feel it\u2019s a waste of \u00a39k and students who are still studying also think it\u2019s not worth the \u00a39250 we are currently having to pay",

I want the government to let students who will be working part of the NHS to have better teaching hours so we are able to learn to a high standard",
