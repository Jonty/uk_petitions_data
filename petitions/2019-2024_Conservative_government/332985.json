        "additional_details": "The Government has launched its obesity strategy. While I welcome the intention behind the strategy, I am disappointed by the emphasis that it places on weight & calorie counting - rather than on education & empowerment. \r\n\r\nWith an estimated 1.25 million Brits suffering from eating disorders, what is proposed as a \u201ccommon-sense approach\u201d - focussing on weight and calorie counting - is incredibly destructive and will do more harm than good\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t turn restaurants in to a place of shame and fear!",
        "background": "We are calling on the Government to not add calories to Restaurant menus!\r\n\r\nEvidence is clear: 93% of diets fail. Add to that the fact that calorie counting does nothing more than create a cycle of guilt and self-hatred\r\n\r\nInstead educate & support people to choose a healthy lifestyle",
