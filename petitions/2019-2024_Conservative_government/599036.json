        "additional_details": "I am a personal trainer and I teach self defence, in some cases, people victims have to stay with the abuser partly because of what I call domestic financial terrorism. It's where the abuser says \"go on leave me but how will you pay the bills?\" The victim has no choice but to stay. We have failed to protect these people. Systems must be put in place to protect them. It must not be forgotten that although the majority of victims of domestic abuse are women, men can suffer as well.",
        "background": "There have been high-profile cases where people have suffered years of domestic abuse. Something snapped and these people ended up murdering the abuser ending up with a life sentence in prison. The law must be changed to take into account the provocation of the abuser over a long period of time.",
