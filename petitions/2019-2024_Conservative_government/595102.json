        "additional_details": "Continue the availability of ordering lateral flow tests online and in chemists so we can be sure we are not carrying and spreading Covid unknowingly. This will help prevent further spread of the disease, save countless lives and help ensure that the economy does not need to lockdown again as infection rates inevitably rise again if there are no safety measures left in place.",
        "background": "With the proposed ending of the availability of free lateral flow tests at the end of August, there is a very real possibility that many asymptotic carriers may continue to spread coronavirus. Although life needs to get back to normal, some precautions must remain to ensure we can do this safely.",
