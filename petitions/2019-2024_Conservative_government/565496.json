        "additional_details": "Princess Diana was only member of the Royal Family who was decent, honest, and kind. She is rightfully remembered as the People\u2019s Princess. She stood for many things that those of us in modern Britain, especially in the uncertain times we are living through, could do well to remember. Her work with those suffering from eating disorders (of which she herself was one) and AIDS, among other things, should be given the proper recognition it deserves. \r\n\r\nRIP to the Greatest Queen we never had",
        "background": "When Queen Elizabeth II passes away and the throne passes to Prince Charles, it is not him who should be on OUR money, but the Queen of our hearts, Lady Diana Spencer.",
