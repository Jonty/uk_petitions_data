        "additional_details": "The costs of operating an MOT bay have of course increased, but the fee we charge has not kept pace, the Govt consultation suggests a fee of min \u00a3 72.50 \r\n\r\nThe DVSA are challenged by test stations working too quickly, we need an appropriate fee in order to allow appropriate time to conduct this important road safety task.",
        "background": "The mot test fee has not increased since April 2010, vote here for a fee of a minimum of \u00a3 85 \r\n\r\nVote for an increase now before we as an industry need to strike and cause more chaos for an already struggling economy",
