        "additional_details": "This would greatly benefit the 1in10 women in the uk who suffer from endo. There is already such a battle to get a diagnosis of endo in the uk, the system fights against them. It would help that once diagnosed they could be recognised as having a disability, each woman has different needs but those with chronic symptoms struggling to get treatment need endo to be recognised as a disability so that they have support to fall back on when working becomes impossible due to this awful disease.",
        "background": "Endo is not seen as a disability in the uk and it can be so difficult for women with endo to work with the debilitating symptoms of the disease which include chronic pelvic pain, pain during sex, heavy and irregular periods, painful bowel movements, and many more. Endo can effect the whole body.",

This could cover people who have endometriosis, where this has a a \u2018substantial\u2019 and \u2018long-term\u2019 negative effect on their ability to do normal daily activities.
