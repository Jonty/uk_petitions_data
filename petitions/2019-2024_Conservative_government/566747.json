        "action": "Close early years settings in the January 2021 UK Lockdown",
        "additional_details": "Nurseries are not covid secure due to lack of social distancing amongst young children thus allowing early years settings to be unsafe workplaces. Early years staff are exposed to a higher rate of germs due to the lack of knowledge and understanding of personal hygiene amongst children, even whilst wearing PPE. There is speculation about children also being asymptomatic which puts early years staff at a higher risk of catching the Covid-19 virus and thus putting other people at risk.",
        "background": "Nurseries and early years settings should not be allowed to stay open during the lockdown when all other educational settings have to close.",
