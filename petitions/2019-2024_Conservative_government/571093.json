        "additional_details": "Driving tests and lessons have been backlogged and are extremely hard to get hold of now. They\u2019ve been off and on when different areas have been in different lockdowns and tiers, meaning people have become more stressed and have not had an even, steady and gradual learning experience. The driving theory pass should be extended from two years to three so that people have more time to pass their driving test.",
