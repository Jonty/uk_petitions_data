        "action": "The Government to urgently review immunity for all vaccine manufacturers.",
        "additional_details": "There is much debate about the efficacy of vaccines especially when they are fast-tracked into use within months and not after years of testing which is the usual time needed to check safety. It is a fact that some vaccines have caused serious injury and even deaths due to inadequate testing and at this time our citizens have to take it on trust that this will not occur from any of the Covid vaccines despite the lack of lengthy testing. Manufacturers should not be made immune to damages claims.",
        "background": "Three vaccines are being fast-tracked through our certification procedures contrary to usual best practice and one of them has been licences for immediate use. It is essential that all manufacturers be held accountable for a product they assert has been tested if side effects injure patients.",
