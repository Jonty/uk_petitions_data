        "additional_details": "Putin\u2019s actions have upended global, European, and national politics - including politics of Brexit. It is blindingly clear that we should rejoin ASAP. \r\nAny discussion of UK prospects after this war must reconsider Brexit.  UK has been weak, isolated, indecisive and too slow.  Churchill had no such problem, and wanted union with France in 1940.  Postwar he wanted a sort of United States of Europe. https://rm.coe.int/16806981f3 \r\n\r\nChurchill knew we would be stronger together.",
        "background": "Europe will be stronger together if we rejoin. UK is too isolated at this critical time: combined strength of EU member states best expressed with one European voice, including UK. \r\n\r\nUkraine\u2019s urgent application blazes the way. Putin\u2018s actions make desperate cases, needing drastic solutions.",
