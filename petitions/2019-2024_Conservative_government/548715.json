        "additional_details": "Secretary of state for Education should be dismissed, due to the fact that he neglected to ensure that A-level results were fair for all students. Ofqual claimed the algorithm used would \"produce overall outcomes which were broadly in line with those of the previous years.\" The standardisation model used historical performance data from each students school or college. This meant grades were not based on individual attainment. This demonstrates gross negligence, and should not have been allowed.",
        "background": "This year, thousands of A-level students were downgraded as a result of an algorithm which does not reflect the ability of the individual. This monumental error, will potentially jeopardise the futures of thousands of young adults. The secretary of State for education should be held accountable.",
