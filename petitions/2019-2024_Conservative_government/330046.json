        "additional_details": "The Government should take responsibility for their inadequate running of the country during the pandemic. It appears that they care more about painting a plane than helping the public, they are supposed to be supporting the country not hindering it. Every decision they have made has been the wrong one and their actions have caused a lot of heartache amongst the population. The Government knew that the virus was on it's way but did nothing to slow its progress.",
        "background": "The Government should be held accountable for the 40,000 or more people who have died in the UK, not only did they fail to curb the influx of people coming into the country they failed to adhere to their own rules and broke the law on several occasions, thus putting more lives at risk.",
