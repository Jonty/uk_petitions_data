        "additional_details": "One obvious solution is to ensure all social media accounts require ID verification. Putting the onus on Twitter, Facebook etc. to identify all users would hinder abusers using the channels for their own nefarious ends\r\nThe Government\u2019s response to a petition from 5th May 2021 claimed:-\r\n\u201cUser ID verification\u2026 could disproportionately impact vulnerable users & interfere with freedom of expression\u201d. This isn\u2019t good enough\r\nThis petition demands ID checks for UK social media users with immediate effect\r\n",
        "background": "After England's Euro Final defeat, three team members who missed penalties were abused on social media. \r\nThis petition asks the Government and social media companies to stop online abuse using ID checks for all accounts and prosecute abusers to the full extent of the law.\r\n",
