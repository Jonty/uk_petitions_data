We are being expected to learn half of the syllabus for our first year, and despite our teachers efforts in helping us, it is near to impossible to be able to do so, and then to be expected to achieve outstanding grades to apply for Universities, is just unacceptable and unrealistic. We want more information on what is going to happen to us and what help we are going to get.",
