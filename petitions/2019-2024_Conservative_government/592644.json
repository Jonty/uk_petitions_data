        "additional_details": "No one enjoys complaining or bringing a legal claim. In UK, it is frustrating dealing with inepts, who have not even been to a credible University, let alone have a law degree or suitable qualification, to police complaints or claims.  \r\n\r\nIf only named credible lawyers or those with basic IQ and competence to defer to legal expertise, are employed to police e.g. professionals, it would save money, costs, stress, and ensure only competent decisions are made, and rogues do not escape justice",
        "background": "Change UK policy so that only named, credible lawyers or those who defer to legal expertise, are allowed to police judges, lawyers, police, insurers, petitions and professionals",
