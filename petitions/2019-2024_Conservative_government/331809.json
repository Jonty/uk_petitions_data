There is too much work being set and children can't learn the same at home as they would at school, it won't be the same rushing through the subjects to catch up on work that we have missed for over 4 months. There's too much to catch up on; it would cause a lot of negative effects on mental health, putting them at a further disadvantage for the future.",
        "background": "End GCSE's and just make estimates of grades on lesson content and coursework as we have missed out on a lot of work and we won't have the same advantage as the previous years have done. It's too much pressure on us.",
