        "additional_details": "With COVID cases rising, and students still required to commute to schools, universities and colleges, surely it is safer for them to do so in the safety of their private vehicle than on crowded pubic transport. To enable them to do so, we ask that the government rethink their decision and allow driving tests which have been adapted to meet COVID safety guidelines to continue safely during the lockdown.",
        "background": "The DVSA has announced that from 5th November 2020, driving tests in England will be cancelled. This will render learners of all ages unable to drive, having awaited a test for months. This will force us to continue relying on public transport to commute, even more exposed to COVID-19.",
