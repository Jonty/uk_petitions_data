        "additional_details": "The NHS is crumbling due to insufficient funding, unfair pay and substandard working conditions for its staff. This has resulted in severe staff shortages due to poor retention which has led to unnecessary deaths of citizens. Staff continue to feel burnt out from constantly working over-time due to the shortages. Paramedics are unable to reach people in time to save lives. Tax-paying people who would like to fund the NHS are dying outside of hospitals due to staff shortages. This has to stop.",
        "background": "Please accept the fair pay rises requested by NHS staff so that the workers can provide a safer healthcare system and save lives.\r\n\r\nNHS staff chose this job to help people and save lives - stop taking that away from them.",
