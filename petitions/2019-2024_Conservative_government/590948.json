        "additional_details": "There are few haulage companies who are willing to pay to put new drivers through their tests as there is a large cost involved and often the drivers change jobs following their training meaning the haulage company has lost its 'investment'. If it was set up in a similar manner as Student Finance then the government would get the money back over time and haulage companies wouldn't lose out. It costs upwards of \u00a32000 to qualify as a class 1 driver which many individuals can't afford.",
        "background": "The government introduced Student Finance to help students pay for University. I would like to see a similar scheme put in place to encourage more young people to take up truck driving. According to the Road Haulage Association there is a driver shortage of around 60,000.",
