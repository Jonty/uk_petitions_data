        "additional_details": "The largest outbreaks of coronavirus are now happening at construction and manufacturing sites. Despite best efforts of management to keep staff safe, corona virus safe guarding is not up to standard. Social Distancing is hard to follow in the manufacturing industry, non ventilated rooms allow for a lot quick transmission of the virus, covid screens are not a barrier or protection if someone can walk behind them, mask although useful will not protect you if you are sat in an office for 9 hours with 30 other people. DESPITE WHAT PEOPLE SAY MANUFACTURING PLANTS ARE NOT COVID SAFE.",
        "background": "The government has left non essential manufacturing plants open as they cannot reasonably work from home. These should be closed due to the increased spread of COVID 19, which is putting families at risk.",
