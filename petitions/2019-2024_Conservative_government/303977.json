        "additional_details": "The hospitality industry is third largest industry in the U.K. with many jobs at stake. \r\n\r\nMany of these business will have to close due to Coronavirus, meaning thousands of employees will be sent home with no pay (whether by redundancy or unpaid holidays). This will have a huge financial impact in a sector that is already on the low pay scheme. \r\n\r\nWe would like the government to provide support to business & individuals struggling in this critical time.",
        "background": "We ask that the government supports business and employees in the hospitality sector (catering, hotels, pubs, bars, coffees, etc) to mitigate the financial impact COVID-19 will have in thousands of people and their families in the sector.",
