        "additional_details": "Inadvertent transmission by asymptomatic individuals is one of the major issues. Community spirit is high: nobody wants to pass it on, but nobody can be sure that they are not carrying virus. Transmission rates are reduced by requiring everyone to wear masks in public spaces, as evidenced by China and South Korea. We should encourage the use of masks to protect others from COVID-19. China has the daily capacity to produce 200 million masks. Retailers should be able to source them easily.",
        "background": "Temporarily, and to reduce demand for online shopping, government should instruct retailers to give customers and employees, on entering the store, disposable face masks and gloves to wear instore. They are more effective if everyone uses them. Shops should be asked to stock them as essentials.",
