The Irish government has lifted all visa requirements between Ukraine and Ireland, and the UK government should do the same.\r\n\r\nA petition exists to offer fast track asylum (https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/609382), however this is short of measures taken in Ireland and other European countries, and would still allow people to be turned away at the UK border",
