        "additional_details": "We are currently classed as homeless and at no fixed abode. We are struggling to be accepted on private rent because despite me and my husband both working our annual income is not high enough for private rent. \r\nSo many people are in a similar boat to us. The landlords should not be allowed to charge such a high rent and at least they should accept universal credit as a form of top up income so then hard working people would then be able to afford a roof over their heads.",
        "background": "With landlords charging high rent even hard working families or single people aren't being accepted because their income is apparently too low. Also alot of estate agents do not accept universal credit as a top up on the rent so that also goes against hard working people.",
