        "additional_details": "It is such an unfair advantage on other countries and some schools in the UK mainly do IGCSEs and it seems like you have again done a half completed job. Please just make up your mind now and cancel them instead of cancelling them last minute, because let\u2019s be honest- are we really going to be back in school in February at the rate we are going at? NO! Please do someone in the government do something about this and make sure ALL Gcse exam boards are cancelled.",
        "background": "We want to cancel IGCSEs for year 11s. It seems stupid to cancel GCSEs but not IGCSEs. Other countries who we are competing against are not as badly affected by corona virus and are able to go to school. This is a massive advantage to those countries so please cancel them even if it\u2019s only in UK.",
