        "background": "I ask Parliament and the Government to move the bank holiday (as they did for May) to celebrate the actual end of WW2 75 years ago. \r\nI ask that, as VJ-Day (15th August) falls on a Saturday, that the bank holiday be on Friday 14th (when Japan announced its surrender) or Monday 17th.",
