        "additional_details": "Including young children within this rule puts a disproportionate burden on families and is damaging to a segment of the population that has already missed out on months of normal social interaction and learning during lockdown. \r\n\r\nFamilies will be unable to meet together without making multiple trips in smaller groups, potentially increasing the overall risk. Meanwhile allowing people from six different households to meet together inside is more likely to increase the spread of coronavirus.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson should follow Scotland and Wales' lead and make young children exempt from England\u2019s \u2018rule of six\u2019. The rate of infection has remained very low among younger children, despite rising among teenagers and adults.",
