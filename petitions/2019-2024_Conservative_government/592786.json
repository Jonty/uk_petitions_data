        "additional_details": "Every year many dogs die from being taken out during heatwave temperatures when it poses a massive risk to their health. within only  20 minutes of a dog being out in these temperatures they can succumb to collapsing and then death. It\u2019s something we can change and it\u2019s causing unnecessary suffering to these animals who cannot speak for themselves. It is cruelty, dogs not only suffer heat stroke but severe burns on their feet because the tarmac heats up even hotter than the outside temperature.",
        "background": "I want you to make it a law that dog owners cannot walk their dogs or take them out when temperatures reach heatwave conditions, such as above 30 degrees. Or even 25 degrees as even this temperature causes massive health risks to dogs. This would also include leaving dogs in hot cars",
