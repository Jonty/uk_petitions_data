However the actual rate of delivery is often less than that claimed by the supplier. This invariably is due to the charger itself not working correctly. Despite the lower than claimed delivery rate, the supplier charges the same unit kwh rate to the consumer. Slower and lower rates should therefore be charged at a lower rate to the customer.",

However, the actual rate of delivery is often less than claimed by the supplier. The Government should ensure that this is regulated",
