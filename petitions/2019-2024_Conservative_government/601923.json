        "additional_details": "Being given more power about who can have their British Citizenship revoked without giving a valid reason means many who have dual nationality may end up being sent back to countries they have little exposure to. It unapologetically flouts international human rights obligations and basic norms of fairness. It has even been criticised by many other countries, including the USA.",
        "background": "The Government is implementing a change in clause 9 of the Nationality and Borders Bill, which states Notice of decision to deprive a person of citizenship exempts the government from having to give notice in the interests for a number of reasons.",
