        "additional_details": "This has been trialled in Haringey, resulting in 65% reduction in blue badge related theft. The infrastructure of digitising this information exists, and could be utilised to aid blue badge holders and reduce break ins. In London, blue badge holders are exempt from the congestion charge, which is recorded digitally. This is an exact example of how the system could work to register blue badges to vehicles for parking, without displaying the physical card.",
        "background": "Blue badge car break ins are on the rise across the nation resulting in people needing to pay to fix their vehicles, becoming costly and anxiety inducing. Councils already have a digital parking permit system. We would attach badges to car registrations, removing the need for it to be on display.",
