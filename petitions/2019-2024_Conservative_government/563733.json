        "additional_details": "Sanitary products are seen as a luxury, however they\u2019re essential hygiene products that women require. Periods are unavoidable for most women. Although the governments period product scheme for schools and colleges in England was a step in the right direction, we feel like this simply isn\u2019t enough. Period Poverty has soared over the past year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Students and Workers are working from home, with limited access to these products. Finances are also tighter than ever.",
        "background": "We believe that women\u2019s sanitary products should be free in England. Women\u2019s products seem to have a lot of \u2018pink tax\u2019 which is an added tax made by corporations on their products that are targeted towards women, it should be illegal for companies to be allowed to do this.",
