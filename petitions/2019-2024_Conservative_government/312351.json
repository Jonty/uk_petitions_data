        "action": "Extend the validity of marriage notices for rescheduled weddings due to COVID19",
        "additional_details": "Many activities of normal life have been put on hold due to the COVID19 outbreak. This includes the suspension of all wedding ceremonies during the restrictions put in place to slow the spread of coronavirus. Whilst this is an important public health measure, this will leave countless couples out of pocket for civil fees for notices of marriage which will expire due to the cancellation or postponement of a planned wedding. Extending affected Notices of Marriage will help alleviate this.",
        "background": "Extend the period for which all Notices of Marriage are valid from 12 months to upto 24 months without additional fees. This would apply where the usual expiry date of an issued Notice of Marriage falls between 23rd March 2020 and the end of government restrictions on conducting wedding ceremonies.",
