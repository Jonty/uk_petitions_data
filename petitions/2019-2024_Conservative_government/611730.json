There should be no need to take on highly lucrative secondary work, sit on the boards of companies, or work for other organisations whose interests may not align with the fundamental role of an MP. Taking on secondary work opens up the possibility of undue influence, nepotism, and is a distraction from the primary function of the role of an MP.",
