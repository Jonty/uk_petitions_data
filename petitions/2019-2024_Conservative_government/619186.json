        "additional_details": "We would like the government to consider our petition due to citizens mental health declining, putting strain on the NHS causing even more vulnerability as their service will be needed. During tax increases families will also be struggling to provide food and other essentials, e.g this can cause malnutrition ( putting tension again on the NHS). If the Government was to agree with our petition we truly believe that families and citizens will be more secure, mentally & financially.",
        "background": "As a society we have noticed all citizens are struggling to provide for the basic essentials e.g food, bills and fuel costs. We would like the government to consider making these needs more accessible by reducing the percentage increase e.g roughly, taxes have increased by 9% within this year (2022)",
