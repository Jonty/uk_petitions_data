        "action": "Reform the system for seeking compensation from the NHS",
        "additional_details": "The Government should:\r\n\r\n1) Protect the NHS from being sued\r\n2) Create a new process for seeking compensation that avoids the need for costly legal action\r\n \r\nThis would reflect the fact that doctors and nurses work really hard and do their best to help their patients. This has recently been illustrated by the manner in which they have \u201cstepped up to the plate\u201d in the present coronavirus crisis.\r\n\r\nThere will always be accidents or mistakes as in any other profession. The government as their employer should protect doctors and nurses and value their contribution.",
        "background": "When a case is genuine the victim should be properly compensated but the NHS should be protected from spurious claims. The 4 BILLION POUNDS budgeted by the NHS for legal fees could be used to increase nurses\u2019 wages, for example.",
