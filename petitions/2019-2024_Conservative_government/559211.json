        "additional_details": "Fireworks cause a lot of air pollution and smoke, and it makes people with breathing difficulties very hard to breathe. Pets are also very scared of the loud noises from fireworks, and it has resulted in many deaths. The constant, loud, irritating noise of exploding fireworks all day is a complete nuisance. Babies and children cannot sleep because of the noise, and the elderly and disabled also suffer greatly from this extreme problem.",
        "background": "Fireworks should be banned from being sold to members of the public. Shops cannot sell them in-store or online. Only large events which are not formed by individual members of the public can launch fireworks.",
