With the vast majority of our paid for university facilities not being in use, we are having to meet in our flats with fellow university students to get our work done.\r\nOur academic resources have been completely diminished and we are having to make do with what limited resources are available online.\r\nBeing able to meet in small study groups and work is a vital part of our progression and education.\r\nThe mental health of students is at tipping point.",
        "background": "We would like Parliament to overrule the devolved Scottish Assembly and allow students (especially) to have up to 6 people in a home.\r\nWe need to be allowed to make small study groups in order to effectively carry out the work that is asked of us.",
