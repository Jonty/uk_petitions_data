In taking measures to protect students from covid there has been gross negligence to consider students mental well-being. Many students have never lived away from home and now have to face the prospect of being locked down in a flat of people they\u2019ve only just met for two weeks. Mental health is a growing epidemic, it\u2019s vital we\u2019re listened too.",

Apply a forcible lockdown onto blocks where it is necessary for 2 weeks but allow students to socialise with each other. Meet human rights, food, sanitation. Regularly check in for mental well- being.",
