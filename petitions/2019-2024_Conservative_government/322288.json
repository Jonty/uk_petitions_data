For example, the swastika, originally a religious symbol for peace, is now a symbol commonly associated with hatred and war. I am not comparing the NHS to Nazis, the NHS are doing an incredible job, I\u2019m emphasising that people in power are able to take and change symbols. The U.K. government should protect LGBT+ rights and it\u2019s flag, ensuring that it\u2019s meaning isn\u2019t forgotten.",

I agree that the NHS should use the rainbow as it\u2019s a sign of hope, just not use the flag that people have died for. People\u2019s history and identities are based around the flag, I don\u2019t want the true meaning of the pride flag to be forgotten.",
