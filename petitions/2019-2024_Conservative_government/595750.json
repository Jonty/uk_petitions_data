        "additional_details": "Get the FDA to approve CBD oil for chronic pain which could replace the morphine, zapane and gabapentine that people are currently prescribed which has massive side effects and cost the NHS and the government a lot more money. CBD Oil is a natural product that has much fewer side effects. Poor people are trapped in this cycle of pain killers, they cannot afford the CBD oil so are forced to take these highly dangerous tablets with massive side effects or suffer with chronic pain.",
        "background": "People in chronic pain are not allowed CBD oil on the NHS, but are supplied Morphine tablets costing \u00a38000 a month.  CBD oil is a natural product, has fewer side effects and is cheaper. CBD OIL NEEDS TO BE APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR CHRONIC PAIN. The USA has approved this oil already for this purpose.",
