        "additional_details": "Every day I come across videos on the internet of gans on a motorbike stilling phones, motorbikes, trying to rob a car at the traffic lights, or even robbing a Jewelry shop.\r\n\r\nIt is always repetitive to see the same scene, Two scooters with four people ready to rob. \r\nWhy did the thief use a scooter? Because is easy for them to escape just by filtering the traffic or using narrow roads where a car can not fit.\r\n \r\nWhy not use the same idea for the Police?\r\nThe cost of a  motorbike and its maintenance is less than a police car.\r\nThe response of the police on a motorbike will be faster than a full-size police car.\r\nThe pursuit of the thief on a motorbike will be more effective.\r\nOne Police officer per Motorbike while usually two police officers in a car.",
        "background": "Vote for Increasing the number of police officers on a motorbike. This will allow quick capture of a thief who usually is on a motorbike too. \r\nAlso, motorbikes can easily filter between cars, making it easy for the police to pursue and capture the thief.",
