        "additional_details": "Child Maintenance encourages parents to focus on money instead of the child. It's often used as punishment to paying parent for fighting to see a child equally in court. Instead of giving time, more parents are depriving their child of seeing the other parent in order to receive money. Putting protections in place for those denied access for a reason other than safeguarding will encourage parents to help one another raise the child rather than use the child and Child Maintenance as a weapon.",
        "background": "Protections need to be put in place to protect Child Maintenance from being used as a weapon by manipulative parents. If a paying parent has been denied access to child after applying to the courts for 50/50, for a reason besides safety, then no Maintenance should be paid. Time offered before money.",
