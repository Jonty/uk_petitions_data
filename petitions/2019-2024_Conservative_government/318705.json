        "additional_details": "The current coronavirus crisis has lead to an economic crisis in the UK and prompted the government to deliver a rescue plan for the economy. Yet many companies still distribute dividends to their shareholders. This should cease.\r\nIn addition, companies whose main shareholders are not paying taxes in the UK should not benefit from state support, unless these shareholders contribute themselves substantially to their company's rescue package.",
        "background": "The government's rescue plan is financed by taxpayer's money. \r\nThe Government should ban dividend payments by companies benefiting from rescue packages, as well as golden parachutes. \r\nIt should also limit financial help to companies whose main shareholders are not paying taxes in the UK.",
