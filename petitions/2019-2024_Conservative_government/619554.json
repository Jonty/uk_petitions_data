        "additional_details": "Why should a single traveller be expected to pay as much as a couple or group when booking a holiday or hotel room.  \r\nCharging extra for a single traveller is discriminating against single people and means that a holiday for a single person is almost impossible to consider when the costs are so extortionate.\r\n\r\nfor example a 10 night, all inclusive holiday for two to Greece in September 2022 is \u00a3977 each, however the same holiday for a single traveller is \u00a31396, how can this be justified?",
        "background": "Holiday companies charge as much as double for a single traveller when booking package holidays.\r\nIt is said that this is because a single traveller spends less than a couple.  If this is the case then this should not apply to All Inclusive Packages where a single traveller would eat or drink less.",
