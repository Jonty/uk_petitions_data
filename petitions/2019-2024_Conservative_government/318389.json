The assessment should ensure that there has not been undue influence or intimidation from either parent. Follow up psychological well-being assessments with the child and its parents should be made to ensure that the child is happy, psychologically functioning well and that both parents are coping.",

Why shouldn\u2019t a child of sound mind not have uncontested choice of which parent they want to live with?",
