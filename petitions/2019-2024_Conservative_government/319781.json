        "additional_details": "Often articles and television news segments will not clearly demonstrate exactly where they found their evidence or how to access it. Too often evidence is cited without page numbers, names, dates or links to source(s). Sometimes there is no reference given at all.\r\n\r\nSurvey evidence has consistently demonstrated great levels of distrust in the news media. Greater transparency in displaying where evidence has come from will enhance education and public trust in our media and democracy.",
