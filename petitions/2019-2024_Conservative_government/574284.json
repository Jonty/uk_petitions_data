        "additional_details": "While honours are regularly awarded to individuals, it is time for the government to consider the entire group of dedicated NHS staff - from porters to nurses and doctors, and all those who have made the fight against Covid-19 the centrepiece of their work and vocational commitment.  The award of the George Cross to a community already has a precedent in the award of the George Cross to Malta during our historic fight for freedom in WW2.\r\n\r\nIn recognition of the enormous gift of love which the NHS has provided to the UK population, and to provide a public affirmation of the heroism and courage of its staff, including all those who have given their lives in the fight against Covid-19, we petition those in power to award the George Cross to the National Health Service.",
        "background": "NHS staff at all levels have been showing tremendous courage and determination during the last year.  Many have lost their lives in combatting the Covid-19 virus protecting patients of all ages and backgrounds.  Many have exhausted themselves, and may carry scars of this for years.",
