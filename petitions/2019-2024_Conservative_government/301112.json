        "additional_details": "These changes are counter productive and absurd. It is every persons right to work for, who, when and how much and which tax status they wish to pay their taxes. \r\nThe IR35 tax change does not allow this and will allow large multi-national companies to descriminate.\r\nThe criteria set out is vacuous and injudicious, and represents an alarming over-reach by the HMRC. I ask this planned change to be suspended for a formal investigation into this decision and a viable alternative can be found.",
