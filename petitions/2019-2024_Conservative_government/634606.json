Decriminalising non-payment of the TV licence would mean that not paying the TV licence would no longer be a criminal offence, but it would still be legally required, and non-payment could be pursued through civil means.\r\n\r\nIf what you want is for the TV licence to be abolished, we could accept a petition requesting that.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nHold a referendum on the TV licence fee: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/629355"
