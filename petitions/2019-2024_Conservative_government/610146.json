        "additional_details": "It\u2019s essential that everybody has the chance to go to university. Some people don\u2019t get these GCSEs because of the school they go to which might be in a poorer area. It\u2019s completely unfair to block them from making the leap to uni just because of where they live. These tests don\u2019t always test actual intelligence. Students must tick boxes and some of the brightest individuals struggle. That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t deserve access to higher education in an environment that might suit them better.",
