Once he was recognised as a prolific pedophile,  he should not have any further airtime. It was only the last 5-10 years that victims finally got their closure so this documentary will open up the wounds again that fo many of us have tried to forget.",

The victims should be allowed to move on without fear of reminders on TV, and the jokes and jibes that come with it.",
