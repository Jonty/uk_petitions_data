        "additional_details": "Change.org offers a huge variety of petitions that seek to bring about action on long-term issues that need reform, and short-term events that call for action from our government in response, notably petitions surrounding George Floyd, our relations with the USA etc. As a result, I believe Change.org should be recognised as a significant and valued platform of public voice in government and parliamentary settings.",
        "background": "Currently, petitions run on Change.org are not discussed in Parliament. This platform receives a huge level of traction and recognition from the public, with campaigns receiving huge numbers of signatures that should warrant recognition in parliament. As it stands only .gov petitions are discussed.",
