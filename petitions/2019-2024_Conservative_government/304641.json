        "additional_details": "IR35 legislation is controversial and difficult to comply with. Currently major UK businesses introduce blanket ban on hiring IT and other contractors providing services via their own Personal Services Companies, leaving thousands of people out of jobs. This is difficult enough to handle for many people on its own, but given the situation with COVID-19 it puts their livelihood in danger.",
        "background": "The Government needs to revoke IR35 legislation extension to the private sector to allow businesses to hire contractors and allow IT and other professional services contractors to continue working via their limited companies and recover from the business consequences of COVID-19.",
