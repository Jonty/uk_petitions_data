        "additional_details": "I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 16. After years of never knowing what was wrong with me. I hadn\u2019t even heard of polycystic ovaries, polycystic ovarian syndrome or endometriosis until a doctor discussed them. The NHS website states that 1 in 10 women have PCOS. That means that in a school year group if there are 70 girls there could be 7 of those girls or more with PCOS. There is not enough education regarding reproductive and hormonal health disorders in our curriculums.",
        "background": "Schools do not teach about disorders such as pcos and endometriosis. It should become mandatory for young boys and girls to be educated about PCOS and endometriosis to prevent prolonged diagnosis and provide knowledge and understanding about these conditions.",
