        "additional_details": "BTEC students work harder than A Level students and GCSE students as a whole load of assignments need to be written and given in before a fixed short deadline. This can be stressfull and it is stressfull for all BTEC students as the pressure is mounting up on teachers and students overall. Furthermore, a lot of work has been put from BTEC students from all different subjects from the start of the year and previous years. So it would be unfair and unjust to not give predicted grades to them.",

Also, A Level and GCSE students are getting predicted grades as this would be unfair not to give it to BTEC students.  I believe there should be flexibility in grades due to this unprecedented situation.",
