        "additional_details": "As the furlough scheme for the employed has been extended to the end of October we would like the Chancellor to review the SEISS with regard to extending it also beyond the three month lump sum payment. Many self employed persons cannot return to work and obey social distancing rules as this would risk their health and that of their families as their jobs require them to be within 2m of their client. We would like to see the SEISS extended in principle to match that of the furlough scheme.",
        "background": "During the Covid 19 lockdown self employed persons have been hit very hard by the social distancing rules and being able to work in close proximity to others. As employed persons became furloughed and received 80% of their wages, the SEISS was introduced to help self employed persons.",
