I have learned that people with mild learning disability and autism are not grouped in Group 6 of the Vaccine Priority List. Some are very isolated with nothing to do because of lockdown restrictions throughout the past year. Waiting longer for a vaccine could be damaging to their mental wellbeing and their development will take a few steps down. We ask for the government to make them priority",
