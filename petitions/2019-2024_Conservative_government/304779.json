        "additional_details": "Under current rules, schools cannot give the money that they receive for free school meals in voucher form or otherwise to families who are eligible. We need to ensure  that the most vulnerable children and families are supported at this unprecedented time. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this petition is to ask the government to change the rules, so that Head Teachers can give food vouchers to families eligible for free school meals during covid-19 related school closures.",
        "background": "Schools are closing due to the covid-19 pressures and growing numbers of families are self-isolating. Many children who are eligible for free school meals may miss out on their main meal of the day if not at school.",
