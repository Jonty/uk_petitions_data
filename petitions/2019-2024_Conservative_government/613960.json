        "additional_details": "Pet ownership is already an expensive thing.  On a normal day, a visit to the vet would cost on average \u00a3100 for a small issue.  If your pet is unwell out of business hours, there is no choice but to use this service and pay these extortionate rates to help your pet.  The alternative is for the owner to see their animals suffer.  We would like to see these fees regulated and made affordable.  This would also help to get pet insurance prices to drop as the payouts would be lower.",
        "background": "Currently, a lot of Out of Hours and Weekend Veterinarian services charge extortionate fees for consultancy.  These fee's are enormous in comparison to a week day fee, and in some cases over 5 times more expensive the normal rate.  We would like to see this regulated.",
