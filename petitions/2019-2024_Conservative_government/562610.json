        "additional_details": "Marian and Tom Clancy have been unable to see their disabled daughter, Charlotte for months due to the pandemic. Charlotte lost her sight as a result of Batten disease, meaning she relies heavily on touch and physical communication. Her motor skills and memory are also deteriorating and her parents are heartbroken to not be spending what little time she might have left with her. For families like the Clancys, rapid testing is absolutely essential.",
        "background": "Urgently roll out rapid testing for the families of vulnerable and disabled people in care homes so that they can safely visit their loved ones. For some people it has been months since they last saw their families and the lack of contact is having severe detrimental effect to their wellbeing.",
