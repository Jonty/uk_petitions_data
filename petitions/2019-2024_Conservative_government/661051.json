        "action": "Reconsider Freedom of Movement between the UK and EU for young people.",
        "additional_details": "This will allow stronger connection between the UK and EU which has broken down since Brexit. It will create a new generation intent of collaboration instead of division. It also gives young people the opportunity to still enjoy some of the benefits of the EU considering many young people disagree with Brexit and did not have a say in the Brexit referendum at the time. It will also stimulate economic growth by attracting young skilled workers from the EU.",
        "background": "The government should establish freedom of movement for young people between the UK and the EU and vice versa. This could be expanded to more age groups. Also, schemes to encourage EU students and skilled workers to come to the UK, stimulating economic growth, should be introduced.",
