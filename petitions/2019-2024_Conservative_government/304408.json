        "additional_details": "Pandemics have two main risks to human suffering. First is the health risk which we are beginning to understand and (hopefully) contain.  The second is the economic risk, which causes long term suffering through bankruptcy, unemployment and the associated stress. This is caused by  cash/credit crunch as cashflows dry up. It can be limited by crediting everyone\u2019s account with money.\r\n\r\nThis should be free and strictly on a one-off basis.   \r\n\r\nSee www.DavidMcWilliams.ie and Milton Friedman for more.",
        "background": "The Bank of England should print money and make a one time cash deposit into the main bank account of every citizen, permanent resident and small business account in the UK. This is similar to Quantitative Easing. The difference is that the money goes straight to those in need now and not to banks.",
