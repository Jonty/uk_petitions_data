        "additional_details": "There are many exceptional, original writers who are unable to \u2018break in\u2019 to the industry. At the same time, broadcasters show many formulaic programmes.\r\n\r\nPart of the remit of Government-linked broadcasters like Channel 4 and the BBC should be to showcase groundbreaking writing. The introduction of fresh new voices is surely key to this.\r\n\r\nThis measure would:\r\n\r\n1) Enrich the cultural life of the nation.\r\n\r\n2) Boost new talent.\r\n\r\n3) \u2018Level up\u2019 and help address the cost of living crisis.",
        "background": "Create a law that forces Government-linked broadcasters (such as the BBC and Channel 4) to support new creative voices, by mandating them to commission and buy at least 50% of shows from writers with no previous professional credits in film or TV.",
