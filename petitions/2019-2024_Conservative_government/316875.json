        "additional_details": "As an Employer, the NHS has a legal responsibility to provide appropriate equipment to its employees in line with any other Employer. You would not ask a Fireman to fight a fire in jeans and a T shirt nor a Policeman to stop a riot with an Easter egg. In 2013, the MOD lost a case where they were found to be negligent and had breached the human rights to life of soldiers that they sent out in Iraq in poorly equipped vehicles despite the known risks. I believe the principle here is no different.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to ensure that the appropriate PPE is provided for its Employees in the line of duty which is their legal responsibility. In the absence of this, when employees die or suffer disability as a result, either they or their families should be maximally compensated for this.",
