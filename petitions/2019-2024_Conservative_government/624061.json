The aviation rules remain the same, the fuel costs remain the same, the Airlines remain the same, the departures & destinations remain the same, airport taxes remain the same. So why do the prices go up by three times when the kids are on holiday?I request the UK parliament to put a price cap on this daylight robbery by the airlines and the holiday companies. It\u2019s not fair on the families with kids.",

Families with kids need holidays and airlines/holiday companies know the school term times and hike the prices to make it impossible for families to afford even a week\u2019s holiday abroad during the year.",
