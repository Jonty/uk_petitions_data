We need to back our High Street & support local businesses more than ever. The Government have obviously seen the importance, which is evident in their \u2018Eat Out To Dine Out\u2019 initiative, but should also encourage the use of table space outside, as eating outside and reducing the number of people inside is important. If wheelchairs/ double buggies can pass safely then tables should be allowed outside",

If a wheelchair/double buggy can safely pass, cafes/ restaurants should be allowed to encourage eating outside as it is safer.",
