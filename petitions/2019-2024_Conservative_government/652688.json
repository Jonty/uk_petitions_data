        "additional_details": "Parliament should take action on this as the old education system doesn\u2019t work for everyone and children should be taught how to use money so in the future, many people won\u2019t be in debt as much. Starting at university puts teenagers straight into debt, this shouldn\u2019t be the case, the government should be encouraging children by teaching them about finance to be financially independent.",
        "background": "We need to change the old education system to allow children to have the opportunity to learn about finance and for children to understand, how to use money and how not to use money and interest etc.",
