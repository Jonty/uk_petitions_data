        "additional_details": "Cancer statistics are shockingly high - 1 in 2 people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. 1 in 2!!! More needs to be done to prevent this. Prevention is key. I have known of over 5 women being diagnosed with breast cancer in the last year. Every single one of them was under 40! These are only people I\u2019ve known of, think of how many more there are. Perhaps if screening was offered these would\u2019ve been caught. Why wait until 50 when it\u2019s hitting so many younger women. Please sign!",
