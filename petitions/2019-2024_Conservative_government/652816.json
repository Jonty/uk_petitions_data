        "additional_details": "We object to the proposed \u00a338,700 salary threshold for migration, which discriminates against skilled workers, especially outside London, and ignores the disparity between wage growth and inflation, failing to account for the fact that wages have not kept pace with inflation. The cost of living has risen sharply, yet salaries for many have stagnated or increased marginally, making the \u00a338,700 figure unattainable for a significant portion of the workforce.",
        "background": "Reconsider this threshold and propose a more equitable and realistic approach that takes into consideration the wide range of salaries in different regions and sectors. The \u00a338,700 is not only unjust but also detrimental to the growth and diversity of our economy.",
