Eg: Muslims can have absent service but cannot have cremation. \r\n\r\nLAs must he able to make necessary arrangements for cremation & also for burial plots for any to whom cremation is not an option.\r\n\r\nOnly a minority will need burial. Worse comes to worse, the state buries (without civilians handling the body) as best as they can. It's doable but not if authorities are dismissive.",
        "background": "Burials and cremation as well the registry of births and deaths ordinarily come under the supervision of local authorities.\r\n\r\nAs we anticipate an increase on pressure to existing services, the Government must make additional funding available to meet increased demands, that still afford dignity.",
