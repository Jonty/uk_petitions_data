        "additional_details": "As we have seen in the past few days ; more and more people are losing their lives to knife crime. There are a series of reasons as to why this is happening and one of those reasons could be due to the fact that the sale of blades are being promoted on sites such as instagram which is easily accessible to young people who are usually the victims and the offenders of knife crime. The reason behind this petition is to stop the promotion and sale of these blades so young people can feel safe.",
        "background": "People especially young boys have are easily getting their hands on bladed weapons and other articles that could make someone lose their lives. The law should be put into place to stop younger people from gaining access to weapons so easily as there is a lack of security checks when purchasing.",

The title of your petition calls for the advertising of knives and bladed articles to be banned, but your petition goes on to refer to stopping young people to gaining access to knives so easily, and stopping the sale of knives to young people, but doesn't make any requests for the Government to implement policies to achieve this. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
