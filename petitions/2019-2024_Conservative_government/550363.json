        "additional_details": "To often those who are most vulnerable in our society are falling victim to Section 21 of the Housing Act 1988. This is down to the fact landlords do not have to give a reason to serve notice and so can abuse Section 21. Landlords are performing a service like any other high street shop and so need to be held accountable for their actions by the consumer, the tenant. This is why I believe Section 21 is outdated and needs to be repealed.",
        "background": "I would like Parliament to repeal Section 21 of the Housing Act 1988 and to replace it with a bill that states landlords must have a valid reason to enact section 21 and to also place the burden of proof on the landlord for eviction purposes.",
