This money could be put to better use to improve the nation\u2019s ailing healthcare system, or spent on schools and feeding hungry children - but no.\r\n\r\nContrary to popular belief, the monarch does hold real power. Just because Elizabeth II has exercised restraint, for the most part, doesn\u2019t guarantee her decedents will and how does one hold an unelected official accountable if what they\u2019re doing is technically legal?",

Let us have a referendum and let the best side win",
