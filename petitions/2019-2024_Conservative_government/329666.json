        "additional_details": "Increasing violence towards cyclists in particular with a number being delibrately attacked is unacceptable. More protection is needed along with legal and government recognition of their right to be on the road to help change attitudes. \r\n\r\nAt present, the UK is out of step with Europe as one of only five EU countries (along with Cyprus, Malta, Romania and Ireland) that does not operate some form of strict liability for vulnerable road users.",
        "background": "Change civil law in the UK to a system of presumed liability so that cyclists and pedestrians who are involved in road traffic incidents are compensated with ease and protected sufficiently. It should be assumed that an accident is the fault of the vehicle unless it can be proven otherwise.",
