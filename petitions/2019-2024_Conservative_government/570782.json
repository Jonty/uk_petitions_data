        "additional_details": "To make sure the uk\u2019s supermarket staff are fully protected. A lot of us have children at school and there risk of us spreading the virus to our children and therefore to teachers. \r\nAlthough it is now law to wear a mask when in shops unless exempt we do not have the ability to confront those people that flout the rules. We are also not allowed to ask for exemption proof so people are using it as an excuse to come into store when they have forgotten their mask. This puts us all at higher risk.",
        "background": "Keyworkers (supermarket staff) are customer facing and at risk every single time they go to work. We can be in close proximity to hundreds if not thousands of people per day and therefore should be prioritised alongside careworkers for receiving the covid vaccine.",
