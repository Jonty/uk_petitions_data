        "additional_details": "Syrian hamsters deserve to thrive in the environment we put them in. Syrian hamsters need at least 50\u00d780cm of unbroken floor space to make thier burrows and live happily.  To keep the hamster happy and active the bigger cage the better with the proper size wheel (30cm) and other crucial enrichment. Rodents have just as much worth as bigger family pets and deserve to be treated with the same respect and love.",
        "background": "Pet shops should be banned from selling cages smaller than 80\u00d750cm for Syrian hamsters & must ask for proof of a suitable cage when selling a hamster. People keeping syrian hamsters in cages smaller than 80\u00d750 should be reported and fined and the hamster rescued. 80\u00d750cm should be the legal minimum.",
