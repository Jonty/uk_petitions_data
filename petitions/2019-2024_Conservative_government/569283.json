Tests are still booked in the next few months, and with no clear indication of when the restrictions will allow lessons to take place, private practice is key. We are posing less risk than other activities still permitted (e.g. communal worship, since although socially distanced people are still indoors with other households. Scotland and Wales have allowed private practice, why not England?",
        "background": "The Government have banned learner drivers from practicing in their own cars due to the coronavirus pandemic. Even if we are practicing with those we live with, on an essential journey, this has been disallowed. Learner drivers are not happy about this.",
