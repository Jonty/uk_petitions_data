        "action": "Free TV license for the over 75s",
        "additional_details": "It is apparent that the elderly can be some of the loneliest people in society. As people get older and their health deteriorates other forms of entertainment can no longer be physically possible. TV offers engagement and even mental stimulus which could even offer mental health benefits. As a society I believe it is our duty to look after the elderly who have worked their whole life for this country. It has already been free for many years and it's disheartening as it was promised.",
        "background": "People on pension credit already receive a free TV license but the questions asked when applying for pension credit are so invasive it can be very off putting, hence a free TV license should be allowed for all those over 75.",
