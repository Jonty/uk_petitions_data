        "additional_details": "We would like the Government to carefully reconsider this decision as it is still a form of an examination, therefore defeating the purpose of cancelling the main summer exams. We feel as a year group, that we are far more underprepared for any examination having been unable to access sufficient resources to aid our education. In comparison to last year, we have covered significantly less content, making it unfair to sit any public examinations, as it adds untold amounts of stress and pressure.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to shed some more light on the exact outcome for pupils as a result of cancelled exams. That being said, we feel as if \u2018mini summer\u2019 exams is not the solution in these unprecedented times. We propose the Government to allow our predicted grades to be used as the outcome.",
