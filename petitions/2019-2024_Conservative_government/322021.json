        "additional_details": "Year after year we have terrible fires in our National Parks caused by careless use of disposable barbecues and badly managed camp fires.\r\n\r\n They have a devastating impact on our wildlife, cost hundreds of man hours and put our fire service in danger while they fight them. \r\nLast year we had fires in Moray, Greater Manchester, Winter Hill in Lancashire, and Ilkley Moor in West Yorkshire to the Vale of Rheidol in Ceredigion, and the Ashdown Forest in Sussex. \r\n\r\n2020 has already seen fires in areas like the Peak District, Wareham Forest,  Kilpatrick Hills, West Dunbartonshire.......\r\n\r\nSurely the only sensible answer is to ban them in all areas where there is peat and valuable wildlife.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition, and ask your friends and family to do so as well. \r\nThank you.",
