        "additional_details": "I feel that us Key Workers are at great risk going to work as we are all exposed to the COVID-19 Virus. We are not able to work from home, we are looking after adults and young people who are vulnerable and who are at significant risk. We are looking after someone elses loved ones, ensuring that we are carrying out our jobs we set out to do. We are also putting our own families at risk on returning back home. If we are off sick we only receive SSP which is not enough to live on.",
        "background": "I will like the Government to consider paying a Hazard payment for all Key Workers working through COVID-19 Outbreak and unable to isolate with their families.\r\nWe are all exposed to the risks, we are unable to work from home as we are keeping adults and young children safe who need our support",
