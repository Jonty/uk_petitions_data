        "additional_details": "The legislation, policies and procedures that govern the administration of the Welfare State need to be amended as a matter of urgency! Since the introduction of Universal Credit, poverty and deprivation across the UK has increased as a direct result - ONS Stats confirm this. Welfare reform of 2013  created a system that doesn't allow claimants enough money to live to the most basic standard, before deductions are made. Additionally punitive measures such as sanctions breach human rights.",

Currently 30% of a claimants Personal Allowance can be deducted for debt repayments to Gov agencies. But this doesn't include Benefit Cap or Third Party deductions.This leads to poverty !",
