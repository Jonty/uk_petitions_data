        "additional_details": "My wife is a full time carer, she works twelve hour shifts and provides excellent levels of care in her place of work. She comes home late many times, not asking for any extra money, just stays to make sure each client has what they need before she leaves. I think it would be a shame if our government does not at least discuss this, they all deserve to be rewarded for their dedication throughout these worrying times.",
        "background": "Look into a way to increase Carers wages. They have been overlooked and deserve a decent rise for their courage, commitment and high level of care given throughout the Covid 19. They should also get sick pay as when clients become ill, there is a good chance carers become ill too.",
