        "action": "2021 exams need to be reduced in conent and have lenient grade boundaries.",
        "additional_details": "The students of 2021 have suffered the most. As 2020 students were taught the majority of their content in schools, the students of 2021 have had to take matters into their own hands through selfteaching and attempted home learning without the necessary support. For some this has been easy, yet the class divide in the UK has made it harder for others. Many students live in unfit conditions and simply do not have the equipment or home environment to study in, therefor i demand that  all students must be ensured that they have a fair chance of achieving their desired grades.",
        "background": "I would like the goverment to esnure that every student taking their GCSE / A level Exams in 2021 have a fair chance of achieving the grades needed for future education, given the current set backs of; not learning in sutible environments and not covering full contents of work without assistance.",
