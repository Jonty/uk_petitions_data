This uniform is a detriment to education according to the current accepted educational research around improving outcomes: the simple memory model. If students are too hot, uncomfortable, chafing, suffering a rash and/or feeling strangled along with other discomforts caused by the current uniform, this overloads the working memory and prevents focus on the work.",
