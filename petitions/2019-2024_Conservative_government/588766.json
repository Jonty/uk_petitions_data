A defibrillator can be used by any member of the public to help save a life. The machine WILL NOT shock anyone who will not benefit from this and is very easy to use. In the case of a person in Cardiac Arrest they have  1in10 chance of surviving. A defibrillator is the only way to get the heart back into a life saving rhythm.",
