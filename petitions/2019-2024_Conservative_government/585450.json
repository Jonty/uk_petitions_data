UAE has the 2nd fastest vaccination rate, one of the world\u2019s most intensive testing systems using PCR Tests and are combatting the spread of concerning variants by restricting entry from high-risk countries and tagging travelers coming from non-green countries. Travelling via another country with a higher rate of infection is putting peoples health at risk.",

UK citizens have to fly to another country to transfer to the UK and then hotel quarantine. This means using another country as a travel hub when we can fly direct and quarantine at home.",
