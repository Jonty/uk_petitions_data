        "action": "Replace GCSE and A Level exams with coursework and teacher assessments.",
        "additional_details": "Considering the governments clear point of view of wanting to make it \"Fair\" for all students I think that still taking exams will provide a lot lower results than usual. Meaning that when we are competing for university spots with people from wales who have their predicted grades students from England will have a lower chance of being able to gain those places at university which for some courses will be extremely limited. \r\nI hope that the government can look at this through the eyes of the current year 11 and 13 students and change their decision.",
        "background": "I would like the government to rethink their decision of letting exams carry on in 2021 because of the amount of time current year 11 and 13 students have lost due to lockdown and isolation because of the coronavirus pandemic.",
