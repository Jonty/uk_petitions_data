        "additional_details": "This petition is because Over the years, the name of \u2018Jesus Christ\u2019 has been used as a curse word and as a way to degrade God!\r\nThe name of Siddhartha Gautama who Buddhists worship, the many names of the Hindu gods, the name of Allah is not used as a curse word, why then, is the name of Jesus Christ readily available at the lips of those who do not respect or have any reverence for Christianity?\r\nWhilst many may not believe in Jesus Christ, his name deserves as much respect as other religions.",
        "background": "To recognise the name of Jesus Christ being used as a curse word, as an offence, in public spaces. \r\nI know many other Christian\u2019s across the board feel the same but feel they would not get the support of the government.\r\nThe further we move away from Christianity the more corrupt society becomes.",
