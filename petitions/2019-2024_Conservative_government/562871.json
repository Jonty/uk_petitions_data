There are a large number of voices within the science and medical community who harbour concerns that the test is being used incorrectly to determine the current infection status of the population. \r\nTherefore, the government should provide absolute clarity around the testing methods since March and provide substantial evidence that the means of COVID-19 testing is appropriate.",
