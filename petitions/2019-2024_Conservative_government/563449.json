        "action": "Reduce the university fees for those who have only been given online learning.",
        "additional_details": "Because the students who are solely online are not experiencing the same learning benefits as those going into university and are still paying the full amount of \u00a39,250 a year for half of the promised experience. Many students have relocated away from home and are in new cities but now stuck at on their computers without any real university experience. They could have saved money, stayed at home with friends and family and done an open university course and it would have been the half the price",
        "background": "To reduce the university student fees for the academic year affected due to COVID-19. Not all universities have allowed access to the campus or face to face learning and have been entirely online. Therefore, many students have suffered by not receiving their full potential learning that was promised",
