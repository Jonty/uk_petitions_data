        "action": "Provide Personal Protective Equipment to UK essential workers to fight Covid 19",
        "additional_details": "While some employers are already adopting basic measures and supplying minimal protective equipment this is still insufficiently widespread. It is illegal and immoral to put employees in a situation that undermines their health and safety. The government must act to supply employers with Personal Protective Equipment for all employees, and take all appropriate measures to make essential work safe. This will help slow transmission of the virus, and so avoid a humanitarian and economic disaster.",
        "background": "In light of the UK spread of Covid 19 the government should mandate employers to: \r\n1) supply essential workers with Personal Protective Equipment;\r\n2) introduce appropriate safety protocol in all workplaces, including social distancing between staff (and public), whether hospital or logistics hub.",
