        "action": "Extend financial support for EU students studying in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The impact of removing financial support for EU students on recruitment will leave the education market in turmoil and create a crisis of monoculture in UK universities. Research by HEPI suggests reducing access to studying in the UK threatens an estimated \u00a31.2bn contributed by each new wave of students from the EU. A cliff edge change to fees and loan entitlements will restrict all students from the open and vibrant experience that they deserve.",
        "background": "Future students from the EU, EEA, and Swiss nationals will lose access to loans and face higher tuition fees from 2021. We call for the Government to either extend access to loans and home student fees or implement alternative financial support after the end of the transition period with the EU.",
