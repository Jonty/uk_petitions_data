        "additional_details": "Our children have now been unable to play properly with their friends for 4 months as they mainly play games which involve contact. Their friendships, development, and mental health are suffering. They are lonely - especially those who are only children. \r\nThis rule would also allow them to be looked after by grandparents - crucial at this time when employers will be asking people to return to work. \r\nOur children have been overlooked in the response to the pandemic and it is time to help them.",
        "background": "Children aged 0-11 need to be able to play without having to physically distance. In Scotland children are now allowed to meet other households indoor or outdoor without having to distance, and we would like the rules in England to be the same.",
