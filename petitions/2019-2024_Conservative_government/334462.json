        "additional_details": "While we all love the 'Eat out to help out' scheme it doesn't really go hand in hand with the government plan to lose weight and fight obesity.  \r\nMental and physical health should be the government top priority in terms of preparing the country for winter and the possibility of a second wave.  \r\nBy paying 50% of gym memberships and health and fitness classes the government will not only help people achieve their health goals, it will also support the  struggling health and fitness industry.",
        "background": "Get the government to pay 50% of Gym memberships, and fitness and wellness classes. \r\nIf the government wants those industries to survive and is serious about it's weight loss plan then it should take this opportunity and help two birds lose one stone :)",
