This penalty is set out in the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, but deciding whether to prosecute individuals and what if any sentence to apply in individual instances would be a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service and the courts, not the Government or House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIf you want the Government to end the requirement for individuals to have to fill in a passenger locator form, we could accept a petition requesting this."
