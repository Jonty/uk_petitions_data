        "background": "Many falconers travel to Scotland to fly Eagles & Goshawks at Blue hare.\r\nThe recent change in the law to protect them from mass culling is understandable, unfortunately falconers are suffering as a consequence, numbers caught by falconers are very low and have zero impact on the hare population.",
