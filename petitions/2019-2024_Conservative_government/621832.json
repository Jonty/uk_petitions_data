This would cover suffering caused by taking a dog for a walk, or leaving a dog in a car, in excessive heat. Fines can be issued for these types of offences, as well as prison sentences.\r\n\r\nThe Government's code of practice for the welfare of dogs, which provides owners and keepers with information on how to meet the welfare needs of their animals, and can be used in courts as evidence in cases brought before them relating to poor welfare, specifically highlights the risks of heat stress: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/697953/pb13333-cop-dogs-091204.pdf\r\n\r\nIf you're concerned about a specific incident, you may wish to report it directly to the RSPCA: https://www.rspca.org.uk/utilities/contactus/reportcruelty\r\n\r\nWe could publish a petition calling for a total banning of dog walking between the hours of 10am and 6pm if that's something you'd like to see happen, although this may have a different negative impact on animal welfare if implemented.
