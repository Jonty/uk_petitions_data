        "additional_details": "The Royal Society, that informs the gov, reported that cloth-based face coverings almost completely eliminated the emission of particles in some cases.\r\n\r\nIn 24 hrs I've seen..\r\nBuses full of people not masked.\r\nShop workers not masked. \r\nShoppers not masked.\r\n\r\nAdvice alone isn't working. Advice can be dismissed.\r\nWhen lives are at stake it should not be left to the individuals choice. \r\nA choice which could endanger those around them. \r\nThere should be no choice. \r\nMake it mandatory in enclosed spaces.",
        "background": "If the government want to unlock the country then yes, masks are a vital part of that. However being advisory on masks is not strong enough language when they have been dismissed so readily for the past 8 weeks by the government & press. They must be made mandatory for all indoor & enclosed spaces.",
