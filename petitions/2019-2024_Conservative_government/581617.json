        "additional_details": "This is a busy road, used heavily by school children, and young adults of a local college. There are traffic lights to control the cars, but at no point do all the cars stop so it is safe for pedestrians to cross. This makes it extremely dangerous for anyone to cross. Many cars do drive fast across this crossing and don't stop or slow down to allow people to cross safely.",
        "background": "I want the government to recognise that the crossing just outside of Laser Quest in Amblecote is really dangerous. \r\nThis road is busy at the best of times, especially during the morning and afternoon when school children are using it.",
