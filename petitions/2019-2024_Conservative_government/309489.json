The vast majority of sites cannot be considered essential work so should close to protect workers and public, exceptions should be granted for works related to vital services but only when this will hamper containment efforts",
        "background": "During lockdowns to prevent spread of coronavirus, only essential work should be ongoing, unless the construction is related to health or emergency services it cannot be deemed essential",
