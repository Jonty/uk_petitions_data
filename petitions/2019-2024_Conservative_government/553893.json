        "action": "Reverse the FCAs decision to ban sales of crypto-derivatives to retail consumers",
        "additional_details": "It's double standards. A consumer can go and play the lottery, gamble large amounts on sports betting but can't do the same with crypto derivatives (often not gambling at all when using the correct tools and knowing when to use a stop loss). The FCA have banned it as they want to protect the consumer. It's the gambling industry they want to look at first. This is a terrible decision.",
        "background": "On the 6th October the financial conduct authority announced it was banning crypto derivatives sales to retail consumers. How can consumers be able to gamble 1000s of pounds on a football match but not be able to purchase crypto derivatives with often a much lower risk? Please reverse the decision.",
