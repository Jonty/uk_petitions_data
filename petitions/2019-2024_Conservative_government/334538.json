Being flagged up on this system is already too late - it is reactive.\r\n\r\nA proactive system running alongside this certificate can prevent mental health problems.\r\n\r\nThis needs to be in place in schools, businesses and communities making the approach \u201cexperiential\u201d and \u201cin person\u201d as opposed to accessing mental health services online.\r\n\r\nImplement a robust proactive system that the nation needs to be aware of. A Strengthening Mental Health Session should be as acceptable as a physical fitness session.\r\n\r\nMental health sessions running alongside PE classes in schools and in businesses as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility.",
