        "additional_details": "It is well established that fireworks cause distress to animals. Many people might think that they are set off on specific dates and I thought this myself until I moved to my present address. The firework season usually starts around the middle of October and continues on a nightly basis until well into the New Year. The people concerned do not need an excuse to set off fireworks. They set them off for the sake of setting them off and there are shops that sell fireworks throughout the year.",
        "background": "Fireworks should be allowed on specific dates. Guy Fawkes Night is an obvious one and Halloween and New Year are others. The important dates of minority communities could be recognised as well. The specific dates are open to negotiation, but it should be illegal to set off fireworks on other dates.",
