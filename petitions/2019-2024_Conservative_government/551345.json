        "additional_details": "The plan is not only a huge burden on the British taxpayer, it is a direct infringement on the right to freedom & privacy, which in a free & democratic country is deeply concerning. The plans make reference to \u201cimmunity/virus free passports,\u201d likely to be available through an app. Essentially a \"Health Passport\" or could otherwise be called \"Digital I.D\" . Furthermore, it may determine if you are permitted to work, travel, attend events or visit a relative. Control by coersion is unacceptable.",
