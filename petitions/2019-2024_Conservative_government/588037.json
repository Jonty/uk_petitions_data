        "additional_details": "We have an opportunity to respond positively to the Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's request for vaccines, made directly to Boris Johnson on 4th June 2021. Nepal does not have time to wait for COVAX commitments which may or may not materialise. People are dying now in their thousands due to a lack of vaccine, and with one of the poorest health infrastructures in the world Nepal needs the UK to stand by it now, not in a few months time or when children here are vaccinated, but now, today.",
        "background": "The COVID-19 situation in Nepal is desperate with one of the highest transmission rates in the world. Only a fraction of the population have received a vaccine. The UK has deep historic links with Nepal. Many Gurkha soldiers have given their lives in service to the UK. Now is the time to act.",
