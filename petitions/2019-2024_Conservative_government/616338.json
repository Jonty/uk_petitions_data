        "additional_details": "The SATs gives an indication of how well a school is performing and has no bearing on the actual student, but the physical and mental stress to perform well is unfair. Other government tests that should be stopped are the year 1 phonics screening and now the proposed assessments for 4 year olds and then the Year 4 times table tests, none of these benefit the children but instead cause anxiety and stress related problems for them. Our children's health has to come first and not school statistic",
        "background": "Stop SATS in primary schools!\r\nGovernment tests are taking away our children's childhood! SATs take place in year 2 and 6 and cause untold pressure on students, parents and teacher's alike. Children are physically ill because of these tests and that is without the mental health issues caused!",
