        "action": "Make BSL mandatory in Primary School Education.",
        "additional_details": "The more people learning BSL through their education, the more access deaf people would have to wider society. There are about 11 million people in the UK who are deaf or hard of hearing. 11 million peoples lives that could  have been made so much easier by introducing BSL classes to the more privileged people of society from a young age. There is a lot of work to be done to gain the equality of deaf people, and to heighten the awareness in Parliament is a great way to begin.",
        "background": "Over the past years, deaf schools have continued to close, meaning that deaf children are now being taught in mainstream environments. If hearing children were given the chance to learn BSL at school, deaf children would have much better access to not only their education, but also their peers.",
