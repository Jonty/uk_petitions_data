        "additional_details": "The government needs to act and review court procedures and let all child sexual abuse cases go to court. Allow Judge and Jury the final say over the case, to ensure the welfare of the child is prioritised. \r\nSomething needs to change to stop these vulnerable children losing faith in humanity, police and everyone. Reaching a ultimate low that in some cases see them seeking comfort from drugs or other substances, self harm or worse.",
        "background": "Disclosing sexual abuse is a difficult and distressing experience for any victim, even worse if the victim is a child!. And all too often these cases never go to court due to as police will say \u2018lack of evidence\u2019. So the perpetrator walks free. \r\nWhilst the child is left feeling let down by everyone",
