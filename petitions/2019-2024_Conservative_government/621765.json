We don\u2019t want to depend on our partner to provide for us, we want to be independent. \r\nThe little benefits provided aren't enough. The cost of living has increased so should the help from the government.",

Without receiving benefits, children can\u2019t get a space on a public nursery, having to pay for a private one. But a family with one parent earning a salary of less than \u00a330K a year can\u2019t afford it.",
