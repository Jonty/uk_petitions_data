        "additional_details": "I believe all judges should be made to study domestic violence, trauma responses and why victims struggle coming forward. Alongside awareness of mental health and fight or flight responses. \r\nIt is important to be able to appeal if you believe a decision is wrong to give families a fighting chance to get the outcome they deserve. Similar to that in a criminal setting. Where appeals can be made if you believe something has been over looked or a decision has been made wrongfully.",
        "background": "At the moment it stands that you can only appeal if a judge does something wrong within family court settings. You can not appeal if you feel a decision has been wrongfully made. I would like this to change to help parents out there who are trying to save their children and families from abuse.",
