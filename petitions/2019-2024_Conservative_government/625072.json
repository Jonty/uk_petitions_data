        "action": "Prevent the ban of numerous Bulldog species.",
        "additional_details": "We would like parliament to do this, due to the fact that these are a loving species who bring light and personality to many family homes in the UK. \r\n\r\nI personally have French Bulldogs with no health complications, and an XL American Bulldog puppy who is the most loving, gentle animal I have ever met. The criminalisation of these dogs would cause a lot of heartache for many families. If these animals are bred and raised in a safe and licensed setting, there would be no good reason to ban them.",
        "background": "There is a law that is predicted to be passed, that will ban the breeding/purchase/ownership of many Bulldog breeds. These breeds include English Bulldogs, French Bulldogs, American Bulldog etc. We would like parliament to review this further, find an alternate solution or even suspend this bill.",
