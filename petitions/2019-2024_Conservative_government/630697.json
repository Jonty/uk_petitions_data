        "additional_details": "Shortly after moving into our new house on Wolverhampton Road South, our parked vehicle was severely damaged in a hit-and-run incident in the early hours. We understand that this happens often. We regularly witness speeding vehicles, which on a tree lined road creates a danger of skidding on wet leaves etc. Incidents like this pose a danger not only to other parked cars on the road but also to the lives of the adults, children and pets who reside on the street, as well as pedestrians.",
        "background": "The Wolverhampton Road South currently has a speed limit of 40mph, which for essentially a single lane residential road is far too fast, posing a danger to the residents who live on the road and pedestrians who walk on it.",
