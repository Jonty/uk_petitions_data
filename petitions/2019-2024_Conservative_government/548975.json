They are receiving full pay, full pension's.\r\nIf Government bodies were asked to take a 2/3% cut, it would save a huge amount of monies, this could be ploughed back into the system for furloughing an extra 2-3m. Government bodies should contribute.",
        "background": "Hello - Could you please look into the impact that Covid-19 has had on both Public/Private sectors. I work like many millions in the Private Sector, we have been hammered with 20% or 10% pay cuts whilst working, this could be for months. Many have been furloughed or have lost their jobs.",

We understand that you don't want the NHS to be included, but we're not sure whether you'd want the Police or Teachers to be included for example. The Government isn't responsible for all public sector workers, such as employees of local authorities.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like to happen. For example, you could start a new petition asking for the Government to impose a pay cut on the civil service, if that's what you'd like to happen. "
