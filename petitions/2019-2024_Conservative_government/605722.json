        "additional_details": "On the 23rd December, the government said \u201croutine visiting to wards will no longer be possible and visitors will be allowed to visit the hopsital in exceptional cases only\u201d. Many people have been unable to say good bye to loved ones since the pandemic began. Many have died alone. Final moments with loved ones provide comfort for both the patient and family, and stay with you forever; this has been denied by the government. From the elderly to young children, nobody should have to die alone.",
        "background": "Bars, night clubs, and other bigger events, are arguably much \u201chigher risk\u201d than visiting relatives in hospitals. Given the visitor has a covid pass and/or a negative lateral flow test, these conditions allow us to attend high risk events; we should be able to say good bye to dying loved ones too.",
