        "additional_details": "We ask the Government to impose measures on the aircraft industry to eliminate, or drastically reduce, aircraft vapour trail emissions by removing the cause or developing and fitting vapour trail suppression equipment to all jet engined aircraft.\r\nAircraft vapour trails were very uncommon before 2000, they have increased exponentially to the point now that it is common to see the sky criss crossed with vapour trails that cover the entire sky.",
        "background": "Aircraft vapour trails and the clouds they create are blocking out sunlight therefore reducing the the output of solar panel installations right across the UK. With the current energy crisis this should be of concern to everyone.",
