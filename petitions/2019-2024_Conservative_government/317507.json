        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to do so as due to the recent events caused by coronavirus, resulting in the closure of schools and colleges, students are unable to study efficiently due to the distance learning. I am aware it is a serious issue and that distance learning is the most efficient method, however it is still difficult for students to study as they would in classroom due to lack of support and thus may fail in their exams. Therefore, predicted grades should be given to these students.",
        "background": "I wish for the Government or Parliament to give students their predicted grades that will be sitting their GCSEs and A-levels in the year of 2020-202. Due to the unfortunate coronavirus issue we're facing, we're unable to study aptly and therefore have lost the time required to cover necessary work.",
