        "additional_details": "We are in the 21century and everyone should be equal in all ramifications.No one has more right over the custody of the kid(s) unless the court says otherwise.Most Single parent has taken it as a means to punish the other parent to the detriment of the kid(s).It takes two people to make a child unless through other means.It is very disheartening that a parent can stop the Ex from seeing their kid(s) and the government doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with it even when there is no court injection",
        "background": "It has become a menace in recent times, how one parent solely stops the EX from seeing their kid(s) they had together after a breakup without any court orders, making me question if a particular set are above law and has made the police powerless because they can\u2019t act",
