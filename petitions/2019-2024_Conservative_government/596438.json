        "additional_details": "Childcare in the UK is the second most expensive in the world and it\u2019s growing considerably more expensive now. It\u2019s almost impossible for families to afford it with both parents working full time. Considering mum is the most likely one to quit and stay home to raise the child, it\u2019s a harsh and unfair tax on women and their careers, and is a strong gender pay gap propagator. It also disadvantages single parents and middle and working class families.",
        "background": "Government should create a childcare subsidy system for working parents, so that they are refunded fees for both daycare and after-school care on a sliding scale based on their income. This could support parents to raise the next generation, which is a social investment in our country\u2019s future.",
