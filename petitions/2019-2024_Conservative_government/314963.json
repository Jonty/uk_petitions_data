If we continue to allow passengers into the country, we will constantly re-seed the country with this virus. The UK may suffer potentially irreversible economic, social and health issues as a result. We must burn it out with lockdown within the UK, and stop it returning in mass numbers. We all want a return to normality and this is a key step to achieve it. We have a geographical advantage that we are an island. Use it!",

Continue to allow imports of vital services and supplies via ports and repatriation of British citizens (with quarantine period). Use limited (rapid) testing at borders to test freight workers coming into country with supplies.",
