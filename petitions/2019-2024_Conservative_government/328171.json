        "additional_details": "I want the Government to do this due to the amount of lessons and valuable revision time missed especially in schools which haven't opened yet. As I am student in this situation, I know a lot of people including myself who are worrying about their future and how it will be affected by their GSCE including me. As students we understand that our exams can't be cancelled like the previous year group however open book will massively help us however we are still using our own knowledge. By allowing this, this will reduce the amount of stress on thousands of students and help them succeed in the future.",
