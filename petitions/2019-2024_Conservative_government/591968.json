        "additional_details": "Anti-vaxers have always been a part of society  and the choice to not be vaccinated should have no repercussions on a persons life or freedom. Without forcing people, the government are making rules and regulations on things such as isolating when returning from holidays (at a personal expense) as well care company\u2019s stating they won\u2019t employ anyone who hasn\u2019t been vaccinated. Not to mention the countless complaints people have had from the vaccine. Its an infringement of our human rights.",
        "background": "Gov said last year there were zero plans to introduce documents to prove you have been vaccinated to gain entry to venues, go on holiday or not have to isolate. Now we are seeing more news stories headed in this direction. We are told the vaccine isn\u2019t mandatory, but without it you can\u2019t do much.",
