Your petition calls for Spanish residents in the UK to be exempted from requirements to quarantine, but it's not clear exactly how you want this to work.\r\n\r\nThe current Covid-19 requirements to quarantine when entering the UK are based on the country a person is travelling from, not their nationality.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, we could accept a petition calling on the Government to remove Spain from the red list, or to allow people to travel to their home countries without having to quarantine upon return, if either of those are things you want to happen."
