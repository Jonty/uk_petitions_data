        "action": "Keep schools closed to avoid summer lockdown.",
        "additional_details": "There are plans to reopen schools on March 8th, despite the huge risk of another surge in coronavirus cases; that could lead to a summer lockdown. When schools reopened in September (due to the mixing of thousands of households) the coronavirus cases began to rise. Also, in London, the November lockdown failed horrendously due the lack of school closure.  However students should be given the option to return if their mental health is declining, in a safe and 'socially-distanced' fashion.",
        "background": "As students, we want schools to remain closed until at least Easter. We understand that the cases are highly likely to rise again if schools open. We are willing to sacrifice our time to fight the virus, but are beginning to become tired of continuous lockdowns -which are inevitable if schools open.",
