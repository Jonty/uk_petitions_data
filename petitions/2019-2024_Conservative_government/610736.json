        "action": "Debate providing a European task force to impose a no fly zone over Ukraine",
        "additional_details": "I think it is disgusting that The UK is sitting back and watching innocent people being slaughtered in their own homes and effectively doing nothing. Ukraine has asked for a no fly zone and should be given one. There should be no discussion with Russia. The first Russia should know about it is when their air craft and surface to air capabilities are being destroyed by air craft with UK / Spanish / Polish / Greek / Dutch / Finnish / Swiss / French / German etc markings.",
        "background": "I accept a NATO no fly zone is a non starter. I want UK Government to approach every European Country (clearly not Russia or Belarus) independently, with the intention of setting up a task force to enforce a no fly zone over Ukraine. NATO will not be involved - just independent European countries",
