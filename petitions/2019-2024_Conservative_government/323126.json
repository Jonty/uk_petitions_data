        "additional_details": "Suffering from a dental problem like an abscess is painful and detrimental to long-term dental health - the longer it is left, the worse it gets and the more difficult it is to treat. Older people who did not grow up with the benefits of fluoride toothpaste have real dental problems like abscesses and tooth decay and for them getting dental treatment is not a luxury, but a vital necessity to their health.",
        "background": "Under the Corona virus rules, all normal dental surgeries are closed. People with dental problems like abscesses cannot get treatment at the NHS Urgent Dental Hubs until their condition is judged to be a life-threatening emergency. This means they just have to stay at home and suffer in pain.",
