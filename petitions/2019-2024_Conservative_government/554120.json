We have missed out on many months of face to face teaching, but exams being delayed for three weeks doesn\u2019t make amends for this; it does nothing. Although we have missed months of teaching, it\u2019s the content of the exams needs altering, not the exams being delayed by three weeks with no real reason why.",
