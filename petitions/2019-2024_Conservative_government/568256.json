        "additional_details": "The government should facilitate landlords with the ability to free students from private rental tenancies with no consequences, or give grants to students to be able to pay for their rent during the pandemic. Students are already being charged ridiculous amounts for online learning which is inadequate in comparison to face-to-face teaching, they should not also be financially drained due to private landlords demanding full rent from students who can\u2019t use what they are paying for.",
        "background": "Students who are in private tenancies should be released from these at they are unable to travel to university to study or use facilities. Private landlords have been demanding extortionate amounts that are unrealistic for students who cannot work, study or travel, therefore they should be released.",
