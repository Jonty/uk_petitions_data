        "additional_details": "If the government legalise and regulate the licensing and production for recreational and medical use of cannabis the crime rate would fall and push people into more legitimate means of business. Taxing cannabis like cigarettes would also bring lots of money back into our country. This would aid the economy to recover from the pandemic and it could also bring more people into the country via tourism and boost local economies once the pandemic is over.",
        "background": "The government should legalise and regulate the production of cannabis for recreational and medical usage as a means of economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. So many countries have already decriminalised or legalised, its time for us to follow and be a progressive and free thinking nation.",
