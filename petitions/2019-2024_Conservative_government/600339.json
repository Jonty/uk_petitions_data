        "additional_details": "This means that a sole earner earning 60k would have to pay back 100% of the received benefit. Compare this to a household where both parents are working and each earn 50k. This household would still keep 100% of the Child Benefit received - even though the combined family income is 100k.\r\n\r\nThis tax is wholly unfair on sole earner families and must be rethought.",
        "background": "Benefit changes introduced in 2012 by the then chancellor George Osborne introduced a sliding scale to claw back Child Benefit. For every \u00a3100 earned over 50k 1% of the claimed Child Benefit must be repaid.",
