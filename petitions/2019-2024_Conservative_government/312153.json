        "additional_details": "I feel this would be beneficial to so many children.\r\nIf they get moved to the next year group in September alot of children will struggle. Emotionally & developmentally wont be ready. Especially EYFS & infants. It could have big impacts on them.\r\nThe children in reception will not have gained all the important skills they need in there first year in school. \r\nPreschool children will not have had enough focus on being school ready either and will miss important transitions.\r\n\r\nPlease consider this.",
        "background": "If the social distancing and school closure remains until the end of summer 2020 term. \r\nPlease consider changing the new school starters to January 2021 and leave the current children in the same school year until then.",
