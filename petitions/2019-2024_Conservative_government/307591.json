        "additional_details": "The health and safety of workers in these key areas is essential to carry out the plan which the government is setting forth to combat this disease. Providing effective PPE for those most at risk will help ensure that key workers remain healthy for work and be able to carry out their essential roles amid this crisis. PPE will help key workers feel safe and protected and encourage those who are fearful for the health of themselves and close ones to continue to work and be productive.",
        "background": "During the current covid-19 crisis across the UK there are certain key workers who are in higher risk enviroments. Settings such as nurseries where staff members are forced to be in close contact with children are particularly vunerable to infection and should therefore be provided with proper PPE.",
