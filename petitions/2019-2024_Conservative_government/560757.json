        "action": "Close schools from the 11th December to prevent families isolating at Christmas.",
        "additional_details": "Christmas is a time for families to spend quality time together and not have a child isolating on Christmas day. If a positive case occurred prior to this date within a school then the isolation period would end prior to Christmas. However if there was a positive case within a school after this date then all children and staff within that bubble would have to isolate ruining Christmas for many families and children. Christmas should be a time for family not a time for isolation and being alone.",
        "background": "I would like government to consider closing all schools nationally on the 11th December to ensure pupils and school staff are able to spend Christmas together with loved ones and not having to worry about isolating on Christmas day if their school bubble has a confirmed case after this date.",
