        "additional_details": "There is currently no future trading deal in place with the EU. The PM frequently states No Deal is a likely outcome. It\u2019s widely recognised any change to trading terms represents fresh obstacles and challenges. After 60,000+ Covid deaths U.K. Gov must focus on shielding citizens from Covid, rolling out the vaccine program and maintaining our food supply chains. Government time spent on the politically-motivated Brexit project at this time is unnecessary at best, negligent at worst.",
        "background": "The pandemic has caused unforeseen and wide-reaching challenges. With travel bans impacting supply chains and Covid cases increasing sharply the U.K. government should acknowledge this national emergency and prioritise the wellbeing of citizens over political negotiations.",
