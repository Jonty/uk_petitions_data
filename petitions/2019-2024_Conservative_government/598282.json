This may lead to the students being viewed as bad and unserious about their education, therefore giving them unequal chances when they are applying for college or sixth form.\r\n\r\nFurthermore most of these events are a day, we are not saying to cancel Christmas , Hanukkah and Easter but to allow others to have a day off as well, to ensure everything is fair and convenient.",
        "background": "We want the government to take non-Christian religious holidays and events into consideration. It is unfair that people from the religions such as Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism and many other religions don\u2019t have scheduled days to take time off.",
