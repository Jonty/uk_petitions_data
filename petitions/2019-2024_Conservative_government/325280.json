        "action": "Ban the use of police horses for purposes of crowd control",
        "additional_details": "This is the kind of reform the Police will not consider without legislation. The police are often heavy handed anyway, and intimidatory tactics are things they would no doubt prefer to keep at their disposal.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to consider this an animal rights issue, as if a horse gets ridden, or even used to charge through a protest and gets injured, that is not the horses fault. The fault can only be laid with the Police for charging in the first place.",
        "background": "The use of police horses at protests is an intimidation tactic, and serves to raise tensions at protests or other events where they are used. This puts horses in harm's way unnecessarily, when there are other more efficient ways of gaining a vantage point (as we are told that is what horses are for)",
