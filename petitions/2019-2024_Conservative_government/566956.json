        "additional_details": "As a student myself I am struggling immensely with my mental wellbeing and like many other students I know would like universities to offer concessions to accommodate for the difficulties being faced through isolation and panic during this stressful period of time. I feel greatly neglected by both my institution and by the government who are both responsible for my wellbeing to a certain extent. More needs to be done to help shift the attitude towards students from villains to victims.",
        "background": "I would like the government to conduct a survey into the general mood of students and their wellbeing during this time to aid appropriate concessions to help reduce stress and declining mental health concerns at the hands of the pandemic situation",
