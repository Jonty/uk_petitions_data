        "action": "Pay workers who lose jobs during Covid-19 crisis with full salary for 6 months",
        "additional_details": "Staff losing their job in the current climate will face a near impossible task to find new employment in a saturated jobs market, with most employers putting a freeze on recruitment. Six months\u2019 salary, in combination with mortgage/rent holidays would be a show of solidarity from a government which has promised to \u2018do whatever it takes\u2019 to get through the Covid-19 crisis. Our priority should be on our health and taking care of our families, not worrying whether or not we can pay the bills.",
        "background": "I\u2019m calling for the government to subsidise lost earnings of workers made unemployed during the Coronavirus pandemic with benefits equal to their full salary for a period of six months. With freelance or staff on zero hour contracts calculated using their average monthly wage over past 12 months.",
