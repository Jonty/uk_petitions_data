        "additional_details": "In my opinion, driving is essential! People need to drive and get to their place of work. If it is ok for you to sit in a Taxi then surely it is ok to sit in with an instructor for a lesson. During the 1st lockdown, essential workers were still able to sit their driving tests, why isn\u2019t this the case anymore? It would be so much safer if those who are ready to take their test to do so as they would no longer need public transport or need to rely on somebody else to get to their place of work.",
