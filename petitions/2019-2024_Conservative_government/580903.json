        "additional_details": "There have been many cases and reports of sexual abuse and harassment by officers towards members of the public, and the Government has also recently passed legislation enabling police officers to be authorised to engage in criminal conduct which could seriously harm people. And now Project Vigilant.\r\nThe Government should Cancel Project Vigilant, and protect people by actually listening to and implementing the recommendations of established anti-violence campaigners and organisations.",
        "background": "Listen to anti sexual violence campaigners and do not roll out Project Vigilant. Many such groups have asked for different measures to be taken, and have disapproved of the move to place undercover officers in and around bars and clubs throughout the country, which could put people at higher risk.",
