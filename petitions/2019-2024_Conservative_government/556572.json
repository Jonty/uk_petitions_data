        "additional_details": "Clinics are still not open despite a large proportion of businesses, and educational institutions re-opening. Telephone appointments do not provide adequate support nor can thorough assessments and reviews be carried out. In some cases key development reviews are being missed which could contribute to long-term health implications for children.  \r\n\r\nBookable, COVID secure appointments should be made available to ensure families are sufficiently supported and assessments are accurate.",
        "background": "Healthy Baby Clinics have been closed since lockdown. Consequently, families have been unable to access face-to-face support or advice.\r\n\r\nThe closure of Healthy Baby Clinics has been particularly difficult for new parents who were, and in some cases still are, isolated from friends and family.",
