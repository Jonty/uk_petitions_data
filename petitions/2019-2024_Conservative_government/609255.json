        "additional_details": "This will hit the rich in Russia hardest and should not affect the poor and middle class, who just want to get on with their lives without influence of their government. These \"rich\" are likely to be the same people who supported the invasion.\r\n\r\nIf we ban parties who take donations from Russia, it will also remove any Russian control over Parliament.\r\n\r\nWe need to show Russia that invading sovereign nations can and will be punished.",
        "background": "Russia has invaded Ukraine. One of the sanctions of this should be for the UK to impound all assets owned by Russian nationals, this should include property.\r\n\r\nWe should also ban all parties who have Russian-linked donors from Parliament, as this is a conflict of interest.",
