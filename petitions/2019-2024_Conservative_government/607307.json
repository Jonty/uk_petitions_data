        "additional_details": "It is not the drivers responsibility to look after every one else on the road it is the cyclists and pedestrians own responsibility.  You are removing the responsibility from cyclists meaning you are opening up every avenue for them to disrespect the laws of the road and ride where and how they like with no consideration for any one else. Make cyclists us cycle lanes if they refuse them remove all cycle lanes.  We paid for them to be safe and they refuse to use them.",
        "background": "The Dutch Reach is impossible for disabled drivers to do.  Give cars the right of way.  Stop cyclists filtering if they refuse to use a bike lane.  If they continue to ride on the road then remove the cycle lane. Make pedestrians look rather than assume it is safe to cross at a junction.",
