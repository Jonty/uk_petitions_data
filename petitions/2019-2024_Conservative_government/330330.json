        "additional_details": "If more people were fined for leaving litter behind on beaches and in parks across the UK, they would eventually stop. The government should make it a legal requirement for councils to have a proportionate amount of wardens present to make a marked difference when there are lots of people about. Hopefully in the same way that smoking and drink driving has gone through a cultural change in society, so would littering specially at locations like beaches, parks, outdoor events and demonstrations",
        "background": "In the same way that there have to be enough Police at large events for safety and crowd control, change the law to make councils responsible for having enough litter wardens around to fine people at these locations if they leave their litter behind. A special force should be set up for this purpose",
