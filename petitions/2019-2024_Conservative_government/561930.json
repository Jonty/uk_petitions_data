This is going to be an incredibly tough few years, but never will it be as tough as the constant tragedies happening to people in the countries which we used to proudly help. 0.7% down to 0.5% makes a difference of millions pounds of food, water and healthcare we are no longer putting towards less fortunate countries.",
