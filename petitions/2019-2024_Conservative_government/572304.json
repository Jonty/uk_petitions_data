        "additional_details": "During the pandemic city centres have been a lifeline to outlying suburbs, areas that are cut off due to local businesses shutting and residents staying home for safety. Due to this the few city centre businesses that have stayed open need to be reliable enough for these vulnerable and needy to use with peace of mind. \r\nRiders are not able to do this in pedestrianised areas as they are forced to walk in and out, making orders late, cold. This is of detriment to the customer, business and rider",
