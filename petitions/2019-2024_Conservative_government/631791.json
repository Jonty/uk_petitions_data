        "additional_details": "The landowners\u2019 new proposal is unreasonable and unjust to the thousands of people who wild camp, particularly to thousands of young people, and unjust to the taxpayer who already subsidises the National Parks. More than 12000 acres have gone and we expect the attrition to continue. \r\n\r\nNational Parks were created for the benefit of the public, and the recent High Court case shows how limited and fragile the public\u2019s rights are. Our children should have a right to camp on Dartmoor and beyond.",
        "background": "Recognise land justice on the statute book. Intervene and stop wealthy landowners of Dartmoor replacing a decades old assumed right to wild camp with a new payment from taxpayer\u2019s funds, with limited permission, on time limited terms, over a reduced area of land.",
