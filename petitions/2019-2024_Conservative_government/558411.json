        "additional_details": "GCSE students are dealing with the stress of lost teaching time and trying to catch up. Many continue to watch their parents lose jobs and some have lost friends or loved ones to this terrible disease. How can they possibly revise for exams with all of this going on. Parliament's answer to these stresses has been to give them 3 extra weeks of lessons to catch up. Very little content has been taken out of the syllabus. Sitting exams is not a level playing field for GCSE Students of England.",
        "background": "Make the decision now to go to teacher assessments for 2021 with possibility of exams in Maths and English. Recognise that exams are no longer a level playing field for students as many are being forced to self isolate and many aren't being taught by their GCSE teachers as they too self isolate.",
