        "action": "Give free female sanitary products to anybody can't buy them & who has periods.",
        "additional_details": "I want the government to do this because it is a basic human right to have these things when they are needed. Lots of families can not afford these things if they have a low income or are on benefits etc. Lots of young people who are just getting used to menstruating deserve to be as comfortable as possible. However their parents/guardians might not be able to afford these things and so they're forced to suffer and manage on a say one tampon a day.  This is not enough and people deserve better.",
        "background": "I would like the government to make sure that anybody who requires them should be given female sanitary products for free. I want them to give families packages once a month with plenty of products. These should include: Tampons, Sanitary towels and menstrual cups. They should also have paracetamol.",
