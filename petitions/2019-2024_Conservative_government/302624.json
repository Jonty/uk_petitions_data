        "action": "Implement widespread aggressive testing for Covid-19 in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The success of aggressive testing measures used in various Asian countries, especially South Korea, should serve as a model for the UK. The Government\u2019s new policy of only testing the critically ill will result in a massive underestimation of the scale of Covid-19 in the UK. It is crucial that as many infected patients as possible are identified in order to identify hotspots and collect data about the disease, which will enable us to judge more effectively which measures we should be taking.",
        "background": "The UK should be testing as many individuals as possible for Covid-19, and definitely anyone with Coronavirus symptoms- including mild symptoms- and anyone who has been in close contact with a possibly infected individual.",
