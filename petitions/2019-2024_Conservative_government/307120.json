The 80% wage coverage should be applied to self-employed people too who were affected by the Coronavirus.  \r\n\r\nOffering up to \u00a32500 a month for employees and less then \u00a3500 for self-employed who are in the same situation is not fair or just. Please rectify this and treat all workers the same way to help the over 5 million people the government left behind.",
        "background": "Self-Employed people are taxed the same way as employees, but they do not get the same help to survive the Coronavirus crises. Self-Employed people treated the same way when it comes to taxes, but not when it comes to benefits, which is unfair especially in these trying times.",
