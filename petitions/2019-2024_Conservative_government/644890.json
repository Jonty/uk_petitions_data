        "additional_details": "Currently, the Scottish Government operates a different tax rate system than the rest of the UK. This leads to working people having far more of their income taken away every month than someone on the same salary, living elsewhere in the UK. This can be thousands of pounds more each year. This is deeply unfair, especially in a cost of living crisis.",
