        "additional_details": "University students are being mandated, by law, to stay at home and not return to university during the current lockdown, and were forced to return home 3 weeks early in December. Yet student accommodation providers are demanding that full accommodation costs - including for food in fully catered halls of residence - be paid for throughout lockdowns and other closures. This is morally unacceptable, especially as parents also have to pay for food whilst the student is forced to remain at home.",
