        "additional_details": "The extraordinarily loud, piercing and startling sirens from police cars and ambulances causes not only significant noise pollution but unnecessary noise-related stress. \r\nFor neurotypicals, those with heart conditions, tinnitus, migraine, or sensory differences like in psychoses or autism - considerable research shows these very noxious and continual sounds are triggers or a source of substantial distress.\r\nI sat at a cafe from 11am-5pm, I calculated at least 1 blasting siren every 15 minutes.",
        "background": "Please reduce one or ideally all of the necessary frequency, decibel level and pitch of sirens from emergency vehicles in London - while not compromising their arrival time. The goal is only for immediate traffic to be aware of them - not for the entire neighbourhood. Drivers should not abuse sirens",
