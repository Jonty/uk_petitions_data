        "action": "Cancel GCSEs and A Levels in 2022",
        "additional_details": "Students in the UK have already missed hundreds of hours of learning In the 2 lockdowns since March 2020. This has had a huge effect. Some pupils don\u2019t have the essential resources: a working computer, textbooks, stationary, etc. Many don\u2019t have a proper learning environment or struggle to study curriculum properly in the circumstances leaving gaps in studies,therefore results will most certainly not reflect the true efforts of pupils. Hence why I am writing to the Government to cancel GCSEs and A Levels which would be very unfair, considering all time and opportunities lost, and provide predicted grades to show the true reflections of students across the country.",
        "background": "The Government should cancel GCSEs and A Levels in 2022 due to the disruption of Covid-19.By the time students go back to normal learning, many months of 2020 and,now 2021 as well will have passed since schools were closed to most pupils.This has already had a huge impact on the studying of so many.",
