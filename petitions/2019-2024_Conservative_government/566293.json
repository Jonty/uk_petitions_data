        "additional_details": "The lack of time being in school throughout the previous academic year, and currently this academic year, has lead to a lot of stress for students. It has also caused a huge disadvantage for students as they are missing out on important teaching time with a teacher to help and answer students questions. This means students have struggled to understand topics and information that they are expected to know. A majority of students have spent time isolating, causing more time off missing learning time.",
        "background": "Cancel GCSE\u2019s and A Level\u2019s for year 11 and 13 students in 2021 and replace using teacher assessment, with the use of school work throughout the school year and also the use of course work.",
