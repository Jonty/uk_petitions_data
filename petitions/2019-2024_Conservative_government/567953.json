        "additional_details": "Teachers are KEY WORKERS too, on the front line. They are expected to go back to work, and yet they are not first in line for the vaccine. The motto of this entire campaign has been to save lives. Well, we are putting all teachers at risk by sending them to school un-vaccinated. The children may be symptom-less carriers. Teachers don't live alone and still travel to school. We need to save lives. They have worked tirelessly through the pandemic to keep kids learning and we should protect them.",
        "background": "I want the group of people receiving the first Covid19 vaccines to include all school staff - most importantly skeleton staff and all teachers that have to bring 10-20 kids into a classroom each day and monitor playgrounds etc.",
