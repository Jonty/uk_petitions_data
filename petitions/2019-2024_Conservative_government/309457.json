Japan has 13 beds per 1000, Germany 8 and UK just 2.5.\r\nSome STP plans would reduce local bed numbers to less than 1.4 beds per 1000 population. \r\nNow we face the #Covid19 crisis and the results of previous cuts in  our NHS have become even more evident.\r\nFor example Germany has 29 acute  hospital beds per 100,000 of the population\r\nIn the UK we have just 6.6 acute beds per 100,000. \r\nWe ask that the Government does what ever is necessary to ensure that all existing plans for further NHS cuts, closures and downgrades are abandoned, permanently, with immediate effect .",
