Each operator has not just lost 100s of 1000s of Pounds worth of business but also suffered losses on quick depreciating assets like Cars, Vans and Coaches. Their business is directly related to travel, leisure, pubs and hospitality business. While other have been treated a part of leisure, Private Hire Operators haven\u2019t been considered affected business. They need your support in the form of grants as given to Pubs & Restaurants.",
        "background": "Private Hire Operators have been amongst the most affected businesses due to COVID19 restrictions. However, there are no grants for operators working from shared offices or homes. The huge fixed costs of vehicles & lack of business due to restrictions have crippled them. Please provide grants.",
