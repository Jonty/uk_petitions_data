Many people end the calls prematurely because they have other things to do. It is also unfair to expect call handlers to deal with the many people who may be angry and frustrated by the time taken to answer calls. There can be added problems of battery life in mobile phones. where a battery could go flat before the call is answered. This problem affects millions of phone users in the UK so legislation should be made to make phone calls less stressful for all",
