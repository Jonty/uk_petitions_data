        "additional_details": "Students again this year, with no notice, have been told that they will be graded on teacher assessments which they have not prepared for. This is devastating for many.  Students taking exams next year have also lost much learning time and it will be impossible to cover the content that is expected in normal times. Rather than letting them face the same uncertainty the government must act now to change examinations so schools have adequate time to prepare for fair and meaningful assessments.",
        "background": "The government must avoid a 3rd disaster with GCSE and A\u2019Level examinations. Exams for 2022 need to be adjusted to reflect the 10 months of disruption already faced by students so that they can be fairly assessed and take into account the considerably reduced teaching they have been able to access.",
