How many more women have to go through what I went through because the nhs staff available don\u2019t haven\u2019t  the right bedside manner. Is it going to take a death on the operating table before something is done. I begged for help because my baby was in distress and I got ignored. This can\u2019t carry on, more nhs staff that have the right caring attitude need to be. Women all over should have a pleasant labour.",

Women giving birth are being let down, I nearly lost my life and so did my son because the hospital decided to leave me after my waters broke. I got sepsis\u2019s through lack of care.",
