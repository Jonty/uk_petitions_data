        "additional_details": "I understand that Children need education, but surely their health is more important! But the main reason for this petition is the fact that, Christmas has been cancelled due to a high rise in this virus yet hes willing to let thousands of schools re-open with thousands of children potentially being carriers, then taking it home to their vulnerable Family members, yet 1 day of a year isent allowed. Please understand our concern! Please act on this, many parents are confused and scared. \r\nThankyou",
        "background": "Now that alot of places have entered teir 4 and as a result, Christmas has been cancelled.  My argument is, how can the Government cancel one day of the year with a few Family members, yet let thousands of Children go to School 5 days a week and spread the virus further.",
