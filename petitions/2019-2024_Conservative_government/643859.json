        "action": "Ensure the root cause of dog attacks is tackled and improve public safety!",
        "additional_details": "Despite current licensing laws unscrupulous breeders deliberately breed powerful dogs and knowingly sell the resultant offspring to unsuitable, abusive owners who use aversive training aimed at producing violent dogs to intimidate the public. If the dogs fail to be aggressive they are abandoned, put to sleep or end up in rescue where rehoming to the right owner with training they can make lovely pets. I urge the government to review current practices and put in place effective legislation now.",
        "background": "The DDAct will continue to fail to protect the public from dog attacks until bad breeding practices are outlawed, licences enforced and breeders monitored. The trend for breeding dogs with overly strong physical characteristics without a care for their health and welfare or public safety must stop.",
