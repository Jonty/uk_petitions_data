        "additional_details": "The UK has spent a lot of 2020 and 2021 in lockdown, giving up so much to contain the virus. We are now looking to a time when it'll be safe to see our families and friends again, but the return to normality may mean working longer hours, offering the ability to see people, but not the time. \r\nAn extra bank holiday will see spirits lifted, families reunited, and communities coming together to celebrate and be thankful for each other. We need something to look forward to after such a lonely year.",
        "background": "We have all had a hard year, missed celebrating birthdays and Christmas together, as well as other milestones. Let's have 2 day this year, so people and communities can get together and make up for lost time.",
