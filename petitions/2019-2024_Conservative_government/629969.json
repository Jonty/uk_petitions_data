        "additional_details": "Between 40-50% of people with Long Covid are estimated to meet the criteria for ME/CFS, meaning we are in the midst of a mass disabling event. \r\n\r\nThere are no specialists for either condition, so GPs are our main point of care. Research is identifying safe medications that could help with managing the symptoms of ME/CFS and Long Covid. Yet patients cannot try any potentially helpful medications because they are not licensed for GPs to be able to prescribe them. We are left with no help.",
        "background": "ME/CFS & Long Covid are closely related severely debilitating conditions for which there are *no licensed treatments*. In the absence of any licensed treatments we need an exemption to be granted for ME/CFS and Long Covid to allow GPs to use their medical discretion to prescribe off licence.",
