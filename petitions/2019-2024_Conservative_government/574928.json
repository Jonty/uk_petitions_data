        "action": "Change the current school curriculum regarding BMI and healthy eating.",
        "additional_details": "This lesson promotes that of eating insecurity and entirely invalidates those with Eating Disorders. The government should respect the mental and physical health of teenagers. The lesson shouldn\u2019t focus on Body Mass Index and rather how healthy eating benefits you as a person. Measuring students on a graph can be extremely anxiety inducing for body conscious teenagers. BMI is regarded by many professionals as incorrect, so teaching this to impressionable young people is entirely wrong.",
        "background": "The secondary school curriculum currently requires schools to teach students about healthy eating and BMI (Body mass index). This lesson is awful and insincere, with many students made to feel uncomfortable and insecure. I believe a change to the curriculum should be made.",
