        "additional_details": "We're in the midst of the biggest global financial catastrophe experienced for decades; and banks are still charging interest on overdrafts/loans & standing by recent hikes of 39.9% APR. Millions of people hit by reductions in their earnings will get to the end of the month with the banks taking their fees; pushing overdrafts into unauthorised due to additional recent hikes, thereby jeopardising direct debits; in turn generate more fees, thus creating a debt spiral & not having money to live on.",
        "background": "We want banks to freeze interest rates on all overdrafts and loans for 12 months. As one of the millions of micro-business owners in the UK who's been hit hard by the financial impact of the coronavirus, I believe it's criminal that banks are been allowed to charge interest on personal facilities.",
