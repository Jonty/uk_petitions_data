        "additional_details": "Increased testing is important because:\r\n\r\n1. If you are given a diagnosis for COVID-19 you can manage the risk and avoid coming into contact with any vulnerable individual.\r\n\r\n2. Avoiding testing for community spread when it\u2019s clearly taking place is intentionally limiting the confirmed case number and not allowing individuals to act in best interest.\r\n\r\n3. Avoiding testing for community spread will likely make the death rate look higher in the UK as less cases are exposed but all deaths reported.",
        "background": "Currently individuals are being declined a COVID-19 test despite showing clear symptoms if they have not travelled from a high risk country or come into contact with a confirmed case. With Nadine Dorries being given access to a test, having contracted in the community others should have access.",
