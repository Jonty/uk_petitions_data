We were not  aware that  a claim for \"anticipation of an imminent payroll run\" had to be submitted before 19/03, otherwise we'd qualify. The UK Government is being hard with black and white deadlines, yet gave us published guidelines after this deadline date. Other schemes of support are available, however we do not qualify either due to no business rates, no tax or VAT liability.  JRS qualification is all we want.",
        "background": "Directors that are paid annually have been left behind because their \"paid\" RTI submission was after 19/03/20. By showing the proof of employment and payment, claims should be approved.   An employee has been furloughed, no work has been carried out, there is no revenue, we should be able to claim.",
