        "additional_details": "Primary school children are only young and it is against the law to force children to wear masks as it is abuse. Furthermore, some schools are asking for proof of a child\u2019s exemption, which is a breach of s.29 (5)(a) Equality Act 2010 for anyone to ask a person to disclose a persons exemption.\r\n\r\nChildren should not be forced to wear mask, or to isolate from other school children. Pupils will be missing education if they are told to isolate from other pupils.",
        "background": "Primary schools across the the country are making children wear face masks. So, the Government and Parliament need to stop this.",
