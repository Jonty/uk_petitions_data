        "additional_details": "After many years of CSA failures, the maintenance service was meant to be an improvement; this is not the case. In my case, payments from my ex-husband's employers are late every month. The maintenance service lets the employers get away with this month after month. There are no penalties; it is a case of putting up and shutting up. I've been told many times by staff members not to rely on maintenance payments; I do rely on it. Payments are part of my monthly income, so if there is an issue, it does affect me. I am seeking that changes are made and employers fined for continued late payments.",
        "background": "The child maintenance service is not fit for purpose, there are multiple issues, I will refer to my own personal case. 2015, my case became a collect and pay; the payment is taken from the paying parents employer. Payments are late every month. I have to report it as a missing payment every month",
