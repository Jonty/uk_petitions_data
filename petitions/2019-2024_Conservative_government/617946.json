There is very little help for sufferes due to very little research into the condition itself. Not all doctors are equipped to deal with patients who have this diagnosis due to lack of training and relevant information. It's a very lonely condition and does affect mental health. More needs to be done to help sufferers.",

Similarly, eligibility for disability benefits is based on the impact a disability has on a person's life.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore already the case that people who have fibromyalgia, where this has a a \u2018substantial\u2019 and \u2018long-term\u2019 negative effect on their ability to do normal daily activities, would be protected under the Equality Act.\r\n\r\nDecisions about making reasonable adjustments for people with a disability are a matter for individual service providers, not the UK Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about disability discrimination here: https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/advice-and-guidance/disability-discrimination\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to increase funding to support people who have fibromyalgia, if that's something you'd like to happen."
