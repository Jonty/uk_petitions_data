        "additional_details": "BORIS and its government are not listening to normal people. They kept doing what they want to do. They are putting theirselves first rather than the people of UK. Their attitude towards normal people is insane, cruel. I am a single mom with 2 little kids. I DONT have any friends and family support in UK. The way I am living in this society and how I am managing, only I know. \r\nThere are NO JOBS outside...\r\n\r\nI want parliament should take this matter up seriously and demands for their resignation.",
        "background": "They should put people on their priority list first. They are cutting benefits, shortages of everything in UK. Prices are 3x more as compared to last year. Why UK people have to suffer for nonsense policies of Rishi's and Boris.",
