The Covid19 virus has been referred to as a war. A war waged on our own soil against an invisible enemy. These front line workers our the nation's hero's and they should have official recognition for their bravery and selfless actions and service during this crisis. Their jobs for the most part are normal domestic activities, they didn't sign up to risk their lives as part of their duty, yet that is what they are doing. For us the people of the UK.",
        "background": "I would like the government to consider awarding medals to all front line workers who have served the nation during the crisis. NHS staff, recycling collectors, shop workers, post and delivery people etc ..",
