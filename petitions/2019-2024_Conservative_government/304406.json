Students are feeling incredibly venerable and whilst this will be excepted once graduated - at the moment they are risking a lot of unnecessary travel with no payment. Many placement sites are over 1 to 2 hours from campus\u2019s meaning students are being forced to take public transport to and from a hospital environment increasing the risk of potential transmittal to other students",

Being transmittable before symptomatic places all students at risk particularly those more vulnerable",
