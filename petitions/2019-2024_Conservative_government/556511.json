        "additional_details": "London taxi drivers have not been helped during the pandemic. They are part of London transport but not included in any funding. We do not want the industry to die out, they are part of London . If driver's haven't been able to work to afford their renewal,  they will lose their ability to work within the industry. TFL are not giving any extensions,  they are not helping the drivers.",
        "background": "An extension on licences that are running out . Tfl should contribute towards the cost as they give no support to London taxi drivers even though they pay for their licence through them. TFL have risen the costs dramatically when they took over from the public carriage office.",
