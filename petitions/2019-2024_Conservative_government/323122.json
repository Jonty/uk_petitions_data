        "additional_details": "Currently there are no plans to extend the Self Employed Income Support Scheme that has supported the self employed from March to May 2020. Having paid our taxes and contributed to the economy, it would be a grave injustice to simply forget the self employed, many of whom work in industries  that currently do not exist due to the pandemic. If we cannot go back to work then it is the government\u2019s duty to support us.",
        "background": "For millions of self employed their livelihoods have disappeared with no sign of resuming in the near future. We request that the government extend the Self Employed Income Support Scheme in line with Furloughed Workers currently being paid under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.",
