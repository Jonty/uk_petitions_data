        "additional_details": "As above. To support cash flow / reduction of income for the majority of households. (80% of income if applicable or statutory sick pay) As households will struggle with ALL household payments during this outbreak - it makes sense to review the current historic payment terms, Plus, Government staff won\u2019t be using their resources to chase monies during this time, and can prioritise resources more effectively.",
        "background": "i.e. NO payments to be due on 1st April or 1st May - all Direct Debits to be changed.  Payments to start on 1st June until 1st March. (Still 10 months). So all still paid or accounted for within the current Tax Year.",
