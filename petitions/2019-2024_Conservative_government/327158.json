Tuesday's session will be the first of three sessions the Committee plans to hold over the next month.\nEarlier this year, a petition calling for verified ID to be made a requirement for opening a social media account received almost 700,000 signatures in six months. Over 500,000 of those people signed in the weeks following the racist abuse aimed at England footballers after the 2020 European Championships final.\u00a0\nFind all publications related to this inquiry, including oral and written evidence: https://committees.parliament.uk/work/307/tackling-online-abuse/publications/\nWhat is the Committee looking at?\nThe Committee's inquiry will be focusing on:\u00a0\nThe lived experience of people receiving online abuse on social media, particularly\u00a0in relation to protected\u00a0characteristics;\u00a0\nSocial, regulatory and technological solutions to online abuse \u2013\u00a0in particular the\u00a0option of user ID verification and/or restrictions on anonymity\u00a0on social media; and\u00a0\nThe availability and enforcement of legal penalties for online abuse.\u00a0\nIn its evidence session on 2 November, the Committee will focus on opportunities and priorities for Government action to tackle online abuse aimed at people as a result of characteristics such as their sexuality, disability, or religion. \nIt will also consider experts\u2019 perspectives on the Government\u2019s proposals to tackle online abuse through its draft Online Safety Bill, as well as looking at how stronger Government-led interventions to tackle online abuse could affect freedom of speech online.\u00a0\nFind out more about this session on our website: https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/326/petitions-committee/news/158217/petitions-committee-hears-from-antidiscrimination-campaigners/\nWhat are evidence sessions?\nEvidence sessions are public meetings with experts, officials or people with personal experiences of the topic being examined. Evidence sessions help Committees to understand how Government policies are working in the real world, and what needs to change to make things better.\nWhat is the Petitions Committee?\nThe Petitions Committee is a cross-party group of MPs appointed by the House of Commons to consider e-petitions submitted on Parliament\u2019s petitions website and public (paper) petitions presented to the House of Commons.\nFind out more about the Petitions Committee: https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/326/petitions-committee/\nFollow the Committee on Twitter for updates on its work: https://twitter.com/HoCpetitions\nYou can also sign up to the UK Parliament newsletter for the latest information on how to get involved and make a difference: https://learning.parliament.uk/en/your-uk-parliament-newsletter-sign-up-form/\n",
