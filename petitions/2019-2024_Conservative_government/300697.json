        "action": "Scrap the BBC licence fee and change the law accordingly.",
        "additional_details": "It appears that the present law on bbc funding via the licence fee prevents the free and open marketing of goods via tv adverts.  Viewers who elect not to pay to fund the bbc are legally prevented from viewing any and all television channels.  In the interests of fair free and open enterprise, the marketing of trade via tv advertising should be free to all potential consumers.  The present system actively prevents manufacturers open advertising.  Thus television licence fee should be scrapped.",
        "background": "The law on televisual transmission should be changed to allow non-bbc transmissions to be viewed free of any licence fee.  The proposed changes could allow the bbc to charge a subscription similar to eg Sky tv, such that the bbc could raise its funding.",
