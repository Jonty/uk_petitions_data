        "additional_details": "Between 1.25 and 3.4 million people in the UK are diagnosed with an eating disorder. This is likely an underestimate because the nature of the illness sees a high number of cases undetected and undiagnosed.\r\nNot only will this affect those struggling as well as those recovered/in recovery, it could likely lead to normalisation of calorie intake obsession, precipitating the development of eating disorders even in healthy and overweight adults who have lost weight in order to improve their health.",
        "background": "Stop the introduction of calorie labelling at chains. This would be incredibly harmful to people struggling with eating disorders and encourage disordered behaviour. \r\nFixation on calorie intake is a way in which disordered thinking manifests and leads to obsessive behaviours regardless of weight.",
