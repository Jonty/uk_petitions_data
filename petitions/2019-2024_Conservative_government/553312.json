        "additional_details": "From Elite football teams to Non League when hosting Elite teams, the decision not allow fans into grounds must be reviewed. If it is not done so this decision could cost thousands of jobs and result in a clubs going out of business. How can it be deemed safe to visit cinemas and other indoor venues when allowing fans in a reduced capacity and in a controlled manner in an outside setting is deemed not to be safe. The benefits of allowing fans back into grounds also promotes positive well-being.",
        "background": "For the Premiere League and EFL clubs in particular, where match day revenue is crucial, the answer will be potentially devastating if fans at a reduced capacity are not allowed back in, in a safe and controlled environment.",
