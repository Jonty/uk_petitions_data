        "additional_details": "It is now apparent that the laws surrounding online abuse are not sufficient to protect British nationals in the ever developing age of social media. This is an opportunity for British government to lead the world once again in terms of equality and protecting others from harm. Especially in light of the abuse received by black English footballers in the fallout after the loss at Euro 2021 the time is right and the public attitude is there to support widespread change for the betterment of all.",
        "background": "The laws surrounding online abuse and hatred have become outdated and insufficient in the modern age.  Parliament should enact laws that would categorize offences of this nature in terms of seriousness, harm and culpability so that appropriate sentences can be passed on those found guilty",
