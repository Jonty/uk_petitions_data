All meals provided in schools, as well as lunch parcels provided to pupils eligible for free school meals during the national lockdown, must meet these standards. See:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-free-school-meals-guidance/covid-19-free-school-meals-guidance-for-schools\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do, if there are specific actions you would like the Government or Parliament to take."
