        "additional_details": "The Coronavirus pandemic is understandably causing stress and anxiety for many people across the UK. Those in single-person households may struggle with isolation during the lockdown even more, with no close support network and in some cases no human contact at all. Allowing single-person households to 'buddy' with another exclusively would give support through this unprecedented time, easing loneliness and isolation and boosting morale.",
        "background": "Request that parliament consider allowing a 'buddy system' for people who live alone during the Coronavirus Lockdown. As announced in New Zealand, two people who each live alone would be able to visit each other during the lockdown period.",
