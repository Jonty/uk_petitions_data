        "additional_details": "The World Food Programme describes the situation in Afghanistan as \u201cthe worst humanitarian crisis on earth\u201d. At least a million children under five are at risk of dying of malnutrition. 95% of people don\u2019t have enough to eat.\r\n\r\n80% of Afghanistan\u2019s budget comes from external aid. Most of this was suspended following the change in government and financial assets (~$10bn) were frozen causing economic collapse. Afghanistan is also suffering from the worst drought for 27 years.\r\n\r\nThe withholding of foreign aid is a form of collective punishment on the people of Afghanistan. Starving an entire country and destroying its economy is not going to get rid of the Taliban.",
        "background": "The UK is directly responsible for the state Afghanistan is currently in. Sign this petition to demand the UK government increase aid to Afghanistan, to pay its part of the $4.4 billion the UN is requesting, and use its international position to encourage other countries to do the same.",
