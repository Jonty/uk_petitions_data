        "background": "Id like it to be illegal and have criminal charges if someone is seen walking a dog in hot weather. Heat stroke and burns are the most common reason dogs are taken to the vets during summer months. Its animal cruelty to walk a dog on hot pavements, and be out in high temperatures.",

If you'd like something else, you could start a new petition clearly explaining what it is.\r\n\r\nWe understand you're concerned about the welfare of dogs in hot weather, however the Animal Welfare Act 2006 already makes it an offence if a person causes, by act or omission, an animal to suffer. This would cover suffering caused by taking a dog for a walk in excessive heat.\r\n\r\nThe Government's code of practice for the welfare of dogs, which provides owners and keepers with information on how to meet the welfare needs of their animals, and can be used in courts as evidence in cases brought before them relating to poor welfare, specifically highlights the risks of heat stress: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/697953/pb13333-cop-dogs-091204.pdf\r\n\r\nDecisions about investigating alleged animal welfare offences and prosecuting these are a matter for the police and Crown Prosecution Service, not the Government or House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIf you're concerned about a specific incident, you may wish to report it directly to the RSPCA: https://www.rspca.org.uk/utilities/contactus/reportcruelty"
