        "action": "Make all WHO approved vaccines for covid 19 available in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "People are hesitant to take vaccines either because they have been made with some new technology or because of  the related side effects. We urge the government to make available all the WHO approved vaccines to UK so that more people come forward to get vaccinated which in turn will be beneficial for the whole of the population. There should be an option for people to choose from the WHO approved vaccines available.",
        "background": "There are vaccines available outside the UK e.g. the Chinese vaccine Sinopharm which doesn\u2019t involve any new technology in it\u2019s making. It\u2019s success has been seen in many countries outside UK e.g. Pakistan and Middle East. If WHO has approved it, why is it not available for people in UK.",
