        "action": "Push back the 10pm hospitality sector curfew to prevent loss of industry",
        "additional_details": "The hospitality industry has taken a tremendous hit with the Coronavirus epidemic, and the government has supported via grants, loans and the furlough scheme.\r\n\r\nFor many hospitality operators 70% of their takings occur after 10pm. They have operated following covid measures and illustrated that these can be run safely. \r\n\r\nThe hospitality sector is a minor contributor to the spread of the virus (less than 5%).\r\n\r\nThe curfew prevents many bars and restaurants from operating without financial support.",
        "background": "Re-think the 10pm hospitality curfew, address the loss of jobs and industry that this measure will cause, and weigh up the real effectiveness of this Covid-19 measure.\r\n\r\nA push back to 11pm or midnight would permit the hospitality sector to stand on its own feet again.",
