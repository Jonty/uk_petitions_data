        "additional_details": "I am an international student intending to practice Law in the UK after graduation. According to the Home office I cannot apply for the grad scheme visa as my current student visa like many other Bar students expires on 30 June 2021, that is just one day before launch of grad scheme. I have delayed my graduation until later this year by deferring one exam to be taken in August 2021. I will not have a student visa by the time I graduate. It is requested to give an equal chance to all of us.",
        "background": "Expand the eligibility criteria of the graduate scheme visa to include those students whose current student visa expires before the introduction of the new scheme or before they graduate (failure or deferral of exams). Enable them to apply from outside the UK or apply by re-entering on visit Visa.",
