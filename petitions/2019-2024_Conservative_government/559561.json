        "additional_details": "This means people unable to see displays can still enjoy fireworks, without causing unnecessary stress. Animals suffer when the area they live sounds like a war zone, some even end up hurting themselves or even dying. It is not only animals; people that suffer with noise sensitivity and others with PTSD need to be able to prepare for the noise. It is not fair for anybody to be made to feel unsafe in their own home night after night simply for people to see some pretty lights.",
        "background": "My petition is for the use of \u2018silent\u2019 fireworks to be allowed for public use under the same restrictions as is currently implemented, and noisy ones to be banned for public use and only allowed for licensed events on two nights of the year. Bonfire night and new year",
