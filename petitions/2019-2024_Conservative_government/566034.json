        "additional_details": "As parents of a extremely vulnerable child we now face the prospect of sending 1 of our children to school to potentially bring back covid anyway, whilst the other one is homeschooled. Please take children's mental health into account here. My vulnerable daughter will have to attend school drop offs everyday seeing her sister going with her friends whilst she has to stay home? Given the circumstances this needs a serious review as its putting families of already poorly children under stress",
        "background": "During the second lockdown I was advised to keep my extremely vulnerable child (8) at home due to her risk of illness from covid. Her sister is a year older (9) and not risking her bringing it home I homeschooled both of them. We later was fined \u00a3120 for this. Siblings need to be included.",
