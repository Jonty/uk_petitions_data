        "action": "Vaccinate all school staff starting with Primary schools.",
        "additional_details": "If you want to keep schools open then vaccinate the staff so they don't become places where covid spreads. If school staff were to catch covid in high numbers schools would have to close putting vulnerable children at risk, and stopping key workers from continuing to work. School staff in primary schools do not have the protection of testing children as this is not possible in younger children without causing distress. Protect our children, staff and the economy by vaccinating school staff.",
        "background": "Vaccinate school staff as a priority as schools are the place where the virus spreads easily. School staff are key workers. Children do not always present with symptoms meaning they can spread it to adults and peers. While the risk is low to children it is not low for the adults who care for them.",
