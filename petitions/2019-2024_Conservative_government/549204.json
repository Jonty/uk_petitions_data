        "additional_details": "Students studying practical courses such as Performing Arts are at a disadvantage, as lessons simply cannot be delivered to an equal standard as face-to-face learning, with some subjects undeliverable. Full fees imply a holistic interactive experience, which unfortunately is now significantly reduced. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect a proportionally reduced tuition fee, which acknowledges the limitations of course delivery and the diminished student experience.",
