This would allow 'chamber based' debate to resume in a safe, clean, modern, high tech environment.  Exhibition centres in the UK are largely based near good transport hubs of bus, rail and road.  They have on-site hotels and other essential facilities.  With the Palace of Westminster not fit for purpose, perhaps this could also provide a long term model for the future?",

Individual seats and desks with microphones spaced according to social distancing rules with Cabinet and Speaker in a position of prominence.",
