        "additional_details": "The student travel windows have led to universities ending in-person teaching early, restricting study space and staggering the return to campus and students should not have to foot the bill for this. Students are paying rent and bills at accommodation they have been strongly advised to not live in for a number of weeks. Government has a responsibility to cover incurred losses as a direct result of their travel window strategy to landlord and housing/utility providers.",
        "background": "Government needs to provide private landlords, PBSAs and utility companies with financial support to refund students who are at a loss due to their guidance for students during the covid-19 pandemic.",
