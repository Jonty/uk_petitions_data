        "additional_details": "Students doing Cambridge national exams are facing extreme levels of stress and anxiety caused by the recent corona case increase and the announcement of a national lockdown. We have been told that A levels and GCSEs have been cancelled but we still have to do our Cambridge national exams.This is extremely wrong as we have had poor quality lessons and no face to face lessons in over 3 weeks. This makes us poorly prepared for the exam",
        "background": "Teacher should use predicted and mock grades to calculate a fair grade rather than students taking the exam in the current pandemic lockdown. This  would relieve stress and anxiety for many people.",
