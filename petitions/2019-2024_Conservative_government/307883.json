For millions of them all contracts have been terminated with immediate effect and ALL income stopped overnight. Currently the government\u2019s protection of 80% of salary up to \u00a32,500 per month applies only to a tiny percentage of freelancers who are also PAYE. With an entire and immediate loss of income many can no longer make ends meet. The effects on millions of self-employed will be catastrophic without urgent and immediate action.",

All self-employed workers must get proportional income of 80% up to \u00a32,500 PCM, which can be assessed using their most recent tax bill.",
