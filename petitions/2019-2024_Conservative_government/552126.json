        "additional_details": "Additionally, we need this travel corridor to bolster our relations with the US during these difficult times, provide a solution to distant families, friends and loved ones being faced with the tough situation of not being able to see one another. This is proving disastrous for the mental health of many, and needs to be addressed urgently.\r\n\r\nWe need a definitive time frame as to when this travel corridor will open. It is easily within our grasp to provide a functioning safe and secure air bridge.",
        "background": "The UK/US are in dire need of a travel corridor between our two countries. Not only is this important for the relationship between our two nations, it would be a ground breaking move forward in terms of functioning global travel, as well as being a much needed boost for the industry and economy.",
