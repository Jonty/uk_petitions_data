        "action": "Change the way PIP is assessed",
        "additional_details": "To many people are being refused pip or having their claims stopped due to poorly conducted f2f assessments. If an assessor has no clinical knowledge on a claimants condition they are not qualified to make an assessment on how this impacts their ability to conduct tasks, such as walking, washing and socialising on a longer term basis. PIP is meant to be personal INDEPENDENCE payments, current way of assessing is removing INDEPENDENCE for hundreds of disabled",
        "background": "Stop the use of under qualified assessors. An assessor should have clinical knowledge and experience in line with claimant. E.g. if a claimant has MS the assessor needs to have specific knowledge and experience such as MS nurse or neurologist. Final outcome is based more on f2f than clinical reports",
