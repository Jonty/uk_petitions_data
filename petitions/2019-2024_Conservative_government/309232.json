        "additional_details": "If further guidance suggests we should continue on placement and continue to support our nursing staff, endangering ours and our families lives, we should be entitled to a bursary. This bursary would be a big help as we are currently paying 9k+ for tuition fees and having 3-11k debt from our maintenance loans and childcare fees for each year.",
        "background": "We want to have clear instructions for what students nurses are to do during the covid-19 outbreak. We appreciate we may be classed as key workers however, being supernumerary are we key workers? We known there is guidance for 3rd year students, but very little guidance for students in other years.",
