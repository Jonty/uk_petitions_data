        "additional_details": "At school, we must have learnt about World War 2 dozens of times, necessary I know, but the 'Britain as a hero' discourse needs to end. I knew we had a shady past but until I studied it in a Sociology module named 'Race, Immigration and Multiculturalism' at University, I did not understand the extent of how colonialism shaped our existence. If people aren't required to learn about the wrongdoings of Britain, they will assume we never did wrong, yet our wrong reverberates around the world daily.",
        "background": "This government has a responsibility to its citizens to teach children the truth about colonialism and Empire. The pride in Britain discourse must be stopped; this country ruined others and it should be part of the national curriculum, because not enough people know the true extent of it.",
