        "additional_details": "The average woman in the UK is a size 16, yet a study found that the majority of female mannequins represent an underweight body size. The purpose of a mannequin is to give customers a sense of what clothes look like off the hanger. Current mannequins are just promoting unrealistic and unhealthy body types, which can, and do, have detrimental effects on those viewing them. It's 2021 and we are still failing to promote and appreciate all body types. Change has to come and it has to come now.",
        "background": "Put a rule in place which ensures clothing stores must represent all body types by displaying mannequins of all sizes. How are men and women expected to embrace and love their bodies when there is no representation of their body type wearing the clothes they're buying in shops?",
