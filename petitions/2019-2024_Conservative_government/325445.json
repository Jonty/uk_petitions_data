All memorials or statues commemorating former slave traders, owners or those who have directly profited from slavery represent a dark past in British history which does not reflect the strong, diverse nation we pride ourselves on being. It is important to remove these monuments so that we can move on and look towards a brighter inclusive future for Britain.",
