        "additional_details": "Punishing the many to correct the behaviour of the few is not effective in schools and won\u2019t work on the general public. This type of punishment only works when the majority take the punishing of the few into their own hands, which causes fear in the minority. I presume this is not an effect the government is intending to create. As in school the biggest effect is to create a feeling of us against them which will cause a greater number of people to ignore the government not fewer.",
        "background": "I think taking away outside exercise will damage many people\u2019s mental health. Particularly those with small houses and no garden. It will also not be effective in deterring those who are flouting the rules already. Instead impose stricter sanctions on those breaking the current rules",
