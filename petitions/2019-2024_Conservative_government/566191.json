        "additional_details": "The current guidelines state, \u201cfor individuals who started the schedule and who attend for vaccination at a site where the same vaccine is not available, or if the first product received is unknown, it is reasonable to offer one dose of the locally available product to complete the schedule. This option is preferred if the individual is likely to be at immediate high risk or is considered unlikely to attend again\u201d. For the safety of the UK population, this experimental method should be prevented",
        "background": "Guidelines outlined in the Green Book Chapter 14a describe the potential of COVID-19 vaccinations being interchanged between doses depending on availability. With no formal scientific trials completed evaluating the safety and efficacy of this method, I propose the modification of these guidelines.",
