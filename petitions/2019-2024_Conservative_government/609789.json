        "additional_details": "Against the backdrop of this conflict, the UK government has pledged its support to the people of Ukraine, lighting up Downing Street in Ukrainian colours, delivering public addresses to condemn Putin's actions, and threatening further sanctions.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we have withdrawn all Visas to Ukraine's citizens. There is no longer a safe and legal route for these refugees.\r\n\r\nWords are not enough, the UK government must take action and be a welcoming shelter to those in need.",
        "background": "As Russia invades Ukraine, thousands of Ukraine citizens are fleeing the country into the West. The US predicts some 5 million might be displaced due to the conflict. \r\n\r\nSome of them will be headed to the UK due to family links. We must be a safe haven in these times of war.",
