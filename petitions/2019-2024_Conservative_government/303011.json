Sadly, we currently have a PM who only seems capable of reproducing sound bites - or worse, appears completely absent. The public has the right to know who's 'running the show'.\r\n\r\nIn this context the disproportionate power and influence of special advisers - especially when they are as controversial as Mr Cummings (remember his questionable role in the 2016 referendum?) needs to be urgently addressed.",
        "background": "In December 2019 29.3% of the electorate voted for the Conservative Party. However, they did NOT specifically vote for any special advisers - like Dominic Cummings and his controversial methods and views.",
