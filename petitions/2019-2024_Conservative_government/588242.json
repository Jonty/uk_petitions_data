        "additional_details": "As a developed country, areas of the UK should not be poverty stricken, but unfortunately many UK residents are in poverty with some being homeless. Food, shelter and access to health care is a basic human right, and so by not providing these residents support, we as a country are failing our own people. By adjusting taxes we can ensure everyone is given adequate shelter year round and sufficent money (or vouchers) for food, as well as enough funding for the nhs to function post-covid.",
        "background": "Adjust taxes so everyone in the UK has their right to food, shelter and healthcare fulfilled, by providing a statutory amount to everyone (i.e. everyone provided a place to live, \u00a330 for food a week per person, and nhs is fully funded to deal with covid backlog), to end poverty and homelessness.",
