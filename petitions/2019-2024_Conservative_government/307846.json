We as small businesses can not afford to take large loans that would be personally guaranteed. To help us overcome this please allow for all (SBBR) to be able to claim at least a \u00a325,000 grant. This will not only support us during this hardship but will allow us to pay for our daily/weekly/monthly business commitments without having to close a established business.",
