        "additional_details": "Companies continue to use the probation period and 2 year Government clause irresponsibly. Dismissing employees with generic and often unfounded claims. Employees who have entered in good faith a physical and psychological contract where expectations are that they will be trained and supported within their employment. \r\nThere is no procedural outline, protection or support for those newly employed within an organisation against being let go at any moment. This archaic system needs urgent review.",
        "background": "Employees can only claim unfair dismissal if they\u2019ve worked for a qualifying period - 2 years. The government should act to protect all employees of an organisation irrespective of the length of service. Extra protection and security should be given to those during the probationary period.",
