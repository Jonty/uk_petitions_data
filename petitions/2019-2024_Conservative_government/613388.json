        "additional_details": "me and many other children and adults across the UK, would like to ask the Government or  Parliament to shorten school hours on a Friday to close at 12pm. Children in the uk are being forced to go to school every day, adding on homework and exams. Children feel stress and may find it difficult to focus on normal daily stuff. Giving them extra hours off, will give them more time to relax and finish any homework they have left. Or study for an exam. We hope you take your time making this decision.",
