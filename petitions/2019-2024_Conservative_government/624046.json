        "additional_details": "Although children under 16 cannot be legally prosecuted for riding bikes on paths, I believe that the main age bracket of 10 and under need protection from not only traffic on the general roads but also from the general public who although correct in trying to stop young cyclists can become overly agressive of the situation and cause emotional distress to young children by stopping them, blocking paths ways and getting overly aggressive when children are just trying to be kept safe by parents.",
        "background": "Children aged 10 years and under have no true sense of traffic direction. I believe allowing this age bracket a legal use of cycling on public footpaths to be sensible and help to reduce any accidents that may occur.",
