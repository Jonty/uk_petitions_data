        "additional_details": "The government must, taking into consideration WHO recommendations and the actions of other countries affected by COVID-19, revise their current approach to the Coronavirus epidemic. News of re-infections must be taken into account, scientific knowledge and ideas from individuals beyond those currently working closely with Downing Street must be taken seriously, and the current complacency has to come to an end. This is a serious problem, and it has to be approached as one.",

Their decision to adopt the approach of Herd Immunity, against WHO recommendations, putting our population in danger, cannot be allowed to continue! Their callousness, to what is a very serious problem, has to be stopped.",
