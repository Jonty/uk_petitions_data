        "additional_details": "Menstrual pain is not currently included within the Equality Act despite 57% of women stating menstrual cramping and pains has \u2018adverse affects on their ability to work\u2019. The sheer disregard of this matter allows employers to implement disciplinary action for female individuals that take menstrual related sickness. Countries such as Indonesia and South Korea operate a \u2018Menstrual leave\u2019 policy, Highly renown business, Nike, also incorporate this within their code of conduct to increase productivity. I believe the government should consider this to further lift the taboo and provide women with greater employment rights.",
        "background": "The government need to diminish the historic taboo surrounding menstruation by enforcing the right for women to take \u2018menstrual leave\u2019 if their symptoms are severe and affect their ability to work.",
