        "additional_details": "Make necessary changes so the long term mental health of those grieving the loss of a lost loved one does not remain with them forever not being able to say goodbye and spend their last days with them they are scared. Those in pubs and clubs are drunk. Where does this make sense. Those that are socialising are not thinking about those that are suffering in silence longing to visit their loved ones. Switch it the other way around. Allow more hospital visits and masks when socialising in pubs and clubs",
        "background": "We would like the government To make some necessary changes, in what is morally right and what is morally wrong. Hundreds of racing to beaches, also going to nightclubs, and pubs, socialising no facial masks been worn, but at the same time family members are dying in hospital alone.",
