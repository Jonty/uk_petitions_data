        "action": "Stop the merger of Department for International Development and Foreign Office",
        "additional_details": "DFID\u2019s work on ending extreme poverty including the Girls' Education Challenge is vital. The PM claimed his priority was supporting the empowerment of girls and women and his first speech on the steps of Downing Street underlined the pledge he made as Foreign Secretary that all girls should receive 12 years of quality education. Now he wants to take aid from Zambia and Tanzania to prioritise security. With over 30 million girls in Sub Saharan Africa out of education, this is \r\ndishonest.",
        "background": "Aid is not a tool for diplomacy and trade. The PM pledged to prioritise girls' education. By diverting aid from low-income countries, the government is depriving millions of girls of education. Delay the merger during the pandemic and provide transparent, informed plans to protect DFID's priorities.",
