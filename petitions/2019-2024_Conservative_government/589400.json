        "additional_details": "More and more animals are coming into animal rescues, and more and more are having to be euthanised. This is down to incorrect husbandry and inadequate enclosures and diet. Most of this comes down to pet stores and breeders who need to be giving out correct and upto date information instead of giving out misleading information and also selling without proof of enclosures.",
        "background": "Make it so animal breeders have to be registered with local councils. Also enforce breeders/pet store  to keep a record of all people that they have sold too along with photo evidence of correct enclosures that the animals we'll be placed in. This information can then be reviewed by professionals",
