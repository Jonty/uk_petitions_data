        "action": "Write off student debt of students impacted by COVID-19",
        "additional_details": "During this pandemic university students have been largely forgotten about. Our education despite the universities best efforts has been at a much lower standard, courses that rely on practical work are vastly impacted not allowing students to gain valuable skills needed for careers e.g. having to watch dissection videos instead of performing them. We should not have to pay back all the money spent on tuition and accommodation as we have not received the education we deserve or have paid for.",
        "background": "The governments should write off the debt for students who have been impacted by COVID-19 for the academic year 2020/21 as well as second semester of the year 2019/20 by at least 60%. Our education has been sub standard to previous years, due to lockdown, online learning and handling of COVID-19.",
