        "background": "The Government must change civil servant payments to reflect the amount offered to private sector workers, which is 80%.\r\nIt is inadmissible that the public sector receives 100% furlough payments during lockdowns whilst the private sector receives 20% less.",

Employers can top of pay beyond the amount provided by the Government if they so choose.\r\n\r\nThe same rules apply to any workers furloughed under the scheme, although the Government has said that where staff costs are publicly funded, employers should use that money to continue paying staff, and not furlough them: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wage-costs-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to require public sector employers to furlough staff who are unable to complete their normal duties during the Covid-19 outbreak, rather than continuing to pay them at full salary, if that is what you want to happen."
