        "additional_details": "As covered above, even though frontline staff did their jobs they went above and beyond expectations. They lost their own time in 2020, let them come together celebrate and have fun and let lose around their day jobs. Knowing that the wider public want to thank them and see them relax and not stress. This festival isn\u2019t for us the general public but for front line staff only. Over 3 days have the ability to rotate around their work and party hard. They deserve it",
        "background": "2020 is a year where frontline staff dedicated their time and lives to saving the rest of the population. They were amazing. They should be rewarded with an amazing 3 day festival purely for them. Headline acts should perform to say thank you. This festival should be completely free for them.",
