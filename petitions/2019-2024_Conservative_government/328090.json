        "action": "Remove no pet clauses in tenancy agreements & leases.",
        "additional_details": "In proposing a review of the model tenancy agreement the government are recognising the importance of pets to people, & how traumatic it is to have to give up a pet when moving into rental housing.  However, merely changing the wording in the model tenancy agreement will change nothing on its own. Without legislation like that in other countries, landlords can still include blanket bans on pets.\r\n\r\nChanges in legalisation would open doors for love and companionship for many humans and animals.",
        "background": "We call on the government to introduce legalisation that bans no pet covenants in tenancy agreements and leases, and protects existing human companion animal relationships as is common in many countries.\r\n\r\nEvery pet has the right to a loving home and every person deserves the right to love a pet.",
