        "additional_details": "A cut of almost a third to UK foreign aid at Christmas, that helps development in the poorest parts of the world, borders on criminal. No lives will be saved in the UK, many will be lost in the developing world. Perhaps Rishi Sunak believes no one cares and that cutting a \"surplus population\" is \"a price worth paying\". Scrooge would blush. I believe pointed questions should be asked and actions to force withdrawal taken in the Commons and Lords.",
