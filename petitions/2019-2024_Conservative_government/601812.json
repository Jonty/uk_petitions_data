        "action": "We want the government to look into the production of vaping.",
        "additional_details": "As young students, we've seen how vaping has affected those who use it and how it influences the people around them. This is most especially important due to them being under 18s which means it's illegal for them to be having a vape box and that is something that needs to be monitored more closely by the government to help reduce the spread of vaping amongst young people and hopefully decrease the influence of vaping. Also we want the government to inspect the nicotine levels that are in vapes.",
        "background": "We want the government to look at the products used to create vapes because not all companies are truthful about the amount of nicotine used due to them crossing the legal limit allowed. Also, we want the government to pay more attention on the age groups (under 18s) that are buying vapes.",
