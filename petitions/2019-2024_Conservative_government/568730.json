        "action": "Reduce the University student tuition fee for all international students",
        "additional_details": "International students too were called on campus, promised the delivery of high quality education, but ended up receiving online lectures, isolated & barely any face-to-face teaching. Along with paying the accommodation rent, we also had to pay for our flight tickets and travel from different parts of the world just to realise that we could have done the same learning from our home country. Thence, we are also facing financial strain along with being mentally disturbed about the whole situation.",
        "background": "Call on the parliament to debate upon the lowering of tuition fees specifically for international students who pay upto five times the regular tuition fees for home students. This also includes subjects related to medicine/health including: Medicine & Dentistry, Veterinary Science and all sciences.",
