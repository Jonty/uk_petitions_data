Who are less likely to meet these needs when facing financial difficulties.\r\n\r\nThis change would have a compounding benefit to our children\u2019s future net contribution to society. \r\n\r\nIt could be applied to single parents and would help ease the burden of the high cost of childcare.\r\n\r\nIt could be paid for by taxing individuals more and higher incomes due to incentivising  higher productivity.",
        "background": "The uk is an international outlier in applying income tax to individuals rather than at the level of a family unit. This creates a financial burden on families with young children, this could also benefit single parents. Should be capped much higher than 100k for areas with high cost of living.",
