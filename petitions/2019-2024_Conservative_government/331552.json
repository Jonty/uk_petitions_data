        "action": "A Penalty for assaulting emergency workers to be harsher than 2 years in prison.",
        "additional_details": "The home secretary has stated that she is making a two years in prison recommendation as a penalty for assaulting emergency workers such as paramedics. I believe this simply isn't sufficient. I want the government to develop a bill that cements in law that any assaulting of a key worker will command at least a 5 year prison sentence that includes rehabilitation programs to prevent repeat offence. Furthermore I believe a fine should be attached to the penalty in order to provide compensation.",
        "background": "I would like an emergency workers protection act that includes penalties of up to 5 years in prison for assaulting emergency workers. These penalties should include rehabilitation programs to prevent a repeat offence when the assaulter is released from prison. A 2 year recommendation isn't enough.",
