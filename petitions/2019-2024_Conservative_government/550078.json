At the very least it has been proven to ease the suffering of epileptics and sufferers of neuropathic pain. It helps with insomnia, anxiety and ptsd, among other things. Cheap and easily grown, it will ease strain on NHS\r\n2 As a Liberal nation, it is our right to grow harmless plants, and sell our own property.
