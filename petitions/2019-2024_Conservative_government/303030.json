        "additional_details": "The government should instruct the universities to refund us appropriate amounts of tuition fees equating to the weeks of rehashing we are missing. This is particularly applicable to students undertaking second undergraduate degrees (I.e. like a lot of veterinary science students) who are self funding the tuition fees with no loans, and so money is already very tight.",
        "background": "Tuition fees currently cost \u00a39250 per year for UK undergraduate degrees. A lot of teaching has been cancelled in universities due to COVID-19 until the end of the academic year, meaning we are losing out on weeks and weeks of face to face teaching and other teaching.",
