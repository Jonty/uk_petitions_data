        "additional_details": "It is not unreasonable to ask that people behave in a respectful manner and put aside their religious or political grievances on occasions such as Remembrance Weekend or at Christmas etc. So as not to disrespect the occasion or ruin it for everyone, including any police officers who may have to be put on duty and deprived of their own personal celebrations with their families due to a given threat. We also ask that water cannons be restored to the arsenals of police forces in all major cities.",
        "background": "We ask that the government changes the law so that in future it will be illegal, and therefore within the power of the police to prevent or forcebly put an end to any protest that is intended to or may cause disruption or provocation on a day or time of national significance.",
