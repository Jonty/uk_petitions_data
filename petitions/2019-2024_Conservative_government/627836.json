        "additional_details": "It's the Parliament's duty to protect those they are responsible for. Those protections save lives and should never be taken away. To reiterate, trans rights do not in any way harm the progress towards women's rights, they are different aspects of the same struggle. Studies have shown that protections under the law for minoritized groups help to prevent hate crimes and improve social attitudes.",
        "background": "There's been news about planned changes to the Equality Act which would harm trans rights under the guise of wanting to protect women's rights. This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how equal rights affect different marginalised groups. Protecting trans rights does not harm women.",
