        "additional_details": "Below are some quotes that I have read online recently regarding fireworks. \r\n\r\n'There's no need for fireworks when it is daylight especially. Dogs are going nuts and my cat hides!'\r\n\r\n'Fireworks should only be allowed in November and in organised displays.'\r\n\r\n'My 3 cats and 1 dog dont like the fireworks'\r\n\r\n'My poor dog gets so stressed when she hears the loud bangs, it's so rude imposing all that noise on everyone else.'\r\n\r\n'My poor little dog was so scared, his little heart was beating so fast'",
        "background": "Fireworks should only be for New Years Eve and organised public events. \r\n\r\nSome members of the public think it is okay to set them off whenever they want. This includes, day time, week days and until 3am in the morning. \r\n\r\nNot only is it a noise disturbance, but it also leaves pets terrified!!",
