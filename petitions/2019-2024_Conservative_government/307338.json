        "additional_details": "Government/Parliament need to recognise that it is unacceptable to overprice such products, and must do everything in their power to prevent it. \r\n\r\nExamples near me include: \r\nA Nisa shop charging \u00a32.99 for Wilko antibacterial floor wipes that are sold normally for 60p\r\nA farm shop selling packets of spaghetti pasta for \u00a39.00 each \r\n\r\nHowever, this problem isn't just a local one, it's nationwide. The elderly and vulnerable will pay these prices and it just isn't fair on them. Action must be taken.",
        "background": "Many shops have been exploiting the vulnerable by over pricing high demand products such as antibacterial hand gel, antibacterial wipes, toilet rolls, and long life food products.  Of course shops will need to put there prices up, but not unreasonably.",
