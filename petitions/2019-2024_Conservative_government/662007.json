        "action": "End the Culling of Male Chicks in the UK",
        "additional_details": "By identifying the gender of chicks before they hatch, in-ovo sexing spares male chicks from needless suffering while ensuring the efficiency of egg production. The culling of male chicks is not only ethically indefensible but also environmentally unsustainable. The resources invested in breeding, incubating, and hatching these chicks are wasted when they are needlessly destroyed. Moreover, the practice perpetuates a cycle of disregard for animal welfare that has no place in a modern society.",
        "background": "Culling male chicks for not laying eggs contradicts societal values. Companies like Seleggt have demonstrated that non-invasive methods like in-ovo sexing exist and they offer a humane alternative. Mandating their use in the UK promotes ethical standards in animal agriculture.",
