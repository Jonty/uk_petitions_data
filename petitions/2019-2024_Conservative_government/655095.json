        "additional_details": "If the Government did change the Summer Holidays to a 4-week-long-period, students would return to school in the middle of August, resulting in more time in school. This would not only be tiring for teachers but also mentally and physically draining for students who attend every single day. Those who have poor attendance might not be as affected due to their lack of time in school. Overall I personally think that the 6-week-holidays should stay the same.",
