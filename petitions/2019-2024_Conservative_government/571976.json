LET PEOPLE HAVE A NORMAL BIRTH, its horrible going to appointments etc alone as is.",
        "background": "Partners should be aloud in through all labour and birth of baby, they are partners not visitors and deserve the experience just as much as the mother does. Whats the difference with being there 24/7 and half way through? It\u2019s a scary experience as is especially for first time mums.",
