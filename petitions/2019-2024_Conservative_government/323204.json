        "action": "Change the curriculum for students taking GCSE and A LEVEL exams next year",
        "additional_details": "During these past months Year 10s and Year 12s have been put at a disadvantage due to this unfortunate time. This has resulted in a lack of face to face teaching which will have catastrophic effects in the coming months. For this reason we would like some leniency/ change in the curriculum for GCSE examinations due to be taken next year. This will put students in a better position to be able to achieve desirable grades and to also have some time to come back to some sort of normality.",
        "background": "I, as a current year 10 student due to take my GCSE exams next year would like the Government to make changes to the Curriculum for both A Level and GCSE exams being taken next year due to COVID 19 and the lack of content being taught to students during this time.",
