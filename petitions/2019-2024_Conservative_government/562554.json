        "additional_details": "The mental and physical impact that covid restrictions is having on our children is unfair, play parks all around the country are open but mid sussex Council refuse to open ours due to the fact it would cost to much to maintain them. Not once have I seen anyone maintaning the open parks during this pandemic and this is a cop out. The 'big'  parks that are open are over crowded and cause more of a concern that any of the small ones would. Our council tax should be spent on the things that matter.",
        "background": "We need our local councils to reopen our play parks for our children. In many surrounding areas all play parks have been reopened after the lockdown however Mid Sussex Council have advised me that our local parks will not reopen.",
