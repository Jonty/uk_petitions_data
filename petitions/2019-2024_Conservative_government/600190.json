        "additional_details": "Currently in the UK there are approximately 10,000 women under the age of 50 diagnosed with breast cancer each year (source breast cancer.org) For many of these women diagnoses comes too late for treatment to be effective, leaving families devastated. \r\nNot only would lowering the age from 50 to 40 see many more women diagnosed early and successfully treated, but this change would also help send out the message that women, and men, are at risk of breast cancer much younger than 50, and therefore promoting breast awareness from an earlier age.",
        "background": "Please give serious consideration to lowering the age that routine breast screening is offered from 50 to 40.",
