        "additional_details": "The singing community across the country has been denied the right to come together and sing for pleasure since March 2020. Many choirs are fully vaccinated and based in areas of low infection rates, making the activity low risk now. Masks are often worn while singing to reassure members of the choir. The knock on effect on the professional soloists and orchestras, often young people at the start of their music careers, who are brought in when the pieces are ready to be performed, has been profound. The mental health and well-being benefits of communal singing  are well documented - it's time to get the nation singing again.",
