        "additional_details": "Over recent weeks there has been a spate of wildfires and damage caused to property caused by the inconsiderate and improper use of disposable barbeques. This has led to the loss of valuable habitat, damaged areas of ONB, cost the taxpayer money, contributed to littering and harm to wildlife and occupied the emergency services unnecessarily and avoidably. This is an annual problem during the summer months.",
        "background": "Consider banning disposable barbeques in their current form, or entirely. If a total ban is not viable/possible, order the design to be changed to ensure that they cannot come into direct contact with other surfaces.",
