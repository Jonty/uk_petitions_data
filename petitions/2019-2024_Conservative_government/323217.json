        "additional_details": "Increasing GDP has been the holy grail of governments for centuries but an ever-expanding economy is incompatible with the challenges we face in the 21st century. Policies aimed at increasing GDP have given us the climate emergency, plastic pollution and mass extinctions. We've suffered recessions which have cost livelihoods and lives and seen whole regions passed by in the spoils of growth.\r\n\r\nWe need a new yardstick to aim for which leads to a more sustainable and happy future for us all.",
        "background": "The government should consult on alternative measures of national welfare taking into account non-economic factors including human health and happiness, as well as the health of the environment. A firm commitment should be made to replacing GDP as the sole or main measure of national prosperity.",

There is not a single, official measure that the Government use to assess policy impact or the health of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Office for National Statistics already collects data on a range of areas, you can find more information here: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing\r\n                \r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do, such as changes to specific policies. For example, you could start a petition requesting a specific strategy for increasing human health, happiness and wellbeing."
