        "additional_details": "In 2019, BAME (Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic) communities made up 12.8% of the UK population of 66.65 million. This means the history of 8,531,200 people is unjustifiably avoided in the National curriculum.\r\n\r\nIntegrating a Colonial & BAME history module would provide students an early essential understanding into the events, values, and consequences resulting from the British Empire. Currently, the sweeping mention of American Slavery in the optional A-Level History course is NOT ENOUGH.",
        "background": "Make mandatory a minimum of 1 module in lower secondary education (years 7-9, pre-GSCE) that explores the history of British colonisation and BAME history, which will include the study of said history\u2019s consequences on contemporary society.",
