        "additional_details": "Please be more realistic and if an increase is needed then do an incremental one, not more than double. It's not ethical to only allow those wealthy high earners to be with their loved ones! Not everyone lives in London and earns high salaries, think of the rest of the country.",
        "background": "Please consider what the average worker earns before coming up with this bogus figure. In particular those on unskilled and semi-skilled jobs aren't paid anywhere near \u00a338,700, let alone average professional like myself. You are punishing British Citizens, leave family visa out and curve elsewhere!",
