At present PCR tests are only available through the NHS for people with Covid-19 symptoms. It's not clear if you want people to be able to accept results from any tests that are already available under these arrangements as part of the testing requirements for international travel, or if you want the Government to make PCR testing available from the NHS on demand, for people who are travelling to the UK.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nLower the price of the \u00a3210 COVID Home Test Kits for travellers entering the UK: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/575509\r\n\r\nAllow international travel with a lateral flow test result: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/582714\r\n\r\nMake Covid-19 tests freely available to all international travellers at airports: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/586262"
