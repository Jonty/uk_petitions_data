        "additional_details": "As a learner driver, who also worked full time and had very little time for paid lessons, I was looking forward to the practise opportunity lockdown presented. However, under current guidelines this is not a reality. I believe that going for a drive with someone in my household, not mixing with anyone else and coming back home presents no threat of infection to myself or others. I, allow with countless other furloughed learners, would be very grateful for this golden practising opportunity.",
        "background": "I believe that learner drivers should be allowed to practise driving during lockdown, so long as they:\r\n.are with someone in their household/support bubble\r\n.do not go out intending to mix with others not a part of their bubbles\r\n.do not take lengthy drives that are drastically far from your home",
