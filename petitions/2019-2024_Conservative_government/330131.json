        "action": "Fund the theatre industry which is shutting down due to the lack of support",
        "additional_details": "Theatres are closing, people are losing jobs daily, self employed are barely getting enough money to pay rent, graduates have no jobs to go into. A large amount of self employed don't qualify for the furlough scheme, despite the Prime Minister saying 'we have given very considerable support'. In his words 'its better to wait for times to get better than to lay people off'. Unless funding is provided it wont matter about how many people are laid off because there won't be an industry to go back to.",
        "background": "The arts sector needs immediate funding to stop the catastrophic loss of the industry all together. Theatres across the country are shutting down, the 5 step plan does nothing more than put words on paper. We need timescales, funding and government support.",
