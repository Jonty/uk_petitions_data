        "additional_details": "The current year 11's and 13's have seen by far the most damaging effects of COVID-19. Online learning simply is not good enough, and the amount of school children without online support is gravely worrying. If exams are expected to be taken physically, then teaching must take place physically. Those calling for school closures have seemingly forgotten the importance of education, and the damaging mental health impact for teenagers of being isolated from people close to them.",
        "background": "We are calling for the Government to ensure schools and colleges remain open for years 11 and 13 if they are expecting students to sit physical exams in the summer. These students have been by far the most disadvantaged by Covid, and have already suffered months of lost contact teaching.",
