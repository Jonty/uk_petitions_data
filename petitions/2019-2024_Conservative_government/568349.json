        "additional_details": "We believe that both Providers and Parents should have a choice of whether to open up or send their children into a childcare setting. If a child does not develop the skill of personal, social and emotional development by the age of 5 they will struggle with it throughout their entire lives. We want to stay open but we want priority access to the Covid vaccination and rapid onsite testing for staff to ensure we can be as safe as possible and protect our Staff, their Families and our Children.",
        "background": "There is a growing movement for Nurseries to close, the majority of Providers and Parents do not want this! Early years plays a vital role in setting up a child with skills they will need for life. The only thing needed is for staff to be given immediate priority access to the Covid-19 vaccination.",
