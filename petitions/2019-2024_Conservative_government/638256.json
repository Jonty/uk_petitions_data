        "additional_details": "Our rivers are dying due to the dumping of untreated sewage by water companies. There have been 389,000 raw sewage discharges into our rivers in 2022 alone. \r\n\r\nThe New Environment Agency report says that 86% of UK rivers are in bad ecological health, with none passing chemical tests. 75% of UK rivers pose a serious risk to human health.\r\n\r\nWater companies allow this to happen while paying their shareholders up to a billion pounds, and company CEOs take out millions of pounds in bonuses.",
        "background": "We are asking the UK government to:\r\n- Better regulate sewage overflows to spot illegal sewage discharges by water companies\r\n- Increase financial penalties for illegal dumping of sewage into our rivers\r\n- Reinvest the money from the fines on upgrading sewerage infrastructure",
