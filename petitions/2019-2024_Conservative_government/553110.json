        "action": "Amend the Road Traffic Act to make it illegal to hit a cat and not report it",
        "additional_details": "Research has shown that around 8000 cats are killed in road accidents and left unreported in England alone.\r\nThis sometimes leads to days if not constant uncertainty as to when a cat goes missing.\r\n\r\nIf a driver did hit a cat and legally had to report it, it would bring closure to the families and then they would be able to move on. A change in the law could make a huge difference to a lot of families whose cat's have gone missing for days and left on the side of the road or disposed of.",
        "background": "Amend the Road Traffic Act of 1998 to include Cats in the defined list of animals that drivers have to stop and report when an accident occurs involving them.\r\nAmending this law will bring closure to families whose cats disappear and they never find out why.",
