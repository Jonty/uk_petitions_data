        "additional_details": "The rate of infection in younger children has been low and the new rule does not target young adults which are driving the number of cases, it penalises families who have been following social distancing and that have more than 2 children. The new rule of 6 allows people to meet with 5 additional households, which surely gives the virus more opportunity to spread to more households. Two households meeting with more than 6 in the two households with children being exempt from the 6 person rule would mean less chance of it spreading. Children have been allowed to go to school with 30 plus children but  larger families can't meet grandparents.",
        "background": "Make children under 12 exempt from the rule of 6. Allowing families to see their extended family, larger families to meet with grandparents. Both Scotland and Wales have this in place, England should be the same.",
