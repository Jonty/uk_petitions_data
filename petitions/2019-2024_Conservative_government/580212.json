        "additional_details": "With a majority of the population being fully vaccinated and a robust testing regime, the UAE poses a minimal threat to UK healthcare or the wider community. With flights to high risk countries now suspended the risk is further reduced. Furthermore, there can be zero justification for UAE to remain on the red list when countries such as Portugal have been removed.",
        "background": "The UAE needs to be removed from the travel \"red list\" as it has undertaken a successful vaccine campaign (over 50% of population at time of writing).",
