        "additional_details": "The Covid-19 situation has remained the same or even worse compared to the last year. Another reasons why the university must reconsider exam submission times are as follows:\r\n\u2022 Poor internet connection\r\n\u2022 Distraction due to overcrowded houses\r\n\u2022 Lack of facilities such as laptop or computer\r\n\u2022 Students with parenting responsibilities \r\n\u2022 Students with specific learning difficulties\r\n\u2022 Lack of study space \r\n\u2022 Lack of Technical knowledge \r\n\u2022 Students can't access the examiners if there's an issue",
        "background": "DMU has changed the exam window to 3-hour despite the difficult situation of covid-19. I would like to request reconsidering the time limit for exam submission. The submission link should be available for 24 hours after accessing the exam. So we have full 24 hours to complete nd submit the exam.",
