        "additional_details": "Cash is one of the fastest ways to spread this virus, and yet they are expected to handle cash all day. Banking can be completed online, through mobile banking and phone. Some banks are also still operating without a glass shield barrier which makes the virus more susceptible to spread! Retail banks are still considered an \u201cessential\u201d business, meaning they\u2019re required to stay open right now. Maybe if this was 1995, but with all the self-service options this is reckless and careless.",
        "background": "I would like parliament to consider closing banks temporarily due to the coronavirus outbreak. My mother works at a bank and there is no equipment to protect staff nor any social distancing measures in place. They are working on the front lines unprotected and when banking can easily be done online!",
