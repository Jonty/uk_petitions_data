        "additional_details": "During the peaceful Black lives matter protest horses have been fearful of large crowds and charged at them. The police should not be able to threaten people with large forceful animals. It is unfair and unsafe. They have encouraged media bias against the protestors, claiming they harm the animals, when its the police that take them into the protests. Mounted police is not necessary in our society or the police. To subject them to our social issues is animal cruelty and against human rights.",
        "background": "The government to ban police from being mounted and taking horses into protests as a defence against protestors. Mounted police are an outdated method of constraint. They risk harming the animal, protestors and the police.",
