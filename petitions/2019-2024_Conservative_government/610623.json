His plans hinge on the assumption that we are all too comfy in our middle class existence to suffer cold showers, to wear more clothes.\r\n\r\nWhy is this obvious option not being put to the British people? why is it off the table in Brussels at the EU? Shame on your political survivalism. \r\n\r\nParliament gives grand gestures to ambassadors, whilst children die under the unprotected skies of Ukraine. Where are the statesmen in today\u2019s politics?",
        "background": "Expand sanctions to cover the one thing we buy that will actually stop Putin\u2019s war: Gas\r\n\r\nEvery day that British parliament fails to discuss the only true weapon we can leverage against Putin - to stop buying his gas - we have the blood of Ukrainian children on our hands.",
