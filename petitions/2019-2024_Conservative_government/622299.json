No other workplace on the country would tolerate this much spent on drink, at work! The public can not afford to eat. Families are struggling and those same families are paying towards the food of some members on over \u00a380,000 a year.",
        "background": "The public purse needs to stop being abused to subsidise the massive amounts of alcohol being consumed every year on the parliamentary estate. The consumption of alcohol in the workplace of parliament needs to stop immediately.",
