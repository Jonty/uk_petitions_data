        "additional_details": "My family cannot afford to visit my vulnerable mother who lives in France. She has not seen her grandchildren for 2 years now and this is having a serious effect on her mental health. She has bipolar disorder and this is exasperating her condition. For all of us to travel it will cost \u00a31000 which is ridiculous and extortionate considering other countries don't charge their citizens for tests to travel.\r\nI know many people in my situation and there needs to be a fairer system.",
        "background": "I have dual nationality and have to make regular trips abroad. Please revise the pcr testing policy into a workable system that doesn't cost 100's of pounds! Travel is as essential as other reasons for people to get tested. Make it free for people travelling for essential reasons and not a holiday.",
