The Government sets national minimum wages, but these only apply to hourly wages.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nEnhance maternity leave to be at full pay for 6 months: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/573965\r\n\r\nIncrease Maternity/Shared Parental pay in line with National Living Wage: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/583847"
