        "additional_details": "A lot of pupils have been working hard since last year to prepare for what will be an important milestone in their future educational and professional career.  Cancelling outright the summer 2021 examination programme without due consideration for the impact it will have on pupils' motivation, mental health and future achievements should be reviewed and amended to provide young people with a chance to demonstrate the progress and hard work they have achieved.",
        "background": "Parliament should review the current status of education achieved by pupils in secondary schools and six-form colleges and consult with headteachers in order to re-instate the current timetable for GCSEs and A-levels in 2021 with an appropriately revised examination programme.",
