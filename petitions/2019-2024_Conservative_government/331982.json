        "action": "New law to ensure porn distribution companies verify age and consent",
        "additional_details": "There are no laws these companies must abide by to make sure all the content they distribute is of consenting adults, and this must change. This new law must also include a person\u2019s ability to withdraw consent at any time, even after the content has been uploaded. Such a law would help victims by ensuring their trauma is not publicly broadcasted or profited from. This law would have a global knock on effect as any company wishing to operate in the UK must change its policies to abide by it.",
        "background": "Porn sites such as Pornhub have no verification process to ensure the content it distributes is of consenting adults, and as a result Pornhub hosts and profits off thousands of videos of sexual abuse and child rape. This negligence should not be legal.",
