        "additional_details": "Shipping asylum seekers to camps in Rwanda is inhumane and indecent. People fleeing war, famine or persecution should not be treated like cargo.\r\n\r\nRegarding LGBT+ asylum seekers: while Rwanda does not criminalise same sex activity, it falls short of equality. There is no anti-discrimination policy, mechanism for changing gender, right to same sex union, right to adopt or to IVF for same sex couples.\r\n\r\nLGB Rwandans may face discrimination and violence, and trans people in Rwanda are not recognised.",
        "background": "The nationality and borders bill would see asylum seekers sent to Rwandan camps while claims are processed. Under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \"everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution\". This bill is not compatible with the Declaration.",
