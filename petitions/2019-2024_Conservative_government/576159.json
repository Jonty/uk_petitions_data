        "additional_details": "Full lockdowns and school closures have proven effective for controlling COVID cases. 1st September 2020 schools were still closed and there were 1,295 new cases. Only a month later, 1st October 2020 new cases had multiplied by six (6,914). We\u2019re currently witnessing the largest decline in new cases in this third lockdown, but it doesn\u2019t mean we should get sent back yet. This petition is for the government to only send schools back when it\u2019s safe enough for us to see our friends and family",
        "background": "We as students have suffered already with decreased mental health and not having the social interaction we are in desperate need of. If it isn\u2019t safe enough for us to see our friends and families normally, how is it possibly safe for us to be sent back to school? We don\u2019t want another spike in cases",
