        "additional_details": "Travellers from a red-list of 33 countries face a \u00a31750.00 cost for 10-days enforced quarantine, akin to a form of punishment, imprisonment and solitary confinement. The threat of ten-year jail sentences for those who do not disclose their port of origin is draconian and completely disproportionate for a regulatory offence. UK citizens, especially foreign expatriates, may still need to travel to and return from foreign countries for personal emergencies, and should not be punished for doing so.",
        "background": "Government should put more resources into monitoring and applying its policy of self-isolation and home quarantine for all international travellers. In addition, should Government continue the policy of self-funded hotel quarantine, it should subsidise the cost of hotel quarantine for UK citizens.",
