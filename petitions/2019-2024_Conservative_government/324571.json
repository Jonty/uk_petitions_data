Non essential shops and car garages etc can open, car boots can start to run and open spaces are now available to all with little or no policing. However zoos have been told they may need to close indefinitely and with no government aid, this is simply ridiculous. We need to allow them to open with support on health & safety measures which will help our country and well being for people and animals alike.",
