Without the intervention of Government, Social Media companies/platforms are most unlikely to voluntarily introduce a new mechanism to require users to create a \u2018verified\u2019 account. Regrettably, there does need to be some compulsion here which only Government can introduce.",

Users would still be able to create and operate unverified accounts (such as amongst \u2018friends\u2019) but not comment on public accounts unless verified.",
