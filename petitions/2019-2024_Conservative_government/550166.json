        "additional_details": "Tony Abbott has said overtly misogynistic and homophobic things during his career in Australian politics. I feel his a horrific choice for the board of trade as he would poorly represent our country and values. He also has been known to be a climate change denier, and therefore not suitable to represent the UK on the international stage, especially in this climate emergency. In short he is an atrocious choice especially due to his homophobia and misogyny",
        "background": "I would like the government to reverse their decision to appoint Tony Abbott as joint president of the board of trade and comdemn his views, historical and present, and admit his values are disgusting in a modern democracy",
