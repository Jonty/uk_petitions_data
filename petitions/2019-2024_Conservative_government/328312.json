        "action": "Suspend future arms sales to Saudi Arabia to save Yemen from humanitarian crisis",
        "additional_details": "Our government has supplied Saudi Arabia with \u00a315 billion worth of weapons. With these supplies, Saudi Arabia has led an intervention in Yemen with a coalition of 10 countries since 2015. The intervention has destroyed Yemen's main ports for importing food, medicine and aid, effectively blockading the country. 20 million citizens are consequently without sufficient food, and over 3 million are severely malnourished. Saudi Arabia has used this famine as a tactic of warfare.",
        "background": "The UK is Saudi Arabia's second largest arms dealer. Saudi Arabia has been bombing non-militant zones in Yemen, such as hospitals, schools, market places and ports, since 2015. Yemen is consequently facing the worst humanitarian crisis. We must save Yemen and stop assisting Saudi Arabia in arms.",
