        "additional_details": "Car thefts and fraudulent claims are on the rise. The impact this has on the country has become increasingly difficult, insurances quotes have increased and not just through inflation but due to the driver of the stolen vehicle being held accountable for having a 5 year claim on their policy, even when it is not their fault. As citizens of the UK we are expected to pay extra for our property being stolen and the perpetrators not being held accountable and given a reasonable sentence. This needs to change!",
