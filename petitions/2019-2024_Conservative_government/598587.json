My daughter got sent home for showing her ankles! HER ankles! Bot allowed her hair dyed, not allowed nail varnish, she\u2019s been targeted every week now resulting in me home schooling her, she\u2019s so well behaved, turned up on time , even when we removed the varnish and hair dye, they still weren\u2019t happy - kids are none Binary, trans\u2026 let them be themselves",
        "background": "Move with the times. Children aren\u2019t allowed to express themselves now with hair colour, make up, nail varnish, a choice of skirt or trousers, none of this effects there learning, yet teachers nit picking does! They should be allowed to chose what they are comfortable in, to be themselves",
