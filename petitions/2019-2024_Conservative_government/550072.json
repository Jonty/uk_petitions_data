        "additional_details": "There are most families especially from poor backgrounds living with children of all school going ages. \r\nThe government should find a way of protecting them or exempting the high risk from this wholesale policy of forcing all parents to send children to school.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn\u2019t be the situation where we know people are highly vulnerable but we still push Them in harms way through highly possible school infections. All lives Matter and past lessons should prevail to reduce lost Of lives . Thanks",
        "background": "As schools are about to reopen, the government has not shown any sensitivity or concrete steps to protect vulnerable families who are at high risk of dying from Covid 19 if infected. \r\n\r\nGovernment is treating all citizens as if we are all equal in terms of our ability to survive Covid 19 infection.",
