        "additional_details": "As a keen golfer myself, I feel that mentally, during this lockdown, it allows some form of exercise to be taken, while staying safe. Not every member of the public enjoys running, cycling etc, therefore golf is there form of exercise. The Scottish government have clearly thought about the implications of mental health and exercise with golf courses allowed to stay open, however within a radius of your home which limits unnecessary travel. I would like the government to seriously consider this.",
        "background": "England golf from day one has provided a safe platform since the reopening of courses in December. It has provided a safe and efficient platform to allow people to play. Using online booking systems, restricting play to two balls were just some of the measures taken.",
