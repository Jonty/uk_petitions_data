        "additional_details": "To insist that the Prime Minister resigns immediately. Mr Johnson has shown that he is unable to control his own party members, no respect for the sacrifices the public have made personally and financially. His actions and decisions have been chaotic & contradictory at best throughout the pandemic. As we have start to come out of a long period of uncertainty we find that not only have the members of his party not been following restrictions, but now we may be subject to more restrictions for a variant that is less dangerous than the original.",
        "background": "Parliament must acknowledge that the British public no longer trusts the government due to how they have dealt with the pandemic.\r\nWe need new leadership to move forward who will act in the best interest of the public not themselves.",
