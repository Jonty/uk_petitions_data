        "additional_details": "The biggest global challenge of the coming decade is how to reconcile feeding a growing population with protecting precious environmental resources. Given the role of food production in environmental damage, informing consumers as to the impact of different foodstuffs will help steer us towards a more sustainable food system. Labelling as an alternative to banning or taxing products provides this privilege without disadvantaging those without the luxury of choice of food items.",
        "background": "Enforce a system to notify consumers as to the environmental impacts of products they are buying. This would enable consumers to make informed choices to help them to reduce their own negative impact on the environment while maintaining freedom of choice.",
