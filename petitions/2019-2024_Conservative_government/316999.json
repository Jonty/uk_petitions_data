        "additional_details": "Foreign citizens occasionally receive honorary knighthoods; they are NOT dubbed, and they do not use the style 'Sir'. Such knighthoods are conferred by The Queen, on the advice of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, on those who have made an important contribution to relations between their country and Britain. \r\nThis means that a knighthood or damehood would be only a minor expression of gratitude towards those foreigners who have risked their lives to serve the greater good of the UK.",
        "background": "After years of negative propaganda against foreigners, it is time that the UK government should recognise the service that foreign seasonal farmworkers provide to Great Britain. This gesture should be extended to those foreign nationals working in other sectors severely impacted by COVID-19",
