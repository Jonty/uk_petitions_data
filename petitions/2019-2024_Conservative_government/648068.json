There are family pets suffering as pet owners are worried they can\u2019t afford to take their pets to be seen by a vet. The mark up on medication, examination's will see pets abandoned as owners will not be able to afford the fees\r\nUnless there is intervention, the vets will not consider the impact the costs are having to the owners. This will result in animals been dumped and/or disposed by the public themselves. \r\n\r\n2 recent examples a retired neighbours dog required 3 teeth removed at a cost of \u00a3750. They could not afford it. Another dog had to be put to sleep at a cost of \u00a3780 or it would be placed in a mass grave was the message left by the vets to the owner\r\n\r\nSomething has to change",
