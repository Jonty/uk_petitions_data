As a result it should be setting an example to other companies, in regards to employee benefits, and good employer. Another reason it is vital to reform, is due the UK Struggles to employ NHS staff, and we recruit a lot of migrants, tackling this issue, would mean it  you could promote this on recruitment campaigns.",
