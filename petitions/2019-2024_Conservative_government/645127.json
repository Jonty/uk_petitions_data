        "additional_details": "The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) defines a child as everyone under the age of 18, so why should we give a child consent to something so sensitive? Furthermore, the human brain attains peak processing power & memory around age 18 meaning those under that age are still developing so to give them the power of consent is almost preposterous. Sounds illogical right? Why exploit a child to sexual activities at such a young age? Join me to getting this changed!",
        "background": "The legal age of consent (16) in the United Kingdom has always been baffling & raises controversy given the vulnerability a 16 year old holds at a young age. This gives those well above this age, the opportunity to prey on those vulnerable, using this as a loophole, opening the doors to pedophilia.",
