        "action": "Ban plastic or Plastic-Hybrid disposable cups in coffeeshops/restaurants.",
        "additional_details": "In taking this first step and providing precedent for other countries to follow suit, there would be a far reduced strain on our waste services, and as consumers we must be held responsible for our purchases. This current generation of cups are lined with plastic and therefore difficult and comparatively expensive to recycle, meaning far too many slip through the net into landfill, which is a terrible solution to waste management. Discussion of this issue is pertinent to out survival! Thank you!",
        "background": "During this nationwide lockdown, coffee shops and restaurants have been closed. In that time, over 15 million plastic and non-recyclable cups haven't been thrown away and as consumers we feel it would be massively beneficial to introduce laws to prevent their use post-covid19 lockdown.",
