        "additional_details": "Gyms have not once been used as a statistic for higher levels of COVID-19 cases. They offer a safe and clean environment where people can successfully social distance whilst improving their physical and mental health. \r\nIn turn keeping them open helps business who would otherwise furlough. Gyms have a two-fold effect on helping individuals\u2019 wellbeing as well as aiding the economy in this sector. \r\nIt is absurd to create a blanket ban without any evidence gyms contribute to rising COVID-19 cases.",
        "background": "Keep gyms open throughout lockdown. They are vital to keeping the mental health and well-being of the country in good spirits. \r\n\r\nKeeping them open not only helps mental health, but thousands of business owners whose business may not survive a second lockdown.",
