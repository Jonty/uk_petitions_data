        "action": "Reinstate the bursary for history teacher trainees",
        "additional_details": "As a final year history student at Leeds University, myself and my peers are unsure of how to fund ourselves for another year of education. We've seen throughout the pandemic just how necessary good teachers are, and as funding to schools is increasingly being withdrawn across many of the most deprived areas of the country, more and more skilled teachers will be needed. Without funding lots candidates are unable to consider teacher training and we will lose many skilled teachers.",
        "background": "A few days ago, the tax-free bursary received by trainee teachers in England was scrapped for the majority of subjects and reduced for all. I am petitioning the UK government to bring back this necessary funding for trainee teachers.",
