To treat it as any other crime which discriminates a person's will, such as rape. Take proper precautions in gathering evidence and to treat the victim like an individual in need.",

For example, we could accept a petition calling on the Government to review the criminal justice system and health system's response to drink spiking, if that's something you would like to happen.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nFund free drink spiking test kits for all bars: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/597143\r\n\r\nRequire licensed venues to introduce anti-spiking policies, and fund training: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/599289\r\n\r\nMake it a legal requirement for nightclubs to thoroughly search guests on entry: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/598986"
