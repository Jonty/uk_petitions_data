        "additional_details": "If we don\u2019t protect frontline staff they will contract Covid19 and have to leave work. This will mean fewer staff to care for patients and we shall enter a vicious circle of fewer staff and more patients. Also the frontline staff should get the immunisations to the same schedule as in the development trials and not the planned delay.",
        "background": "A basic principle of control of an infectious disease by immunisation is that staff caring for patients must be protected first even before people at high risk. The CMOs have ignored this advice putting NHS & Care Staff at risk. They should be Top Prority.",
