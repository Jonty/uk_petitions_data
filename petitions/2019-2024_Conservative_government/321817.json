I feel that as a foreign national, in a key worker position in this country, I should be accorded the same treatment as my fellow key workers in the Health and care sector. They were able to do their job of saving lives because we were doing our job of looking after their children and all the vulnerable children in our midst. It is the right thing to do.",
        "background": "The Government has finally done the right thing by waiving the NHS surcharge for Health care workers and those in the care industry. It is only fair that these charges are exempted from all key workers who have ensured that life goes on under the difficult circumstances we find ourselves in.",
