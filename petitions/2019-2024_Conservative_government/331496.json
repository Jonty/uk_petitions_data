        "additional_details": "There are approximately 11 million deaf/hard of hearing people living in the UK, studies show deaf people are twice as likely to suffer with poor mental health due to feeling isolated from the outside world and unable to undertake tasks which to hearing people are so simple. Now that face coverings are mandatory in all UK shops I fear the mental health of the deaf/hard of hearing will deteriorate due to being unable to communicate with anyone and feeling even more isolated and alone.",
        "background": "Help the deaf/hard of hearing. If the majority of the public and NHS staff wore clear masks, the deaf/hard of hearing would be able to communicate easier using lip reading and facial expressions which will help them not feel so isolated and alone, therefore helping their mental health.",
