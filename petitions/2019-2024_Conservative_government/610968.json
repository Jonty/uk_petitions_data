        "action": "Allow UK families to sponsor a Ukrainian family fleeing from the war.",
        "additional_details": "Over 1 million Ukrainians, the vast majority being women and children have left their homes in search of safety from the horrors of war currently being inflicted by the Russians. Whilst the UK government has stated they will allow Ukrainian relatives of British people to apply to come to the UK, we can do a whole lot better by volunteering to house a Ukrainian family in our homes here in the UK until it is safe to return to Ukraine. This is not immigration, this is a humanitarian issue.",
        "background": "Whilst the rest of Europe are bringing Ukrainian families into their homes to give them a safe shelter from the war, the UK government are hesitating in the support of the humanitarian crisis. Allow British families the choice to voluntarily host a Ukrainian family until it is safe to return home.",
