        "additional_details": "Their complete lack of science backed restrictions have brought this country to it's knees. The unnecessary 10pm curfews, the rule of 6 and the closure of a multi billion pound industry are just a few of the things that have completely destroyed the events industry and the lives of those who work in it. The only help we received was Mr.Sunak's quality piece of advice to \"retrain and get another job\". I say lead by example and free up 650 jobs for people who care about the UK and not themselves.",
        "background": "We, the people, employ the government which is without any doubt not fit for purpose. They should all be sacked, with no pay outs and be made to retrain and find another job. If it's as simple as Mr. Sunak says it is they should have no problem finding a job in the current situation",
