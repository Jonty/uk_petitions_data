        "additional_details": "For years the media has had free rein over anyone they choose to target. The right to publish whatever they want, to the point of bullying, hate speech, black mail and  harassment. Tabloids in particular run their business on \u2018fake news\u2019 and use this to control a narrative on whatever will fit their agenda. It is getting ever more toxic, leading to the public not being able to separate fact from fiction and in some instances, stirring up civil unrest and political rigging. This has got to stop.",
        "background": "Enforce fact checking and citation to publish news articles, whether hard copy or online. Have the authority to shut down articles who can not show evidence of meeting fact checking standards. Criminalise media bullying and harassment to the same degree as civilian cases.",
