        "additional_details": "I started this petition because of disregard for legitimate concerns as countryside is lost to concrete, communities disappear into urban sprawl & residents face shoddy new builds, a fight for resources & flooding. Especially when housing supply isn't necessarily the problem - affordability & accessibility is. And 'build build build' isn't necessarily the answer when better use of existing stock, controlled rents & deterring foreign investors could have greater impact on the housing crisis.",
