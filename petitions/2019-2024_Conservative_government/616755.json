However the hours a school is open is left up to individual schools to decide - the Government simply sets a minimum number of days per year schools are required to be open. This means the Government doesn't decide when in the day that a school must open and close.\r\n\r\nYou may wish to sign this petition which calls for a very similar action: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/614046"
