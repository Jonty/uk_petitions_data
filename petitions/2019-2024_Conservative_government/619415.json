        "action": "Ban the Thin Blue Line emblem from police uniform",
        "additional_details": "The thin blue line was popularised as a counter-initiative to the Black Lives Matter movement. By the use of it on police uniform it undermines their position as impartial law enforcers as they take an oath to be. The emblem is largely considered by the public as a sign of contempt for the public, an 'us and them' mentality. The emblem contrasts the Peelian principles, specifically principle number seven. The emblem has racially prejudiced and diminishes the public opinion. It must not continue.",
        "background": "We the people require the thin blue line emblem to be banned from being worn on police uniform and by any police officer while on duty. It undermines the police and contravenes their oath to remain impartial.",
