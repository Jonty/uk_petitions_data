The veterinary industry has put the needs of animals first throughout the pandemic.\r\n\r\nVeterinary staff deserve Key Worker status, so that their children can be sent to school along with the children of other Key Workers. Without this, the industry is quickly crippled and animals will not get the treatment they need.\r\n\r\nVeterinary staff are exposed to the public every day as part of their role, and should also be considered for prioritised access to Covid-19 vaccination.",
