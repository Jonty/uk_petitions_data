I feel we have honestly progressed so much that we should be smart enough to know they are bad PTSD sufferers, extremely bad and dangerous for animals and the environment. I have anxiety and cannot stand fireworks - they are terrifying. They kill animals and greenery every single year. If the government wants to show that it\u2019s doing something to help the environment - banning fireworks is a good start.",
