        "additional_details": "Lough Neagh is the largest lake in Britain and Ireland, it provides water for 40% of NI and it is an internationally important wetland environment. \r\n\r\nCurrently the lough is dying, pollution has lead to blue-green algae bloom that can be seen from space. It is killing wildlife and threatening Northern Ireland\u2019s drinking water supply. It is Ecocide on a biblical scale.\r\nThe lough is currently owned and managed by a variety of body\u2019s and individuals making proper management impossible.",
        "background": "In the absence of a functional government in Northern Ireland I would like the UK government to bring Lough Neagh into public ownership and unify its management under a single body. The pollution in the lake has become a huge health hazard and cannot wait to be dealt with until Stormont returns.",
