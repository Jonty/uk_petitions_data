        "additional_details": "It seems extremely sensible to ask that we take similar precautions in schools, as we do in shops and restaurants. In shops, it is easy to maintain social distancing, this is not the case in schools. People are in much closer proximity in schools and it seems that the very least the government can do to be seen to try to protect their citizens is to ask that all staff and children who are over 10 wear a mask or face covering while inside buildings at schools, colleges and universities.",
        "background": "There is strong scientific evidence that the risk to the staff and families of students will greatly increase when schools and colleges go back. Masks have been shown to be effective in reducing the spread of the virus so why not encourage their use? Without them, a second spike seems inevitable.",
