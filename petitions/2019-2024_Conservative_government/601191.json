Teachers spend hours copying key information about their address, previous occupations and any training they have undertaken for no reason other than schools have a different format. The same information is requested every time, which makes applying for a new teaching role something of an uphill battle. The main focus for any teacher applying for a new role is the personal statement.",

This application form is then stored on a database and regularly updated prior to applying to a new school. The form should be uniform and used across all schools regardless of whether they are an academy or state school.",
