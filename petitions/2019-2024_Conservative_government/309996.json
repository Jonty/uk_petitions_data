However, when you do this, it takes you to a voucher form rather than a refund form. If you hadn't noticed like me then you now aren't having a refund but instead a voucher which is not what you wanted at all. This is a scummy dirty act from what should be a professional company that has exploited those in such a vulnerable situation.",
