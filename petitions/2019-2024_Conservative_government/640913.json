        "action": "Increase the funding available for Education throughout the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Our local school in Aberporth Ceredigion is increasing in pupil numbers and has been in financial surplus for the past 20 years. However this year its funding has been cut so drastically that they are having to make three staff members redundant. Despite the staff doing a wonderful job this will have a negative impact on our children who have already been disrupted by Covid. It has become apparent as we fight this decision that it is a nationwide issue. The Government is failing our children.",
        "background": "We request that the Government increase funding for Education. This includes increasing the funding to the devolved nations as well as England. Thereby allowing more money to be available for County Councils and Local Education Authorities to pass on to the schools.",
