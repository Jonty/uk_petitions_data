        "additional_details": "It is unfair that two parents can both earn \u00a349,000 a year, a joint income of \u00a398,000 and they do not incur a tax charge on child benefit claimed. Yet if just one parent earns over \u00a350,000, you have to pay tax on child benefit even if the other parent doesn\u2019t work or earns a much a lower income. It is penalising higher earners unfairly and it needs to change. High income benefit charge should be calculated in the same way tax free childcare is.",
