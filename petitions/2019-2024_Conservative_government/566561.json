        "action": "Teach LGBTQ+ sex education and history in schools comprehensively.",
        "additional_details": "I believe that the government should adopt an attitude of inclusivity when it comes to teaching sex education at schools and that they should divide time spent teaching sex education for queer and non-queer students equally. The government\u2019s lgbt survey done in 2019 outlined the problems that this country faces in regards to the quality of life of its lgbt citizens, therefore we should improve the education system in order to educate those who are prejudiced and support the students who need it.",
        "background": "As a country we have neglected the health of lgbt teenagers and hindered their ability to navigate relationships in their adult life. We are denying them the privileges that cisgender, heterosexual members of this country have and it is wholly unjust.",
