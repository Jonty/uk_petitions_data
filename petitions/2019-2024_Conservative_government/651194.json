        "additional_details": "It is true in many cases, that biological Father's are left off of Birth Certificates for inadequate reasons, such as; Controlling Behaviour by the Mother, Parental Alienation, to prevent Father exercising Parental Responsibility, or just plain spite. It is impossible to understand why the law continues to not enforce equality when it comes to Children Matters. A Mother receives Parental Responsibility from birth, a Father receives it if and when the Mother allows it, or a court, This is wrong!",
        "background": "Currently, a Mother has absolute control in whether a Father is named on a child's Birth Certificate. The Government should amend the law to require Father's to be named except in extreme extenuating circumstances, Also prevent CMS claims against Fathers that aren't named on Birth Certificate.",
