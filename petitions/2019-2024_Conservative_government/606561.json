        "additional_details": "Because for years the mother of my son has tortured me. And because I wasn't around for the registration at the birth and I am not on the birth certificate, a form of power seems to have gone to her head. When I ask her to re register him she screams and says it will mess up her benefits. I've had enough. In 6 years of my sons life she let him stay with me once two months ago. And because I had to move homes and work hard I was not able to see him as much as I'd have liked, she has now stopped us from talking to each other. I have done some research and found that there are many men with similar circumstances,  and women I've recently heard. I'm doing this for us.",
        "background": "If a person let's their emotions get in the way of a child and their parent and deliberately stops them from seeing their parent for any personal reason other than violence, this harmful act should go down on their criminal record and be punishable, from community service, to a custodial sentence.",
