        "additional_details": "NHS medical staff should not wear uniforms out of their workplace.   This increases cross infection risk.   Uniforms require daily laundering at 60\u00b0, putting extra work and financial pressure on staff.   Scrubs should be disposable/recyclable or washable cotton/cotton mix fabrics with a separate washable laundry bag, again reducing cross infection risk whilst also reducing work and costs to individual staff with sufficient supply for several sets to be laundered separately from other laundry.",
        "background": "Parliament/Government should permanently enforce NHS Trusts to provide scrubs for medical and ward staff, to reduce cross infection risk.   These should be disposable, recyclable, or cotton/cotton mix fabric, with a separate washable transportation bag and colour coded for rank/status as necessary.",
