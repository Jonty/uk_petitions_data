        "additional_details": "Once the country begins to find its feet after the vaccine has been rolled out, everyone will need to blow off steam and will be eager to mingle with people in a social environment. By giving people a free week to socialise and return to normality, it will prevent a binge or influx of not only nightclubs, bars and restaurants being at full capacity from Friday to Sunday, yet also spread the chaos over the course of a week.",
        "background": "Introduce a \u2018reverse lockdown\u2019 week once the UK is completely immunised from COVID-19. In this, the hospitality sector in particular will most likely have 3 months revenue from people desperate to get back out and live their social lives again.",
