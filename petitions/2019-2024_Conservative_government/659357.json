        "additional_details": "The economy in the United Kingdom is struggling at the moment, it would be a good idea to start looking at the legalisation and taxation of cannabis and THC products. The black market sale of cannabis in the United Kingdom at the moment is estimated to be worth anywhere from \u00a32.5 billion to \u00a38 billion per annum. Imagine if we were able to capitalise on that? nevertheless the tourism it would bring too. America has begun legalising it why can\u2019t we? Also think of the moral boost, Times are hard.",
        "background": "Legalise the sale and consumption of cannabis and THC products. Only those with the correct license are able to sell cannabis. Cannabis can only be consumed on licensed premises or in the privacy of your own home, Not in public. (rented properties still have to follow tenant agreements)",
