Due to many people having to self isolate, or are unable to work due to school closures, there are limited income. The increase of council tax bills  is an insensitive act whilst they\u2019re aware that people of the UK and Local Authority areas are struggling for income due to self isolating or unable to work due to school closures and this being their only source of childcare.",
