Recently, families who were entitled to these meals had been given \u00a315 a week per child to feed the children at home.\r\nWith millions now facing redundancy and job loses, some parents cannot guarantee they are able to provide their children with a hot meal each day. \r\nSome of the most vulnerable members of society are now going hungry to ensure that their children have something to eat and in some cases, this is still not enough.",
