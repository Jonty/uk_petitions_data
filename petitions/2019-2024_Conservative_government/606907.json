        "additional_details": "Despite international pressure including from UNESCO, The British Museum has steadfastly refused to return these classical objects widely regarded as vital cornerstones of Western civilization. \r\nA recent poll showed that 56 per cent of Britons were in favour of the Marbles being returned. Government pressure would help.\r\nEarlier this month The Times called for these classical statues to be returned to Greece. \u2018The sculptures belong in Athens. They should now return,\u2019 it wrote in an editorial.",
        "background": "Urge The British Museum to return these priceless artefacts to The Parthenon. The statues were removed them between 1801 and 1812 and shipped to Britain. The legality of this move has long been questioned. These classical objects are widely regarded as vital cornerstones of Western civilization.",
