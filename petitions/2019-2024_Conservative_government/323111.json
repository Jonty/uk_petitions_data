        "additional_details": "Many, many students, including myself, feel as if they have had a whole years worth of learning wasted as the current crisis has taken away time that was meant to be spent consolidating learning and preparing for exams. Year 12's across the country feel lost, as we are being given unequal learning opportunities, in unequal learning environments, with little to no guidance from government. Giving students the option to retake the year would hand some students the fresh chance they need to succeed",
        "background": "We are asking that the Department for Education make provisions for the current Year 12 students to be able to retake the academic year at school if they see fit, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic",
