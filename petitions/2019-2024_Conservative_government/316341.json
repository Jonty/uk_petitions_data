        "additional_details": "Because the current strategy isn't working, it is destroying the economy, it is costing thousands of lives & is failing to protect the vulnerable. It provides no acceptable exit strategy that protects the elderly & vulnerable or avoids the horror of 'social herding' theory and fails to inform and enable front line staff to return to work knowing whether they have been exposed to C19 or not. Mass testing and monitoring can and does work, until such time as an effective vaccine is available.",

Employ industry lead now & get support from senior regional Ministers, use UK capabilities to manufacture & test on scale, support with mobile technologies, reinstate economy, save lives, protect the vulnerable.",
