        "additional_details": "Stroke patients need to have contact with close family to give them the optimum chance of their best recovery. The brain is most plastic in the first few weeks following a stroke. It is during this time they must be surrounded by as much familiarity as possible. Family support is a decisive beneficial factor in post stroke quality of life and rehabilitation. Virtual visiting is often not appropriate for stroke survivors due to vision impairment, disorientation and communication difficulties.",
        "background": "Allow a designated family member to visit stroke survivors in hospital and rehabilitation units during COVID restrictions. Visitation could be safely facilitated for patients and staff through PPE, testing and Perspex screens in visitor lounges, which are empty due to the blanket ban on visiting.",
