Reopen current closed roads to cars, decreasing the congestion & pollution the road closures have caused.\r\nClosures negatively impact surrounding residents who have not been consulted at any point to date. \r\nPedestrian safety has never been an issue on these roads but emergency vehicles are now delayed increasing risk to lives.",
