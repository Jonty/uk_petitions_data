        "additional_details": "I want the government to pass a requirement because it is wholly unfair for the majority of students having to pay for a term's rent when they cannot afford, nor live in this accommodation - as many returned home after government instructions - these houses remain empty but landlords are demanding payment because of several reasons; one of which is having to paying council tax. Along with removing council tax during this time, make it a requirement for landlords to reduce/waive third term rent.",
        "background": "Require landlords to reduce rent or waive it for students who cannot afford full term rent. Many subsidise rent payment through part-time work - many of which cannot work in this pandemic and therefore cannot afford to pay full rent (\u00a32000-\u00a33000). This money is needed for basic living requirements.",
