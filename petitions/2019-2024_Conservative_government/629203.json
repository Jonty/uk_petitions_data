        "additional_details": "The current rate of RPI at time of writing is 14.1%. Should this rate stay the same then mobile phone networks can increase monthly charges by 18% every year.\r\n\r\nSomeone buying a mobile phone in January at \u00a330 per month could  instantly be paying \u00a335 per month the very next month for 12 months and then possibly \u00a342 per month from February the following year (should the RPI rate be at a similar level).\r\n\r\nOfcom are unwilling to act and so the government should act to stop this shameful profiteering.",
        "background": "In recent years, the major mobile phone operators (O2, Three, Vodafone and EE) have all changed their contracts to allow them to charge RPI / CPI PLUS 3.9% increases to mobile phone contracts. This is profiteering of the highest order for what, these days, is an essential item to have.",
