        "additional_details": "The Child Maintenance Service has failed. The National Audit Office finds it unfit for purpose with questionable calculations and procedures that unfairly stifle a parent's right to due process. It has been a tool used by toxic parents to alienate a child from their non-resident parents and punitively and financially punish them. We ask for a fundamental policy change to include that all maintenance costs be joint. That DEO's be removed completely and that appeals on CMS payments be means tested.",
        "background": "The Child Maintenance Service has a history of failings in both its service to resident and non-resident parents. We wish for a fundamental change in policy to bring about fairer calculations of maintenance, abolish DEOs completely and establish evidence-based appeals with due process.",
