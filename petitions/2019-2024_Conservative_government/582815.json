        "action": "Ban non-recyclable crisp packets",
        "additional_details": "It's a small problem that has probably contributed to the large scale of waste that goes to landfill each year. As a nation we eat 6 billion packets of crisps a year, yet they all still end up in landfill and no efforts have been made to make their packaging compostable or recyclable. Yes there are schemes, but these aren't good enough. I love crisps as much as the next person, and I think that with non-recyclable packaging becoming a thing of the past, crisp companies need to catch up.",
        "background": "I want the government to ban non-recyclable crisp packets. You would've thought that in 2021, we would have at least some form of innovation regarding crisp packet packaging. I want the government to lobby these companies and demand they find new ways to produce the classic crisp packet.",
