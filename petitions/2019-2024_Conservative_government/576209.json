        "additional_details": "COVID-19 has had a huge impact on everyone. Many pupils however, believe that the issue and focus of both mental and academic wellbeing isn\u2019t being considered in the seriousness of which it should be. Academics of this generation are progressively missing more education and are feeling more fear for their futures and many students are progressively seeing a decline in their emotional wellbeing. Opening schools at the earliest date possible will aid these young people greatly.",
