        "additional_details": "Conversion therapy is \"unethical and potentially harmful\" (GMC, 2015), is based in discrimination and can be psychologically damaging to those who endure it. The American Psychiatric Association says, \"the potential risks of reparative therapy are great, including depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior [...and] may reinforce self-hatred already experienced by the patient.\" The ban is an hugely positive step, but transgender people should be protected from conversion therapy as well.",
        "background": "The government has recently set out plans to end conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ individuals, but they have excluded transgender people from these plans. This petition is asking for the government to include transgender people in these plans.",
