        "additional_details": "Job seekers allowance does not in any way cover the amount of money that these people have lost through this crisis. Furloughed workers are receiving 80%, whereas \u00a3400 per month from JSA would be 25% of the money earned from a minimum wage job. FAIR payments for all tax payers, ALL members of our society deserve to be reimbursed equally! At least 80% of previous job earnings for all!!",
        "background": "Currently, The UK government has allocated large amounts of tax payers money to furloughing certain members of our society. Whilst this is a good decision, certain members of The UK are not allocated anywhere near the same amount of money. i.e. hospitality workers and people caught between jobs.",
