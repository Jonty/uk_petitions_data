        "additional_details": "Now it is legal for someone of any age to engage in sexual activity with a sixteen-year-old. This leaves the door open for what is effectively legal grooming of young people, which can cause long-term psychological harm.",
        "background": "Present laws are open to predatory people seeking to groom much younger people for sex. A staggered age-of-consent system that allowed young people to engage in sex with those of a similar age, whilst preventing older people from sex with 16 & 17 year-olds, would help prevent abuse.",
