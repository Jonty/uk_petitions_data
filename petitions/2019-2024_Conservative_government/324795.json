        "additional_details": "Lifting lockdown may lead to exponential spread of COVID-19, risking care homes as the elderly are locked down but carers are not.\r\n \r\nMany carers on minimum wage cannot afford cars, so use public transport which can increase their risks.\r\n \r\nMany carers would agree to live in care homes if well paid. Government should give homes funds for carers to live-in month on month off, including bonus to compensate fully for off-duty loss of personal freedom. Furlough should extend for carers who cannot do this.",
        "background": "The Government should update guidance to recommend that care staff live at care homes on a monthly basis during the pandemic to help protect residents. It should provide appropriate funding for care homes to pay staff well with bonuses for this and provide sufficient accommodation and facilities.",
