        "additional_details": "Reasonings for cancelling IGCSE\u2019s are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Some state schools received just as much education as private schools did during online lesson however they don\u2019t take IGCSE\u2019s so wouldn\u2019t have to take exams like private school students. \r\n- The stress and mental health issues students are gaining from covid is the same regardless of what school they attend. \r\n- Despite having access to online resources, online learning is harder, and much less easier to focus on than physical lessons.",
        "background": "We would like to cancel IGCSE (International GCSE) exams for year 11 pupils as keeping them will cause a huge divide between state and private schools hence causing a social  injustice. People\u2019s family members, friends and members of our community are dying, yet you still want us to take exams?",
