People don't get the dogs for the right reason and purely based on looks alone. \r\n\r\nWe need to stamp out backyard breeders and band owners. A dog is a product of its environment only. No dog is born aggressive",

We need to stop bad ownership, educate people on what breed suits their life better, I feel a license will help with stipulations of being renewed 10 yearly and limiting the number of dogs allowed at one time.",
