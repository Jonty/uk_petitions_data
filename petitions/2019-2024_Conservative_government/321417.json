Matt Hancock has clearly shown time and time again. I don't usually call for a resignation of a Government minister. But hearing that around 16,000 people have died in care homes is tragic. The UK has the highest death toll. Highest excess deaths in Europe. This is clearly not good enough and he should resign asap.",
