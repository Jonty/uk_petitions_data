        "additional_details": "Removing protections of a marginalised group contradicts both our British values and human rights.\r\n\r\n41% of trans people have experienced harassment and 67% avoid being public about their identity. Removing these protections is a clear dismissal of the issues trans people are facing. (Stats according to the GEO)\r\n\r\nGender Incongruence is recognised by the NHS and transitioning is our only way to treat it; to not allow a trans person their identity is to decline a patient the care they need.",
        "background": "Sunak wants to further separate sex and gender in his revision, meaning you will only be recognised by your assigned sex at birth regardless of GRC or transition. This excludes Trans people from gender specific services and removes their protections against discrimination. This change can't happen.",
