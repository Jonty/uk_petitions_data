        "additional_details": "The statue is a piece of Bristol's history, and should not be discarded in such a manner. The removal of the statue was an act of criminal vandalism, and was not decided upon by the people of Bristol. This sets a dangerous precedent for historical statues and monuments in Britain - if this is not dealt with, other pieces of local history are endangered by the government's lack of action. As a Grade II listed structure, this statue is protected and deemed culturally and historically significant.",
        "background": "On the 7th of June, the statue of Edward Colston was toppled and thrown into the nearby harbour. This statue should be retrieved from the harbour, repairs should be made if necessary, and the statue should be reinstalled or placed in a museum.",
