        "additional_details": "More than 300,000 critically deemed construction workers are still having to commute into and around London via busy transport services, as they are unable to work from home. Our capital is the nucleus of this country\u2019s COVID-19 crisis, where one third of our nation\u2019s cases have been reported. Construction sites remain open, under instruction to impose \u2018social distancing measures\u2019 of which are as impossible and insignificant as standing 2 metres apart.",
        "background": "Those most critical to our economy should not be discriminated against due to the nature of their trade. Forcing workers, many undoubtedly vulnerable, to resume commuting and working entirely undermines all measures in place \u2013 as upon returning home they will expose their families to COVID-19.",
