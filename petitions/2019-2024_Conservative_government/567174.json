        "action": "Close nurseries alongside schools under current COVID-19 restrictions",
        "additional_details": "Teachers have well organised unions ensuring there voice is heard. They did not feel safe returning to teaching in the classroom and they are not being made to. Nursery school teachers do not have the same voice. If a political decision is made to keep nurseries open nursery school teachers should be prioritised for the vaccine as as a matter of urgency if they are expected to continue working in an environment where it is impossible to maintain social distancing with small children.",
        "background": "There is so scientific evidence to keep nurseries open whilst closing schools. This is a political decision and one which shows that our government values the lives of teachers over nursery school teachers. Very young children can just as easily spread the virus as school aged children.",
