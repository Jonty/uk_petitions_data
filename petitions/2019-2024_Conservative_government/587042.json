If the healthcare professional feels you have the capacity to give your consent, your decision will be accepted and your wishes will continue to be respected, even if you lose capacity at a later stage. If the healthcare professional feels you do not currently have the capacity to give consent and you have not made an advance decision or formally appointed anyone to make decisions for you, they'll need to carefully consider what's in your best interests before making a decision.\r\n\r\nThe process for determine a person's best interests if they lack the capacity to give consent is set out here: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/consent-to-treatment/capacity/\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for the Government to change rules regarding to consent for medical treatment for people who lack the capacity to give consent, but it would need to be clear what changes you wanted to be made to existing requirements."
