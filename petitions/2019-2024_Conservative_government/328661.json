        "additional_details": "The public has expressed overwhelming support for these measures and so, the democratic course of action would be to follow through with what the government promised to deliver. \r\n\r\nThe current process to legally change one\u2019s gender is time-consuming and complex. This must be rectified as many people suffer from severe mental illness due to delays in their transiting process. These measures could also help to reduce the marginalisation trans people currently experience which often leads to abuse.",
        "background": "The government should respect the outcome of the public consultation regarding the proposed updates to the Gender Recognition Act. 70% of respondents were clear in their support for allowing people to self-identify as a man or a woman. Therefore, there is no reason for these plans to be scrapped.",
