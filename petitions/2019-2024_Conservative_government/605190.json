        "additional_details": "The decision to award A. Blair a Knighthood has generated a deal of public oppobrium.  Many  unsuccessful (due to UKGP Rules)  attempts have been made to launch a UKGP on this topic. However: The Prime Minister DOES advise HMQ, and it follows that HMG does have some influence with HMQ in matters of this kind. On 5/1/22, over 700,000  have voted for a Petition on the Change.org platform, on this topic.  UKGP Rules need review so that such petitions may be adopted  for Debate by HMG.",
        "background": "UKGP rejects Petitions which do not fall within UKGP criteria. If another respectable  Petitions platform hosts a Petition which gains great popular support, in a very short space of time, it might be appropriate for the UKGP Committee to adopt that Petition so that it might properly be debated.",
