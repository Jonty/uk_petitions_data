        "action": "Reverse the decision to delay the 2nd dose of the Covid-19 vaccine",
        "additional_details": "The World Health Organisation strongly recommends not delaying the second dose, and the manufacturers of the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine recommend that the second dose should be administered 21 to 28 days after the first dose at the latest. This petition calls on the Government and NHS England to listen to the WHO and the manufacturers and reverse their decision, and ensure no one receives a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine more than 28 days after their first dose.",
        "background": "On 30 December 2020, health officials were informed that people who receive the Pfizer/BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine could have to wait up to 12 weeks for a second dose. This decision will severely impact health workers, who are more likely to receive the Pfizer vaccine than the Oxford vaccine.",
