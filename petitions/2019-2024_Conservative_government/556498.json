        "action": "Reduce the content of A Level examinations",
        "additional_details": "Students in the UK have already missed hundreds of hours of learning since March. Some pupils don\u2019t have the essential resources: a working computer, textbooks, stationary, etc. Many don\u2019t have a proper learning environment, therefore results will most certainly not reflect the true potential of pupils. Hence why I am writing to the Government to reduce the content of A Level examinations to allow students across the country to be much better equipped and less disadvantaged.",
        "background": "The Government should reduce the content of A Level examinations in 2021 due to the disruption of Covid-19. Approximately 6 months of adequate teaching has been lost, and pushing the exams back by a couple of weeks is not enough. This has already had a huge impact on the studying of so many.",
