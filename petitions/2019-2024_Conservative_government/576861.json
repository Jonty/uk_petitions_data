No other profession has to do work training on a day off that I'm aware of. Drivers do anywhere between 60-70 hours work a week and then are expected to do another 35 hours unpaid work on one of there 2 days off every 5 years",
        "background": "Lorry drivers have to pay for dcpc training, which is just classroom work where people who don't drive tell you how to drive your vehicle safely and legally. Even though we drive them all year round. They also have to do this on one of there days off. Which is strange as its a work thing.",
