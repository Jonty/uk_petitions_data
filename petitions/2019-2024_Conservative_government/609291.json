        "action": "Amend the 2010 equality act to include non-binary as a protected characteristic.",
        "additional_details": "Being non-binary, I have struggled with every day things such as finding the right toilets that some people might take for granted. I have recently struggled a lot with not feeling comfortable in my PE class. I didn't ever want anyone else to feel like that, ignored and like it wasn't important if you were comfortable or not because it was easier for the school to just stick me in the class which matches my gender assigned at birth.",
        "background": "I would like Parliament to make amendments to the Equality act to make being Non-Binary a protected characteristic. This could change day to day issues for non-binary people such as gendered toilets and school classes (e.g. PE) to help them feel more included and welcome in society.",
