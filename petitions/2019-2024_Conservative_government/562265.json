        "additional_details": "Year 11 pupils have missed out on vital teaching for all subjects, firstly during the first lockdown, when it was only in July that teachers started to do online video teaching. They shouldn\u2019t be expected to sit exams when for half of year 10 they taught theirselves. \r\nThen in year 11 pupils are having to isolate themselves or due to class mates or family members having Covid and once again missing teaching as work they are set is online and not videoed from each class with their teachers.",
        "background": "To look at not making year 11 pupils sit GCSEs for 2021, due the fact they have not had the full teaching during year 10 and some of the time in year 11 due to isolating, it\u2019s also putting an immense amount of pressure on the pupils to get the grades they require to go to college",
