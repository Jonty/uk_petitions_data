        "additional_details": "This is because, especially those who are applying to university are going to be up against people who have not sat the exams and therefore have an advantage meaning they can get into the universities easier. Additionally all students have missed out on over 5 months of crucial education. It simply unjust to allow students from Wales not to do any exams whilst other students must suffer.",
        "background": "I want the Government to cancel A-levels and GCSES due to the disadvantage we have had of missing over 5 months of crucial education.Today on Tuesday 10th October Wales announced they will cancel the exams and I think this leaves the rest of the UK students at a major disadvantage.",
