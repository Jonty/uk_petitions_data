        "additional_details": "Governments have been playing politics with the NHS, cutting and privatising. \r\n\r\nUp to the 90s we saw similar meddling with the Bank of England and int. rates. Under Thatcher rates changed twice per month and at 15+% homes were un-affordable. Blair depoliticised the B of E and let the bankers run it, result a steady & lower int. rate.\r\n\r\nGovernment must stop meddling with the NHS and give control to a team to run it on behalf of the people. We may get through COVID-19, but what about the next one?",
        "background": "We the British people have had enough political interference by successive governments which is destroying the NHS.  We ask/demand that the government depoliticise the NHS and return to us a health service in line with how it was originally intended.",
