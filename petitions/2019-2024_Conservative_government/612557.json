        "additional_details": "Just because animals taste good does not justify the brutal murder and abuse of these sentient creatures who think and feel like we do. Sensory pleasure DOES NOT justify violence.\r\n Animal welfare is not good enough. Under animal welfare, animals are still killed and abused in ways that are considered legal, standard-practice.\r\n Some sympathise with the farmers over this. What matters more; money or life? The farmers can get other jobs, the animals can\u2019t just go and get other lives\u2026",
        "background": "Currently, 77 billion animals are slaughtered annually across the world. That\u2019s more animals dying brutal and often terrifying deaths at the hands of man for something as trivial as 10-minute meals. Who gave us the right to murder and abuse all of these poor creatures?",
