Changes should be made in order for our society to become a better place for all and to deter others from committing crimes as such.",
        "background": "As it stands hate crimes are not punished in ways that they should be and it feels as if people who discriminate are being let off light. I propose that there should be harsher penalties for those who commit hate crimes in order for people to learn right from wrong.",

Deciding what action to take in specific cases is a matter for the police, Crown Prosecution Service and courts, not the Government or House of Commons.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling for minimum sentences for hate crimes to be increased, or for hate crime provisions to be extended to all protected characteristics, to increase protections against hate crimes."
