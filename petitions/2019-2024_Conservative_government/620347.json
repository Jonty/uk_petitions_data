        "additional_details": "There are many fine things about monarchy as an institution, but the permanent inherited privilege, wealth, and legal immunities of a single family is not one of them. We could preserve the value of the monarchy as an object of tourism and a focus for national devotion while making it more democratic, celebrating dozens of queens each year for their own special character and contribution to British life. Hundreds of women would unexpectedly become 'grandmother of the nation'.",
        "background": "After the current Queen dies, we want the position of Queen to rotate. The temporary occupants would be randomly selected UK resident women over eighty. Each would spend a week living in palaces, hosting events, and making addresses. Their families would become the temporary royal family.",
