        "additional_details": "We have been led to think that the monarch's role in legislation was now merely symbolic, limited to the automatic granting of royal assent. It appears that this isn't in fact the case and the queen is able to interfere and change legislation for her own benefit. This is simply feudal, medieval and solidly undemocratic and should not be tolerated in a modern democratic society.",
        "background": "Queen's Consent is the system whereby the monarch is able to make changes to draft laws before they are even presented to Parliament. This procedure is an undemocratic, feudal relic. It must be abolished.",
