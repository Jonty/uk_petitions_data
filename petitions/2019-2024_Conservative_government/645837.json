I recently purchased a puppy Luna from an unregistered breeder. Luna was seen by her vet 2 days before I collected her. Luna was seen by our vet a few days after we had her. She was diagnosed with maluntrition, severe dyhdration, swollen kidneys & all this from a physical examination. She on scan presented with a Liver shunt.",
