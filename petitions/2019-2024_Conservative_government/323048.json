        "additional_details": "These students have lost out on developing debating skills and network building with 6 weeks of strikes and the digital environment in lockdown being disrupted and absent of the essential interaction and frank discussion which can only take place in the physical environment.\r\n\r\nThe significant effects have encompassed cancellation of dissertation work placements, field trips, student conferences, guest speaker talks and cross-departmental presentation \u2013 severely curtailing the experience gained.",
        "background": "Please bring forward by one year the policy of a 2-year entitlement to work, in respect of 2019/20 Master\u2019s students. Taking a 1-year course, they have been deprived of the major part of the anticipated international and practical experience due to industrial action and the Covid-19 pandemic.",
