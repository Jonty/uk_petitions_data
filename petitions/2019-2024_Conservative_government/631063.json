        "additional_details": "Not only are we not doing enough for the various crises and wars happening around the world but the UK are actually regressing in that the our PM pledges to detain and prevent refugees from fleeing to the UK. There have been countless reports of channel deaths due to lack of supplies or freezing to death. Seeking asylum is a human right, and the country they are escaping from does not afford them that choice. 100 million people have been forcibly displaced according to Amnesty International.",
        "background": "We need an accurate and positive representation of this cause in the media by not allowing what is said to be bias. Fund rescue boats on a larger scale to bring people attempting to cross the channel, to the UK safely. Don't criminalise asylum seekers and refugees or alienate them from UK society.",
