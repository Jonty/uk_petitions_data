        "additional_details": "The govt has no place policing people's personal behaviour. Drugs and prostitution should be legal.\r\n\r\nAnd no-one should have to beg for benefits just to eat! Additional funds could be raised by increases in environmental taxes and, if necessary, general taxation. Together with savings on benefits, a Basic Income of c. \u00a310k is achievable.",
        "background": "The wars on drugs & prostitution have failed. If both are fully legalised, the taxes (and savings on crime costs by releasing all drug or prostitution only convicts immediately) could pay for a Basic Income for every British born, British resident, British citizen between 18 and retirement.",
