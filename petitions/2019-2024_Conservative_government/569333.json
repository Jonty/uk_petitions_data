        "additional_details": "The music industry is worth \u00a35.8bn to the UK (The Guardian). Without freedom of movement for musicians and performers, we will struggle to uphold this number and the well-being and livelihoods of many as artists won\u2019t be able to afford the fees. The UK has always been proud of its culture and the arts, but the disregard and disrespect is blatant. We have given so much, but gained so little. I am asking the UK Government to re-think their deal with the EU and access visa-free tours.",
        "background": "The Government need to re-think and evaluate their choice on rejecting the offer the EU has given for visa-free tours. We have been shown the blatant disregard to the arts during this pandemic. We do not need another blow. Musicians and performers need freedom of movement within the EU.",
