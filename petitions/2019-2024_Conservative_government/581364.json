        "additional_details": "There are so many people who I know who would love to be using e-scooters for commuting and short journeys but are scared they will be stopped by police and fined \u00a3300. This makes no sense. Hire schemes are legal so what is the difference between a privately owned scooter and a hire one. Yes the speed and safety but whilst legalising them the government could make a list of safety standards to make them safer.",
        "background": "Legalise the use of privately owned electric scooters on roads and cycle paths. As we are constantly being told to use public transport less, use cars less and cut carbon emissions electric scooters are a no brainier to help with all of these issues.",
