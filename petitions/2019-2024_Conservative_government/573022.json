        "action": "Increase penalties for criminals convicted for dog fighting",
        "additional_details": "Dog fighting was outlawed nearly 200 years ago sadly it still continues in the 21st century and is a significant animal welfare issue for the UK. It was thought this used to be a issue occurring in the country but there has been a huge rise in incidents within cities and the cruelty is increasing. At the moment the penalty is minimal when considering the barbaric nature of the crime, I want the penalty to match the horrific offence.",
        "background": "I don\u2019t think torturing, injuring or being responsible for the death of a dog should only result in only up to 51 weeks\u2019 imprisonment, a fine, or both. At the moment the penalty is minimal when considering the barbaric nature of the crime, I want the penalty to match the horrific offence.",
