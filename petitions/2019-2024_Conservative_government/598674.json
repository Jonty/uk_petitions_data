        "additional_details": "It has become increasingly difficult to travel abroad with pets. There are limited routes & companies allowing for animal travel. Owners are left with few options, normally leaving them behind.\r\nPet travel is an important part of the travel industry and should not be taken lightly. In fact, according to Away Resorts survey, 85% of UK pet owners would prefer to stay home than leaving pets behind when abroad. We need more solutions and pet-friendly routes to travel.",
        "background": "Change the rules of animal travelling abroad. Government should contribute to the facilitation of animal travelling and add pet-friendly routes to and from the UK- by rail and airplane (cabin).",
