        "action": "Offer the covid vaccine to all 5-11 year olds, now it is approved by the MHRA.",
        "additional_details": "Although the risk of severe disease in children is rare, the risk of long covid is substantially higher, and the long-term effects still unknown. Recent studies have shown that covid infection in children raises the risk of developing diabetes by up to 166%. Unvaccinated, they will suffer repeated infections, increasing the risk of serious illness, and school absence. Vaccination would significantly reduce transmission and illness, and help protect vulnerable members of the community.",
        "background": "Currently, 5-11 year olds are the only significant age group not to be offered the vaccine, apart from those indicated as vulnerable, and also the age group suffering from some of the highest rates of infection: as of January, the only age group in the UK in which infection rates are still rising.",
