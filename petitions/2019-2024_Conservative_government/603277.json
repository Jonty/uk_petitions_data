Such as working extra time leaving their families so services do not fail, sacrificing annual leave, so that  service continues to run. Without the commitment of our NHS employees the NHS would suffer. As a thank you and show of appreciation the Government  should grant 1 day extra leave either this year or next financial year.",

Due to Covid 19 and other covid variants, NHS staff have worked hard to keep the services running, despite the staff shortages lack of funding. The staff had ensured that patients get the best care despite these shortages.",
