It is also vital to maintain public trust to facilitate uptake of the vaccination at all. For both of these reasons the government must revert to the original vaccination program as recommended by the manufacturer.",
        "background": "The science and evidence testing shows a 52.4% efficacy after 1 dose and 95% after 2 doses with the 2nd dose 21 days after. There is no current evidence to suggest that this efficacy will be achieved after 3 months. Patients consented to a vaccine course that is now being changed. This is wrong.",
