        "action": "Extend Permanent Health Insurance Payments to the New Retirement Age(s)",
        "additional_details": "Additional legislation is needed to mandate PHI insurers to continue payments until clients receive their State Pension.\r\nFor many, the agreed-upon policy term was their retirement age, yet a specific age stated in the policy translates to a fixed term. \r\nThe government should legislate to ensure Pension Law changes do not adversely affect PHI policies holders who are vulnerable people. The payments should continue until their actual retirement date - reflecting the true objective of a PHI policy.",
        "background": "Disabled or long-term sick employees, who enrolled in PHI decades ago, now approach their 60th (Women) or 65th (Men) birthday with apprehension, as they do not qualify for State Pension until months or years later & due to their PHI policy stating a fixed retirement age.",
