        "additional_details": "I think that quarantine and covid testing must be removed for fully vaccinated people to allow  easier travel to/from amber list countries in order to support the travel industry and be able to get closer to normality. Although it may seem unfair to unvaccinated people, it can encourage more people to get both vaccine shots and therefore have more options for travel.",
        "background": "Allow double/fully vaccinated travellers arriving from amber list countries to avoid quarantine and COVID-19 tests. Quarantine after travel would be a waste of time for vaccinated travellers as vaccine has significantly reduced the spread and infection rate of the virus.",
