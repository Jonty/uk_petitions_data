        "additional_details": "The people of Mauritius lack the resources and funding to clean up this catastrophe & deal with it quickly. Fishes are washing up dead, the ecosystems are dying & the fishermen are unable to make a living. Schools are also being closed due to the dangers of the oil/diesel in the air. The locals are doing everything they can to help. The British ruled over Mauritius from 1810-1968 and I feel that if the British were to give back to Mauritius, this time of crisis would be the best time.",
        "background": "On the 26 July 2020, A Japanese owned ship named: M V Wakashio, left China headed towards Brazil carrying 4000 tones of Oil & Diesel, which crashed onto the Mauritius reef & is currently leaking oil and killing the underwater creatures and ecosystem. It has been too long with very little help.",
