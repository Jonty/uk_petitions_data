        "action": "Change the definition of rape to include perpetrators without a penis.",
        "additional_details": "S1 Sexual Offenses Act (2003) states that rape is penetration with a penis. This means none penis baring people would be charged with a lesser crime for what society deem as rape. Rape should be changed to a more Americanized definition as found on the FBI website. Further to this, the new definition should also include a female forcing themselves onto another using the victims own penis. This would protect all genders from unwanted sexual action as current law forces the CPS to charge people with lesser offenses. More, assault by penetration doesn\u2019t carry the same stigma as rape does. This could also potentially create a deterrent due to the stigma around being a rapist vs a sexual assaulter.",
        "background": "Current law requires a person to have a penis to be able to be prosecuted for rape. This means that people without a penis would be charged with other offenses which, usually, grant a lighter sentence. A change of the definition of rape to a more inclusive definition would lead to equal sentencing.",
