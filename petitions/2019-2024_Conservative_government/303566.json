        "additional_details": "Currently following separation/divorce some fathers are denied access to their children by mothers who have no legal or formalised order to do so, at the detriment to the upbringing and emotional state of the child/ren. We are asking that government make it law that fathers have equal access until such time Mediation / Court have formalised an agreement. Or if Mothers believe access should be restricted its done so with an order.",
