        "additional_details": "Weekly bin collections are not a luxury for many residents of the Hounslow Borough, they are an essential service. The change to collect recycling and food waste bins weekly but move general waste collection to every 2 weeks is unacceptable. Councils who move to fortnightly collections see overflowing bins, more litter and more fly tipping. Please invest in our waste collection services, look after the people who deliver these services and restore our weekly bin collections.",
