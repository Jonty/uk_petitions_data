We are now in another lockdown, meaning more people\u2019s certificates are getting closer to expiry date through no fault of their own. Even more practical tests have been cancelled, people are losing their chance of driving. To take another test is costly, and robbing more precious time than already taken. You hold your theory for life, please allow these people a better chance.",
