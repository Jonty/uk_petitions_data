Jobs that currently workers can't afford to vacate but could with the right incentives.\r\nWe believe that this would also prevent the increased and expected burden on the tax payer as unemployment numbers will be suppressed and instead of creating huge increases in welfare budgets funding will be passed to pension funds.",

Businesses are already able to offer financial incentives to employees in order for them to resign or retire early. It is up to indiviudal businesses whether to offer such incentives, and for individual employees whether to take these.\r\n\r\nIf there are specific statutory rules regarding redundancy or early retirement that you want to be changed, you could start a new petition explaining clearly what changes you would like the Government or Parliament to make to these."
