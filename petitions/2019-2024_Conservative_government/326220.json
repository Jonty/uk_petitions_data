        "additional_details": "Statues in the UK were erected by those wishing to honour the greatness, endeavours and philanthropy of those that came before. I suggest there must have been very good and noble reasons to erect all of these statues and that perhaps these reasons may have been lost in the mists of time. A craze of history revisionism has tended to only focus on negatives and to distort. No context is given to the times in which these people lived. They are our history and should remain for people to judge.",
        "background": "The removal of public statues by councils in the wake of the black lives matter protests are efforts to appease mobs and should not be condoned. Under these conditions it is proper for permission from the home secretary to be granted before their removal.",
