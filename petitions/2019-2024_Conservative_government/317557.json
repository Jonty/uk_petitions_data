        "additional_details": "The risk of Coronavirus to teenagers and younger adults (Sixth formers and college students) is too high to justify re-opening schools to these years. The vast majority of students at this age are independent and do not need parents/guardians to remain home for them, meaning that they have little effect on stimulating economic recovery. We should continue to embrace home learning, and especially from Sixth Formers, acknowledge their ability and self-motivation to learn independently . \r\nFor 2021 GCSE and A-Level exams, grade boundaries will ensure that all students will be graded fairly, acknowledging this unprecedented loss of classroom time.",
        "background": "Schools should remain closed to Years 10-12 until September 2020;  The re-opening of schools to older children and sixth formers/college students at this stage is NOT essential, and won\u2019t help stimulate economic recovery. The risk to teenagers of this age isn\u2019t the same as it is for young children.",
