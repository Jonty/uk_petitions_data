This is not enough to support parents to work, even part-time after maternity/paternity leave. At an average of \u00a352 per day for a two-year-old attending nursery (Daynurseries, May 2022), 3 days per week and using the childcare tax-free account the fees would be \u00a3540.80 monthly. How is this affordable?",

Simplify funding criteria, meaningfully subsidise early years and holiday club childcare; to make it affordable to all families and children in the UK.",
