        "additional_details": "This time of year is essential for all retailers and personal care industry. By closing them without the facts to back it up, when the science is stating that salons in particular are safe environments, at the same time keeping schools and universities open when the rates are constantly increasing, is disproportionate and highly unlawful. Each industry should be rated upon risk of transmission and closed according to risk. Not this knee jerk reaction that has been taken. Look at the facts.",
        "background": "A recent sage report has confirmed that hair salons are not involved in the rise of covid 19, with a risk of 0.05% . How many businesses are closed that are actually covid safe? The reasoning behind closures needs to be based upon facts not assumptions. Open all businesses that are Covid safe.",
