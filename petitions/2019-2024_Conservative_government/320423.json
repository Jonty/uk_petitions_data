        "additional_details": "Right now it is highly essential for us, at all times and above all in times of crisis, to have access to our churches, to the sacraments. We urge the government to uphold the constitutional right of its citizens - to freely practice religion.\r\n    We are fully aware of all the gathering requirements under the circumstances and all places of worship are capable to meet all the requirements, namely, sanitising, social distancing etc as laid out by the Government.",
        "background": "We call on the government to open churches so people could resume corporate worship to find peace and support. We have endured isolation from worship for two months through the restriction on movement and gatherings. We believe that it is an integral part of our life.",
