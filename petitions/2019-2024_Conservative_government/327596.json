        "additional_details": "We want Government to complete the reforms so that transgender people will be able to fully be themselves, especially \u00ecn the eyes of the law. We want them to not have to go through endless tests over the course of many years to see if they are 'truly' trans. We cannot see how much pain and dysphoria they are going through and so we should aim to make it easier for them to at least present as their true gender before all the tests and having to have gender reassignment surgeries.",
        "background": "Complete the reforms to the Gender Recognition Act which would make it easier for transgender citizens to legally transition. The plans to scap the reforms will make it harder for transgender citizens to transition and will prevent them from going to the correct bathroom until fully transitioned.",
