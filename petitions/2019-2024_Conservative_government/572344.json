        "additional_details": "There are a lot of learner drivers who have been unable to take their driving tests due to their theory test expiring during national lockdowns. It is unjustified that learner drivers can have their theory test certificates extended but it would be justified to allow learners to prove their knowledge is up to date free of charge. Learners should be allowed one free retake on the receipt of an expired theory test certificate expired after the 17th of March 2020.",
        "background": "Give candidates with a theory test certificate expired during the pandemic pandemic entitled to one free retake of the theory test when the test centres reopen. Refund candidates who have already paid to retake their theory test due to the pandemic (1st retake only).",
