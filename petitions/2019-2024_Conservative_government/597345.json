        "additional_details": "When Archimedes of Syracuse came up with the value of \u03c0 he clearly did not appreciate the widescale use to which it would be put. We use it in trigonometry, computing and all manner of branches of engineering.\r\n\r\nNot being able to enter a simple value for \u03c0 into our calculators and computers makes engineering and business life much harder and has a significant impact of the efficiency of the UK economy.\r\n\r\nChanging the value to something simple like three (3) will garner much support from us all.",
        "background": "It is very gratifying to see that the government is bringing back the sensible Imperial system of measurement which was so successful during our days of Empire.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of this change it is time to simplify the ridiculous, Greek and irrational value of \u03c0 which makes mathematics so difficult",
