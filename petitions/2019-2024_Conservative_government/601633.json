        "action": "Prevent UK Government to Revoke Ethnic Minority British Citizenship",
        "additional_details": "The changes are draconian and offer an individual little to no chance to appeal. It is against international law to deprive a person of citizenship and inhumane not to allow one to appeal a decision made in their absence or knowledge. This practise is alien and frowned upon even by the UK's closest allies. An individual should be given enough time to make a legal challenge in a British court of law before any decision to revoke citizenship is made.",
        "background": "The British Government has recently and quietly made changes to the 'Nationality and Borders' bill. Clause 9 of the bill -  \u201cNotice of decision to deprive a person of citizenship\u201d, now exempts the Government from giving notice to an individual if they deem you are a national security threat.",
