        "additional_details": "In 2012 a UK government study revealed that only a quarter of animals trapped in snares were \u2018intended targets\u2019. Victims range from pheasants to pet dogs. Although all snares are dangerous, \u2018free-running\u2019 snares are legal in the UK and can be lethal and cause so much suffering. IPSOS MORI states that 80% of the British Public think that Fox Hunting should remain illegal. DEFRA suggests 1.7 million animals are trapped each year. The Conduct of Practice is not a solution, instead we need a ban.",
        "background": "The UK\u2019s precious wildlife is under threat due to private and commercial hunting. The government must make snares completely illegal in the UK to conserve our wildlife. Snares are used to protect other animals, but in doing so, they kill so many others - they don\u2019t discriminate between species.",
