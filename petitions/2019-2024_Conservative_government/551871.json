        "additional_details": "After finding junk mail in our mailbox almost every day, we realised this is a real health hazard. Watching a few junk mail deliverers over a few days we saw how they were delivering leaflets without using PPE (gloves, face mask or visor etc). A junk mail deliverer will touch hundreds or even thousands of mailbox doors and leaflets. They are putting the public at risk every day",
        "background": "We need a new law making cald calling and junk mail illegal. A second wave of Covid-19 might be here soon and we need to act now. The public can only opt out of receiving Royal Mail's junk mail, but there are still a number of private junk mail deliverers out there that put our lives at risk",
