        "additional_details": "The XL Bully has been slaughtered for the way they look and the way the media has percieved them. Most owners of the breed are raising them with the correct training, socialisation and care. They are companions like any other breed and majority come from loving homes. They make excellent family pets. They are loyal, caring and full of love to give. I know breeds of this type who are very friendly and sociable and show no aggression towards other dogs and even strangers. They are not the problem.",
        "background": "Do not make XL Bully a banned dog breed in the Dangerous Dogs Act. Do not allow social media and news to create bad names for this dog and halt all consideration on the ban. Owners are responsible for their dogs and should therefore be accountable for any incidents. Bring back dog licences.",
