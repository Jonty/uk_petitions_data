        "additional_details": "75% of the investment should go to railways in Scotland, and 25% to railways in Northern Ireland, roughly in proportion to their population.\r\n\r\nIf built, a fixed link could go through miles of unexploded World War II-era munitions (of which there's over a million tonnes) and radioactive waste.\r\n\r\nIn Northern Ireland, the rail network is concentrated in the east. There are only 3 train stations in the west - and no rail at all in Tyrone or Fermanagh. We can't justify this any longer.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson wants a tunnel or bridge built to link Northern Ireland and Scotland.\r\n\r\nThis is an unfeasible vanity project.\r\n\r\nIf Johnson is serious about transport for NI and Scotland, he should put his money where his mouth is. Scrap the tunnel/bridge & invest the \u00a315bn in railways instead.",
