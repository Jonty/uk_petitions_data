        "additional_details": "Currently Statutory walking distance is 2 miles for 5-8 years & 3 miles for 8-16 years. This is not a particle walking distance in this modern lifestyle and this was implemented back through Educational Act 1944. \r\n\r\nGovernment is expecting kids to walk 6 miles a day and effectively learn at school. For parents with 8 years old who doesn't drive and cannot afford public transport is expected to walk 12 miles if they drop & pickup the kids as they are young to walk alone.",
        "background": "Reduce the walking distance to 1 mile that is more practical for Kids according to various lifestyle researchers.\r\n\r\nThis is a major problem where we have no convenient public transport, especially for 5 years & it gets worse when council put kids in different schools and parents doesn't drive.",

Currently this distance is 2 miles for under 8s, and 3 miles for 8 to 16 year olds. The title of your petition refers to \"5 & 8 years old\", but you then go on to talk about the 3 mile distance that applies to 8 to 16 year olds.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
