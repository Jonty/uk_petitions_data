        "additional_details": "Zoos wildlife parks and safaris all rely on visitors for at least 90% of there income which they haven't in lockdown. Yet they still need to feed the animals and pay staff to look after them as well as maintenance and so on. As beaches and non essential shops have been allowed to open why not these places. Lots of wildlife trust parks allowed to open why not zoos etc. It's easy to set up a 1 way system in these places in some places there is 1. As for distance and hygiene it's just as easy as national trust and easier than shops as it's out side with more room to move about.",
        "background": "To allow zoos ect to open as part of the economy getting back to normal. They will have to use social distancing measures yes but being mostly out side this should be easily done.",
