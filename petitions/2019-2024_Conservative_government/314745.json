        "additional_details": "At the moment it is the transport industry keeping the county afloat, even the NHS for that matter. If we all become ill then the supply chain stops. It\u2019s a disgrace that a company out there is making all this money from parking fees and we can\u2019t even get a hot meal! I stopped tonight and a lorry fee for \u00a330 for 24 hrs and my van was \u00a315!! Who ever stops for up to 24 hrs?? This needs to be addressed and the fees stopped until the COVID 19 outbreak is over !!!! FREE PARKING FOR THE TRANSPORT INDUSTRY",
        "background": "To stop the fees for parking at service stations. Lorries and vans running up and down suppling our country are working so hard to keep everyone supplied and we can\u2019t can\u2019t even stop for more than 2-3 hours without paying an extortionate amount to stay longer, and can\u2019t get a meal either.",
