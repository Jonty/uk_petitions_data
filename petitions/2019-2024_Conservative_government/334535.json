        "additional_details": "Last week in Scotland, 124,000 pupils\u2019 teacher estimated grades were downgraded by the Scottish Qualifications Authority. Pupils in the poorest areas were marked down the most. This Thursday, when 250,000 English pupils will receive their A-level results, almost 40% of grade assessments by teachers may be revised downwards, according to the Guardian. To achieve a \u201cnormal\u201d spread of results and avoid grade inflation, the regulators risk robbing a generation of young people of their futures.",
        "background": "We want the Government to follow the Scottish Government and reinstate all the downgraded grades back up to the teacher predictions. Students shouldn't be discriminated against because of their postcode.",
