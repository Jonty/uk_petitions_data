        "additional_details": "There has not been a revision on bowhunting within the Wildlife and Country act since 1969. modern bows can fire arrows in excess of 300fps ensuring a humane kill. Many European countries have already legalised bowhunting as well as the United States where bowhunting for large and small game is legal. If this is licenced it would bring a revenue stream to help with conservation.",
        "background": "Legalise bowhunting on private land in the United Kingdom. This can be governed by a licenced body which you would receive a membership upon completing a competency test.",
