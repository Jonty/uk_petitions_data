        "additional_details": "Currently phlebotomists are being paid band 2 agenda for change. Due to rise in cost of living, and the increase in minimum wage, the current banding does not reflect the skills, knowledge, experience, or risks taken by phlebotomist when they perform their roles. A band 4 pay will boost morale, and improve working lives for phlebotomists across the nation. Otherwise, trusts will lose experienced phlebotomist who would otherwise work elsewhere for the same pay (less risk) if not more pay.",
