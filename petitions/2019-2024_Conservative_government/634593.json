        "additional_details": "For many students, A-level mocks were the first time they have been in an exam hall due to the cancellation of formal GCSES. A huge disadvantage. Yet going further, 2023 A-level students have suffered endless strike action. Rail strikes have caused students to be unable to attend college. Teacher strikes have led to vital learning being dismissed. The UK\u2019s biggest teaching union, the NEU, has predicted that 85% of schools will be affected by strike action. A-level students need to be heard.",
        "background": "Current A-level sitting Year 13's deserve much more lenience with our A-level marking and grading, considering the impact of COVID-19 & endless strike action. Our grade boundaries need to be lowered; grades need to be granted much more generously. We cannot go back to pre-pandemic grade boundaries.",
