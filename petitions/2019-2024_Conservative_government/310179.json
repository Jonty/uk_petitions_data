My husband ( and he is not alone) has already visited one patient who didnt disclose this when calling for an ambulance and as such they went in unprepared and then discovered the patient had corona symptoms.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople can show no symptoms for 10 days so ppe should be worn for every patient as these staff could unwillingly infect other patients and families.",
