        "additional_details": "This is not a petition to silence people\u2019s opinions, however it is a petition for every user of social media platforms to be verified like a person of media interest is. This is not an exercise to silence opinion, but to use as a buffer to unknown user profiles sharing absusive, hate speech towards religion/race/sexual orientation and violent threats towards users. I believe this would cut the amount of abuse aimed at people on social media that can have detrimental impacts to their wellbeing.",
