        "additional_details": "Keeping non essential shops open for click & collect does nothing to reduce numbers of staff or customers coming into contact with each other.\r\nClick & collect encourages people to leave their homes for non essential reasons. These people often then have to stand in a queue with others, putting them at unnecessary risk of contracting the virus. \r\nWorkers also have to put themselves at unnecessary risk. \r\nUnnecessary risk of spreading the virus should be eliminated when lockdown becomes necessary.",
        "background": "When we enter a national lockdown, all non essential shops should close.\r\nThey should not remain open for click & collect services or delivery if they are not essential. \r\nA national lockdown is only put in place when extreme measures are needed, and so extreme action should be taken.",
