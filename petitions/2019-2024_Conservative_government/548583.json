        "action": "Grant the Environment Agency powers to monitor and penalise water companies.",
        "additional_details": "In 2016 the government acknowledged that only 14% of English rivers are in good ecological condition.  Despite this they have not brought in measures to monitor how water companies and landowners are misusing our rivers and ,through the Environment Agency,  are not penalizing companies and landowners who routinely pollute our waterways. Last year 1.5m hours of raw sewage was pumped into English rivers posing a serious risk to human health as well as damaging the environment.",
        "background": "Water companies and landowners should be monitored by the Environment Agency and if they are found to be polluting rivers they should be penalised. There should be investment in the sewage system so that it operates more efficiently in extreme weather conditions.",
