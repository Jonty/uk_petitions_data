        "additional_details": "Most parents go back to work after a child turns 9 months old. So why is it that free childcare isn't provided until they turn 2? Even then why is help only provided for families on benefits, or children from disadvantaged backgrounds? The cost of nurserys are extremely high, and people who want to work full time are not able to. This is because the average salary would only just cover the cost of full time nursery fees, and possibly a few other bills. This must change. Help working families.",
        "background": "Children from the age of 2 get 15 hours free childcare if they are from a disadvantaged background, or if one or both parents are on benefits. More help is needed for single and joint parents who work full time but cant afford the extortionate costs of nursery fees.",
