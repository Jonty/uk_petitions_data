        "additional_details": "Year 10 and 12 students are missing at least \u00bc of their course for each subject, this figure will most likely be even higher depending on the amount of time we spend in lockdown. This will reduce our expected results by 2 grades. Year 11 and year 13 students didn't sit their exams in 2020. If we survived 2020 without exams, why should we have to go back? Students are pressured to do well in their exams, and with the fear of COVID-19 affecting their grades the aditional stress is just unnecesary.",
        "background": "Upon the return to school after COVID-19 lockdown restrictions are loosened, we believe that GCSEs and A-Levels for current year 10 and 12 students should be cancelled. We think this because year 10 and 12 students are at a strong disadvantage when it comes to examinations after having to homeschool",
