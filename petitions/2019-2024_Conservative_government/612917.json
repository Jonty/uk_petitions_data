        "additional_details": "150,000 British people have registered under the Homes for Ukraine scheme & 28,000 Ukrainian refugees have applied, yet only 2,700 visas have been granted and a fraction of those have arrived in the UK. This is in stark contrast to European countries where very many thousands have been welcomed since the outbreak of war. The visa system is grossly inadequate and harmful in its complexity and its huge delays. It is extremely embarrassing to British people, the vast majority of whom want to help.",
        "background": "The current visa application process required of refugees fleeing war in Ukraine is not fit for purpose and causing harm through its complexity, extreme delay and paucity of information to people who deserve our instant and unqualified protection. It is also damaging the UK's reputation.",
