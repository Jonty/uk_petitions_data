Your petition calls for mandatory subtitles, but it's not clear if you want these to be shown at all times, or just made available. Your petition also says this should apply to televised content, but also refers to YouTube, which is not necessarily transmitted by television.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
