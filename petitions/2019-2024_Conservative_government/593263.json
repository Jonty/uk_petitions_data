        "additional_details": "By creating this rule I feel a lot more cats will be reunited with their owners by either just a report of the cats description or the returning of the cat to the owner via a veterinary practice. Having been through this myself twice now I feel that it is always better to have them brought back to you even if the outcome has been poor. I feel people would much rather have the animals where about a known than worry for the rest of their life why the cat never came home",
        "background": "Similar to dogs I think it should be made a crime to hit a cat and drive away leaving the animal In considerable pain and suffering (one of the five freedoms) without offering it immediate veterinary care. Also the reunification process for owners should be done to to improve owner mental states.",
