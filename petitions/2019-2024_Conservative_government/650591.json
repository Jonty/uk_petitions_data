        "additional_details": "The North East Youth Alliance campaign #YouthStartsHere centres around shining the light on the sector & the work it does to enable young people to develop holistically so that they can find their voice, influence & place in society. Youth work is already saving the government \u00a33.2bn a year through improved education/employment outcomes AND positive impacts on mental health. It is also contributing \u00a35.7bn annually to the wider economy.With further investment, these benefits would be even higher.",
        "background": "The North East Youth Alliance wants the government to recognise the importance of the youth sector. Youth services have been cut by 73% since 2010 & annual spending has dropped by almost \u00a31 billion. We want more funding, more recognition for our vital work & more people to work within the sector",
