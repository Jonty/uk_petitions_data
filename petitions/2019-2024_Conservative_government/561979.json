Exercise classes are a way for people to switch off from normality and have time to get away from the outside world while getting healthier, fitter and improving mental health. I know not everyone does exercise but the number of people doing classes now has increased massively due to the help and improvement it has had on health both mentally and physically.",
        "background": "Indoor exercise classes have been on and off throughout this whole year. I know a lot of instructors who rely on their exercise classes for their only income, and so many people who rely on these classes for their mental health. If this year hasn\u2019t been hard enough, exercise has helped people a lot.",
