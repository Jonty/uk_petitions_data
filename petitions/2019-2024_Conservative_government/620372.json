In addition people in wheelchairs will then be able to go out as the pavements will be smooth. Also, a personal relative of mine in Wales tripped over the pavement, fell and broke her hip and ankle.",
        "background": "I want the Government and Parliament to fix all the roads with potholes and the pavements with cracks and that are uneven. This is because the pavements are not safe for people in wheelchairs, and prams etc. The roads are also not safe if there are potholes as this increases cyclist accidents.",
