        "action": "Refund or Compensate University Students for Learning Affected Due to Strikes",
        "additional_details": "University students often have to pay up to \u00a39,250 a year for tuition fees but do not receive their full course due to strike action. Strikes affected universities in November and December 2022 as well in the years before that and strikes are also planned for 2023 with students not getting any compensation but still being expected to pay back tuition loans  +interest. It is cruel that students have to bear the cost for this action whilst also trying to save money to start their own lives.",
        "background": "Although the use of tuition fees are a separate issue, the fact that students have to pay for a service they do not receive during industrial action is outrageous. The Government or Parliament should look into ways to refund students for the seminars and lectures that are affected when strikes occur",
