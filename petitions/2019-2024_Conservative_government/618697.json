They need to be recognised, and protected under all laws. Many MPs in the conservative party refuse to see nonbinary people as who they are, and I believe that is utterly unacceptable and disgusting. The LGBT+ community would like full support from every government, we want to be seen AND heard.",
        "background": "Many nonbinary people in the UK experience transphobia from all over the place, and although the whole community does, we are recognised within England unlike nonbinary people. I believe that nonbinary people should be recognised and protected under the Equality Act that YOU put in place. Recognise.",
