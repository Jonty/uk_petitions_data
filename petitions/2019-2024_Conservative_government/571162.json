        "additional_details": "If the government/parliament can make it unlawful to overcharge in the sale of dogs, and cap the price of a dog by law, it will therefore bring down the rise in crime we have seen. It will give owners of dogs the confidence to go out on walks again without the fear of being attacked like cases we have seen in the news. This needs to stop, thugs attacking poor people to steel their dogs due to the ridiculous re-sale price that they can achieve!",
        "background": "Through the last few weeks and months during the pandemic, the sale of dogs has gone though the roof. This not only encourages irresponsible breeding of dogs but also correlates with the increased rise in crime.",
