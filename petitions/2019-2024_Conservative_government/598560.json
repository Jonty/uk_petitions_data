        "additional_details": "It has been stated on the news that '102,000 pupils' were tested positive. Furthermore, \u00be of students won't be attending school in the winter. As it has been shown that despite having a (double jabbed) vaccine, students are able to catch covid as there's no covid restrictions to maximise the risk needed. students didn't sat their GCSEs in 2020, which creates a disadvantage for them. In conclusion, either way there would be disadvantages for either side. We as students don't believe the statement topics would be given as last year January, topics weren't told.",
        "background": "Exams should be cancelled because it isn't fair as some people aren't receiving the same education as other due to self isolation. As winter is coming close, students aged 15- 16 and 17-18 are likely to suffer from mental health due to health concerns and due to language barriers that parents have.",
