        "additional_details": "I would like the government to pay anyone who applies a Universal Basic Income at a rate of \u00a395.85 per week (same as Statutory Sick Pay starting 6th April). Payments should start as quickly as possible and be classed as income for tax & income-related benefit purposes. If the trial goes well then it could be expanded to replace all income-related benefits and eventually to all UK citizens instead of being stopped.",
        "background": "Start a trial of Universal Basic Income now and continue it until the end of the COVID-19 outbreak at least. It will be easier than dealing with the enormous amount of sickness claims that will be submitted.",
