When they get to the supermarkets, supplies are so low or non-existent that they are struggling to get what they need when they need it most. This has to stop. If we are in it together, then we must all be in it together. Everyone, for everyone, with everyone. https://mobile.twitter.com/BBCLookNorth/status/1240687667265843202",

Make this so that every supermarket can offer a consistent time whereby our most vulnerable citizens and most needed workers can get what they need when they need it most.",
