        "additional_details": "Clearly the problem has increased as more vehicles are fitted with them, which is why it is now a major problem. Drivers are constantly dazzled by these oncoming lights and often flash the drivers thinking they have their main beam on. Manufacturers will continue to fit these hazardous lights unless the government intervene. It is less of an issue in major cities as these areas are brightly lit anyway but this leaves urban and rural areas very vulnerable.",
        "background": "LED headlights are too bright for our roads. This is a constant topic of conversation and therefore is a real problem.",
