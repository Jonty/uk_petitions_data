        "additional_details": "Deduction of Earnings Orders is a controversial form of collection that takes money from a Non-Resident Parent\u2019s (NRP) earnings every month. The principle behind this is that a parent who is refusing to pay has an order to make the deductions. We call on the UK Government to understand the pressures this puts on NRP and replace it with an appeal process focusing on the affordability of payments.",
        "background": "The Government should abolish the process of a DEO's entirely and replace it with an appeal process focusing on the affordability of payments.",
