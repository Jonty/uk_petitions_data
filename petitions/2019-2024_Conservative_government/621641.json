The latest Government guidance on freeports states\r\n\r\n\"There is no deregulatory agenda in Freeports, our\u202fFreeport model ensures\u202fthat the UK\u2019s high standards with respect to\u202fsecurity, health and safety, workers\u2019 rights, data protection, biosecurity, tax avoidance and the environment\u202fwill not be compromised. Freeports \u2013 in the same way as every other business in the UK \u2013 will have to adhere to the UK\u2019s high regulatory standards.\" \r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/freeports\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.
