It will have a negative effect on their mental health.\r\nIf they were to repeat a year there wouldn't be the pressure to get them back into school too soon and risk another spike.\r\nThose children / teenagers who have worked so hard towards their SATS, GCSEs and A levels have missed out on taking their exams and achieving a grade they truely deserve.",
