        "additional_details": "Just like there are consumer laws to stop misleading advertisement of products in shops; the same should follow.\r\n\r\nThe government passed laws that allow universities to charge full fees even for a course completely online. This was obviously created as a loophole to stop any repayments. Students who will be in \u00a360k+ of debt aren't getting the courses they were promised. These are students who are going to bring the UK out of the recession in the years to come, help us to help you.",
        "background": "Most universities boasted of a \u2018blended\u2019 approach which leads you to believe that the online and in person content would be vaguely in similar proportion. \r\nOn arrival, students found they have hardly any or no in person lectures, seminars or tutorials. \r\nStudents have been mis sold degree courses.",
