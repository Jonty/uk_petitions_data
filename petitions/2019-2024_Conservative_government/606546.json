        "additional_details": "There are more and more people cycling on the pavement making it very dangerous for children and the aged. Many of the offenders work for fast food delivery companies and get paid on commission encouraging them to cycle at dangerous speeds. \r\nThere is a possibility of receiving a level 2 fine for this offence which is anything up to \u00a3500. Most of these cyclists are not insured so if there is an accident they would not be in a position to pay damages to their victim.\r\nIt is more than likely that the 1835 Highways act also applies to electric scooters, although it is not clear whether this has been tested in a court of law yet.",
        "background": "Cycling on \u201cany footpath or causeway by the side of any road made or set apart for the use or accommodation of foot passengers\u201d has been an offence since The Highways Act was passed in 1835. It is not currently being enforced. The government needs to find a way to enforce this law.",
