        "action": "Make eye coverings mandatory and ban all beards until we have a vaccine.",
        "additional_details": "We should all be required to wear eye coverings, as uncovered eyes still leave people extremely vulnerable to exposure. Beards should also be banned, as they compromise the effectiveness of face coverings. This may discriminate against certain religious groups, but facial autonomy and freedom to practise religion is a luxury we can't afford in the middle of a pandemic.\r\n\r\nSee CDC infographic for more info.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/FacialHairWmask11282017-508.pdf?source=techstories.org",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, believe that eye coverings should be mandatory in indoor public spaces, and all beards should be banned until a vaccine is made available for COVID-19. It is important that we control the spread of the novel coronavirus, and we can all do more to achieve this goal.",
