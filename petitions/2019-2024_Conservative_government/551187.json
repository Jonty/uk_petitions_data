        "additional_details": "Students have missed vital time to learn and will not be able to cover all the areas due to the pandemic and this gives students and teachers less time to prepare for this . This would be extremely challenging for them as they have missed 6 months of school and have such less time to prepare for their exams. Removing poetry would reduce the content students have to learn in such less time .",
        "background": "I would like the government and parliament to speak to the department of education about removing poetry as this would benefit gcse students",

With regard to the English Literature GCSE, Ofqual has proposed that students should only be assessed on 2 out of 3 possible areas of content: poetry, a 19th century novel, or fiction/drama from the British Isles from 1914: https://www.tes.com/news/gcse-english-2021-has-poetry-been-dropped.\r\n\r\nIt will therefore be for individual schools to decide whether poetry is to be taught as part of the English Literature GCSE.\r\n\r\nYou could start a petition calling for poetry to be permanently removed from the National Curriculum if this is something you would like to happen."
