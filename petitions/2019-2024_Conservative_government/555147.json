For example you automatically get grave deed ownership for a baby\u2019s burial at no cost in Liverpool but in Dorset you have to pay \u00a3600 to own the grave before you can add a headstone, this is unfair and adds to the distress adding unnecessary financial stress as parents want the opportunity to be able to do something for their baby in their memory",
