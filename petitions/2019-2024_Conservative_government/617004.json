This also makes decisions difficult, such as: \r\n-Whether or not a child has medical treatment. \r\n-Child\u2019s name change \r\n-Consent for a child go holiday etc. \r\nIt makes no sense having to ask an absent parent for permission whilst not in their lives & also dealing with stress, court costs & having to explain why we shouldn't need to get permission from the absentee",

This is to ensure the responsible parent is the one making big decisions for the welfare of their child/children & to prevent stress & potential mental health issues for the child/children.",

You can learn move about removing parental responsibility here:\r\nhttps://www.co-oplegalservices.co.uk/media-centre/articles-jan-apr-2017/how-to-remove-parental-responsibility/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling on the Government to change the amount of time a parent can be absent from a child's life before having their rights removed, if this is something you would like to see happen."
