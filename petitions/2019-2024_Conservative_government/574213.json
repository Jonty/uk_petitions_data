        "additional_details": "To move from a uni-polar to multi-polar financial world. Allowing nations globally including the UK to have freedom from the US Fed. The UK should be able to trade with other nations without some of that value being extracted to the US simply because of USD hegemony. Why should the US be the middle person in our transactions with other nations around the world?",
        "background": "The USD is still the world's reserve currency. It is a finance and trade union we are forced to be a part of. If a UK or EU company trades with a company from India, China, Australia or other country it has to do so in USD. We never voted for this. Should we not have a referendum on this next?",
