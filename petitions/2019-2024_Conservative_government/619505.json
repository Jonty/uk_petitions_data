        "additional_details": "More and more multinational companies headquartered in the UK, are locating their factories in countries with more lax environmental regulations, allowing them to pollute more heavily than they\u2019d be allowed here. \r\n\r\nClimate Change is a global problem, just because the polluting isn\u2019t happening in the UK, doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t do something to stop it. Our proposal is to develop a law to help prevent this issue, and to ensure businesses find less harmful ways to operate, instead of avoiding making changes by moving somewhere else. These companies must start facing consequences for their damaging actions.",
        "background": "A law imposing fines or tariffs on multinational companies which are headquartered in the UK, but who purposefully locate their polluting factories in lower income countries with weaker restrictions, thus allowing them to pollute over the UK\u2019s guidelines.",
