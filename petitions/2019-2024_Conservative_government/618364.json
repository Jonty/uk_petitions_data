As one of the UK's leading consumer rights campaigners, the most common complaint I am asked to help with is the inability to contact businesses.

We have already seen the Spanish Government introduce a similar law, which proves conclusively that it can be done",

Businesses should not be allowed to keep people on hold or create barriers to prevent people making complaints",
