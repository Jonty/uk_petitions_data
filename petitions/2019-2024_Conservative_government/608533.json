        "action": "Enable UK energy users to opt out of the proposed \u00a3200 'rebate' on energy bills.",
        "additional_details": "Because it is not right or fair to enforce all households to take a loan that will then affect future energy payment costs. This decision should be optional, based on whether the household wants to receive the proposed \u00a3200 rebate/discount. It should not be compulsory. If households wish to opt in to receive the rebate then that's fine, but forcing a nation to undertake a loan is beyond the remit of the Government.",
        "background": "UK users of gas and electricity should not be forced to receive the proposed \u00a3200 'discount' / 'rebate', which will then have to be paid back over time. It is effectively a loan and the Government should not force households to take a loan if they do not wish to do so. It should be optional.",
