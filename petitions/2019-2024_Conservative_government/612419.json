        "additional_details": "The early years sector in the United Kingdom is currently in crisis. After years of under funding and inadequate support from local authorities, providers are now struggling both operationally and financially. \r\n\r\nThe sector is struggling to recruit and retain staff, because of the low pay and minimum wage associated with the sector. It is struggling to give children the best start in life due to the lack of support from local authorities and families are struggling to afford rising fees.",
        "background": "As a minimum, Government needs to vastly increase the amount paid to providers in 15/30 hours and SEND funding. Support providers to better recruit and retain talent. Alongside, reforming the support structure provided by local authorities and review Ofsted - as a regulatory model and framework.",

The Government is not directly responsible for the pay of early years providers, or recruitment and retention in the sector, but we could accept a petition calling for increased public funding for early years providers. Your petition also calls for reform of local authorities and a review of Ofsted, but it's not clear what reforms you want, or what aspects of Ofsted you want to be reviewed.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
