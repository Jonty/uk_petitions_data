        "additional_details": "Currently shops are inflating the price of items such as toilet rolls, soaps, hand sanitizer etc, to such levels that it is adding to the anxiety and stress of households. Some shops have increased prices for a small pack to almost \u00a310. Others have seperated packets into single rolls to sell which is not only unhygienic but I would argue illegal.\r\nThis has to stop - the country should be working together. The government has provided grants for businesses and so this inflation cannot be allowed.",
        "background": "The government should enact rules to limit or prevent shops being allowed to raise the prices of essential items and medicines. The country understands that prices can fluctuate but it is apparent that a limit or ban is now needed to prevent shop owners using the pandemic for financial gain.",
