It is disgusting to think that these statistics can exist with no significant legislation in place to protect both men and women who experience sexual harassment on a daily basis. \r\nSexual harassment is a violation of basic human rights and can be incredibly detrimental to the victim\u2019s wellbeing.",
        "background": "Public sexual harassment is a problem which has been ignored by the government for too long. Many of us have suffered detrimental effects to our well-being as a result of harassment and feel endangered in public. We therefore ask the government to reconsider its legislation of sexual harassment.",
