        "additional_details": "There are two key reasons as well as many unlisted reasons in which this petition aims to introduce such a licence.\r\n\r\nThe first is the curb trolling and troll behaviour which is fast becoming a pandemic amongst social media platforms. \r\n\r\nThe second is to allow the relevant authorities to quickly locate those deemed in need of assistance whether it be domestic issues or mental health.\r\n\r\nFailing to do so will lead to a further increase in troll activity and many not receiving the support they need.",
        "background": "The petition aims to introduce a social media licence that must be required to use social media platforms. \r\n\r\nThe licence will aim to contain some basic user information that can only be retrieved from the relevant authorities in a case deemed as an emergency.",
