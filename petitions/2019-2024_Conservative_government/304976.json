Closing services that support and encourage healthy lifestyle choices is a poor decision as it will only add to the negative effect on health causing increased demand on emergency and GP services. Give people the choice rather than taking it away - so long as gyms are kept clean, and people follow PHE advice there is little impact to the spread of the virus.",
