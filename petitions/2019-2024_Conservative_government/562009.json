        "additional_details": "The protection of UK businesses during this time of crisis is paramount in minimising the impact of COVID-19 to the UK economy. \r\n\r\nIf shops & amenities are expected to remain open without contributing to the spread of COVID-19, effective preventative measures need to be installed and maintained.\r\n\r\nThe provision of a government grant, solely for the use of COVID-19 prevention will ensure that every business can afford to remain open whilst protecting employees and customers.",

We believe that a grant from the UK government would assist companies with funding effective COVID-19 prevention measures.",
