So much so that the vast majority will act to avoid this rate. This is dragging liquidity away from the market and therefore adversely affecting everyone in the country.",
        "background": "The effective income tax rate for earnings of \u00a3100,000 - \u00a3125,000 is 60%, as the tax free allowance drops away. So the tax rate goes from 40% for earnings under \u00a3100,000, up to 60%, and then back down to 40% for earnings between \u00a3125,000 and \u00a3150,000.",
