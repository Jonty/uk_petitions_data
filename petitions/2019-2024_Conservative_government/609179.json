        "action": "Abolish domestic COVID-status certification in the United Kingdom",
        "additional_details": "COVID-status certification is one of the most contentious issues Britain has faced since Brexit.\r\n\r\nSerious legal & ethical issues remain if it were continued for voluntary use, especially with regard to the Human Rights Act (1998), Equalities Act (2010) & Public Health Act (1984).\r\n\r\nAs cases, hospitalisation, and mortality rates continue to plummet. Covid certification is no longer a necessary or useful tool for public health surveillance & must be expunged from our society never to return.",
        "background": "We want the Government to abolish all domestic COVID-status certification remaining in use.\r\n\r\nDue to high vaccination & booster uptake, continued relaxation of restrictions, and fast approaching endemicity of coronavirus, it is neither right nor proportionate to continue such measures in Britain.",
