There is no reason to keep them as they already been identified/sentenced. In the light of cost of living crisis and prison capacities there would be logistical act to remove them from UK. I believe they are no longer risk to the public. In case anyone decides to comeback illegally, strict penalties should be implemented. \r\nDecision to build new prisons instead is wrong",

Foreign national prisoners are held by tax payers and these who want or will be deported should be processed earlier by 24 mths to there half way pnt",
