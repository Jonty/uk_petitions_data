        "additional_details": "During the 1st lockdown in march 2019 non-essential shops were closed. In that time it was impossible for many people to care for their hair, some products were unavailable online while some were tripling the prices. Please acknowledge our hair is unique and needs different/particular products and essential oils to stay nurtured. Not being able to care for our hair affects mental health as well as damage/breakage. If Black Lives Matter our hair care should too.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to acknowledge that Black/Afro Caribbean hair shops are very essential and should be able to open and run in a Covid-19 safe manner during the lockdown. Black/bi-racial hair is unique to many hair types, which means we have to care for it in a particular way.",
