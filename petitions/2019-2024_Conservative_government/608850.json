        "additional_details": "Income inequality is further established by taxing low-income earners harder than the wealthier. For example, by raising the National Insurance tax as a way of recovering from the Covid-19 led financial crisis. The majority of the population spends half their income on living arrangements and taxes, making it a challenge to save and own property. By raising the net wealth tax for the top 1% of the wealthiest households in the UK, the government will raise revenue and decrease the income gap.",
