        "additional_details": "I am a mother of 2 mixed children who have experienced racism 1st hand. To have to still protect your children from racism in 2020 is unacceptable. A lot of it is down to ignorance. We can not let this continue. We live in a world right now that parents who were not educated or were lead to believe that it's right to judge someone for the colour of their skin are continuing to teach this to their children. This then continues into the next generation and so on. Please let us educate !!",
        "background": "I feel strongly that all younger school children should be taught Black History as part of the Curriculum. In my Sons Primary school in Scotland at the moment they are taught nothing on race.\u00a0In my daughters High School it is only taught if the school choose it as part of History.",
