        "additional_details": "The reason why I want the Government to keep schools shut until Covid 19 has finally gone and cleared up. This is because i found an article that states that Boris Johnson wants teachers and students to get tested for Covid 19 even if they don't have any symptoms. I am a school student myself im 15 years old. I'm about to go into year 11. For my final year in school. By letting students go back into school in September i still don't think it is safe for us to go back. Not until Covid 19 has gone",
        "background": "Keep schools shut for September as the pandemic is still happening. Until things have finally cleared up and it's all safe",
