        "additional_details": "Without structural change ( establishment of BBC News and Current Affairs as a distinct unit with defined and ring-fenced resources) management and cultural change will be unlikely to bring about improved impartiality. Excellent wildlife and dance programmes, high profile representations of diversity in the BBC are rightly highly valued, however they are distinct from the objective of improving the impartiality of BBC News and the editorial decisions it displays.",
        "background": "The Ofcom News Consumption Survey 2019, found a smaller proportion of BBC TV news viewers, consider it to be impartial than viewers of ITV, Channel 4 or Sky News.  To enable management and real cultural change to address this, structural change is proposed.",
