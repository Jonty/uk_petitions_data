        "additional_details": "Review if it is suitable for an instructor to pass a learner driver and enforce limits similar to the current style for learner bike riders. Allowing a new driver to drive a vehicle of equivalent bhp or certain class, for a given number of years before full license approval. It will take pressure away from current services, allow those who want a 'full' power vehicles to proceed through current test procedures. E.g can drive normal roads but restricted to 50mph and cannot drive on motorways.",
