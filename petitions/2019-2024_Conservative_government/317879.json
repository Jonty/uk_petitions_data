        "additional_details": "An unprecedented situation requires measures that address more than its symptoms.\r\nOur politicians have been unprepared, confused and slow with a coherent strategy.\r\nThe risks are global and complex, as well as local and varied and demand a different political paradigm.\r\nAn evidence based approach to policy has been lacking. \r\nCollaboration, inclusion, imagination and creativity are key to change & security \u2013 locally and globally.\r\nWe cannot return to a UK of inequalities; an NHS valued only for its potential as a monetised private concern, nor to a place where political dogma paralyses vital decisions and where it is acceptable to consider how best to profit from the pandemic.",
        "background": "Create a UK National Government \u2013 non-partisan & drawn from the best across the political spectrum with a focus on what is best for the people, the country and our children\u2019s future.  We\u2019ve done it before. We can do it again. It will work again. Our response now will resonate for future generations.",
