The government has been mired in its own problems and seems to have lost sight of the real priorities. At the moment the best we can hope for is a temporary tinkering that may or may not address some of the many serious issues.\r\nThe current administration has lost its mandate, What is needed now is for a General Election to re-shape government, whichever party is successful.",
