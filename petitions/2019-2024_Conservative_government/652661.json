It disproportionately affects women and young people, and creates single parent families. 65% of respondents to a survey conducted by Reunite Families UK said their child received a diagnosis of a mental health condition. Family life must be protected",

We must protect family life and family values. We ask that Parliament do not increase the figure to this unjustifiable amount.",
