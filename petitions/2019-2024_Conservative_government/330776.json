        "additional_details": "NHS staff are on our frontline and shouldn\u2019t be expected to pay to come to work to save patients lives. ALL NHS staff are valuable yet underpaid, this pandemic proved this. They can\u2019t afford parking let alone parking fines. Most NHS staff are struggling to make ends meet, they work long hours and put themselves and their families at risk of CV19. Why should they pay to do this? Clapping NHS staff is not enough.",
        "background": "Free parking permits given to all NHS staff. During CV19 staff parked for free. Staff are now being issued with parking fines. Stop all parking fines for the rest of 2020 and pay back fines already paid and cancel all tickets issued.",
