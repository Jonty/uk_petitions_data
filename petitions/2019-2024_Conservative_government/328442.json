        "additional_details": "I would like to see that all parking charges are dropped for all NHS workers, as I stated above it\u2019s around \u00a325 a month, which doesn\u2019t sound like a lot but when the workers are doing 12-13 hour shifts and helping so many people out I think that it is disgusting that they have to pay to park. This parking charge is automatically deducted from their wages each month as well as the fee for being registered to work for the NHS. This means that each year the workers are deducted around \u00a3550 a year.",
        "background": "Help provide free parking at hospitals for all NHS staff. I think that it is wrong when they are helping so many people that they have to pay to park at work, especially when they are working in the current Covid-19 situation. This \u00a325 could go along way to helping pay for important home items.",
