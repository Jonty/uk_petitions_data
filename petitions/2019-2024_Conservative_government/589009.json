        "action": "Make both separated parents equally responsible for childcare costs.",
        "additional_details": "Make it a legal obligation for both parents to share any childcare costs associated with enabling both parents to work. This ensures that both parents have equal opportunity to work, achieve financial security and a career and the resident parent is not unfairly discriminated against. Women are disproportionately affected by this situation since usually the resident parent is the mother of the children. Commonly the other parent refuses to pay and this further adds to the barriers women face.",
        "background": "At present when parents are separated there is no legal obligation for the non resident parent to pay childcare costs which means the resident parent is likely to remain on benefits or in a part time, poorly paid job with expensive childcare bills. Thus thrusting them into poverty with no prospects.",
