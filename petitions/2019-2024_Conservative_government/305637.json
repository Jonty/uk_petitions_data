Workers are being put at risk by public disregard, and as such government action should take place. Business owners are also unable to claim against insurance policies to support their full closure unless adequate action is taken by government.\r\n\r\nWe need to protect our businesses and the public safety by shutting pubs/bars etc. officially.",
