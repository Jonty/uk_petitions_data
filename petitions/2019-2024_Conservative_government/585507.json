        "additional_details": "Brexit was triggered by only 1/3 of the UK voting population. This should not have been binding (in fact it was 'advisory' but somehow got enacted nevertheless) . For referendums to be binding there should be a significant majority - either 2/3rds of those who actually vote or more than half of the total electorate.",
        "background": "The PM is afraid that a referendum for Scotland would show a slight majority for independence. By making referendums binding as proposed the PM will avoid the break-up of the Union (unless it gets the 2/3rds or the 1/2) but can still allow a new referendum.",
