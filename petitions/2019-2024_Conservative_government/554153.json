        "additional_details": "I think that postponing exams is not as helpful since we\u2019ve missed a lot more than 3 weeks - many students have not been contacted by the teachers throughout lockdown. Cancelling them completely could lead to similar complications as last year, whereas reducing the content seems like a fair way to do it.",
        "background": "Reduce the curriculum and announce what could be taken out of the courses - it\u2019s unfair how much we\u2019ve missed, often with no contact from schools, but having to do the whole course in reduced time.",
