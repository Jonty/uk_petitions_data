        "additional_details": "The UK government needs to support Taiwan\u2019s appeal for WHO participation. Not being a WHO member means Taiwan is not informed of the latest outbreak information. This puts both Taiwan's 24m people and the world at risk when information is not exchanged with speed and accuracy through the WHO\u2019s channels. It is also an infringement of Taiwan\u2019s health rights. Second, Taiwan would be a tremendous contributor to the international health community including the UK.",
        "background": "Taiwan has been left out of talks with the WHO, because of political pressure from China. Despite Taiwan's close proximity to countries with Covid-19, Taiwan has done exceptionally well in managing the outbreak. The UK and many countries can learn from Taiwan's experience.",
