The spending on the Queen's Jubilee is a one-off investment, so could not be used to fund a long-term pay increase. It could be used to provide a bonus to NHS staff, but there are over 1,000,000 NHS employees, so this would only amount to around \u00a328 per member of staff.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petitions, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nDo NOT spend \u00a328 million on the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/577830\r\n\r\nPlease give the NHS Covid Heroes a bigger pay rise.\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/577970\r\n\r\nRecognise all members of NHS nursing profession by giving them a 12.5% pay rise\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/560253\r\n\r\nGive NHS Covid heroes a minimum 5% pay rise\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/578004"
