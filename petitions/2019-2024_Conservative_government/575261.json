As someone with an autistic sister, I would like to have faith that the NHS are not ordering a Do Not Resuscitate order to patients unnecessarily. Both the carers and patients should be aware of any medical decisions being made. Statistics show that 6 out of 10 COVID deaths are of those with a learning disability. The government needs to reassess their approach to treating patients with learning disabilities.",
        "background": "Stop the NHS from giving Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation notices to COVID patients with learning disabilities. Hospitals that have adapted this approach should be investigated, as many of these deaths have been unavoidable and orders have been made without relatives knowledge/consent.",
