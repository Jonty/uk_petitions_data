        "action": "Abandon Channel4 privatisation. Industry opposes it, it makes no economic sense.",
        "additional_details": "The Indie TV production sector has existed in the UK since the 1950s but has only became the powerful national and international economic force it now is since the founding of Channel 4 in the 1980s. The government has a duty not to damage a sector it has nurtured and to maintain the ecology of UK broadcasting it has engineered. Channel 4 helps Britain create distinctive home grown and internationally successful programming that reflects our diverse domestic creativity and offers it the world.",
        "background": "In the light of the negative industry response to Channel 4's proposed privatisation and the channel's unique public service remit, a detailed economic case for this action must be presented and consultation responses that might back the proposal published in detail before foolhardy action is taken.",
