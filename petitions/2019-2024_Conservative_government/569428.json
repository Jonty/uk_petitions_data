        "additional_details": "If the government would extend theory tests that expire in 2021 by 6 months to a year, this would give learners the opportunity to, hopefully take and pass their test.\r\n\r\nIt is no ones fault that students can't take their test and it is unfair to force learners to retake their theory if they miss out this year.",
        "background": "Due to the Corona Virus Pandemic, learners who have booked their tests, and then they have been rearranged or cancelled may miss out due to their theory expiring.",
