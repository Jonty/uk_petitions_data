        "additional_details": "People are facing unprecedented and unforeseeable circumstances.\r\nAfter the Treasury (funded by the tax payer) bailed out the banks in 2008, now it's the time for the banks to pay it back.\r\nSuch action will immediately translate into a lower cost for mortgage holders and ensure that the BoE action DOES trickle down to the people. \r\nThis will hardly effect the banks bottom line, because their borrowing cost has also been cut by the same percentage.",
        "background": "The government should mandate that Banks and Building societies, (who just received an interest cut from the Bank of England) pass such a cut to all of their mortgage holders, regardless of the type of mortgage they hold. Unless this is done, only the banks will benefit from the BoE actions.",
