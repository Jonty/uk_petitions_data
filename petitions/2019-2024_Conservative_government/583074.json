        "additional_details": "The company in Japan has been waiting for me since last year March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic I was unable to travel. However, when Japan briefly opened their borders for foreigner workers and students, I was able to apply for a working visa. Due to the new variant Japan closed its borders and went under another State of Emergency,  causing many disruptions to people like me in the UK and around the world not able to start work. We are willing to comply to quarantine procedures.",
