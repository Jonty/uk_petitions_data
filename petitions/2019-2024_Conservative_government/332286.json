        "action": "Reverse the decision to exclude Nursing staff from the public sector pay rise",
        "additional_details": "Mr Sunak MUST reverse his decision regarding the exclusion of Nursing staff from the salary increase as the 2018 agreed wage increase did not account for the emotional and physical distress that this pandemic has caused them. \r\nExcluding the backbone of our NHS from the salary increase is a deplorable decision and they should be rewarded for the extremely hard work that they have done. They have suffered from pay freezes, short staffing issues, extreme stress and lack of investment for so long.",
        "background": "Rishi Sunak announced today that Public sector workers are to receive a wage increase backdated due to the exceptional work that they have all carried out during the Covid-19 pandemic however, Nursing staff are to be excluded from this due to an pre-agreed pay increase structure from 2018.",
