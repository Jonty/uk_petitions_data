        "action": "Rethink the proposed obesity strategy to be less stigmatising and more inclusive",
        "additional_details": "1. To put calorie labels on food in restaurants is restrictive and damaging. While helpful for some, calorie counting can be greatly harmful for those who suffer with eating disorders and/or disordered eating. 1.25 million people are cited to suffer from eating disorders in the UK (Beat).\r\n2. Reducing deals on certain foods deemed unhealthy could be helpful, however, this needs to be paired with lowered prices for healthy food and support for lower-income households to access healthy options.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson\u2019s proposed initiatives to tackle obesity in the UK are short-sighted. The strategy lacks helpful initiatives to encourage healthy eating and exercise habits, and enforces a restrictive diet culture that stigmatises fat people, poor communities, and those with mental health disorders.",
