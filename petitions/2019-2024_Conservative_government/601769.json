If you have specific concerns about the behaviour policy at a particular school, you could contact them to express your concerns.\r\n\r\nYou could also raise any such concern with a particular school's behaviour policy with a local councillor who represents you. You can find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them, by entering your post code here:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors.\r\n\r\nYou could have a petition calling for the Government to commission a review of how bullying is addressed in schools in England, if that is something you'd like to see happen."
