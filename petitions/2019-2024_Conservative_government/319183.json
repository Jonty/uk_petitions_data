        "additional_details": "The President of the Family Court issued guidance on how child arrangements orders should be complied with during lockdown.  It says a parent may exercise parental rights and stop a child from seeing the other parent.  This guidance can be interpreted as a green light for  one parent to alienate the other parent from the child\u2019s life and face little prospect of legal consequence if they claim they are acting on genuine health concerns.  It is also silent on how to deal with parents shielding.",
        "background": "We would like the Family Court to clarify its guidance on non-compliance with child arrangement orders during Covid-19.  This would prevent the guidance being used cynically by one parent as justification for stopping the child seeing their other parent.",
