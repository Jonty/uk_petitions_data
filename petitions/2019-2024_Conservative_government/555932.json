Which is unacceptable and in 2020 to think that children still go hungry in the UK is outrageous and action needs to be taken. Mps have also received a pay raise of 3% taking there starting salary to \u00a383,000. Which during these uncertain times is disgraceful.",
        "background": "That money instead of going to people who have already received a 3% increase in pay, while others have lost their job and struggle to find work during the uncertain times of COVID-19. Can go to schools who can make sure that no child at school goes hungry.",
