        "additional_details": "Currently a log burner is being used, not eco friendly not good for the environment, but the storage heaters lose all their heat and blow all day running up fuel costs we can't afford due to heat loss, so we don't run them. It's the environment or we get cold. We need new Windows now, not just for home owners for long term tenants.",
        "background": "The Green Energy bill was too difficult to negotiate, our landlords are property rich and cash poor, we don't want to move after 21 years, but we would like double glazing as it is an old property, no point in offering storage heaters and loft when heat is lost through windows.",
