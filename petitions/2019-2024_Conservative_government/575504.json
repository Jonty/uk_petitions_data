        "additional_details": "Current tuition fees for studying healthcare related professions within the United Kingdom are extortionate and completely unsustainable. Our National Health Service is in a perpetual staffing crisis. Tuition fees alone cost in excess of \u00a350,000, not incorporating the cost of working >40 hours per week in labour. There are little incentives to study these subjects. The educational system needs complete reform effectively immediately. This is in the interest of benefitting the health of the UK.",
