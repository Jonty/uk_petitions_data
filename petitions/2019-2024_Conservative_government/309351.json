        "additional_details": "During this pandemic we are already stressed and depressed being at home. Majority are home with most members of the family at home which means less focus, WiFi might be slow etc. Also, work cannot be done do the best ability as we lack the resources (library, books) to get us a higher grade. It\u2019s a long process to be getting in contact with lecturers to then wait for their reply and if you have more questions after you\u2019ll have to email again and then wait for a response. Due to the strikes we already lost out on some sessions so it\u2019s hard to understand the assignment briefs or process of the exams etc. This pandemic is already stressful for us so it\u2019s not fair that we have to be the only students in education to still carry on with assignments and exams.",
        "background": "Make universities cancel all assignments and exams even if they are online. Just like it was done for A level exams and GCSEs it should be the same for uni students.",
