        "additional_details": "Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said local authorities in England will be able to raise council tax by 5%, with 3% used to top-up adult social care budgets. \"It is absurd that during the deepest recession in 300 years, at the very time millions are worried about the future of their jobs and how they will make ends meet, Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are forcing local government to hike up council tax. \"The prime minister said he would do 'whatever is necessary' to support local authorities in providing vital services - he needs to make good on that promise.\" The British people urge Boris Johnson to \"give families the security they need\" by dropping this new tax increase from April this year.",
        "background": "\"Absurd\" council tax rises due in April 2021 should be scrapped to ease the pressure on family budgets during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
