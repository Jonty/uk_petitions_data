        "additional_details": "In 1932, the Moscow-based Soviet government organised a mass famine among its peasant population, during which time Stalin specifically targeted Ukraine to suppress its resistance and culture.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1933, at least 4 million Ukrainians starved to death. \r\n\r\nThe UK is host to 170,000+ Ukrainian refugees and is Ukraine's ally against russia's 2022 invasion. By recognising Holodomor as an act of genocide, the UK can strengthen its position in holding russia accountable for its war crimes.",
        "background": "The UK should condemn the historical killing of over 4 million Ukrainians by Moscow and officially recognise Holodomor as an act genocide under the Genocide Convention (CPPCG). This has already been done by 20+ countries in Europe, Oceania and the Americas.",
