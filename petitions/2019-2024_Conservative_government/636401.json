        "additional_details": "Putting live golf coverage behind a paywall means that the sport is being lost to those that cannot afford to pay for a subscription. While it also fails to capitalise on the huge numbers of people who enjoy the game.\r\n\r\nMartin Slumbers, the Chief Exec of the R&A, recently stated that 10.2 million people played golf each year in the UK. The loss of live coverage of these Majors and even lack of highlights on free-to-air telelvions, and the inspiration that it gave to those that watched, means that golf will forever lose generations of future stars.",
        "background": "For years golf fans have enjoyed watching The Masters on terrestrial TV - for the first time in 2022 there is no live coverage and not even highlights of The Masters on free-to-air television. The Masters should be classed as Category A or at least a Category B sporting event.",
