        "additional_details": "Following the Cancellation of Exams, Students have been met with confusion and teachers had reduced the workload given that exams were 'cancelled' as announced on national television. Now more recently in Ofqual's consultation, it has been announced exam board set 'mini-exams' may take place, despite students learning from home and being away from school for an extended period of time because of the national lockdown. This alongside the unpreparedness of students, leaves some disadvantaged.",
        "background": "Instead of the currently proposed 'mini-exams' being used to collect data for the upcoming Summer 2021 exam series, teacher-assessed grades should be used without application of an algorithm.",
