So that people can still obtain protection if they so wish, in the same way annual flu jabs and other inoculations for overseas travel are available. \r\n\r\nAt present the Covid vaccination is only available on the NHS at the JVCI's recommendation. Covid immunity wanes over time, so let people decide for themselves if they are willing to pay for a booster.",

Make the jabs available at cost in the same way people can sign up for a seasonal flu jab. Let people have the choice.",
