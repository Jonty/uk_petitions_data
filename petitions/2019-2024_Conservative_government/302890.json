Although children are unaffected, they are viral vectors in school for the spread to the elderly such as grandparents. These elderly and immunocompromised peoples lives should not be put at risk for the sake of herd immunity. It is simply unfair. We should be protecting and preventing every person possible. The public should have a say in major national emergency issues.",

However, now is not the time for experiments, but to take action as there is possibility of COVID-19 mutating. Many lives will be put at risk with inaction. The WHO advice should be followed of testing every single case",
