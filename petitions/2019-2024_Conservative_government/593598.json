        "additional_details": "I believe if the cost of these drinks is reduced then it will also reduce the amount of people that may drink and drive (just 1 or 2 can be too many). It could also help with long term issues related to drinking like liver damage.",
        "background": "Lower the price or cap the price of alcohol free lager and wine, at the moment it's cheaper to drink alcohol when out. Even a pint of coke is overpriced and so there is no incentive for people to drink alcohol free when out, which could affect drink drive numbers and possibly even save lives.",
