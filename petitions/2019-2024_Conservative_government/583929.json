The history of these clubs are engrained into British society and we can not risk them being tarnished at the hands of greedy investors. We want to preserve these clubs by returning the decision-making power to the fans; such action will not only reduce the risk of such an ill-informed idea resurfacing, but will ensure that our clubs remain both community-driven and fan-focussed.",
        "background": "We want the Government to introduce legislation providing fans with the majority of voting rights at their football clubs and, in turn, reduce the excessive individual power held by the clubs' current owners.",
