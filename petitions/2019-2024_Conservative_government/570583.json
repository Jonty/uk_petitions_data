        "action": "Require employers to grant furlough to support parents during school closures",
        "additional_details": "Data gathered by the TUC suggests that over 70% of working mothers that had requested furlough following school closures have had it refused. Many parents are therefore being forced to make the impossible decision of choosing between having an income or being able to care for their children and offer them an education. In most instances women typically take responsibility for the majority of childcare and will therefore be disproportionately impacted by the lack of support from employers.",
        "background": "Create a legally binding provision in the Job Retention Scheme giving employees the right to apply for furlough for homeschooling purposes during school closures which must be reasonably granted. Specific and legitimate circumstance under which this may be refused by an employer must be made clear.",
