        "additional_details": "This is because it is illegal under international law to make someone stateless. So the government can only strip ethnic minorities of British citizenship even if they were born here by claiming they can go back to their parents' or grandparents' homeland.\r\nThe UK government has clearly not learned the lessons of Windrush. This is the worst type of racist law-making and mustn\u2019t be allowed to exist, let alone to happen without the right of appeal or in secret where the government can\u2019t be challenged.",
        "background": "The British Government has recently and quietly made changes to the \u2018Nationality and Borders\u2019 bill.\r\nThrough clause 9 they are allowing themselves to deprive you of citizenship in secret and without appeal but only if you are from a minority ethnic background. It is literally racist law-making.",
