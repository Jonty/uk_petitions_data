        "action": "Make it illegal for someone over 19 to have sex with someone under the age of 18",
        "additional_details": "Currently under UK age of consent law, a sixty-one year old can have sex with a sixteen year old and that is considered fine in the eyes of the law. I believe that this is disgusting, exploitative and disgraceful. I do not see how a 16 year old is simultaneously considered to be too young to participate in the democratic process but is considered to be old enough to be able to give consent to have sex with someone four times their age. I call on the Government to close this vile gap in the law.",
        "background": "I wish for the Government to consider changing age of consent law so that someone over the age of nineteen cannot have sexual intercourse of perform any kind of sexual act with someone under the age of eighteen.",
