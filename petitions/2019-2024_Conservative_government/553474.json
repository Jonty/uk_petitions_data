To claim that these jobs are unviable because they were refused financial support whilst being told it is illegal to operate is a step too far. Rishi Sunak is responsible for deciding not to support these industries. In doing so he has made the U.K. the worst performing in Europe and the G7, highlighting his incompetence. Time to retrain?",

Rishi Sunak has purposefully denied certain industries any support whilst removing their rights to work due to local and national lockdowns, in doing so breaching their rights.",
