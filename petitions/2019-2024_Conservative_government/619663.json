        "additional_details": "While this Act has been repealed by the current Government, it has not yet taken effect. Following the resignations today (05/07/22), it is clear to the British public that the Conservative government is floundering and an election needs to be called. With the cost of living crisis, botched \"Brexit\", and now sexual assault allegations within the Party, it is clear that this Government is not fit for purpose and a Vote of No Confidence needs to be held within Parliament.",
        "background": "Calling a motion of no confidence is one of two ways that an early general election can be triggered, under the terms of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. This was the first time a no confidence vote had been called since the passing of the Act.",
