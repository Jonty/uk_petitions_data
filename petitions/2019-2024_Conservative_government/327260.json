        "additional_details": "The 'leak' of information about the scrapping of the two-year inquiry into a reformation of the Gender Recognition Act has shown dangerous ideals that could become reality within the Tory government.\r\nTo put it bluntly, this could KILL people, and encourage violence against trans women more than the current statistics - which rose 37% since 2018.\r\nAnother big issue is the suggested \"crackdown\" on 'quacks' - a dangerous proposition that they will make private trans healthcare less accessible.",
        "background": "Do not ignore the facts and data that over 70% of poll takers were in favor of the reformation of the Gender Recognition Act. To also blame the poll as being \"hijacked\" by trans rights groups is also disingenuous. Introducing a bathroom bill will actively kill & harm ALL women.",
