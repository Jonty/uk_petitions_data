When Chester is an outdoor attration and the risk to people is massively reduced when outdoors. \r\n\r\nIt is a huge double standard by the government when they allow garden centres to open & allow mass gathering where people protest about incidents in other countries, but order the zoo to stay closed putting animals and jobs at risk.\r\n\r\n97% of the zoo's revenue comes from the public visiting the zoo if they stay closed that money will have to come from somewhere else. Will the Government pay? I doubt it, it is up to us to take action NOW.\r\nPLEASE SIGN THIS PETTITION\r\nSAVE CHESTER ZOO",
