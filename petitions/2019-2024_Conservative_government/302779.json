        "action": "Take sanctions against nations with cruel animal welfare & wet meat markets.",
        "additional_details": "The coronavirus and SARS outbreak have two things in common:both most likely started in wet markets. Those wet markets put people, lives and dead animals such as dogs, chickens, pigs, snakes, civets, and more, in constant close contact. That makes it easy for zoonotic diseases to jump from animals to humans. By improving animal welfare can improve bio-scrutiny & prevent further fatal viruses affecting citizens.Recent meat & dairy centered viruses include  Corvid-19,EColi,BSE,Swine Flue,SAR-CoV",
        "background": "We the undersigned call on our government to initiate financial sanctions against businesses & nations  who continue to trade in wild animal meats, wet meat markets and participate in demonstrably cruel livestock practices, both nationally and internationally.",
