Whether that be Jesus, The Prophet Muhammad, Moses, Raam, Guru Nanak, Buddha or any other figure. \r\n\r\nWe all commemorate our historical leaders and face emotional harm when 'hateful attacks' are launched against them. \r\n\r\nWe should all have equal protection on the grounds of emotional harm caused by such attacks, to protect peace and civil order.",
        "background": "The proposed Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill provides stricter sentences (up to 10 years in prison) for those who damage statues on the grounds of them being \"commemorative\" and such attacks cause emotional harm to communities.",
