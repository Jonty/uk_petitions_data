        "additional_details": "With the cost of living increasing, the nations youth are finding it more expensive to travel around the country. This is increasing reliance on parents/carers to provide the funds for their public transport, or to take the children themselves, causing increased levels of pollution, traffic, and road deterioration. If under 19's were granted free public transport, roads would become clearer, the air cleaner - reducing the risk of respiratory illness, and money would be saved on road repairs.",
        "background": "We want to provide all under 19's in full-time education with free public transport across the nation.",
