        "additional_details": "Many UK Universities have and will remain closed for face-to-face learning. The ongoing stress of performing visual learning is not something that students opted to pay for. We feel a partial refund should be in place to compensate for this distress.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, many students face the predicament whereby necessary student accommodation is being paid for in hope to return to on-campus learning. Many students are worse off due to paying for this inaccessible accommodation and further financial support is therefore vital.",
