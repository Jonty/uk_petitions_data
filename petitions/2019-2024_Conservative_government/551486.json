        "additional_details": "School uniform is restricting, uncomfortable, expensive and stops students from being able to express themselves as individuals. It should not be someone else's choice what students wear on a daily basis. Students should have a right to a choice and a say. School uniforms send the message that we do not have our own identity and that we aren't allowed to make choices for ourselves. In many other countries school uniform is not worn and this has no detrimental impact on learning or behaviour.",
