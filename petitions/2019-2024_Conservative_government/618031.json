You call for an appointment and have to wait a week for a triage ( on the phone ) and then another week or so to get an appointment. Too many GPs are refusing to treat patients and if they don\u2019t want to see patients then why be a GP? Absolutely disgusting and the government need to make GPs open fully again before people get seriously sick!",

The whole world is back to normal but GPs still refuse to see patients and tell them to go to a walk in or A&E.",
