        "additional_details": "People working in supermarkets are at high risk of contracting the COVID-19 coronavirus as they have to come into close contact with hundreds of members of the public on a daily basis. Often the customers they deal with are upset (especially with stock limitations and item restrictions) and will shout at staff in a way that's bound to spread germs. Providing equipment for these key workers will help the government in reducing the spread of the virus.",
