        "additional_details": "The process is too slow, and so much time and money wasted when buyers (especially) pull out. If a deposit is paid which is binding, it will encourage buyers to be more serious and ensure they are able to proceed. In Scotland buyers are committed once an offer is accepted. The process in Australia and America is so much better. Family and friends are aghast at our system here which takes many months, even years sometimes. Such a waste of time and money, not to mention the stress. Please change!",
        "background": "Change the system to a binding situation with a deposit on offer acceptance and a set completion date. Make it too difficult for someone to pull out like they can right now. Seller to provide searches. Many other countries have it right being able to move in less than 6 weeks. No more gazumping pls!",
