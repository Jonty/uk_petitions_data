        "action": "Change the EIM23151 Car Benefit: Double Cab Pickups back to Previous BIK Rules",
        "additional_details": "The introduction of this change will have far-reaching economic impact on several industries that depend on the buoyancy of the pick-up market. \r\nPickup trucks are a vital tool for the service industry, transporting workers and their tools to job sites across the construction, telecoms, local authority, utilities and hundreds more fields. It is essential that the workers who drive these utility vehicles should not be penalised in the same way as the drivers of luxury\u00a0company\u00a0cars.",
        "background": "From 1 July 2024, Double Cab pickups will be re-classified as cars for the purpose of Benefit In Kind (BIK). We want the UK government and HMRC to reconsider the implementation of EIM23151. We believe that there will be economic consequences that far outweigh any benefits.",
