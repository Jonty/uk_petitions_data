It's time we took action not just as individuals but as part of the larger community of responsible pet owners.",
        "background": "I have witnessed the recent implementation of the XL bully ban. This has made it clear to me, and many others in the dog community, that we need a system in place to manage and regulate dog breeding and ownership. One such solution is reinstating a mandatory dog licence for breeders and owners.",
