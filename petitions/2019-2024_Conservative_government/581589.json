        "additional_details": "A life cut short, a future obliterated, a family devastated. Sentencing can help those left behind to feel that justice has been done. We ask to reinstate the Death by Dangerous Driving (Sentencing) Bill and to allow progression through Parliament. This will enable Judges to have greater scope and enable them to issue more severe sentences than is currently possible. Dangerous driving costs lives. \r\nIncrease the maximum penalty for causing death by dangerous driving to life imprisonment.",
        "background": "We ask to increase the maximum penalty for causing death by dangerous driving to life imprisonment. The severity of the offence is not always reflected in current sentencing, because of the limitations on the sentence that currently exist. This will ensure justice for victims and their families.",
