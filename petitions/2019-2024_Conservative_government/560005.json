We haven't seen him in 5 months which is very unusual as I have lived next door to him my whole life. If this were normal times, every one of my family members would have been to visit him to hold onto the precious moments that we have left with him. I know that my family is most certainly not the only family going through this at this very difficult time, and something more needs to be done.",
        "background": "Relax the visiting rules for families to visit their family members who are currently in hospital and care homes. One designated visitor is not enough when people may be nearing the end of their life. We need there to be rules that allow more visitors for these situations.",
