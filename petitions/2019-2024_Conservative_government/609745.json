        "additional_details": "Currently the UK Government has stopped receiving visa applications from Ukrainians, unless they have British relatives.\r\n\r\nDue to the closure of the UK visa application centre in Kyiv, those with British relatives must travel to Western Ukraine to start their application, whilst those without British relatives must travel even further afield to Poland, Romania, Hungary or Moldova.\r\n\r\nThis is unacceptable in a humanitarian crisis. The government must lift all visa restrictions as Ireland have done.",
        "background": "Thousands of Ukrainians are heading to the border following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. \r\n\r\nThe US has predicted that as many as 5 million people will be displaced by the conflict. \r\n\r\nThe UK Government needs to ensure a safe and legal route to the UK for Ukrainians fleeing the conflict.",
