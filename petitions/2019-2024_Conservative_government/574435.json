        "additional_details": "The government must do this in order to keep our numbers below what they were in our March peak, so we never see this level of coronavirus infection or death in the UK. While we have new drugs and treatments, coronavirus is still a novel virus and the more hosts it has, the more extreme chance there is of dangerous and deadly mutation. We must sacrifice a small period of time to prevent more death, strain and time in lockdown in future, or future peaks ten times worse, for the future of us all.",
        "background": "The government must continue school, college, university and nursery shutdowns, and close our borders entirely except for returning British citizens with clear rest results and appropriate 2 week quarantines as the only way to completely suppress the evident danger of coronavirus and its mutations",
