The only treatment we have for this lifelong condition is a strict gluten-free diet, our food is our medicine. We shouldn't be made to pay more for something that we have no choice but to eat to prevent ourselves from getting unwell. The government stopped the prescription of gluten-free foods such as flour, bread, and pasta! These are essential to us!",
        "background": "With the cost of living crisis, food prices have gone up. This is causing people with celiac disease to not be able to afford gluten-free food, which is essential to their diet. Those struggling with low wages, benefits, and pensions are paying more for food. The weekly shop price is extortionate.",
