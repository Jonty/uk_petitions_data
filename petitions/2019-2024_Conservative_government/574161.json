        "additional_details": "At the moment, domesticated animals are classed as property in the eyes of the law. Therefore, someone stealing a household pet would face the same charge as someone who had shoplifted a Mars Bar. I believe this is wrong. A dog isn\u2019t an item, they are a family member who\u2019s disappearance would bring total devastation to their owners. \r\n\r\nDog theft and attempted dog theft has risen exponentially  recently and action must be taken to quell this cowardly, horrific crime as soon as possible.",
        "background": "I would like Parliament to consider making dog theft and attempted dog theft a specific crime that is punishable by a minimum two year prison sentence. At the moment, a domesticated animal is viewed as an item and I believe household pets should be reclassified and not classed as property.",
