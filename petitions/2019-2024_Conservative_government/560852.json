Providing regular testing for school staff may help schools stay open and take action quicker in the event that a staff member tests positive and to reduce the spread of Covid within them.",
        "background": "Provide regular free testing for school staff both primary and secondary including additional staff such as cleaners, lunchtime supervisors and office staff to ensure school environments are safe for children and staff, to help them stay open and to help schools prevent the spread of Covid-19.",
