        "additional_details": "Pet shops across the UK are allowed to sell hamster cages that are far too small. \r\n\r\nHamster owners are led to believe that these cages are suitable for hamsters but they are actually cruel and inhumane. In order to live a healthy and happy life, hamsters need minimum of 4000cm squared of unbroken floor space. \r\n\r\nThe government should make it illegal for pet shops to market these cages as suitable permanent homes for hamsters. \r\n\r\nThese little creatures deserve to live happy and healthy lives.",
        "background": "I am calling on the government to make it a legal requirement that any hamster cage sold in the UK should meet these minimum size requirement as set out by the RSPCA: \r\n\r\nDepth: 50cm\r\nWidth: 80cm",
