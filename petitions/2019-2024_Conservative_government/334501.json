        "additional_details": "Tens of thousands of Scottish pupils are to have their A-level exam results upgraded after the Scottish government agreed to accept teacher estimates of scores today (11 August 2020).\r\n\r\nIf Scotland's students are given higher grades based on teachers' predictions, how will it be fair if they're competing for the same university places as students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland? So please accept teacher estimates of scores as final without any further moderation. Teachers are the best people to judge grades and not a nationwide mathematical moderation algorithm.",
        "background": "We want the UK government to cancel the exam regulator A-level moderation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and accept teacher estimates of scores, which will be fair to all students. It is unfair to downgrade grades based on external criteria, rather than looking at a student's work only.",
