        "additional_details": "Many families including mine and my partners will be suffering at this time worrying about the health & wellbeing of prisoners. They have no hope of containing the virus you can not isolate prisoners when there is more than one person per cell. There has already been 2 deaths in prison how many is it going to take for something to happen?! Low risk prisoners should be released to free up cells in light of not spreading the virus. It is in humane to keep them locked in a cell all day when prisons are a breeding hotspot.",
        "background": "I want low risk prisoners released from prison amidst this Covid-19 outbreak. My partner is in prison for a non violent crime which he did not commit and I am worried for his wellbeing as they do not have hand washing facilities, protective wear or cleaning products to keep them safe.",
