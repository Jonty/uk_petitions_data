        "additional_details": "Many employers 'top-up' SMP provided the parent returns after 12 months, otherwise the money must be repaid. There is no provision to request longer off to:\r\n- take part in parenting activities / family life / leave work early and stay off due to Covid-19.\r\n- Solve childcare problems for those unable to use grandparents / day care. \r\n-  Encourages fathers to take shared parental leave.\r\n- Give options if partner faces redundancy. \r\nAlso creates jobs by extending the contracts of those covering leave.",
        "background": "The UK offers 9 months maternity pay and a further 3 months unpaid. We want the right to request longer off work due to Covid-19. Countries such as Australia allow for an additional 12 months unpaid leave to be requested and reasonably considered by their employer after their first year off.",
