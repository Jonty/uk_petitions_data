        "additional_details": "Pornhub is the world\u2019s largest and most popular porn site. It has repeatedly been caught enabling and profiting from videos of child rape, sex trafficking and other forms of non-consensual exploitation. Recently, a 15 y/o girl who was missing was found after her mother found (58) videos of her on the site. By allowing a site like this with no restrictions to be legal in the UK, the Government is complicit and accountable in the abuse of women and minors.",
        "background": "The government needs to create a law ensuring all content posted is verified- including the ages and consent of anyone in the videos. There is no system to verify the age or consent of those featured in the videos the sites hosts and profits from. All that is needed is an email address \u2013 no ID.",
