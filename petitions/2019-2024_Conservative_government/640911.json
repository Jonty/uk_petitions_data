        "additional_details": "These are children that have been through an incredibly traumatic journey. Whether you are anti immigration or not, these children didn't have a choice. Many fleeing war, famine, or political persecution. They're here anyway, and we have a duty to protect them until a solution is found. The least we can do is is make their stay comfortable. They're not suspected terrorists, dissidents or criminals. They're children. And we're Great Britain. A nation can be judged by the way it treats children.",
        "background": "After news that Minister Robert Jenrick ordered a cartoon mural to be removed from an asylum detention center for children, because it was \"to welcoming\" I think its time to be clear. No matter what your political leaning, these are children. Traumatised children. The UK should be better than this.",
