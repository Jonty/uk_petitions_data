For example, it states that you must not overload your vehicle or trailer and that you must secure your load and it must not stick out dangerously. \r\n\r\nThe Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) and the Police are responsible for enforcing the Highway Code, not the Government or Parliament. \r\n\r\nYou may be interested to know that the DVSA launched a year-long enforcement drive against light trailers and caravans last September (2019). \r\n\r\nYou may also be interested to  know that part 2 of the Haulage Permits and Trailer Registration Act 2018 introduced new requirements on trailer safety reporting and monitoring.
