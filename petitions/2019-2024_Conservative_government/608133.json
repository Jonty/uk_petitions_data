        "additional_details": "As a country where we are meant to respect one another and treat each other equally regardless of religion and ethnicity. When it comes to the privilege of higher education, thousands of students are forced to not continue because these loans stop them due to the unfair interest. Interest is not just as it makes the poor poorer and the rich richer. This is meant to be an equal opportunity for everyone regardless of religion and by having the current system, this stops  us from getting our dreams.",
        "background": "As David Cameron promised since 2013 to introduce the Interest free student loans so that has to be fulfilled as a country. I want the government to be able to fulfill that promise and bring in these loans for the upcoming undergraduates of 22/23.",
