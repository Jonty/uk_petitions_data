        "additional_details": "Such simple changes could relive working parents of a lot of stress, for the people without the family support around them it often feels extremely hard to find a balance. The way contributions to childcare are paid on UC does not work well for millions, also UC take away council tax supper if your property isn\u2019t band A yet the same property & parents with a higher income qualify for the support under the tax credits system.",
        "background": "Change the way you currently pay childcare cost if you receive an element of UC, pay it directly to the provider at the time they require payment to secure places to save parents taking out payday loans while they wait for 80% to be reimbursed a month later it would save a lot of debt and stress.",
