I am vaccinated and I find it incredible that some performers (e.g. Justin Bieber) are allowed to not even disclose whether they have had the vaccine and still perform. It's in the public's interest for them to disclose their status so people can make a choice and it is unacceptable to expect us to have it in our roles but then allow a stadium of people to get together with people who are refusing it.",
