A genuine father should not be denied access by the child\u2019s mother full stop. The current system needs scrapping. Create a fast direct way for fathers to legally have access and other parties to be legally bound to it. There is no need for 100s of thousands of dads to be left without access to their child.",
        "background": "Speed up the process of access providing fathers are fit and contribute to a child financially. Cafcas to be carried out then once checks are back with no concern for access to be given. An agreement between mediation to be legal, binary and fixed without long court proceedings. To make this law.",
