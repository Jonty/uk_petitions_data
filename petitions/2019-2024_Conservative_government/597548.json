        "action": "Stop discrimination between Covid-19 vaccinated and none vaccinated individuals",
        "additional_details": "The UK government originally introduced PCR testing for travel to detect potential new covid variants entering the UK. Vaccinated travellers can STILL carry and pass on the virus so why are they suddenly exempt from essential testing?! Quarantine needs to be scrapped for non vaxx travellers and PCR testing replaced with lateral flow testing. The govt are discriminating and dividing society as they try to take away freedoms to increase vaccine take up which is increasing tensions in communities.",
        "background": "Treat none vaccinated people with respect as they exercise their right to freedom of choice. NHS Track and trace rarely detect cases in those that travel so reduce the burden of expensive PCR tests and scrap unnecessary quarantine for none vaccinated travellers.",
