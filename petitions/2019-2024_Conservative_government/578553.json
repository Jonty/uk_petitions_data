These are at odds with the accepted norms of behavior in the UK and undermine the legitimacy of the monarchy.\r\n\r\nThere is historical precedent in the United Kingdom and the wider British Isles for the abdication or forcible removal of a monarch who is unsuitable for the office.  Appropriate 21st century mechanisms for this must be developed.",
        "background": "The government will review the current constitutional arrangements for the monarch's succession, with a view to reform.  Consideration should be given to mechanisms for abdication following votes of no-confidence in unsuitable monarchs, and to systems of tanistry and election from roydammna.",
