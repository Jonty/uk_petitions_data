        "additional_details": "The burden of this pandemic can not be placed on those industries hit hardest. Hospitality is trained to serve, host and care for guests in a safe matter -  forcing nightlife to go underground will only create more harm and bigger risks. \r\nAccording to the governments own statistics, hospitality is NOT accountable for majority of infections - so why penalise and punish? We need firm leadership to help save jobs, protect our communities and support small businesses - not kill hospitality!",
        "background": "Government needs to stop vilifying the hospitality sector and using bars, pubs and restaurants as scapegoats. Penalising a whole industry for the actions of individuals is not only unreasonable, but also encouraging illegal and irresponsible behaviour in creating an underground market for nighlife!",
