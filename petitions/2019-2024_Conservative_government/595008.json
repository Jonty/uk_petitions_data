        "action": "Reverse the decision to block Afghan Chevening scholars from entering the UK",
        "additional_details": "By awarding scholarships to these students, the UK has made them targets for reprisals in Afghanistan. Following the principle of Do No Harm, we must follow through with our international commitments to these students. We cannot let bureaucracy stop us from doing what is right. The UK government is well resourced, and should be able to find a solution that enables these students to take up their scholarships. It is our duty.",
        "background": "The Foreign Office is refusing to issue visas to 35 Afghan Chevening scholarship students. I call on the government to reverse this decision and find a solution for issuing the visas. It is too easy to say it is not possible to issue the visa - where there is a will, there is a way.",
