        "action": "Freeze interest on Tuition Fee Loans during the Coronavirus outbreak",
        "additional_details": "Instead of reimbursing students (for which either universities or the central government itself would have to bear the substantial cost), temporarily abolishing the Retail Price Index interest addition to Tuition Fee Loans would provide a more realistic, cost effective and pragmatic approach to helping students reduce their student debts in the future. The RPI addition to tuition fee loans (which is above the current interest rate anyway) is injust enough as it is, and doubly so here.",
        "background": "During the Coronavirus crisis, tuition fee loans are likely to rack up interest despite students not technically attending university. This crisis is likely to continue for a number of months; urgent action must be taken to avoid this potential injustice negatively affecting students in the future.",
