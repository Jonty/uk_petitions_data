        "additional_details": "The deterioration of political freedom and human rights for Hong Kong citizens has accelerated from the corrosion of the One Country, Two System legislation and the potential introduction of the new national security law. Furthermore, the Hong Kong government refuses to listen to its citizens, and have not condemned the excessive police violence against the peaceful protesters. The British Government has the responsibility to protect its oversea British Nationals, and act as a member of the UN.",
        "background": "The British Government should vocally condemn and actively prevent the introduction of the new national security law onto Hong Kong. Nevertheless, the British Government should grant willing Hong Kong citizens opportunities to take refuge in the UK.",
