        "action": "Abolish Vehicle Excise Duty (road tax) in favour of usage-based (fuel) taxation.",
        "additional_details": "VED is a regressive tax which unfairly penalises occasional car users, a situation that is only amplified by the current COVID-19 crisis.\r\n\r\nMillions of people are now unable to use their cars due to movement restrictions imposed by the The Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020, yet are legally obliged to pay hundreds of pounds a year in VED.\r\n\r\nSuch changes could easily be implemented via existing mechanisms to exempt vehicles from VED based on age, and the Petrol Revenue tax.",
        "background": "The government should suspend VED as soon as possible. A tax on fuel instead could achieve fairer, use-based charging whilst supporting the government's stated environmental aims, and be revenue-neutral overall. It would also address the unfair double taxation whenever there is a change of Keeper.",
