        "action": "Replace all Flammable Cladding on Buildings in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The Government cannot fail its citizens in rented apartment buildings and council housing, disproportionately putting people from lower income backgrounds at risk. The government must pay for the removal and replacement of dangerous cladding on council and housing association buildings, which it so far has not funded for 21,000 households. The former housing secretary said that all private sector buildings with ACM cladding would be fixed by June 2020. It\u2019s June 2020 and we are a long way away.",
        "background": "The Grenfell Tower fire occurred as a result of flammable cladding and inadequate safety measures. Three years on the problem still remains with thousands across the country. Banning cladding is not enough, we call on the Government to ensure the replacement of all flammable cladding.",
