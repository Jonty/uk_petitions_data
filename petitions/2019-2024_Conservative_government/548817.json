        "additional_details": "CAGs were produced months into a pandemic which caused educational disruption for some students far more than others. UCAS predictions were calculated by the same teachers as CAGs, just before the pandemic took hold, so are not skewed by the last few months as any CAGs differing from UCAS predictions self-evidently are. Disregarding UCAS predictions undermines their value and punishes students who were unable to work to the best of their ability during the pandemic through no fault of their own.",
