        "additional_details": "Autonomous vehicles will be a huge part of the UKs future, by allowing autonomous cars to test and drive on UK streets it paves the way for us to become a leader in self driving. It also will attract companies like Tesla or Waymo to test their vehicles here and improve their safety on UK roads. Our laws should be more inline with the US laws of autonomous vehicles rather than the EUs restrictive laws on it.",
        "background": "Autonomy is a big part of the future, the EU had regulations that made it practically impossible to do. Now we have left the EU the UK government should change our regulations to allow autonomous cars and remove any EU regulations that stopped it. They UK should also rewrite the regulations on them.",
