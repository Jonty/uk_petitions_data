        "additional_details": "Many students mental health has been affected greatly by this lockdown meaning that they have missed out on particular lessons or haven\u2019t been able to focus at home. They do not have full support of teachers over zoom and it isn\u2019t fair on them to make them sit an exam with such a large gap of knowledge missing especially considering what this year has been put through. They have missed a large chunk of GCSE work and haven\u2019t been given stage right amount of time or support to revise and improve.",
        "background": "I believe that you should reconsider making year 11s sit mini exams and think of an alternative such as either making them stay on a month longer to catch up or to even base it of the November mocks.",
