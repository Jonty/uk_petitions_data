        "additional_details": "England is now the only part of the UK that charges for prescriptions, with charges having been abolished in Wales in 2007, Northern Ireland in 2010 and Scotland in 2011. A PPC costs \u00a329.65 for 3 months or \u00a3105.90 for 12 months, which is cheaper than paying for individual prescriptions but isn\u2019t enough, it should be free. Diabetes patients are permitted to free prescriptions, whereas IBD patients are not. Both can be considered dehabilitating illnesses, so both should be treated the same.",
        "background": "Crohn\u2019s & Colitis are lifelong Inflammatory Bowel Diseases with no current cure. Living with a chronic condition is physically, mentally and emotionally challenging. IBD patients should be entitled to free prescription charges as it is a severe and a long-term health condition.",
