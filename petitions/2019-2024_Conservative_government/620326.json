        "additional_details": "Renewables have a 'payback period'. This, along with the upfront costs is putting people off having a viable and valuable asset to generate power installed. By giving access to 'up-front' funds at Zero interest, would encourage more domestic Solar installations. Fully self-funding by submission of a second meter reading at a substantially reduced kw/h rate, payback for a typical family is 6 years where 'tandem billing' finishes. Repaid funds can be then reused again for other causes.",
        "background": "Rather than keep giving Energy cost handouts, use a Fund generated from Windfall Tax on Energy companies to allow homeowners access to 'FREE' financing of renewables. This is paid back via a second meter reading, at say, 15p/kwh. Paid with existing bill until a point the cost has been repaid.",
