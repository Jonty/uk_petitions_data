        "additional_details": "I believe that this will be better for everyone especially students at school. This is because usually by Friday students have a lot of homework and if the school day is shorter, it will give them more time to do their homework. The 30 minutes taken off of Friday could be added to another day instead like Tuesday and Wednesday could get an extra 15 minutes each.",
        "background": "I want the workday and school day on Friday to be shorter by around 30-40 minutes. For example you normally leave work at 6:40 pm but on Friday you would leave at around 6:10 pm.",
