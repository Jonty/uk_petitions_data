        "additional_details": "Due to the current crisis of the COVID-19 and the Government's action to prevent the spread of the virus, the lockdown situation has impacted many businesses in various ways. Lots of companies have stopped their recruitment processes and cancelled many ongoing applications, which lead to less opportunities for the current universities' final year students to find jobs. If the Government could help to extend our Tier 4 Visa, it would be only be fairer for the current final year students.",
        "background": "We would be grateful if the Government could extend Tier 4 Student Visa for universities' final year overseas students for a few more months, perhaps another three months, to allow us more time to apply for jobs during this critical time.",
