        "additional_details": "The affect it has on animals is cruel, fireworks are so loud now the vibration going through the ground is like a bomb going off. When you have them going off in all directions it\u2019s impossible to get away from it especially living on a housing estate. It\u2019s also bad for the environment? If it was just November for bonfire week & Christmas & new year, then it would be barely, it\u2019s going on for months.",
        "background": "Only make fireworks available to the public for a short length of time over bonfire week & new years. The amount of wildlife that dies of shock & the pets that suffer badly is cruel & it\u2019s time to stop the cruelty. If you can\u2019t stop them at least ban the use of the loud ones that sound like bombs.",
