        "action": "Reduce/remove the UK lockdown restrictions as soon as possible",
        "additional_details": "There are many reasons to consider:\r\n1. The measures were largely put in place due to various models predicting the possible severity of the virus - these models have proven to be wrong; deaths as well as NHS capacity are far lower than expected.\r\n\r\n2. The OBR has stated that the UK economy could shrink by 35% and unemployment could hit 10% - people want their jobs back.\r\n\r\n3. There are already reported abuses of police power enforcing the poorly written and abstract legislation regarding the lockdown.",
        "background": "The UK government must take action to secure the UK economy, mental well-being and human rights of its citizens - to do this they must immediately reduce the severity of the lockdown, allow family members and friends to meet again and start the process to return to our previous way of living.",
