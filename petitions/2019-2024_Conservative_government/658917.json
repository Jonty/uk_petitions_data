She shared how people frequently dismiss her requests for assistance in supermarkets, claiming they are too busy. As a result, she often leaves the store feeling even more despondent than when she arrived.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we fail to enact small changes in our world, how can we hope to address the significant issues of war and global warming?\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease, kindly assist me in effecting change by signing this petition. Many thanks in advance.",
