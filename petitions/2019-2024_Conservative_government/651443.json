        "background": "1) All pet owners (not just dog exclusive) should be required by LAW to register themselves as pet owners & each of their pets they ever own\r\n2) Regulate dog training industry - ensure all trainers are QUALIFIED & owners nationwide attend COMPULSORY basic training courses\r\n3) Ban abusive pet owners",
