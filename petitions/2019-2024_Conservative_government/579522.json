        "action": "To legalise the use and distribution of pepper spray in the case of self defence",
        "additional_details": "It is currently illegal to carry weapons of any sort. Only a blade less then 3 inches. The danger with carrying knives is the aggressor among violating you in other ways may be able to use that weapon against the victim. \r\nTherefore, pepper spray is a non lethal solution to a lethal epidemic. As women writing this petition on behalf of other women, it is important to be able to defend our bodies from violation from those who would seek to do us harm. \r\nThank you for your time.",
        "background": "There\u2019s an increasing threat to the safety of women in the UK today. There is currently no sufficient solution to this ongoing problem. Women (and the general population) are not adequately equipped to protect themselves. This is why it is important to introduce a non lethal option of protection.",
