        "additional_details": "Some students do not receive financial support or a maintenance loan like myself and are forced to take up many jobs to pay the bills. Taking up a few jobs equals paying more TAX. As students, we are not financially stable enough to pay such an enormous income TAX. That leaves us little or no money to save for the mortgage, a car, tuition fees, and many more. When hundreds of pounds is taken away from your wages each month, it feels like you\u2019ve been robbed anad all the hard work is for nothing.",
        "background": "I would like the governemnt to decrease the income TAX for students employed on a part-time basis to 5% of their income regardless of the amount of jobs they have. The NI and pension scheme deductions are already high enough, the TAX should be lowered to support students financially throughout HE.",
