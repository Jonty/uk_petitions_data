They are not the responsibility of the UK Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou could have a petition calling on the Government to reduce the maximum directed time of 1,265 hours over 195 days per school year (the time in which teachers are required by their school to be at work or available to work), if that is something you'd like to see happen."
