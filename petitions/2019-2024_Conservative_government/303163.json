        "additional_details": "Working in a nightclub myself, I am worried for my own and for other\u2019s safety. Whilst closing schools and universities is also important, I believe that nightclubs and bars are a greater risk to health.\r\nHere\u2019s some reasons why:\r\n-Drinking alcohol lowers the immune system.\r\n-There is a large capacity of people in a small space.\r\n-There are people passing germs by sweating, couching, kissing and many more\r\n-While intoxicated, people are more likely to forget to wash their hands.",
        "background": "Nightclubs and bars are possibly the worst environments for coronavirus to spread. By closing them for an appropriate amount of time will result in a safer, healthier UK during this pandemic.",
