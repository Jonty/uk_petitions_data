        "additional_details": "The sound level of at home fireworks displays can be deeply upsetting for many. Lots of pets suffer greatly, ex service personnel can have PTSD attacks, the elderly can be frightened and the young, who are more sensitive to loud noises, can also be very scared. Only allowing silent fireworks at home displays provide people with the ability to enjoy these displays whilst not upsetting their neighbours and still enabling people to enjoy loud fireworks at public displays.",
        "background": "Only allow the sale of fireworks with a decibel level of below 90db to the general public. Public displays can have louder fireworks but at home displays would only be able to have 'silent' fireworks, that typically have a decibel level of 70db (vacuum cleaner) and 90db (lawnmower).",
