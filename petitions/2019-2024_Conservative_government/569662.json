        "additional_details": "The Covid pandemic has taken its toll on many people and everyone wants to see the back of it as soon as possible.\r\nIn order to do this, the government are now saying the vaccine is the way to get the pandemic under control, this will only work if everyone is vaccinated quickly and efficiently - the government are currently well below the needed average weekly vaccinations to achieve this so 24 hour centres would be a way to meet the much needed vaccine demand",
        "background": "The Government have indicated that there is \u201cnot a clamour for appointments late into the night\u201d, this is not the case and would actually be beneficial for most people who are still working through Covid so they don\u2019t lose money during working hours.",
