        "additional_details": "This will massively stop the spread of coronavirus, and help stop the NHS getting overwhelmed so that effective distribution of the vaccine can be achieved. It also means that teachers etc have the time to get vaccinated and protect themselves before going back to work. Going between tier 3 and tier 4 is not only ruining hope, but it is detrimental to everyone's mental health. We need to put a stop to COVID 19 once and for all, this way we can save lives and the economy.",
