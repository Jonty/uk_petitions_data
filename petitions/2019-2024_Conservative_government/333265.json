        "additional_details": "I'would like to see far harsher sentences in regards to violent/knife crime. In particular attempted murder by stabbing.  Regardress of what age the offender is. The fact is they tried the take a life why should they be allowed a slap on the wrist. If you attempt to take a life or do so you should be locked up for the remainder of yours. I truly believe that at the moment we need such incentive's to put an end to knife crime for good. As it is only getting worse.",
        "background": "So it's no secret that knife crime has been increasing in vast amounts.  I believe as do many others that if you are prepared to take a life using a knife (successful or not) you should absolutely spend the rest of your life incarcerated.",
