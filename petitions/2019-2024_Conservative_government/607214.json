There are myriad of various difficulties they're facing - and most of them could be easily minimised. Teaching BSL not only will allow non-deaf people to communicate and interact with deaf people, but most importantly; it'll raise the awareness of the struggles deaf people facing - ultimately creating mindset for improvement.",
