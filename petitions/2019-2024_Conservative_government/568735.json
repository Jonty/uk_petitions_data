        "additional_details": "I'm a UK citizen born in the UK. I served in the UK Army & Police. I'm a qualified Police Firearms Instructor, but I can't apply because I've lived in the US for the last 20 years. I'm bound by the official secrets act until 65, but now I'm not eligible to work for the Police. I have worked in the US & UAE training Police Officers, and completed background checks within 1 month of living in those countries, but I can't work in my own country at age 54? This rule needs to be changed for ex-vets.",
        "background": "The ICP rule of 3 years prior UK residency needs to be reviewed. There are many ex vets/police who have previously passed extensive background checks, but can't now serve the government because they have worked overseas. This is a waste of talent, a severe waste of public funds & qualified resources",
