        "additional_details": "i understand that their has been many horrendous dog attacks but this doesnt always come down to the breed of the dog! banning a certain type of dog breed isnt going to change anything. \u00a0over the years theyve blamed so many diffrent type of dog breeds for attacks and it still goes onto this day from all other diffrent breeds. The dogs actions are based on how they are brought up & trained to be. Any dog can attack no matter of the size, breed or age of the dog, IT SHOULD BE THE OWNERS TO BE PUNISHED ! If the owners of the dogs knew they would be jailed or punished in a certain type of way we would have less dog attacks! ITS NOT THE BREED ITS THE OWNERS",
        "background": "these are our pets not all of them are vicious! its down to the owners on how they treat the dog and bring it up everyone elses shouldnt be took away because of someone elses actions",
