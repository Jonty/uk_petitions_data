        "additional_details": "It is no secret that students have struggled greatly throughout the current pandemic, however, students have struggled in varied amounts. Many schools opened for exam year students as soon as allowed, however, many stuck with online learning. This has massively widened the pre-existing divides between students who are better and worse off. By providing students with precise topic lists for the tests, if they go ahead, it will allow students the equal level of oportunity they all deserve.",
        "background": "Ensure exam boards provide students with a precise topic list for each of the proposed 'mini exams' as exam replacements, giving all students equal oportunities to do well. A topic list would allow for focussed revision and make sure no more of students' valuable teaching time is wasted.",
