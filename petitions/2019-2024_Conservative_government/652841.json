        "additional_details": "It's not fair for families to be split apart due to this new requirement of \u00a338,700. This amount is too high for those people who are working a normal job. \u00a318,600 was a good amount which majority of people can meet. We want this decision to be looked into. There are hardly any jobs who pay this amount unless you have a good qualification or work with the NHS. If that is the case then every job shall increase the amount the pay employees.  So they can afford living and supporting families.",
        "background": "The new requients for spouse visa is too high for most people to meet. Its not fair on children to live without either of their parents. There are more important topics to be talked about in the parliment such reducing the prices of living costs so people and LIVE without struggle.",
