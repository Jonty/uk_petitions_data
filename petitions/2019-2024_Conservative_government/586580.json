        "additional_details": "As a mobile DJ and entertainer it is very frustrating that I cannot carry on with my business, there are also many, many others in the same position. I therefore am petitioning the government to allow the restriction to ease as planned. I know there will be many people that feel the same way, it is really starting to effect my mental health as I am sure it is many others, if this carries on for much longer there isn't going to be a country to save, most of us will just all face financial ruin.",
        "background": "As long as deaths remain low and admissions to hospital remain at a manageable rate then lockdown restrictions should be ended on June the 21st as planned.",
