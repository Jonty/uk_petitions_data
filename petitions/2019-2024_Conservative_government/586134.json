        "action": "Exempt fully-vaccinated people from quarantine on arrival in the UK",
        "additional_details": "As international travel to the UK resumes many tourists will be keen to visit Britain, as will British citizens living overseas. However, under current rules, people who are fully-vaccinated and pose zero risk to the public from Covid-19, are still forced to follow quarantine rules in the different nations of the UK. This also forces them to incur costs for tests for a virus against which they've been vaccinated. This is unfair and unnecessary.",
        "background": "People who are fully-vaccinated against Covid-19, and can provide documentation proving their status, should not be forced to quarantine on arrival. They should be allowed to move freely through the UK, under the same rules as vaccinated people living in Britain.",
