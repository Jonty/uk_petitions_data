        "additional_details": "Bmi is not an indicator of health! Weighing children can/ will make them feel inadequate. More focus on lessons on nutrition, starting with what some schools serve to our children, add variety to PE lessons, make them more fun. Weighing children can lead to feelings of shame, eating disorders and bullying. Introduce yoga and mindfulness lessons. Building up self esteem / self worth would be more important. We need screening for eating disorders in schools not weighing!",
        "background": "Eating disorders are on the increase in young children. Weighing them, focusing on bmi is unhelpful and damaging. The government making knee jerk reactions without full and proper consultations with eating disorder and mental health experts is appalling.",
