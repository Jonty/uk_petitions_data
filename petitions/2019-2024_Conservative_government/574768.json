The impact of lockdowns vs the virus's impact need to be weighed up.\r\n\r\nMPs are not financially affected by the lockdowns that they're voting for; having some impact may make MPs consider a little harder before voting to ruin people's livelihoods and way of life.\r\n\r\nA 20% pay cut for MPs is still far less of an impact than on the wider population.",
