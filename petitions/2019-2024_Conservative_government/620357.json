        "action": "Increase the maximum working hours to 30 for International Students.",
        "additional_details": "With the inflation and increasing costs of living, it has become extremely difficult for international students live on 20 hour part time work. The UK's inflation is all time high and costs of rent and bills are soaring day by day. Students are financially struggling to pay their rent and bills. Inflation is at 9.1% and energy bills rose by 54%. International students are not eligible for public funds to get support from government. 30 hours of part time work will help students to earn enough money to pay rent, bills and loans.",
        "background": "Increase the working hours to 30 instead of 20. It would help international students to live without financial burden and will help with keeping up with the rising prices.",
