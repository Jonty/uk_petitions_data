        "additional_details": "There is no food in the supermarkets.  Politely asking the public to show restraint has failed; panic buying and hoarding is rife; there is now profiteering.  Supermarkets are reluctant to implement necessary restrictions for fear of appearing draconian and alienating customers.  \r\nSo now, only Government can take necessary action and take a lead.   Government should introduce rationing coupon books.",

Priority for OAPs and other vulnerable persons.  Make the coupons bearer instruments so that a helper/carer/family member can buy on behalf by presenting the coupon.",
