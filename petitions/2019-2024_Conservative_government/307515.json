        "additional_details": "The effects of the new economic breakdown are already being felt throughout the country, and students are not exempt from it. As businesses and workplaces are getting shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic, several students will no longer be able to pay the rents for their stay at the University. Likewise, on behalf of several of my University colleagues, I am asking you to pass a law for Universities to stop charging students living on their campuses for rent until the pandemic crisis ends.",
        "background": "Cancel all university final rental payments.  As advised by the government, Social distancing has been put into place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and I am sure you are aware that a student accommodation is not an ideal environment to abide this advice.",
