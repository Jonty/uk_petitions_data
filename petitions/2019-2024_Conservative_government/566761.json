        "additional_details": "It is easy to predict the overall grade a Btec student should receive due to continuous assessment over the two years. Our final grades will be affected because we\u2019re in lockdown and can\u2019t have help from teachers. Therefore we should receive predicted grades like other students.",
        "background": "A level students aren\u2019t taking exams this year and will receive predicted grades. It\u2019s not fair that Btec students have to create big final pieces of coursework with the same lack of teaching due to lockdowns.",
