        "additional_details": "We would like to ask the Government or Parliament to enforce this action due to the growing fear of the rapid spread of Corona-virus among the UK community. \r\n\r\nThe government needs to collect and treat all \"mild\" patients of Corona-virus who are currently self-isolated at home into a specific quarantined place  (e.g., a hotel). They should have better treatments by nurses and doctors. Also, it is a great danger to allow them to stay at home without restrictions. Family members and community groups can be easily infected due to a lack of knowledge and protection. The effect of this action has been proved a huge success in Wuhan and also 1918 flu pandemic in the UK. We hope to come to an agreement as soon as possible in a timely manner.",
