        "additional_details": "We have the power for this. this is an easy thing to do. australia did it and so can we. i get people\u2019s mental health wasn\u2019t so good in the first lockdown, but if the cases don\u2019t go away now we are going to have to keep on having them, and i\u2019m sure no one would like that. it\u2019s tiring having to wear masks and social distance everywhere and being at risk all the time so can we please just do this together, just a few months in complete lockdown for everything to go back to normal guys please.",
        "background": "I think we should copy what australia did and go into a full lockdown for a few months, close everything except grocery stores and pharmacies, have a 5km limit and an 8pm curfew bc they have 0 cases now. it\u2019s a sacrifice for a few months but it\u2019s worth it for everything to go back to normal guys.",
