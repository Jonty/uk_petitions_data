        "action": "Ban sale of fireworks to the general public.",
        "additional_details": "By restricting the sale of fire works to the general public they are less likely to end up in the hands of irresponsible people who are going to seriously hurt themselves others or worse kill themselves or others. How many life\u2019s are to be ruined before action is taken? Fire works should only be sold to licensed and trained individuals who have undergone training on how to use them safely for the purpose of organised events with safety measures in place to ensure the safety of everyone involved.",
        "background": "It\u2019s apparent by looking at last year\u2019s petition fireworks cannot be banned. However this year again we are facing the same issues as previous years, kids, elderly & disabled and our pets are terrified, not to mention the dangers of those who misuse them, to themselves and others around them.",
