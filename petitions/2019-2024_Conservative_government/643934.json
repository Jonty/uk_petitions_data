        "additional_details": "It's clear to me that many people strongly disagree with putting a ban in place on American XL bullies. Owners of these amazing dogs are sharing pictures of their family pets, who have proven to be loving and kind. Let's use these heartwarming examples to show that responsible ownership is key, rather than a blanket ban. Together, we can make a difference and advocate for fair treatment of these wonderful dogs! \ud83d\udc36\u2764\ufe0f\u270a",
        "background": "I\u2019m Starting this petition to ask parliament to reconsider the ban on American XL bullies. Instead, they could focus on promoting responsible ownership and education about dog breeds. Let's emphasize that it's not about the breed, but about how they are raised and cared for. \ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\ude4c",
