        "action": "Stop isolation in close contact cases for unvaccinated people who had Covid-19.",
        "additional_details": "This will reduce staff shortages as we are coming into a crisis of staff shortages within the UK. This will lead onto helping the economy and build it back up. Within the EU some countries are already recognising this and their cases are far lower than us. UK also has the highest immunity rate with 98%, this means we can now beat covid-19 confidently so we all need do to it together regardless of vaccination status.",
        "background": "People who had covid within the last 6 months are allowed covid-passports to get into venues due to immunity. This means when it comes to close contacts cases instead of a full 10 day isolation period, these people should be offered the same option as vaccinated people. Who both have immunity.",
