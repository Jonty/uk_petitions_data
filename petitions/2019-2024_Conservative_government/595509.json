Hence, we need new human rights to protect people's intelligence.",

The skills needed to become proficient as a doctor or a driver are available to learn for everyone and the intellectual capabilities are not the exclusive property of the individual. Therefore we're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling for the Government to review the full impacts of possible automation and explain clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to know more about the future of automation the House of Commons, Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee have published a report entitled \"Automation and the future of work\" which you can view below:\r\nhttps://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmbeis/1093/1093.pdf"
