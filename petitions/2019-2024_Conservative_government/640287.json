        "action": "Bring forward stronger domestic CCTV laws especially if children are at risk",
        "additional_details": "Currently domestic users can install CCTV with very little regulations. Children can be put at risk and yet police will not help unless law can be proved to be broken. This is hard to prove unless data access requests are enforced. The ICO will only write to the user & will not retrieve data, verify privacy settings or enforce removal. This gives unregulated individuals ability to install CCTV for wrong reasons. The only effective way to prevent misuse is regulation at the time of installation.",
        "background": "Introduce stricter laws & mandate permissions before installation of CCTV. A risk assessment has to be conducted before issuing permissions. When deemed a risk or intrusive, the request should be rejected & alternate locations should be suggested. Child protection & human rights should be upheld.",
