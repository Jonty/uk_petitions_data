        "additional_details": "Statues cementing Britain\u2019s \u201csuccessful\u201d extraction of resources and exploitation of humanity run amuck. Few have been taken down as a reaction to BLM either by gov. or protestors so the question is: where do these articles of Britain\u2019s slave-based heritage go? I\u2019m fearful that if disposed of history is being censored rather than pragmatically addressed. A museum or permanent exhibit for these articles aims to educate future generations on our crimes against humanity and the figures involved.",
        "background": "The establishment of this novel museum or permanent exhibit would house any artefacts that glorify Britain\u2019s past involvement in slavery. This can include, but is not limited to, statues recently taken down or still standing on Britain\u2019s streets during these times of uncertainty.",
