        "action": "Accept the European Commission's youth mobility proposals in full.",
        "additional_details": "Since Brexit, mobility between the UK and the EU has plumetted, to the detriment of young people in particular. We believe that the EU's proposals would be a great way of restoring the lost opportunities caused by Brexit, whilst also respecting the result of the 2016 referendum. We have no doubt that British people would overwhelmingly support this scheme, which would make foreign study more accessible to young people, restore valuable cultural exchanges, and enrich both the EU and the UK.",
        "background": "The European Commission has proposed a youth mobility scheme between the EU and the UK, which would allow 18-30 year olds to move to a destination of their choice for 4 years. It has also proposed lowering tuition fees for EU and UK students. We ask that the Government accept the proposals in full.",
