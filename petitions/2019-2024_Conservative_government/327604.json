        "additional_details": "Britain's foreign aid budget helped save 250,000 lives last year, and rescue 350,000 people from slavery. But Boris Johnson wants to move our aid department into the Foreign Office, with the express intention of getting \"value from our aid money\" for Britain - suggesting we won't give unless we get something in return. This was not in his 2019 Manifesto and comes at a time when attention is diverted elsewhere. The Department should stay, and aid money should focus on helping the world's poorest.",
        "background": "On Tuesday, Boris Johnson announced that the Department for International Development would be merged with the Foreign Office, so aid spending could focus on promoting Britain's interests. We call on the government to reverse the change so aid spending can keep helping the world's poorest people.",
