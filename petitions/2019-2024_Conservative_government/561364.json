        "additional_details": "MPs have voted against extending free school meals into the holidays for the poorest children in the UK, in the middle of a pandemic. They should under no circumstances benefit from free or subsidised meals out of public funds themselves. If the public purse cannot afford to feed the poorest in our society, why are we feeding those least in need? Already well paid public servants, set to receive yet another generous pay increase, whilst millions face hardship, job losses and poverty, do not need the public to pay for their food and drink. Public funds should be spent on those most in need of them. \r\n\r\nRead more about what expenses MPs can claim for food here: https://fullfact.org/online/mps-free-housing-alcohol/ \r\n\r\n(This petition has been copied from 38degrees.org)",
