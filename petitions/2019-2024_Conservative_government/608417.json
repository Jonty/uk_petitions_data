With everything in the world increasing in cost and people needing to travel to work to afford to live fuel is something many need to allow them to continue working.",
        "background": "Since the driver shortage for fuel tankers the cost of fuel has risen drastically. The cost of fuel a few years ago was manageable at just over \u00a31 per litre but in recent years we have seen around a 50% increase in cost to the consumer. Cost of living rising, gas/ electric rising.",
