        "additional_details": "Blanket IR35 assessments fail to take into account individual circumstances and working practices of the Contractor. Blanket / role-based assessments are being deemed as the risk adverse approach for corporations to mitigate risk of any tax liabilities to them. As a result Contractors are being incorrectly classified. An increasing number of Corporations are taking this approach on the lead up to the reforms due 6th April 2021 with evidence illustrated on the lead up to the reforms in 2020.",
        "background": "This is calling upon the Government to address blanket IR35 assessments. HMRC have enabled corporations to take an unfair approach determining employment statuses on mass to mitigate any risk to themselves. Contractors have no power to overturn unfair and inaccurate assessments.",
