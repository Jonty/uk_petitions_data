        "additional_details": "This is a decision that's been made, based on clubs needing revenue as fans aren't in the stadium yet, Premier League clubs have splashed around \u00a31.4billion on permanent signings during the recent summer transfer window. Even though some fans are still paying Direct Debits for a season ticket, they are now being told they will have to spend \u00a315 on each individual game that is not televised. This issue needs highlighting and talked about.",
        "background": "The decision this week by the Premier League/Clubs, to charge fans for PPV games at \u00a314.95 during this pandemic could arguably be one of the lowest points in Modern Football. The Premier League/Clubs who voted in favour of this decision should be held accountable to ensure a refund goes to fans.",
