        "additional_details": "I am aware that this rule is meant to combat obesity, but very few obese people use calorie counting as a method to lose weight, instead this is causing people who have issues with eating to have anxiety or guilt from just eating in a restaurant, or people who are recovering from an eating disorder, which could trigger relapses. You may think i am talking hypothetically but i have a close friend of mine who is recovering from an eating disorder , and this rule has caused her to relapse.",
        "background": "There is a growing issue with eating disorders in the UK. This law encourages people to view their food as a number and therefore people become fixated on counting those numbers, which causes an eating disorder.",
