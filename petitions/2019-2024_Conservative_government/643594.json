        "action": "STOP the forced PSTN switch off by BT for whole of the UK",
        "additional_details": "Government should stop BT from forcing everyone on to a service which is new & not proven to work nationwide. PSTN should remain for those that chose to keep it & all those who are elderly & vulnerable. The replacement to PSTN VOIP does not work when there is a power cut & this is dangerous. It could be days before power is connected depending on situation, mobiles don't work everywhere & 1hr back ups are not helpful. Why destroy PSTN network when it remains working & useful during power cuts.",
        "background": "By December of 2025 BT plan to switch of the PSTN network for the whole UK without giving anyone a choice to continue on the old service or indeed even to check if elderly and vulnerable people are adversely affected by having no standard telephone line. Few people are even aware it is happening.",
