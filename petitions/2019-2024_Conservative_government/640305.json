        "additional_details": "Young people should want to work so they can get realistic work experience, building life skills. Most people will not be motivated to get up for work to only be making \u00a35.28/hr, especially teenagers. It doesn\u2019t make sense for young people to be paid less for doing the exact same job and usually on top of educational studies. By increasing the minimum wage, more young people will be inspired to put themselves out there and find themselves a job which would benefit the economy in general.",
