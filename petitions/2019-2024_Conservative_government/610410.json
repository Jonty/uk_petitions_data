        "action": "Increase disability facilities grant inclined with increased cost of builds",
        "additional_details": "To make the life of disabled people or their families less stressful, making the process easier and smoother for all involved. Meaning disabled people get what they need sooner to give them the life they deserve. Having to wait for someone with a complex disability means their quality of life is affected and they are having to live in unexceptable living conditions for far to long, fighting all the time to get what they need.",
        "background": "The cost of building materials has increased between 20-50% in the past 2years yet the amount of DFG has remained the same for years. Meaning disabled adults and children are left struggling or fighting for what they need, the wait time is around 2years before they even start to build.",
