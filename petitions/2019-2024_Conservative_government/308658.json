        "background": "At hospitals in England, NHS staff have to pay for their parking. To be charged to spend your day dedicated to helping others is unjust; especially during the COVID-19 outbreak. \r\n\r\nIn the few cases that staff can get permits, these car parks rarely have enough space to fill all employees.",
