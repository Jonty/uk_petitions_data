        "additional_details": "The spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan only started to be controlled and then slowed down after the Mobile Cabin Hospitals being introduced as part of the Epidemic Prevention strategy. The idea is to gather all the confirmed cases with minor symptoms, isolate them together with professional care and necessary treatment, instead of letting them go home, pass the disease onto their families and then to more people in their communities. It has been proven to be effective in containing the spread of virus.",
        "background": "We would like the government to establish Mobile Cabin Hospitals for treating patients infected with the COVID-19 virus and showing minor symptoms. Instead of letting these patients go HOME and self-isolate themselves.",
