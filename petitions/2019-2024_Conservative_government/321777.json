        "additional_details": "COVID-19 is effecting the lives of thousands, including students. In order for our studying to commence under safe practises, many universities have made the decision to not only push back the starting term date, but also move teaching online. As we have now experienced this way of teaching during the lockdown period, we do not believe it lives up to the high quality of teaching that is promised and expected and is not worth \u00a39,250 every year. We are asking you to reconsider the yearly fee.",
        "background": "Due to COVID-19, many universities have made the decision to move all large scale lectures online. As most lectures are large scale, this means that the campus is almost completely off limits and we feel that this level and quality of teaching is not worth \u00a39,250.",
