        "additional_details": "Our quality of teaching has not been sufficient in any way, shape, or form in comparison to what universities offered pre-Covid. More importantly our mental health across our age group has been massively affected and we want recognition that we, as the next generation, will be the ones that sort this mess out and repay the money spent by the government. On top of that students will have their loans to pay back - which were spent on botched university experiences and degrees.",
