        "additional_details": "Given that the government have already admitted that this act breaks the law, It is blatantly obvious that it is criminally negligent to proceed to go ahead and do it. I believe the ONLY reason MP's will proceed and take this course of action anyway is because they know that some other mug (the UK taxpayer) will fund their bill.",
        "background": "I believe individuals should be responsible for their actions. If individual MP's want to pass this legislation they should expect to live with the consequences not the UK taxpayers. So I want individual MP's responsible to be held legally responsible for any resulting fines issued by the ECJ",
