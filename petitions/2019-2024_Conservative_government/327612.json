Elongated by Wait times, this means that transgender people are forced to put their lives on hold as they are unable to do anything that requires an ID. These new measures would have removed barriers for transgender people so they instead only would have to make a sworn declaration in front of a judge. It is simply dehumanizing to deny the identities of transgender people by having such harsh barriers in place especially when plans to loosen these barriers have been already been set out and made public by the previous government. A core principle of this country is tolerance and to allow this to continue as it is most certainly isn\u2019t reflective that.",
