        "additional_details": "In 1968 the average house in the UK cost \u00a34,010 with an average wage for a male in 1968 being \u00a31,144. This evidence shows that house prices were about four times the average wage. Compare these figures to now where the average wage in the UK is \u00a324,600 and average house prices sitting at \u00a3277,000. Now showing that houses are over ten times the amount of an average wage. Something desperately needs to be done about this.",
        "background": "We as a generation need the housing market to decrease all over the UK. Individuals all over the country are struggling to move out of their parents homes. If they manage to do this they are struggling to pay rent. The price of housing is increasing poor living conditions all over the country.",
