        "additional_details": "The current minimum age of voting is 18, we believe that this doesn't give younger, but equally as mature people, the opportunity to have their opinions, morals and values appropriately and accurately represented.\r\n\r\nIssues resolved and decisions made by the use of voting will have a direct, and potentially long-lasting impact on the lives of us, the younger generation. Therefore, we should be given the opportunity and the right to have our say on the decisions that are made.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to change the minimum age that a UK citizen can vote from the current age of 18, to a lower age of 16, giving younger people the opportunity to have their voices heard.",
