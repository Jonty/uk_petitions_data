A disillusioned government remains ignorant to struggles & arrogant to really listen to what we have to say. Leaving us dependant on broken support services not fit for purpose\r\n\r\nA wonderfully diverse range of individuals, talents & abilities are stripped of their uniqueness by an outdated, performance led & test heavy \"one-fits-all\" education\r\n\r\nChange the system, solve the problems",
