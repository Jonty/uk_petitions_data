        "additional_details": "Knife crime amongst the young has been largely bounced around and no action taken. No-one in goverment seems to want to own/act on it. Every year we hear of horrific cases where youths have been killed or seriously injured. Current deterrents do very little to detract from this behaviour. More stringent education in ALL SCHOOLS to inform the far reaching consequences to the victim, their family, their friends as well as to the perpetrator, his/her family, their friends and to the general public.",
        "background": "We need to stop the carrying of offensive weapons by any member of public but particulary youths of school going ages, far to many pointless killings occur every year but nothing  of any real effect is ever done. We need a new ZERO TOLERENCE attitude to it.",
