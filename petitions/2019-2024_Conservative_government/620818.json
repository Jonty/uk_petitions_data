You may be in a job that doesn't easily allow for strikes, your salary might limit your ability to strike or you may not be part of a union. This doesn't mean your voice shouldn't be heard. \r\n\r\nIf you are tired of scrimping and saving and being told that now is not the time to discuss wage increases, please sign the petition and spread the word.\r\n\r\nMake your government work for you.\r\n\r\nThank you",
        "background": "The cost of living crisis is biting hard. Arguments that wealth redistribution will drive inflation are hollow because inflation has been rising during this austerity period - the Tory government's strategy has failed. Rampant profiteering has disrupted, destabilised and weakened our democracy.",
