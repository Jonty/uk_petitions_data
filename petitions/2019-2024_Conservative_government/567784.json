        "additional_details": "Reopening schools, colleges and workplaces to those who aren\u2019t vulnerable or more likely to develop serious illness will benefit the economy and slow down poverty and mental health deterioration. Spend more time and money on developing new ways to be able to still proceed with Normal life without forcing every person to stay at home like prison. By focusing on people who need protection the most, you could keep the gears of England running and have money to support the vulnerable who can\u2019t work",
        "background": "Stop forcing every person to stay locked up at home and focus on supporting the vulnerable and the elderly. By implementing different restrictions on social meetings and family bubbles we could still stop the spread for the vulnerable without having the drastic effects it has already had for all",
