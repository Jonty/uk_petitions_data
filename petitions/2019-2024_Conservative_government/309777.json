        "additional_details": "India is being overlooked as country. The UK has sent extraction flights to Angola, New Zealand, Australia and Peru yet India is being overlooked. Police in the state are using threatening and harassing techniques to UK nationals who are frightened and running low on basic supplies like food. These citizens belong in their home country with the rest of their families during this international crisis. Only the state of Goa has allowed flights but there are citizens all over India that need aid.",
        "background": "The British Government has urged all UK nationals currently abroad during the COVID19 pandemic to return home immediately. However nothing is being done for those stranded in India, currently in lockdown. The UK government needs to setup up extraction flights immediately for these anxious families.",
