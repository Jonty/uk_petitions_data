        "additional_details": "In every Press Conference the Prime Minister pays tribute to the NHS and their increased workload. In return for this extra pressure on an already maxed-out service we, the general public, ask the Government to pay a finite \u00a32,000 out of the \u00a334bn the Chancellor recently earmarked.\r\nWith 1.5m NHS employees + cleaning/catering contractors this will equate to a \u00a33.5bn cost or 10% of the earmarked money.\r\n\r\nFor lowest paid workers this equates to a 7% increase and for the average doctor - 3.3%.",
        "background": "NHS Staff, Health-Workers and Carers are at the forefront of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet they are amongst the lowest paid public servants. These workers deserve more. With school closures, pressures of caring for the sick and dying these workers face hardship.",
