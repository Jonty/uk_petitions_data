Permanently excluded 10 days before finishing school during assessments. This is a common things that many schools do and things need to change not just for my child but for all SEN children, they are pushed into naughty schools because mainstream cannot be bothered. They deserve better and nothing has improved over the years.",
        "background": "Make it compulsory that main stream schools undertake full training for SEN to be able to provide them with support and to understand. Stop allowing schools to exclude them so easily because the child is not following behaviour policy that is for a child without needs. Allow them their human rights",
