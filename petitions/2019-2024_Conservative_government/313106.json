It will apparently not be ready until June.\r\nFor many people this leaves them open and as such will try to continue working when they should not. \r\n\r\nA blanket \u00a3300 per week would be possible to roll out immediately relieving the additional stress placed upon people nationally. \r\n\r\nFor some waiting until June is just too long. A blanket payment. Cover all types of workers.",
