        "additional_details": "If you are a pet owner, you know they are family. In most countries, pets are allowed to travel in eurostar, airline cabin (<8kg) or hold (>8kg) as 'accompanied pets' after carrying out health checks. Yet, due to government regulations, UK forces owners to register them as 'cargo' which costs >\u00a31-2k (20x more than a standard airline pet ticket) while travelling alone for longer, causing distress to the pet, owners and their wallets. We plead the government to take example from other countries.",
        "background": "Although UK has one of the highest no. of pets, it still has one of the most stringent travel schemes. You aren't allowed to travel with 'an accompanied pet', neither in cabin, hold or Eurostar. We want parliament to consider allowing pets to travel both in/out without having to register them cargo.",
