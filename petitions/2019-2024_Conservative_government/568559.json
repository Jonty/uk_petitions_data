        "additional_details": "Students shouldn\u2019t have to go home from school just to do even more work after six hours. Especially when we mightn\u2019t have exams to revise for, this builds up a lot of stress which may cause students to get low grades. Also homework can make kids end up sleep deprived and miserable because of the overload of homework. It feels like we can never escape school, even though going home is supposed to be the place to relax and be relieved of school,",
        "background": "I want the government to abolish homework across all secondary schools. Students get homework day in and day out which creates a lot of stress especially when we have test to revise for and as a year 10 student I personally know how it feels.",
