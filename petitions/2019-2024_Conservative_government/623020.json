        "additional_details": "Families are struggling and rather than the government having to find ways to help them via money contributions out of our own funds would it not make sense to cap the profits of the companies and therefore keep the bills low? If the profits of the companies were capped to their expected levels pre the war then they would be getting what they expected rather than the expanded version they are now enjoying due to war.",
        "background": "Cap fuel prices. The energy companies are showing record profits while many families are struggling now even before the rises. These profits have been inflated by the war between Russia and Ukraine so does this not constitute profiteering from war? Does the government not recognise it as this?",
