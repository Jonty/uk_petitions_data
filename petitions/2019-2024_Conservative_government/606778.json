They are not necessarily superior in a particular regard but they have monopoly of users.\r\n\r\nLaws governing free speech, are drafted by elected officials -- they should apply equally on large platforms like Facebook and Twitter.\r\n\r\nFor the natural selection of ideas, it's important we are permitted to express ourselves freely. Unpopular ideas naturally don't get far, whilst good ideas gain traction and cause big change -- this is part of a democracy.",
