        "additional_details": "The potential benefits of working from home for a large proportion of the working population are numerous - helping people to achieve better work life balance - but also for the country - reducing pressure on infrastructure, rail and road, and reducing our carbon footprint to help the environment. Government should be supporting people to work from home proactively.",
        "background": "The Covid-19 pandemic has proven that nearly 50% of the working population are able to work from home effectively, and many employers are reviewing the need for offices. Government has said they may legislate on rights to work from home, but we call on them to bring this forward now.",
