        "additional_details": "I want them to stop discriminating against women. You get paid more on furlough than you do on maternity leave. They need to consider women need time to breastfeed and bond with the baby. It is common for women in this century to be the main earners in the household and not the men. Therefore, they don\u2019t have the luxury to be able to not work and live off \u00a3151per week. Women didn\u2019t choose to carry babies it was how we were made therefore shouldn\u2019t be penalised for it.",
        "background": "I want the government to make it essential for companies to pay fair maternity wages and not at their discretion. Women are being penalised for having children and some having to go back to work after as little as 6 weeks due to wages being dramatically cut and not able to survive otherwise.",
