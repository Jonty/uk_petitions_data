        "additional_details": "Meat killed by religious slaughter is not prepared in Parliament, so MPs know that they are not eating it, unless they specifically request it. UK legislation must replace the EU slaughter directive, explicitly precluding the religious exemption from pre-stunning requirement. Stun to kill must be mandatory.",
        "background": "Religious abattoirs in the UK are de facto exempt from the stun laws which apply to non-religious abattoirs. Animal welfare must take priority over faith tradition.\r\nNon-stun slaughter is cruel. Many consumers do not want to eat meat killed by religious slaughter.",
