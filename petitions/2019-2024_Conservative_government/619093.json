Everything needed to enable this, quickly, exists bar a crucially important coordinated government plan to ensure that energy consumers can invest what\u2019s needed to meet only their own needs. The benefits in this time of crisis are many; cost, self-sufficiency, savings to the public purse and, in a wider sense, will lead to carbon neutrality, greater use of electric cars and potentially a huge boost to the national economy.",
