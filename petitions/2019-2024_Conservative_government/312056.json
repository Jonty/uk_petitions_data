        "additional_details": "There is a lockdown,99% of life in UK especially in London has stopped,People are sitting in their homes,relaxing on sofas,watching tv & playing games while enjoying 80% of wages granted by the government;However we must not forget our front line heroes of NHS specially Doctors and Nurses who are still working tirelessly and risking their lives without being afraid of losing their lives and leaving their loved ones behind.Therefore they deserve to have tax free wages during this lockdown crisis.",
        "background": "Taxes should not be taken from the over-worked NHS staff, while other members of the Nation are busy enjoying 80% free money, therefore we would like to request the Parliament to consider this appeal and make a tax free salary from the hard-earned wages of Doctors, Nurses and other NHS Staffs.",
