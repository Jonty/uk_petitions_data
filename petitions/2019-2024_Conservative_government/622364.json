        "action": "Abolish the Driver CPC cards for professional drivers",
        "additional_details": "When I first became a pcv driver back in 2000, there was no cpc card, nvq was a voluntary scheme, I passed a driving test to qualify for a D licence, and have driving now for almost 23 years, I took a trailer test in 2005, passed that as well.\r\nI dont need an extra card to tell me I'm a professional driver, CPC is just another expense on drivers that they technically don't require, surely having a licence is enough!",
        "background": "CPC for drivers is not only a waste of time, but also an expense we can all do without, courses are merely someone drivelling on for 7.5 hours, for 5 days, at the end a driver gets a card that lasts for 5 years, little wonder we have a driver shortage.",
