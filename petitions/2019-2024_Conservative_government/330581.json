        "additional_details": "I want the government to allow this change to be passed to make a change in society, one that will positively impact the discrimination faced my black people everywhere. If the burqa worn by Muslims isn\u2019t prohibited due to their religion and cultural significance why should it be allowed for black people. Many Rastafarian\u2019s consider there dreads a part of the identity as with africans and box braids. Do not allow companies to discriminate based on hairstyle",
        "background": "I want parliament to stop allow this discriminatory behaviour based on cultural practises such as dreadlocks or box braids. These hairstyles are based on history and cultural lineage and by not prohibiting them your erasing years of history founded on a lack of human rights.",
