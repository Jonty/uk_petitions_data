Teach the atrocities of King Leopold II and what he did to the Congolese people. Make up for the fact that the minute colonisation started that anything they had once knew was then preached wrong. Help children understand the cultural importance of the black community around the world.",
        "background": "The realities faced by the black men and woman of Africa should be taught from the Africans perspective in British schools to impart knowledge and understanding on the implications imperialism had for so many people around the world.",
