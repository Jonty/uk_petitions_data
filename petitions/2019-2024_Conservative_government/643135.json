        "additional_details": "Trials have taken place in the US and the UK on Low Grade Glioma brain tumour patients. Low Grade Gliomas affect mainly young people. Results of the trials proved very promising. The drug will soon receive FDA approval in the US.\r\n\r\nThe trials were stopped abruptly in March 2023. There was enough evidence that Vorasidenib significantly reduced the risk of tumour progression or death. The supplier of Vorasidenib has suggested it may make the drug available on a patient-by-patient basis.",
        "background": "Low grade brain tumours have few effective medicines.  A recent trial shows Vorasidenib is effective and prolongs life.  I ask the UK government to make Vorasidenib available to clinically suitable brain tumour patients in the UK under the Early Access to Medicines Scheme",
