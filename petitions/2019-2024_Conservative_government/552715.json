        "additional_details": "In 1825, Locomotion No. 1 became the first steam locomotive to haul a passenger carrying train on a public railway. It's the jewel in the crown at Darlington's Head of Steam museum, and has been on display in the town for more than 160 years.\r\n\r\n2025 marks the 200th anniversary of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, with plans being developed for a new rail heritage quarter in Darlington. The possible loss of the jewel in the crown would be a major blow to the town.",
