        "action": "Make responsible wild camping within Dartmoor and other national parks legal.",
        "additional_details": "The benefits of wild camping in the beautiful nature for both physical and mental health are widely accepted. England and Wales lag behind the rest of the world in recognising these benefits by making wild camping almost impossible due to the complicated need to gain permission from land owners. Also, wild camping teaches and increases skills of self sufficiency; our society needs to become more self sustaining and less excepting councils and the government to look after them.",
        "background": "We want the government to change the law to allow the public right to responsibly wild camp on Dartmoor and other national parks, without the need to go through the complicated process of gaining permission.",
