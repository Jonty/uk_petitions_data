        "additional_details": "There are currently only 2 wildlife crossings in the UK, which simply isn\u2019t enough of an effort to protect our species and landscape. By building more, wildlife migration corridors can be preserved and healthy, connected landscapes promoted. They can also reduce vehicle accidents that result in human fatalities, property damage and wildlife mortality by 85-95%. Not only would this be saving money, but also saving lives.",
        "background": "Wildlife crossings are bridges built across roads and railways that are usually planted with a variety of local trees, shrubs or other vegetation. They allow birds, mammals and insects to keep moving despite a road or railway blocking their path, significantly reducing the likelihood of accidents.",
