        "additional_details": "This is academic censorship on political grounds. It doesn't align with the values of a free and democratic society, and shouldn't have a place as part of the policy of a democracy like Britain which depends on a free and educated populace.\r\n\r\nIt affects the diversity of ideas in education and limits the education of students in several subjects, e.g, History, Politics, Sociology, etc.",
        "background": "The government has ordered schools in England not to use resources from anti-capitalist organisations, categorised anti-capitalism as an \u201cextreme political stance\u201d and equated it with opposition to freedom of speech, antisemitism and endorsement of illegal activity.",
