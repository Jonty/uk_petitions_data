Various governments of our continent have opened their borders to the people of Ukraine, but as of 27 Feb 2022, we seem - if anything - to have closed ours. \r\n\r\nDo we want the history books to read that when this time came upon our generation, we failed to help? Do we want to see an avoidable humanitarian crisis develop in Ukraine's neighbouring countries, overwhelmed by refugees?\r\n\r\nWe should example for the rest of Western Europe. We can do this, and therefore we must.",
