        "additional_details": "This inequitable distribution is not just a moral issues, it's also a mistake economically & epidemiologically. More transmission worldwide means more variants, with an increased risk of variants being resistant to vaccines. People will keep dying, travel & trade will not recover.  \r\n\r\nWe need to pause rollout except for those in the top 9 groups identified by the Joint Committee on Vaccination & Immunisation (JCVI) until global supply increases & the pandemic is under control globally.",
        "background": "Vaccines are our biggest hope for overcoming the Covid-19 pandemic but vaccinating the younger, healthy section of the population now is stopping other countries ability to vaccinate their most at risk.  Supply is limited & vaccinating all those most at risk worldwide should be the priority.",
