        "additional_details": "My proposal would be to introduce a pink badge scheme, similar to the blue badge scheme for people with disabilities. It could be handed out with the red health book so this no need for additional man power and would be valid for 12 years (this is what most private car parks who have parent and child bays have as there upper limit already). This would hopefully act as a deterrent for those who do not have a child with them and don't need the wider space.",
        "background": "Most families and carers of small children, I'm sure will agree how frustrating it can be when an already limited amount of parent and child bays are taken up by those who don't have a child with them, so have no need for the additional space.",
