        "action": "Ban the use of free-running snares for trapping wildlife.",
        "additional_details": "Every year 1.7 million animals are trapped in snares in the UK. 70% of the animals trapped in these vicious snares are non-target species. Snares don\u2019t discriminate and a wide range of species are caught in snares, Cats and dogs are routinely caught in them. \r\n\r\nPeople setting free-running snares cannot ensure animal welfare as required under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, that such snares cause unnecessary suffering to mammals, are indiscriminate and should be banned.",
        "background": "While the war on wildlife is a worldwide issue, snares are without doubt an element of that war! There are non-lethal ways of managing conflicts with wild animals like foxes, including better fencing and scent-based deterrents. There is no justification for the use of cruel devices like snares.",
