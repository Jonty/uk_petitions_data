We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nThe Government's guidance on disability under the Equality Act 2010 states that you\u2019re disabled if you have a physical or mental impairment that has a \u2018substantial\u2019 and \u2018long-term\u2019 negative effect on your ability to do normal daily activities: \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/definition-of-disability-under-equality-act-2010\r\n\r\nIt is therefore already the case that under the Equality Act, anyone with a physical or a mental condition which has a substantial and long-term impact on your ability to do normal day to day activities is protected under the disability protected characteristic. This could cover people who have endometriosis, where this has a a \u2018substantial\u2019 and \u2018long-term\u2019 negative effect on their ability to do normal daily activities. So it's not clear what else you would like to happen.\r\n\r\nFind out more about the Equality Act here:\r\nhttps://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/about-discrimination/equality-act-2010-discrimination-and-your-rights/\r\n\r\nFind out more about endometriosis and the Equality Act here: https://www.endometriosis-uk.org/sites/default/files/files/Endometriosis.pdf\r\n\r\nYou may also like to sign this petition which calls for more funding for research into endometriosis and PCOS: \r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/328570"
