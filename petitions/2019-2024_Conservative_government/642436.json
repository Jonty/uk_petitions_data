We understand that you would like to change the law around assisting those illegally entering the UK. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is already an offence to facilitate a breach of immigration law.\r\n\r\nA person or organisation does not commit an offence of facilitation if the act is done by, on behalf of, or co-ordinated by Her Majesty\u2019s Coastguard or an overseas equivalent. This provides protection not only for organisations such as the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), but individual seafarers who respond to mayday relays.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/immigration\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do and how you would like this to change."
