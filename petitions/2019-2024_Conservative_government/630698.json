But we are failing them by not even having a cubicle space to see them in. \r\n\r\nRishi Sunak has made pledges to improve the NHS within 2 years.\r\n\r\n A key pledge must be the elimination of any patient being cared for in a corridor in English NHS hospitals and A&E departments",
        "background": "It is estimated that 500 patients are dying a week because of failures in emergency care in English A&E departments. \r\n\r\nEvery day 1000s of patients are cared for in a corridor, with no dignity and with the staff unable to give them the care they deserve",
