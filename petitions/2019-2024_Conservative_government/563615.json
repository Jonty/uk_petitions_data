        "additional_details": "It is requested that they be given a reasonable extension on their Tier 4 student visa so that in the coming year when hopefully more job opportunities will come into existence they are able to look for work, seeing as it is of little use looking for jobs at a time when more and more jobs are being scraped. At the same time as students are staying on looking for work their stay and travel within the UK will contribute to the economy.",
        "background": "Due to the Covid-19 pandemic an overwhelming number of jobs have been eliminated, which means that international students of the class of 2020 have not been able to benefit at all from the additional four/six months on their post-study work visa.",
