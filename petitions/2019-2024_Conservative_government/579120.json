        "additional_details": "No formal consultation was carried out before the government published its sentencing white paper. The government\u2019s equality assessment concedes some proposals would increase racial disparity. It justifies this as a \u2018proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim of protecting the public\u2019 but acknowledges there is no evidence that these measures will impact on public safety. We do not accept that the legal duty to eliminate discrimination under the Public Sector Equality Duty has been met.",
        "background": "Withdraw the discriminatory clauses from the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts bill and consult on its proposals, so that the views of those who will be most directly affected can be sought, to avoid further entrenching racial disparities for black, Asian and minority ethnic groups.",
