        "additional_details": "I fully appreciate that the UK government have given supplies to India as well as contribute to the UN COVAX scheme which helps supply vaccine to low to middle-income countries. The WHO warns that the world is heading for a very, very dark period unless more countries get access to the vaccine.\r\n\r\nThe UK has already ordered 50 million booster doses, which seems so immoral when many countries are not able to vaccinate their most vulnerable\r\n\r\nPlease share the vaccine with countries that need it",
        "background": "As I\u2019m sure you're aware, India is in the midst of a terrible Coronavirus storm, with people tragically dying on the streets. These scenes are absolutely heartbreaking, and the WHO predicts these scenes could be repeated in many countries around the world without urgent access to the vaccine.",
