        "additional_details": "During the Covid-19 pandemic student nurses took to the emergency register to help and assist on the frontline. 3rd years had to leave the programme 6 months early and through anxiety and trepidation they answered the call. Second year students took up the role of not being super numerary and worked as support staff.Those in the first year were unable to gain any placement experience but still had to pay their student fees to continue with therory work.",
        "background": "Students from 2017, 2018, 2019 and the 2020 Cohorts will all qualify with debt of around \u00a330k-\u00a370k as they embark on a life long career in the NHS and private health care. After their bravery and determination in helping the public during the pandemic we ask the government to remove their debt.",
