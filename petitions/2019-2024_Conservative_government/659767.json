        "additional_details": "The Windsor Agreement is not substantial enough to be of any practical use to the general public and is geared more around the inclusion of Northern Ireland, some red tape and the inclusion into Horizon Europe, or Copernicus (i.e climate awareness action), does not stop the threat on our doorsteps! Now rulings made around non EU passports restrict movement around Europe - 10 year, 3 months, that will no doubt be changed by not being a member..",
        "background": "In todays climate, we see conflicts such as Israel and Hammas/ Ukraine and Russia and then add in the constant terrorist threat and looming outright threat to national safety by standing alone. Rejoining the EU safeguards us so much more than alone, Let us vote on facts and clear honest reasons!",
