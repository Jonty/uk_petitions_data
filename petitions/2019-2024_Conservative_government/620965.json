        "action": "Return the Kohinoor diamond back to India.",
        "additional_details": "During the British Raj, the British Empire ruled India for almost two centuries. India used to be a very rich country with many valuables. The British Empire came to India as traders and then decided to rule India. They took a lot of valuables away from India, including the Kohinoor diamond, leaving India less wealthy. On 3rd October 2010, Germany paid the last instalment of these debt repayments for WW2 so why can't Britain give the Kohinoor back to India as an apology for their actions?",
        "background": "I want the Government/Parliament to return the Kohinoor back to its rightful owner which is India. They took the Kohinoor from India during the British Raj so they should give it back.",
