        "additional_details": "I want the Government to make it compulsory to all the online sellers such as Amazon, eBay, Argos, Curry's, Supermarkets, etc. to clearly display (by having a Union Flag symbol) whether the product they are selling is made in Britain or any other countries. This will allow public to buy a British made product over the non-British products. It will decrease Britain's dependency on other countries for imports as well as improve Britain's productivity and competitiveness.",
