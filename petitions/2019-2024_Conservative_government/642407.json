        "background": "I would like to see all ULEZ, LEZ and CAZ cameras, poles and feeder pillars to be painted bright orange, I would like this done for 3 reasons, number 1 being that they are easier for drivers to see, 2 easier for visually impaired people to see and 3 so that are distinguished from speed cameras",
