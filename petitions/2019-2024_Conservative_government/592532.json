        "additional_details": "Currently the statistics are saying there is a shortage of 100k HGV drivers, yet it's a nightmare to book a test due to the thousands of people waiting to get them.\r\nIf there is a shortage of drivers, then scrap the class 2 rigid license and have the class 1 articulated only to reduce costs for people coming into the industry and having to pay over \u00a33000 to get all licences.\r\nThere is enough people looking for work who can't afford to get the license, so put funding forward to help the economy.",
        "background": "Rather than put the \"HGV shortage\" on the list for people from other countries to drive here, create the 100 thousand jobs from people on benefits who need to work in this country, also scrap the class 2 test and have the class 1 only to reduce the cost for people who want to get the HGV license",
