        "additional_details": "Students across the UK have missed around 6 months of in school learning since the 23rd of March. Causing a huge effect on students across the entirety of the UK, and there mental health and well being. Students all round are struggling with the extreme stress of having to do exams with no initial preparations and loss of school time, hence this is why I am writing to the Government to cancel GCSEs and A Levels and provide predicted grades to show the true reflections of all students in the UK.",
        "background": "The Government should cancel GCSEs and A Levels in 2021 all due to the disruption of Covid-19. Over 6 months of schooling was lost during the first initial lockdown causing students to lose tremendous amounts of learning time. This has already had a huge impact on the studying of so so many.",
