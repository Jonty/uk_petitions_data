Excellent home-schooling resources and processes are already in place.\r\nThe risk to our amazing teachers\u2019 lives is real. Children could also bring infection home to their families and grandparents.\r\nLimited opening will do little to help parents return to work and economic arguments are weak.\r\nSave lives, protect the NHS, keep children at home",
