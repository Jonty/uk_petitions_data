        "action": "Implement a policy of \"Not Currently Recycled: Not Currently Sold\" for packaging",
        "additional_details": "It is a fact of modern life that essential goods such as food and cleaning items will be sold in some form of packaging which the customer must dispose of at end of use. Despite increasing efforts by citizens to recycle all they can, many of the packaging materials used still cannot be recycled. Small changes net small results. An industry level change is required to minimise the amount of non recyclable waste that ends up in landfill. Allow industry up to 10 years to change their manufacturing.",
        "background": "The government should make plans that within the next 10 - 15 years a policy of 'Not Currently Recycled, Not Currently Sold' will be introduced for the packaging of common consumer goods i.e food, household goods. This would see products such as plastic PVC film that fail to conform being removed.",
