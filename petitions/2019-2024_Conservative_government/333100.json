        "additional_details": "With regard to eating disorders, calorie labelling can enhance disordered attitudes towards food, inhibit recovery and trigger relapse. Additionally, calorie counting is a major factor leading to unhealthy attitudes towards food, contributing towards the onset of eating disorders. Whilst I understand that obesity currently effects more people than eating disorders, the approach of calorie labelling encourages unhealthy and unsustainable weight loss, whilst ignoring the root causes of obesity.",
        "background": "Calorie labelling can have detrimental effects on individuals suffering from eating disorders and those in recovery. Adding calorie labels to menus fails to address the deeper socio-economic factors that contribute towards unhealthy lifestyles and obesity.",
