        "additional_details": "Nurses go to work and risk bringing the virus home to their loved ones. They are paid well under the national average and it is shameful that these heroes, who are saving lives and going towards the danger, are paid such a meager wage which results in many of them requiring food banks. The pay and benefits are better at Aldi. \r\nAsk yourself, where would you go if they weren't there to look after you when you get sick. Pay the nurses fairly. Maybe it could come from your mp's 2020 2.7% payrise.",
        "background": "During the coronavirus pandemic the advice is to stay at home and create social distance, whilst nurses are forced to work in groups directly with people who have the virus. All for an incredibly low wage which is not reflective of the work they do, as with other public sector workers.",
