        "action": "Pass legislation ensuring it is illegal to not accept cash as a form of payment",
        "additional_details": "Since the start of the covid 19 crisis, more and more retailers are refusing to accept cash as payment.  This discriminates disproportionately against some of the poorest in society, and limits choice of payment method for all citizens.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence to prove that contactless payments are any safer than accepting cash, therefore there should be no discrimination in which payment methods are acceptable.\r\n\r\nEnsure that cash can be used is by making it illegal not to accept cash for payment.",
        "background": "The right to use cash is not a legal right at present. We call on the Government to legislate, to guarantee cash and its use in the future is protected in law.\r\nWe call upon the Govt to pass legislation to enshrine in law the right to use cash in everyday life, and pay for goods and services in cash",
