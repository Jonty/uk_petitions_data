        "additional_details": "It is only fair that key workers children are also entitled to free school meals as us as parents still have to work to provide for family and also serve & look after the people in the country in this epidemic. We either are too tired or have barely enough time to make a packed lunch 5 days a week for a child. Helping us with this will put less stress on us and give us motivation and peace of mind knowing our children are well fed and cared for while we help the whole nation.",
