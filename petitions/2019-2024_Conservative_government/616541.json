        "action": "Change the Domestic Violence Abuse Act to also include Females as perpetrators",
        "additional_details": "The Domestic Violence Abuse, has not considered the psychological impact that Men can also suffer within relationships.  The Mental Health Statistics show that Men are the highest rate at 75% of suicide victims.  It also shows that 25% suffer from Mental Health due to Divorce and relationship breakdowns.  The Act is not balanced to reflect Equality for All victims of DVA.  This is being most definitely manipulated within Society causing many issues for children and families within our community.",
        "background": "The Domestic Violence Abuse agenda is biased towards Women being the Victims and Males targeted as the perpetrators.  This is due to statistics heavily weighing in favour of females reporting DVA to the Police.  Men are less likely to come forward to report claims of DVA made towards Women.",
