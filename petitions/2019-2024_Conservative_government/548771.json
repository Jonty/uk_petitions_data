        "additional_details": "Evidence shows that rather than improving student safety, SBPOs risk causing irreparable damage. SBPOs create a climate of fear & alienation, particularly for working class students & students of colour. Minor behavioural issues are turned into criminal issues, fast-tracking young people into the criminal justice system & feeding the school-to-prison pipeline. Instead of more police in schools, we must look for alternatives, investing in racially literate counsellors, youth workers & teachers.",
