Local councils, not the Government or House of Commons, are responsible for deciding who is eligible for a blue badge.\r\n\r\nWe have published the following petition, which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nIncrease funding for research into Endometriosis and PCOS: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/328570"
