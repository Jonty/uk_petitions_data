        "additional_details": "Barcelona players have taken a 70 % pay cut and are also supporting the pay for their non playing staff.  Some of our clubs are continuing to pay astronomical payments to players whilst their support staff are either furloughed or are being supported through some of the government schemes set up to support the country through Coronavirus. This is a crazy situation given that when we come through this, we will have many economic challenges to deal with. Why should the tax payer fund this?",
        "background": "PL football clubs should not be able to claim government subsidies for payroll of support staff whilst continuing to pay large sums to players. If they have money to fund the players they have money to support all staff without calling on government to subsidise.",
