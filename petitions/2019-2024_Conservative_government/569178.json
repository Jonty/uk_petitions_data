        "additional_details": "Neonicotinoids pose a significant environmental risk, particularly to bees and other pollinators. The UK bee population is already in crisis and we must do everything we can to protect them and other pollinating insects, as they perform a vital role in the growth of our crops. Even though the exception granted this week is limited, it sets a dangerous precedent that the pesticide will be allowed to be used in the future. This must not happen.",
        "background": "Completely ban the use of pesticide products containing neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, including the limited usage granted by the enviroment secretary this week for treating sugar beet crops.",
