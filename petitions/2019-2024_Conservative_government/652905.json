Research undertaken by our youth campaign Politics 4 All suggests only 1 in 5 of the young people surveyed agree with the statement \"I have been equipped with the tools and knowledge to be politically literate at school\". We would like to improve this by encouraging MPs to visit schools and colleges so young people are at the minimum getting to interact with an elected representative and ask questions.",
