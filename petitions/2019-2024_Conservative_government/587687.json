        "additional_details": "I believe that the Government grant and with its recent reduction is not enough to make electric vehicles accessible and affordable to most people. The grant comes into play when purchasing a new electric vehicle and means that there is an amount deducted from the total price. This is supposed to be to help make the electric vehicle transportation proposition more enticing to buyers and to make them more accessible to a wide range of people, but the current grant simply isn't doing enough.",
        "background": "I would like the Government to raise the amount of the grant towards electric vehicles to help make them more accessible and to help boost the sales of such automobiles. Therefore, helping the environment and helping the government to reach its 2030 target.",
