        "additional_details": "I propose that legislation is brought in to prevent any pay rise to MP\u2019s salaries before the rest of the public sector. The majority of MPs are already financially secure and do not require pay rises especially when there are nurses and teachers forced to use food banks because of their dedication to their profession. https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/politics/mps-get-8-pay-rises-in-10-years-while-nurses-salaries-are-slashed/12/08/",
        "background": "Since 2010 MPs in England have received a pay rise from \u00a365k to nearly \u00a382k, beyond the rate of inflation, and during austerity measures which saw real wages for the public sector such as the NHS and schools fall.",
