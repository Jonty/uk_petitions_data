        "additional_details": "How can People budget? It was promised by November in one tranche, then 3 payments and now we don\u2019t even know whether it will be before Christmas or not.  \r\n\r\nWe already know \u00a3100 of assistance with home heating oil will only be ready after Christmas and some Recipients being checked beforehand for eligibility. In contrast to Great Britain 58% percent of Northern Ireland Households are on oil fired central heating which has also experienced significant price rises in a similar way to gas supplies.",
        "background": "There is a lack of parity across the UK with Northern Ireland not receiving the same support in the midst of the Cost of Living Crisis due to political impasse.\r\n\r\nWe call for Minister Grant Shapps\r\nto centrally confirm a payment date by early December for essential assistance before Christmas.",
