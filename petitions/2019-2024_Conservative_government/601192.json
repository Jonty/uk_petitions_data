        "additional_details": "Bonfire night has become firework month due to the commercialisation of fireworks. \r\n\r\nThe irony of people wanting their children to see them in their garden at the risk of their future survival on this planet beggars belief.\r\n\r\nIf a neighbour has a party with loud music, the police can understandably be called. Yet neighbours can let off fireworks all evening and late into the night to no consequence. \r\n\r\nIt is anti-social and has to stop.",
        "background": "Animals become stressed, the environment is impacted by more carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen being released into the air and thousands of people put extra strain on the NHS each year to treat firework-related injuries. And this is ALL AVOIDABLE.",
