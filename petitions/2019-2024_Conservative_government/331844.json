They\u2019re people who want to live a life however, the support from the U.K. government to Israel must stop and must consider the effect this has on regular people who are just trying to live. Instead, try and support Palestine to create a new economy, one where it can live in peace with Israel if they stop this nonsense for their \u201cpromised land\u201d, because God doesn\u2019t exist unless you can prove it.",
