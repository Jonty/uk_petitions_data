        "additional_details": "We would like the UK government to stop the sales of arms to Saudi Arabia, remove military and diplomatic support to the Saudi-led coalition who are indiscriminately aerial bombing Yemen resulting in 100,000 deaths (minimum). The CAAT agreed that \"UK arms have been central to the devastation of Yemen.\" In 2015 the attack on Yemen saw sales of UK bombs increase from \u00a39m to over \u00a31bn in three months. Amnesty International have shown that UK arms are being used on civilian targets.",
        "background": "Yemen is currently suffering with cholera, Covid-19, economic collapse and war, along with a famine. It is estimated that 22 million people will die. The country is on the brink of extinction and the UK is complicit by selling arms to Saudi. It is the world's worst humanitarian crisis in a century.",
