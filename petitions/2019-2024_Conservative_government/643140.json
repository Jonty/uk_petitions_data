        "additional_details": "I feel that everyone including people with learning disabilities should have access to the community and also to be able to freely access venues such as Gyms/attractions/shops and many other things. \r\nMany people with learning disabilities don\u2019t have access to online banking or debit cards as they are vulnerable and having cards could leave them open to abuse. They often are given money by guardians in form of cash so that they can meet their needs from week to week and not being able to use it means they cannot enjoy things that others can which is not inclusive or fair.",
        "background": "Make it mandatory that businesses continue to accept cash as many people with additional needs and with learning disabilities are unable to use bank cards and this takes away independence and  limits access to the community",
