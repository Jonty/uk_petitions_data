Manslaughter and Actual Bodily Harm are already offences, and it would be up to the Crown Prosecution Service to decided if there were circumstances where intentionally spreading coronavirus could lead to being charged with one of these offences.\r\n\r\nWe have published a petition calling for mandatory jail sentence for assaulting (eg. spitting/coughing) emergency worker, which you might like to sign: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/309432\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about coronavirus and how you can protect yourself and others here:\r\n\r\nwww.gov.uk/coronavirus\r\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/\r\n\r\nThe Government has also created an online service to help you out what you can do if you\u2019re struggling because of coronavirus: https://www.gov.uk/find-coronavirus-support\r\n\r\nYou can read NHS tips to help if you are worried about coronavirus here: https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/coronavirus-covid-19-anxiety-tips\r\n\r\nYou can read impartial analysis of the Government response to coronavirus and policy developments here: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/coronavirus/\r\n\r\nYou may also be interested to know that because of the large number of petitions that have been started in relation to coronavirus, the Petitions Committee has been questioning the Government about its response to the coronavirus outbreak.\r\n \r\nFind out more and watch the Committee put questions suggested by petitioners to Government Ministers and the Deputy Chief Medical Officer: https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/326/petitions-committee/news/145767/committee-question-deputy-chief-medical-officer-and-ministers-on-coronavirus-response/\r\n \r\nRead letters asking further questions of Government Ministers: https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/326/petitions-committee/publications/3/correspondence/"
