        "additional_details": "Bombing of any kind causes on-going suffering and should be governed by the same rules that control chemical and other weapons. \r\n\r\nBlanket bombing causes huge destruction and suffering, alienates the victims and serves little positive purpose other than to enrich the arms manufacturers. \r\n\r\nHuman nature can tend towards violence, but governments should set a good example and show maximum respect for humanity.",
        "background": "Liaise with world powers to ensure control of the arms industry. The UN must govern profits to reassure the public that the arms industry is not profiteering. The UN can use profits to create a peace-keeping force able to protect those in danger, support war-torn/refugee populations and their hosts.",
