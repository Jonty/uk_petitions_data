        "additional_details": "Parliament should introduce this into the PSHE syllabus as early as primary school. It\u2019s left to parents to teach children these morals however not everyone has parental figures. This can reduce sexual assault on a great scale if every child is taught the different forms of sexual assault.",
        "background": "Younger children need to learn how wrong and traumatic any form of sexual assault/harassment is. The subject of sexual assault is introduced to younger people far too late in life; it should be taught much earlier. Sexual assault is not just rape, every form it takes should be taught and considered.",
