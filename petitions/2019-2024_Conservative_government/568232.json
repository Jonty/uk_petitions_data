        "additional_details": "Some students are also parents who are now home schooling or who also work on top of FE studying. School exams have been cancelled as children have faced disruption and rightly so. Last year as a functional skills student, we were the last to know what was happening with our exams, this time I think we deserve to not be left until last and our exams need to be cancelled due to disruption to adequate learning and also for the safety of students, their families and teachers.",
        "background": "Students due to take exams for functional skills this year should have them cancelled like the other exams. Most students have been remote learning since courses began and it's unfair to expect exams to go ahead for students who have received no face to face learning at all.",
