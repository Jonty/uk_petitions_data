        "additional_details": "We know that changing our diets is one way of lowering individual carbon footprints as part of the broader effort to prevent climate catastrophe. Yet, consumers currently lack sufficient information to make informed choices about the products they buy and consume. Providing such information in the form of a standardised labelling system could help consumers to choose more sustainable diets and will raise awareness of the impact that certain foods can have on our environment.",
        "background": "The government should make it obligatory for supermarkets to display the climate impact of products they sell to enable consumers to make informed choices about what they buy. This could be done in a similar format to the existing traffic lights labelling system used for nutritional information.",
