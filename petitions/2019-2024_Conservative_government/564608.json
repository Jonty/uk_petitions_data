Neighbouring countries have closed their borders with the UK and there is a real danger of immediate shortages of essentials.\r\n\r\nThe UK government must not be distracted from its primary objective of protecting its citizens. Brexit is a very important issue, but one that can be delayed without causing harm to people. An epidemic can not be out on hold, and do had to be the focus of our attention.",
