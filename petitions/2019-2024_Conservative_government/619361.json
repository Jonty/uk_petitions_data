        "additional_details": "In the year 2020, there were 24,856 offences of coercive control recorded by the police in England and Wales ( ONS). Schools and Colleges show ignorance by ignoring problems that happen on their very own doorstep, which leaves students vulnerable, unprepared and at risk.\r\n\r\nEducational establishments have a duty of care, they are letting their students down by neglecting the realities that many young people face in romantic relationships and failing to teach them about such widespread issues.",
        "background": "I am calling on the government to consider making lessons about domestic abuse and healthy relationships a mandatory part of PSHE and related classes. These lessons would benefit ALL pupils from ALL walks of life as domestic abuse does not discriminate and these crimes are rife and ruin lives.",
