Trying to get on the home ownership ladder is hard enough without having to compete against BTL landlords trying to build a retirement nest egg and buying up 'units' to let out. We don't want to pay someone else's mortgage and secure their future, We can afford and want to pay our own mortgage, we don't want to rent forever, Why is it acceptable for us to pay someone's else's mortgage? but not our own?",
