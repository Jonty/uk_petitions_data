        "additional_details": "London and the UK is increasingly becoming unsafe for its citizens. \r\n\r\nPolice response times have been constantly increasing, leaving citizens at risk.\r\n\r\nAccording to Statista the overall crime rate in the UK has begun to rapidly increase since 2013.\r\n\r\nCitizens can only use \"reasonable force\", FARB/ID spray and a personal alarm to legally defend themselves in the streets, all of which are lackluster when life is at risk.\r\n\r\nLegalise pepper spray so citizens have a fighting chance against criminals.",
        "background": "I and many others want the Government to legalise the sale of pepper spray as a self defence option to law abiding citizens.\r\n\r\nExclude pepper spray in a small canister (55ml or less) from Section 5(1)(b) of the Firearms Act 1968 so citizens can legally buy and carry pepper spray in public.",
