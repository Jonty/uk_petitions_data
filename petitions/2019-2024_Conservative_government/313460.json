Despite knowing this risk they continue to work and to serve others.  As a direct result of infection contracted whilst at work many will become ill and sadly some will die.  Their selflessness and sacrifice should not be forgotten.  \r\n\r\nThose who give their lives must not be forgotten.",
        "background": "It should be inscribed with the names of all those NHS staff and carers who have already made, and those that still will make, the ultimate sacrifice of giving their lives whilst providing care and comfort to others.",
