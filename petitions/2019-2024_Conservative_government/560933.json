        "additional_details": "The government should research and help to develop other ways of fuel for cars, as electric is not very reliable, expensive and Industry damaging. Further more car manufacturers have very little time to develop reliable technology and to make sure it is met to standards and some manufacturers haven\u2019t started to developing electric cars. This means the ban could potentially make car manufacturers loose business and eventually go bust, which is devastating to the economy. Not everyone can be ready",
        "background": "To lift the ban on petrol and diesel cars and to find other methods of low carbon fuel. The country is simply not ready for this change and the technology is to distant in the future.",
