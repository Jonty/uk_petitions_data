        "additional_details": "Throughout and prior to the pandemic a sub-par response on a national level has led to the government and schools not giving students the adequate support they need through this crisis. A proposed extension will not help, this will only increase the amount of time for us to stress and mentally suffer as we try to retain the excessive amount of content from up to 3 years of already flawed education. So many of us are being left to the mercy of what are already physically and mentally testing exams after missing months of content. Something must be done.",
        "background": "The GCSE and A-Level exams for students who will sit them this academic year must be cancelled.This does not mean students get an extension and sit the exams at a later date, this means cancel the 2021 GCSE and A-Level Exams.",
