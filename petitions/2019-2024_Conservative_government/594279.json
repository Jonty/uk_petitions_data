        "additional_details": "Nottingham Goose Fair is over 700 years old, and the people of Nottingham are keen to protect its heritage by ensuring that people from all financial backgrounds can still enjoy the experience every year. Nottingham City Councils proposal of a perimeter fence and entry fee change the dynamic of the fair forever and could have a detrimental effect on its future. Associated showmen agree with this and are considering a move, however the forest is still the preferred site.",
        "background": "Keep the fair open for all to visit free of charge, as the fair is fun and safe for the residents of Nottingham. Given that it is an outdoor establishment there should be no need to control entry from a covid-19 perspective.",
