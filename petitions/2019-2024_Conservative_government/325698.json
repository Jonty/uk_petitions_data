Over 240k weddings took place last year with the high season being July, August and September. The hospitality industry has been given guidelines to re-open from the 4th July. So far, there are no future guidelines for weddings. Without the start of the wedding economy in it's highest season, it will suffer dramatically, just as the hospitality sector will without it's summer trade.",
