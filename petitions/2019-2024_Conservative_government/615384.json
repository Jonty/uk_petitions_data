        "additional_details": "Recently, my school has introduced rules preventing students to go to the toilet during school hours. This is not only violating human rights, but has many other negative unseen elements. For example, not being able to go to the toilet increases risks of bladder problems later on in life, along with reducing concentration in lessons. This will eventually lead to worse results in exams.",
        "background": "Introduce legislation which makes it illegal for teachers to not allow students to go to the toilet during school hours. Furthermore, harsh penalties should be in place for teachers who will not abide by these laws.",
