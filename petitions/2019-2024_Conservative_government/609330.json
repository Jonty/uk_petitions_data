        "additional_details": "Covid-19 has damaged the UK society physically but also mentally and emotionally. The mental health services are stretched to the limit and too often fail to help those who need them most. A common barrier is the need for trained mental health professionals. Educating people across society to recognise and support people with mental health problems such as early stages of depression or anxiety via basic CBT training, could ease the load on NHS and local support groups.",
        "background": "The Government should create, fund and promote voluntary courses for anyone who wants to learn about mental health and support their family and community. Courses should be free and accessible for people of all backgrounds, including adolescents.",
