This colludes with financial abuse practices commonly used by perpetrators.\r\nCMS also needs two proofs of address to be able to start the case, resulting in early closure of cases and a sense of an additional blow to survivors of abuse. The system needs to be reviewed.",

However, as it stands, it does not support victims/survivors of domestic abuse appropriately.\r\nThe understanding of domestic abuse has evolved in the last decade and their policy needs to be up-to-date and sensitive to cases.",
