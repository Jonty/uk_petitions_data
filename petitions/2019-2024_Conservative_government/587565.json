        "additional_details": "A poorly publicised campaign was inadequate grounds for an opt-out process for sharing confidential patient data with third parties (NHS digital). Ethically the government has a duty to get valid consent from all patients before their data is shared with any third parties for 'research and planning' purposes. Patients not opting-out may be unaware that their unwittingly shared data could (despite careful use) identify them and/or be used, even if it is not sold, to make profit for companies.",
        "background": "By June 23rd 2021 all NHS digital requires patients to opt-out of a process of medical record sharing for 'research and planning'. As an NHS patient I was not aware this is due to happen. I want patients to be fully informed about the consequences of how their data is about to be used.",
