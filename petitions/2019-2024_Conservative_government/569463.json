Circumstances for child support/benefit could mean than a spouse does not work to care for dependents whilst the other spouse earns over \u00a350k.  The household income being \u00a350k and the charge being implemented.\r\nIf a household has two parents earning \u00a349,999 each ( a total income of \u00a399,998) then no charge is implemented.\r\nThe couple who earn \u00a349,999 each are at an advantage.",
        "background": "Review the \u00a350k limit of Gross salary for individuals in a household with independents.  Currently if spouse A earns \u00a350,001 and Spouse B earns \u00a3nil in a household, the child benefit received in a tax year will need to be repaid.  If Spouse A earns \u00a349,999 and Spouse B \u00a349,999, no repayment is made.",
