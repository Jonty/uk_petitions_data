A breakdown of my family sent me down this route recently. \r\nI work hard whilst also looking after my 2 young children.\r\nUniversal credit helps me support my children with our living costs. \r\nA \u00a320 a week cut wouldn't get me into work fulltime. Far worse..\r\nIt will potentially make me lose my job completely. I will struggle with transport costs and other costs. It could force me into unemployment. \r\nPlease sign and help my family. \r\nYou could be in my shoes one day.",
