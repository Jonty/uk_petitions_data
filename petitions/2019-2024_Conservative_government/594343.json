        "additional_details": "I want them to change the blanket policy of when your 16 you have to go to college or a job. I want them to consider the sen kids that are unable to do these day to day things. The kids that suffer with their mental health more being forced into these things. Child benefit needs more options other than you go or you don't go. For some families not a simply choice. Once child benefit stops all other benefits stop where does that leave families. If a child is signed off by a mental health professional that should be taken into account. The government see every sen child as the same and are failing sen families across the country it's time all sen needs were judged on a individual basis.",
        "background": "My 16 Yr has just been diagnosed with asd on top of all his other learning conditions. Camhs have said he is not suitable for main stream college. But child benefit see it as black/white you go to college or you don't. There's no inbetween so many kids and families are struggling because of that.",
