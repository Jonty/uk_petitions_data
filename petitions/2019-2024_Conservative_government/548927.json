        "additional_details": "What is the government doing to help year 12's for their A Level exams next year considering the fact that we have missed 5 months of school learning (which definitely is not the same as learning at home)? GCSE lasts 3 years whereas A level lasts 2 years and is double content. Why is it that next year's GCSE students and A Level students are being treated differently when we both are disadvantaged for next year's exams? We are students after all regardless of what year we are in and have the same feelings.",
        "background": "Year 10 students are struggling to complete that 'small amount of content' (compared to A levels)imagine what the Alevel students are going through. If they get can get a change in their exams why not the year 12's? We both have been affected by the pandemic so why are the year 12's forgotten about?",
