        "additional_details": "The reason for this is not only because this provides needed clarity to businesses, especially small ones that were already entering a risky environment financially (even before COVID) but also to help those that would otherwise be unemployed.\r\n\r\nIt is not a worker's fault that a virus has led to a decrease in profit. It is not fair that they should suffer for the sake of \"kickstarting the economy\" quicker.\r\n\r\nTo deny an extension to this would be to prioritise profit over the welfare of the people.",
        "background": "We want the furloughing scheme to be extended past the 31st of October 2020 to at least the 31st of February 2021, extending it by an extra four months.",
