        "additional_details": "The gov.uk website clearly states that parents can withdraw their child from any Primary sex education lessons taught outside the science curriculum. This fact is not being outlined to parents. Transparency is vital. Parents ought to be fully informed of their rights, especially those who may have trouble with comprehension (e.g. language barriers) \"Private parts\" should suffice regarding safeguarding as there's clearly no confusion as to what is alluded to. Age appropriate language is crucial.",
        "background": "At present, the government has provided statutory guidance on RSE. The content regarding sex education is wholly  inappropriate. Children as young as five (Year 1) are being taught names of genitals and Year 2 have content including \"Explain that our genitals help us make babies when we are older\".",

Sex education is not compulsory in primary school, and the Government's statutory guidance on Relationships and sex education (RSE) and health education says that it is up to primary schools to determine whether they need to cover any additional content on sex education to meet the needs of their pupils.\r\n\r\nWhere primary schools choose to teach aspects of sex education, the Government's guidance is clear that schools must set this out in their policy, that all schools should consult with parents on what is to be covered, and that\r\nschools that choose to teach sex education must allow parents a right to withdraw their children.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not clear what parts of the Government's guidance you want to be reviewed, or changed.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
