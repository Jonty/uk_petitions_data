        "additional_details": "With all the uncertainty in the world, losing loved ones, not having loved ones near us and the added stress of having to rearrange a wedding it would help for couples that have already given notice to have their marriage certificates extended for 12-18 months. This will also put less pressure on registry offices around the U.K., as trying to rebook all the couples in to give notice again, processing new notices as well as having to deal with the backlog of birth registrations",
        "background": "For couples that were due to get married this year, that have already given notice please allow marriage certificates to be extended for 12-18 months to ease stress of replanning weddings. Also allow for small admin changes like venue addresses for a small admin fee.",
