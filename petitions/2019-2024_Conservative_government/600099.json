        "additional_details": "I want the Government to re-introduce the death penalty to protect the citizens of the UK. A typical murderer in the UK gets a life sentence which is around 15-20 years, after this they are released. This means the murderer has another opportunity to kill UK citizens. If the murderer was dispatched instead, then there would be no risk of the criminal killing anymore people.",
        "background": "I want the Government to re-introduce the death penalty for the most heinous crimes, for example serial killing and mass murders. I also want Parliament to look over other abhorrent crimes and increase the punishments for them, to dissuade people from committing them.",
