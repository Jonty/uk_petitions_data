        "additional_details": "Gambling/betting causes debt & poverty. The lockdown will cause a surge in gambling  thanks to all the ads on TV & online, and the way gambling is so easy to do when in self-isolation and bored. Offers of free bets tempt those suddenly left without income.\r\nThe gambling industry has been linked to evictions, house repossessions and bankruptcy. The debts run up during the COVID-19 crisis could take years to repay - let's not add to them.",
        "background": "UK gambling/betting companies should be shut during the COVID-19 pandemic. Internet companies should be *asked* to voluntarily block international gambling websites. This industry hides money offshore & doesn't help our economy - instead of causes suffering to millions.",
