        "additional_details": "Frequently, people buy fireworks and start letting them off on 31st October for Halloween. They are then setting them off between Halloween and bonfire night, then again at Christmas, and again at New year. It is non-stop. It is difficult to predict when they might be set off, and as such it is difficult to prepare for them when you have people with additional needs at home and when you have animals. They cause distress and anxiety, and can make already serious medical conditions such as seizures life-threatening.",
