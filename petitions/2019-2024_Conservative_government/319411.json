        "additional_details": "The fastest route to economic recovery is to support indigenous industry and businesses where possible. Almost every product which is sold on the internet fails to state country of manufacture, so those people who wish to support the country, want to limit their impact on the environment and wish to uphold ethical standards are unable to do so. By simply making it mandatory to state country of origin in the main body of the product description, the public can make informed purchases.",
        "background": "When buying products on the internet the country of origin is rarely stated, to enable the public to make an educated and ethical purchase, country of origin should be clearly declared in the first three lines of the product description.",
