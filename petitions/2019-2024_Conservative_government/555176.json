        "additional_details": "I would of purchased the test privately had I been told about strep B and it would not of got so severe as it did had I been educated about strep b in appointments. 40% of pregnant women have strep B, 1 in 2000 babies are born with it and 1 in 10 babies die from it. Women are not aware of it and lives could be saved. I wish that it was mandatory education at midwife appointments and options are given for private purchase of tests that cost just \u00a334. Like the harmony test for downs syndrome.",
        "background": "My daughter Lexie got Strep B Meningitis at 3 weeks old, she almost died and she suffered brain damage as a result of the infection. Our lives have been devastated by something that could of been easily prevented with a little bit of education and an opportunity to purchase a test myself.",
