        "additional_details": "So many A level and GCSE students have been unfairly penalised in 2020 due to students not sitting exams because of Covid 19.  It has lead to young people not being able to take up their places in university or get onto the courses they want.  There has been an unfair disparity across the grading of this years exams and we cannot let students from state schools be unfairly represented or penalised again next year.",
        "background": "Ensure the Goverment, exams board & schools work together to ensure the term + of missed lessons due to Covid 19 is taken into consideration for the exam sitting in June 2021. It is impossible for students to catch up so much work, so exams/curriculum need to be adjusted accordingly to reflect this.",
