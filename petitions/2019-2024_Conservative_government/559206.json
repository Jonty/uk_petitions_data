        "additional_details": "Every year, in the time surrounding bonfire night animals are terrified, the constant loud bangs trigger PTSD in those such as veterans and fires and injuries are caused by those who do not properly understand how to use and discard of fireworks in a safe manner. Fireworks are constantly misused by those looking to wreak havoc and are essentially a mini explosive. Limiting the sale of fireworks would minimise the harm caused yet still allow families the fun of bonfire night at scheduled events.",
