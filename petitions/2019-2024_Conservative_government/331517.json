        "additional_details": "It is unfair and insane that we don't have a say about our children safety. Why should you fine a parent that like me, is scared and don't feel safe sending my young kid school. I see people disrespecting basic rules everytime I have to make shopping for my mother. It will be much harder to keep kids from kissing or hugging each other! And it is unfair to tell children \"don't kiss or hug your friends, don't share with them\", because it's the opposite of what they were thought. Reconsider please.",
        "background": "My mother was diagnosed with Lung Cancer when all this pandemic started. I left work to stay home and care for her. I'm really scared to send my child to school with \"bubles\" of 30 kids and don't feel safe. How can any parent be fined for deciding what's best for their children and family?",
