        "additional_details": "The police forces within the UK already promote the use of body cameras for the protection of their staff and the public. There is no reason social workers should not wear body cams. This would create evidence that can make or break a family, court case or both. We need to know what children are being asked, what parents are being told, and what other professionals are being updated with. There are far too many children being neglected by local authorities. Let's change this. NOW.",
        "background": "Local Authority and CAFCASS Social Workers visit children, parents, guardians and families at home, school, hospitals and within the community. It is essential that their suggestions, feedback, questioning and actions are recorded for everyone's safety. This is vital evidence & proof.",
