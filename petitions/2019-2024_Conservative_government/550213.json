        "action": "Start 24 hour trains up in London.",
        "additional_details": "I believe the Government or Parliament should do it as London is a major city, things are open at all hours. Now quarantine is easing up, more things are open and travelling  home from central London is expensive as cabs are the only option as buses do not always go to peoples desired location. Trains are affordable and usually the quickest route of transport, as a major city having 24 hour trains I believe is vital.",
        "background": "Since coronavirus the last trains have now been at the times 11PM to 12AM. Now we as a country are opening back up since quarantine I think it\u2019s a necessity for trains to be 24 hours again and not just on Friday and Saturdays like before.",
