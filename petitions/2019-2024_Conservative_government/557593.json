        "action": "Change the eligibility requirements for the SEIS grant going into 2nd lockdown",
        "additional_details": "Because many self employed slipped through the cracks through the first lockdown and recieved little to no financial help. We cannot survive another lockdown of no income when everyone else recieves 80% again whether they are in a new job or a job theyve been at for years. Now in a new tax year, the SEIS grant should include the 19/20 tax return and not just the 18/19 return.",
        "background": "The SEIS grant specifically states it is only eligible for those who were eligible for the first and second grants. But now we are in a new tax year, it should accomodate those who had to struggle the first time as they werent eligible but now are and cannot survive a second lockdown with no income.",
