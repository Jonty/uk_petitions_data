        "action": "Review and reduce parking restrictions for delivery driver's/couriers.",
        "additional_details": "During the pandemic we have seen the pivotal role delivery driver's have played keeping the country going in the lockdown periods. In some locations restrictions make it impossible to deliver goods without risking a ticket. Huge numbers of drivers are self employed and parking fines are paid by the delivery driver and not by the vast wealth of companys they deliver on behalf of. Many roads that are perfectly safe to stop on have restrictions that mean stopping to load/unload is not permitted.",
        "background": "We would like the Government to review and liaise with local authorities to discuss possible changes and the relaxing of parking restrictions for the purposes of loading and unloading. Vast numbers of delivery driver's are self employed and parking fines are paid by the delivery driver's themselves.",
