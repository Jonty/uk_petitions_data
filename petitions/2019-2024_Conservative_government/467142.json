        "additional_details": "The last 6 months have been a big struggle for many students, as not everyone\u2019s home environment nor school is the same. Some students receive daily calls and meetings from their teachers to help them work while others are only left with a textbook and no communication at all. Some students have no internet access within their home which limits their learning.\r\n\r\nThe Government cannot rely on the students independent learning to carry them through their exams. This is not fair.",
        "background": "Extend the period of time that we have to take our exams so we are able to meet our teachers face-to-face and catch up on the work effectively. Alternatively, they should cut the content (as they have with 2021 GCSE students) so we\u2019re less pressured to learn everything in the next 8 months.",
