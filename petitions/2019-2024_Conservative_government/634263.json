Deciding on when to investigate a paying parent is an operational matter for the Child Maintenance Service.\r\n\r\nIf you're unhappy with how the Child Maintenance Service has handled your case you can find out how to complain about this here: https://www.gov.uk/child-maintenance-service/complaints-and-appeals"
