        "additional_details": "This change will not affect those who wish to socialise in pubs, clubs or other venues but will significantly increase the safety to vulnerable people. The wearing of masks in these situations will help protect others from people who may have Asymptomatic COVID-19 and be unaware. In a recent you gov poll 66% of people said that they would most likely continue to wear masks, however unless everyone does the risk remains. This would save lives for little effort.",
        "background": "COVID-19 levels remain a concern especially for vulnerable people. The wearing of masks for the majority of people in these situations is not a hardship and will enhance the protection of vulnerable people who have no choice about shopping or using public transport.",
