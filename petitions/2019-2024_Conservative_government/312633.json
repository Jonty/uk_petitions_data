        "additional_details": "The support available for new businesses in these times isn't enough, especially when a household isn't entitled to other benefits (i.e. Universal Credit). Many households that fit into this category will be struggling severely. Loans are available but the nature of many new businesses means that revenue and profit can be expected to be low and repaying loans isn't feasible. It's fantastic that the government is covering the 80% wage for older businesses but newer businesses need more help.",
        "background": "Find a way to extend the Self-employment Income Support Scheme to cover business started in the last year. A potential solution could be to offer a loan that is repayable next year. If the claimant has filed a tax return in the meantime for self employment and is eligible, the loan is void.",
