        "additional_details": "Paying for a full education but in reality only getting half as we weren\u2019t allowed to use facilities like lecture halls, workshops, etc is unfair to charge for something that wasn\u2019t used. The fee is ridiculous for lessons being cut short or disturbed by teachers children interpreting lessons and other, not being able to do loads of task as you need use a workshop etc. It was hard on student who rely on facilities to use computer, printer and so on. The government should take action. SIGN SHARE",
        "background": "Reducing university fees to at least half seems only fair as the education during COVID-19 times wasn\u2019t the standard it should of been. As a student myself I know first hand experience that learning online caused loads of problems, eg WIFI not connecting therefore lessons didn\u2019t happen, ect",
