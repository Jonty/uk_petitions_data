        "action": "Review all fines for Covid breaches issued by the courts and law enforcement.",
        "additional_details": "It appears, that the individuals who dictate the laws may not have abided by those same laws.  In addition, potentially identified breaches by individuals in public office are not being investigated and go unpunished.  Hence in the interests of fairness and equal justice, it feels only appropriate that individuals prosecuted or fined for previous breaches should have their penalties refunded, removed and rewarded costs.  (To clarify I was never one of those individuals)",
        "background": "Order review of all Covid breach enforcements and organise refund of any fines that occurred and clear the records of anyone punished for Covid breaches.  This is due to the fact that the laws did not apparently apply to all and some offending is not being investigated and will go unpunished.",
