But if they wait until my youngest is in full time education then I could work 25hrs a week with no child care cost and more chance of keeping a job, less benefits claimed and better for my mental health. Being a parent is a full time job and should be seen that way.",

Finding work that works around your children is a very hard thing to do.. putting children in childcare is not only experience but not always possible for a child that suffers from separation anxiety",
