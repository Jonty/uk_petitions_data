        "additional_details": "We need the law that wouldn't allow big hot food delivery companies reduce delivery fares they pay to the self employed couriers leading them into poverty pay and let the couriers along with companies set the fees. Why can the big companies themselves decide how much they want to pay to the couriers, why can't the couriers have an impact on the fare prices. Why aren't fares going up every year when all the bills are. You dont go to barber and decide you will pay them less this year do you.",
        "background": "Enough is enough every year fuel prices are going up, costs of living are going up, car maintenance costs and taxes are going up, yet app based hot food delivery couriers working for the three biggest american companies keep having their delivery fares reduced every year. We want law to change it.",
