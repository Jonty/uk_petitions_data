        "additional_details": "The UK has made the decision to close schools and nurseries, as other EU countries have done in an effort to limit Covid-19 deaths.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem for all parents who have to continue working, but even more so for those of underage children who often have to continue to pay \u00a31000-1500 per month of nursery fee per child.\r\n\r\nIn France, the state has voted a amendment to the law (D. n\u00b0 2020-227, 9 mars 2020) meaning one parent per household of children under the age of 16 can receive state funded sick pay of 50% of the salary, to up to 45.55\u20ac per day (60.73\u20ac after a month for parents of 3 children or more). This represents approximately 277 to 303 \u20ac per week and starkly contrasts with the maximum of \u00a394.25 per week in the UK.",
        "background": "The government has a duty to support parents by enabling them to look after their children and  financially survive while they do so. \r\nSick pay should be made available to one parent per household and statutory sick pay levels raised so parents can survive and fund nursery fees due during closure.",
