        "additional_details": "We had an accident in 2022 on this island due to a driver not slowing down and driving over the top of the island, not around the contours as stated in the Highway Code; treating it like a T-junction. There have been several other accidents on the same island.\r\nHighways agency believe it\u2019s safe but it\u2019s not. I have nearly been hit when trying to go around the contours, even though I was not indicating to turn onto westgate, another vehicle went across the top and nearly hit my driver\u2019s side.",
        "background": "This roundabout is designed wrong. The island goes into Westgate, so people coming from Ormskirk cut across it or don\u2019t bother slowing down.\r\nSeveral accidents have occurred due to the lay out of the island. Something needs to be done before someone gets killed.",
