        "additional_details": "The government should do it as they can contribute taxes and work legally to help the economy in this country so people becoming stateless can be prevented. If they don\u2019t have any criminal record they won\u2019t do any harm to the country. People are wandering everywhere with no shelter or way to get money. They have been living in this country and this will be a very good opportunity for people to become legal to support themselves. And without being legal they can\u2019t get a job.",
        "background": "Foreigners stuck in the UK can\u2019t return to their home country because of Coronavirus and other problems and they are not allowed to stay in the UK as well so they cant get the aid they need",
