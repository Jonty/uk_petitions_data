        "additional_details": "The money used in funding the BBC is unfair, and often squandered in expensive salaries, and poor TV programs which no way reflects the cost of television entertainment today. Those with low incomes pay in weekly installments, to watch old shows that have often been already shown on other forms of entertainment platforms such as Netflix and then bought by the BBC. As it is a old technology you can not watch episodes and series in sequence if you miss one, without iPlayer, which no way should be the price of the current TV license or forced to be paid for.\r\n\r\nAdvertising can be used to generate money to run it, or premium subscription for those who want it.",
        "background": "Abolish TV licensing fees, when the money is clearly needed now for the tax payer to ofset rises in the cost of living.",
