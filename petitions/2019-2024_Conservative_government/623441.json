        "action": "Reinstate the fracking ban and up support for renewables",
        "additional_details": "At a time when the country needs a solution to both the cost of living and climate crises, fracking will only set us back.  It will halt progress towards tackling the former, and at best providing temporary respite from the latter but with the real risk of extra investment needed to mitigate various risks associated with this water intensive, polluting and poorly regulated technology.\r\n\r\nWe call for the ban to be reinstated and for greater investment in renewable energy.",
        "background": "We ask that the government reinstate the ban on fracking so our country can deliver on much needed climate commitments to rapidly cut emissions, and to ensure investment in safe, resilient and zero carbon alternatives.",
