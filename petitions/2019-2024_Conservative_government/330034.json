        "action": "Take diplomatic action over China for not respecting Hong Kong Agreement.",
        "additional_details": "It is unfair that many Hong Kong\u2019s citizens are at risk of jail for just simple use of human rights and freedom of speech. While the Government have imposed a rule over allowing Hong Kong citizens to immigrate, it is not enough and unfair since many lives have been built in Hong Kong. We would like the Government to take action over China\u2019s brutal abuse of power.",
        "background": "We want the Government to address the fact that China have ridden the Hong Kong citizens of basic human rights and have employed such laws that are unacceptable. They have also broken the agreement of Hong Kong\u2019s freedom for 50 years, abusing their power and taken control 27 years earlier.",
