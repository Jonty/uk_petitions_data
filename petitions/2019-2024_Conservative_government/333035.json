        "additional_details": "It is a fact that wearing face coverings slows the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. COVID-19 Is non discriminatory; anyone regardless of circumstances can spread the virus or catch the virus. Many people are refusing to wear masks for a variety of reasons, thus putting others at risk. Giving the option of shopping during a mask free period would stop unnecessary rows, alleviate concern over the risks non maskers pose to wearers, and help the economy to get back on its feet. Everyone wins.",
