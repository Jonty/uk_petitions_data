People fought for gay rights and if we\u2019re going back to then there\u2019s gonna be no further evolution in this world. People need to understand that your SEX and GENDER are different things. Gender is how you identify. Your sex is your biological and legal sex. People should be able to change there sex legally.",
        "background": "I think that parliament should understand a human is a human. And trans people are not predators like they have been called before. Trans people are people and it feels we are going back to 1940s when we fought for gay rights. If people don\u2019t get it, they don\u2019t get it.",
