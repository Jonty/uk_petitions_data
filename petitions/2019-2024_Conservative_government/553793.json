        "additional_details": "Many students live with family members who are vulnerable and at risk of dying from this virus. By sending children to school, they are mixing with other households and could contract the virus. As children don't usually show symptoms, those who have it may not self isolate as they don't know they've got it. This means that they are likely to pass it onto other children who may be living with vulnerable individuals. This is putting many people at risk and nothing is being done about it.",
        "background": "Students who have electronic devices such as phones, laptops, etc. should be doing online learning to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Those who don't have access should continue to go to school with the correct measures in place (e.g. face masks to be mandatory in lessons).",
