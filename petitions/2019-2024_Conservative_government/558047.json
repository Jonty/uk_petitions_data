        "additional_details": "Since the end of the first lockdown the retail sector has proved they can provide a safe environment for customers. By restricting numbers, providing hand sanitiser, ensuring social distancing & the requirement for face coverings they have done exactly what has been required to stop the spread of COVID-19 within shops.\r\n\r\nNovember & December are the busiest & most crucial time for retailers. As a country we need to live with the virus, not hide from it. Support OUR high street before it disappears",
        "background": "Keep ALL retail shops open during the second lockdown regardless of whether they are classed as \u201cEssential\u201d or not. What is not deemed essential to one person maybe essential to another. \r\nWe must live with this virus and support Our high street otherwise the internet giants become the only option.",
