        "additional_details": "The huge increase in home working and the collapse in commuting by rail into London and Birmingham casts serious doubts on HS2's business case. Its now clear that the growth in digital technologies and video conferning will hugely reduce the demand for inter city rail travel. HS2 is based on outdated 20th century model of work and travel. It is rapidly becoming the most expensive & redundant civil enginering project in history. It now requires an urgent Government cost benefit analysis",
        "background": "The number of trips on Britains rail network fell by largest figure on record (51 million journeys) between March to June 2020. In July passenger numbers across rail network remained 85% down. Employers expect that almost 40% employees will work permanently from home once Covid-19 pandemic ends",
