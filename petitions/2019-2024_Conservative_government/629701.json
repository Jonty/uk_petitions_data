        "action": "Make mandatory Autism/ADHD training for all educational and social care staff.",
        "additional_details": "My son and myself shortly after we\u2019re diagnosed with Autism last year. Since then I have spoken with multiple parents who feel their children are being unknowingly emotionally harmed by situations within school that could be easily remedied with mandatory training. What is very obvious to parents of children with Autism might be difficult for those less connected to see. However simple training could help better identify and meet the needs of sen children because ultimately every child matters.",
        "background": "As a social work student it became clear to me that it was not mandatory for anyone including mental health social workers to have even basic training around Autism or ADHD. They often believed common myths and schools also rarely had good enough knowledge to adequately support ASD or ADHD children.",
