We need to reduce the risks and prevent this happening time and time again. To those of us who are not in the grips of suicidal depression and despair, it\u2019s difficult to understand what drives so many individuals to take their own lives. But a person in this position is sadly in so much pain that he or she can see no other option. Suicide is a desperate attempt to escape the suffering that has become unbearable. Surprisingly, most individuals in this position are deeply conflicted about ending their own lives. This is why far more needs to be done.",
