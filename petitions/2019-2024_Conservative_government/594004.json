        "action": "Introduce mandatory environmental impact ratings on food products sold in the UK",
        "additional_details": "An environmental impact rating would allow consumers to make informed choices when buying their food which would help individuals reduce their impact on the environment which we are beginning to see the devastating effects of globally. It would also incentivise companies to reduce their environmental impact as customers would choose to buy the products with a lower rating, thus putting sustainability at a similar priority to their profits.",
        "background": "Just as we currently have mandatory nutritional information, alcohol volume, allergy information and energy ratings on certain products, we should ask manufacturers to estimate CO2 emissions, water and plastic usage per product and to display these on their products packaging.",
