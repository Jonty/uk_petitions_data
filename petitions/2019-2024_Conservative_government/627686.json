        "background": "Introduce a \"Good Samaritan law\" for food donations to protect businesses and individuals from legal action if someone falls ill from a donation. Also, encourage businesses to donate excess product to food banks and/or give them away to shoppers, and penalise the binning of perfectly good food.",
