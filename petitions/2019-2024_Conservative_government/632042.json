        "additional_details": "Disposable vapes surged the market, significantly marketing young people, selling over 1 million/week, despite having a scarce lithium-ion battery (Material Focus, 2022).\r\n\r\nMost go to general waste. When not recycled (WEEE waste), they risk fires during collection and processing. Containing mixed materials and hazardous chemicals, they require manual dismantlement; processing 1M+/week is unfeasible.\r\n\r\nA ban aligns to a circular economy, net zero, and allows reusable devices for smoking cessation.",
        "background": "Ban the import and sale of single-use \u201cdisposable\u201d vapes.\r\n\r\nInterim: Retailers, manufacturers, and distributors comply with Extended Producer Responsibility, improving disposal information.\r\nRaise nicotine trading standards aligning with tobacco; removing multi-buy deals and sell behind screens.",
