        "action": "Stop unnecessary rabies jabs and checks on British pets travelling to N. Ireland",
        "additional_details": "The new set of EU rules for NI affect our freedom to move around the UK with pets unimpeded as before without incurring huge costs and will impact on family life and domestic tourism.  Many UK pet owners travel to NI rather than abroad as they do not wish for their dogs to be subjected to rabies vaccinations. The EU has devised an Animal Health Certificate and we must get 1 every time we travel to NI and have our pet vaccinated for rabies even though they will have zero exposure to rabies.",
        "background": "Under article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol, the UK government can intervene to safeguard its citizens from EU rules that negatively impact on our lives and on the economy. Use the Common Travel Area to agree not to enforce EU rules on pet travel for UK and Irish dogs on the Island of Ireland.",
