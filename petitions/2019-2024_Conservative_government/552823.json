        "additional_details": "The banning of resources that challenge the ideology of capitalism from schools is an act of authoritarian thought policing and must be stopped.\r\n\r\nSchools and other educational settings should be spaces where children and young people can safely empower themselves through education. This policy will build a roadblock in the way of young people's freedom to reimagine current systems and look towards building a brighter future.\r\n\r\nSign this petition to help protect English educational freedom.",
        "background": "Recently, the Conservative Government have instructed schools in England to not use material from organisations that publicly express anti-capitalist political stances, branding such beliefs as \"extreme political stances\". This petition calls for the Government to immediately revoke this decision.",
