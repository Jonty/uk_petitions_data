        "additional_details": "Studies have shown that a significant portion of the population in the UK feels more connected to their regional identity rather than a unified British identity. Additionally, ongoing debates around issues like Brexit, Scottish independence, and the monarchy reflect the complexities within the UK regarding national identity. This can be seen in the rise of nationalist movements in Scotland and Wales, including concerns on the impact of globalization on traditional British values and culture.",
        "background": "St. George's Day, celebrated on April 23rd, is the patron saint of England. It should be a bank holiday in England to allow people to celebrate national identity, inclusivity and culture. Like other countries have holidays for their patron saints. It could boost the economy with increased spending.",
