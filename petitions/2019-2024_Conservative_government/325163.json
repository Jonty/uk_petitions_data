        "additional_details": "As the Consumer Rights Act 2015 is legislation set out by the Government, it is expected that you would deal with any issues that arise about companies who do not follow the act's rules.\r\n\r\n\"It\u2019s illegal to display any notice that deliberately misleads consumers or deceives them about their rights\", in previous emails RyanAir have told customers that they would receive their refunds within a set timeframe. Now they have been pushed away, offered a 'voucher' and told it would be dealt with later.",
        "background": "As flights have been cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak, customers of airlines were expecting refunds on these flights. However, most airlines have NOT complied with the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (eg. RyanAir has left 84% of requested refunds unfulfilled). Many people need this money urgently.",
