        "action": "Remove quarantine and replace PCR test for people with natural immunity",
        "additional_details": "The new travel legislation ignores natural immunity, placing those who have been previously infected at a counter-logical disadvantage. This includes the types of testing, and the conditions on which each have to quarantine. If current travel legislation remains discriminatory against natural, equivalent immunity, it can only be seen as a function of a political campaign to incentivise vaccine uptake for reasons which do not primarily reflect the interests of the good health of the public.",
        "background": "Recognise that immunity gained from COVID-19 infection is at least as effective as the current vaccines in preventing infection and spread. Remove the 10-day quarantine and require only LFTs on return to the UK from countries not on the red list for people with proof of recent infection.",
