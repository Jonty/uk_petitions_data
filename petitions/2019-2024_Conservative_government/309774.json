The holiday would allow people to go out and meet friends and family for the first time in weeks, a joyous moment for many. Permitting things like parties and meetings would give people the chance to improve their mood and to reintegrate into daily life.\r\nSecondly, rejuvenation which simply allows people to re consolidate energy after a long period of isolation; preparing them for work and going back to normal life.",
