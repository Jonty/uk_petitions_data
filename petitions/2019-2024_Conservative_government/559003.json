        "additional_details": "We have observed that blonde people are becoming very rare to be seen, therefore we decided to go around and do research of our own. We found that most of those surveyed agreed fully and had noticed the same phenomenon.\r\nScience shows that as we become a more global society the recessive blonde gene is being lost in the gene pool; which is a case for concern. To keep the variety of people, this fact needs to be acknowledged and people should be made aware of the decline in this demographic.",
