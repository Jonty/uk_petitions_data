Every death devastates a family.\r\nBased on the government\u2019s statement, they need 60% of British population to be infected, which means almost 40 million people. With 1% of fatality, this means 400,000 British death! In addition, 20% of the cases need hospilisation, which means 8,000,000 hospital beds need to be available with the NHS!\r\nThe government must provide transparency on this serious issue as early as possible! The British people need to be protected!",

They must make the detailed scientific references, assumptions and calculations a open source to the public.
