        "action": "Reduce the energy price cap and return it to annual increase/decrease",
        "additional_details": "The increase in price caps were to reduce energy companies going into liquidation. Those fails were relatively new companies, many set up for the lucrative profits to be had and were inefficient/badly managed. The larger, long standing energy companies are now making vast profits. Already 1 large company (EON) saying customer debt is at \u00a31.3bn. Their profits a staggering \u00a33.4bn for 1st 6 months of 2022. If price cap continues as planned, more customers will fall into debt creating more poverty.",
        "background": "Look at the energy price cap which is going up almost 4 fold. The energy companies are making vast profits, even with the one off windfall tax. The price cap increased by 54% in April, is set to increase by 70% in October. The Government must cap the October rise and cancel the planned 2023 rises",
