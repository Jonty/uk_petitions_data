        "additional_details": "We are all aware of the dangers of cigarettes and the fact that they do indeed kill but many smokers enjoy smoking despite the risks just as some people enjoy skydiving despite the risk. Now if this legislation was in fact banning all cigarettes this would be a pretty strong case for health reasons, however, as only menthol cigarettes will be banned then this is essentially telling menthol smokers that they can't smoke their cigarettes. This creates a sense of unfairness. Please reverse!",
        "background": "The EU Tobacco Product Directive laws implemented back in 2016 will effectively outlaw menthol cigarettes. We believe that this is not in the spirit of a liberal country and now that the government has left the EU we must look again at this ban.",
