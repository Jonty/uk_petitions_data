        "additional_details": "Having to work 40hrs a week unpaid and then get a part time job on top is so draining mentally and physically for any student. meaning that their focus won\u2019t be on the course but how they will manage financially. Therefore affecting their studies. Another way it can affect students is not being able to afford travel to their work placement and this can put a lot of strain on any student. I think it would only be fair if we got the same loan as we have lives in our hands like human nursing.",
        "background": "Human nurse students can get the full \u00a39k student loan, so I would like the government to make this the same for Veterinary nurse students.",
