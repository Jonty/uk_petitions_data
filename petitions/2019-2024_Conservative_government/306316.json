Refusing testing and disabling knowledge of Covid-19 status, vulnerable UK citizens are not safe and those displaying symptoms may not follow correct quarantine guidelines. The government has a duty of care to the people of the UK and to the rest of the world, and it is negligent not to carry out adequate testing during this pandemic.",
