        "additional_details": "Children and school staff have all worked continuously throughout this epidemic. Saying now they have to work longer hours and more days is not going to help anyone's mental health. Staff are contracted and paid for 39 weeks a year (averaged then over 52 weeks), will the government be changing all staffs contracts and paying staff more? This is demoralizing for staff that have already worked their Easter and Whit week holidays without pay. Let children have a social holiday to develop those skills.",
        "background": "Stop planning longer school days and children and staff to attend during school holidays. Children are tired in the afternoons already with a day finishing at 3.30. Any teacher will tell you the quality of work is lower in the afternoon compared to the morning. Children are tired at the end of term.",
