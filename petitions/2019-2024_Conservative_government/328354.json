        "additional_details": "It is currently Pride month, and this is a stripped away right to the LGBTQ+ community to be treated equal and fairly. You can not say we are moving forward and leave laws like this un-changed. LGBTQ+ should have the same right as Heterosexual people in the court room. People are getting away with harm and murder to the LGBTQ+ because of there sexuality which is an outdated clause and we should all be treated with respect and like human beings. Its the basic right of a human to a fair trial.",
        "background": "In UK there is still a law that's used called 'Gay Panic Defence' now called 'Portsmouth defence' this means that if someone harms or kills a member of the LGBTQ+ they could be let off with lesser chargers or claim innocent by pleading insanity, blaming the victims sexuality for the crimes commited",
