        "additional_details": "Out of 1000 cases, an average of 310 are reported to the police. 50 of these reports lead to an arrest whilst only 28 of these 50 will lead to a conviction. A lot of these cases do not make it past the CPS as the most used reason from the police is that there was not enough evidence to support the complaint. This is the main reason why victims will not come forward. I truly feel if the law changed and that all perpetrators were put to the jury more victims would feel safe and would come forward.",
        "background": "I am asking the government to look into and get behind the sentencing for rape and sexual assault. Majority of victims do not come forward and report to the police for fear of not being believed, felt their safety would be more compromised if reported and felt the police couldn\u2019t do anything to help",
