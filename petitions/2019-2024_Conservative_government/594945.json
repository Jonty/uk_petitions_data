        "action": "Reinstate the government scholarships offered to 35 Afghan students.",
        "additional_details": "These scholarships help talented individuals achieve their potential through studying for a UK Masters degree. Many are already community leaders. The Afghan scholars, almost half of whom are women, are now in danger. It is deeply irresponsible to deny them a chance to continue their lives safely & receive the education promised to them. It is wrong on humanitarian grounds to suggest that bureaucracy is an insurmountable barrier to saving lives & futures. Reinstate the scholarships immediately.",
        "background": "As a consequence of Afghanistan's fall to the Taliban, the Foreign Office has told 35 Afghan students that they cannot take up their government funded scholarship to study in the UK, because their paperwork can't be processed in time. We demand an immediate reversal of this devastating decision.",
