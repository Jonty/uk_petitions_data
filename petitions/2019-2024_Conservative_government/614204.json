There are different requirements for being classed as N1 or M1, which means that not all vehicles classed as N1 will necessarily be able to be changed to an M1 class. We could accept a petition calling on the Government to change the requirements for these tax classes, so that any vehicle classed as N1 would be eligible to be changed to M1."
