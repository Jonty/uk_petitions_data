        "additional_details": "The recent case of former PM Boris Johnson rewarding his political allies with Knighthoods, for doing nothing other than politically support him, degenerates and demeans this otherwise wonderful and historic venerable honour system. It was an act of cronyism of the worst kind that we don't want in British politics. Prime Ministers should not be allowed to reward their friends with this honour. Recipients should be chosen by an independent panel assessing against agreed criteria.",
        "background": "Knighthoods should be awarded to members of the British public who have achieved something outstanding that has benefitted the country, making it a true badge of honour for recipients. The government should devise guidelines that should be met for such an award.",
