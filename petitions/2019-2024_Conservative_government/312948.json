        "additional_details": "Large businesses are emptying their banks paying shareholders dividends leaving no working capital, then when the business has a poor month trading they collapse risking thousands of jobs and expect the government to bail them out, this is poor management and the businesses should have enough saved to work through problems. Force shareholders to bail out the businesses or let them fail,  the government is not a bank and using this money leaves less funds for government needs.",
