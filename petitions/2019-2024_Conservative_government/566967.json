        "additional_details": "It is unfair why early years is so over looked during this whole pandemic. There is no social distancing with the children as they don\u2019t understand. \r\nEarly years staff have hardly got a mention, we do our job because we love it but why are we risking our lives and our families lives when the rest of the education sector is told to stay home? Makes no sense.",
        "background": "It is unfair to close down the nation yet expect early years settings to be open to all, when children aged 4 and under cannot social distance and have no or little understanding of the pandemic. This is putting many risks to children, parents and staff.",
