        "additional_details": "Scotland voted differently to the UK in the EU referendum and we are being taken out of the EU against our will. The SNP have had constant success and popularity in Scotland for many years at this point but have been denied a second referendum. The people have the right to change their mind and therefore a second referendum should be arranged. The union is after all a voluntary union of equals. If this is denied then I believe the act of union 1707 is void.",
