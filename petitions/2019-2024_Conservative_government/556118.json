Nurses, police offices, factory, shop and all public sector workers who work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week had this benefit taken many, many decades ago. Greedy MP's even awarded themselves a \u00a310,000 bonus to work from home during the pandemic but refused to even discuss nurses pay.",
        "background": "To debate whether MP's should continue to get free meals and food allowances. 2020 has been a year of financial hardship for too many people. In October 2020 the government voted NOT to provide free meals to hungry children during half term, whilst taking public money to feed themselves.",
