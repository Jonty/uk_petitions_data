        "additional_details": "So many students across the country are struggling massively to catch up&stay on top of learning, which is massively impacting their mental health. Results are much more likely to be accurate if taken from internal assessments that have been done after each topic as oppose to trying to regurgitate information in 2 hours that had been learnt up to 2 years ago. It will also make uni applications unfair if Wales and Scotland have their predicted but not England and it gives an unfair advantage.",
        "background": "Current year 13 students have missed so much learning & are still missing out on so much due to social distancing and lockdown measures. Exams were cancelled for last years students who had missed very little content in terms of learning so it is only fair to follow Scotland and Wales in cancelling",
