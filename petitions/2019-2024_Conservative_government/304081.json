        "additional_details": "As an independent owner of a small bar and nightclub, the way the British government has handled the situation of advising people to stay away from pubs and clubs without enforcing us to close has left us in an untenable position. Our customer base has been advised not to go out, staff, bands and DJs do not want to come to work or to perform in the venue due to this advice. This leaves us in a situation where we are unable to make a Business Interruption Claim until the Government enforces closure. Please act fast we don't have long left!",
