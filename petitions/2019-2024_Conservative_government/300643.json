        "additional_details": "We want to close the borders in order to reduce the risk of people with additional health complications becoming infected. Also, closing the borders will prevent a fast rise in the number of cases in the short term so the NHS can respond to new cases faster. It will also protect countries that are unaffected and prevent outbreaks in other affected countries from worsening. This is purely a proposal for a temporary measure to contain SARS-CoV-2 on a domestic and international level.",
        "background": "We want the UK Government to suspend all flights to, from and within the UK, suspend all ferry services to, from and within the UK, close the Channel Tunnel and close the land border with Ireland. The majority of cases of COVID-19 have entered the UK from abroad.",
