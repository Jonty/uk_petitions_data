        "additional_details": "It was recently made aware that 97% of women have suffered from sexual harassment/violence. This figure shows that there needs to be a change. For the future society. It shouldn\u2019t be deemed okay to act the way men do. Women shouldn\u2019t fear normal activities like going onto public transport or walking home alone.",
        "background": "Women and girls should feel safe walking the streets, day and night, with the confidence that the law protects them. In the UK, that\u2019s not the case, as there is no specific law against street harassment.Making it a criminal offence will empower people to talk about it more and stop harassers.",
