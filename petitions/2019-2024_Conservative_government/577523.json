        "additional_details": "The government announced that they would more than halve their aid to Yemen. Britain gave \u00a3214m in aid in 2020, and this year it will be cutting it to \u00a387m. This is despicable in the middle of a pandemic, when the suffering of Yemenis is getting worse and this could lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children who are already dying of stavation and suffering malnutrition. \r\n\r\nIt was also a promise in their party manifesto not to make this cut. This should be debated in parliament.",
