Everything is online, which 9.5k does not explain the expenses. Many students had to buy a laptop in order to carry on their studies. Many are paying for accommodation that is not being used. This is debt that does not justify the courses. Universities are not the same, so isn\u2019t teaching. Students only matter when they are being blamed for something.",
        "background": "The government should review the standard of teaching that is being given and if the 9.5k justify a such teaching. University facilities are also closed, independent learning is difficult for many. Tutors fail to reply to students when it need. The help needed isn\u2019t there.",
