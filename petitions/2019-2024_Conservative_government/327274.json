        "additional_details": "For a Gender Recognition Certificate, the time is 2 years living as that gender. You are required to use a bathroom to relieve yourself. As someone living as a gender surely they should use that gender's bathroom (assuming gender-segregated bathrooms). Denying those people the legal right to use that bathroom puts them at great risk regardless of the door they pick. This denial cultivates gender stereotyping and encourages assault on trans people while they are at their most vulnerable.",
