        "action": "The sale of loud fireworks to the public must stop.",
        "additional_details": "The detonation of loud fireworks causes stress to people and animals. They also present a risk of harm to those who use them. Consistently public opinion has been against the use of loud fireworks in residential areas. The reduction in the noise of these fireworks in an residential setting would be appropriate and easily enforced. This is not a call to ban fireworks it is a request that the rules are changed so they are less likely to cause trauma.",
        "background": "All fireworks intended for use by the public must comply with British Standard BS 7114 Part 2: 1988. It is proposed that the Standard is amended so that fireworks sold to the public generate no more less than 90 decibels rather than to existing 120dBA.",
