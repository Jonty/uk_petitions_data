        "additional_details": "While the UK faces self-isolation, the amount of litter being created in this country is likely to be much less, which makes this a great opportunity to reduce the negative effects of unnecessary plastics on our landscape, water and soil. Of course, every volunteer would be confirmed COVID-19 negative and comfortable to walk within a radius of a few miles of their home in order to pick. This would also be a good opportunity for socialisation and exercise in this otherwise isolating time.",
        "background": "During this current period of self-isolation in the UK, the Government should encourage every County Council in the country to organise small, safe litter-picking events in order to reduce litter's impact on the environment in a time when it is being significantly less produced.",
