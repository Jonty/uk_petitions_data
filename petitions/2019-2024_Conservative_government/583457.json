        "additional_details": "Covid-19 highlighted the importance of sport, and more specifically football, in the UK. The pandemic also highlighted the disconnect between fans and the upper echelons of football. \r\n\r\nBy creating a system whereby local fans are given a deciding vote in major decisions, like the breakaway league or the decision to furlough staff, will redress the balance of power in football. Other important institutions in the Uk have this business model, it is time to protect our much admired football pyramid.",
        "background": "In light of the disregard for the local fans of the ESL breakaway clubs, will the government explore the option to create a Golden Share business model whereby one official fan group per club gets a deciding vote in major decisions.",
