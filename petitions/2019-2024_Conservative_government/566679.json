        "additional_details": "Officers are not only dealing with covid breaches, anti mask/ anti vax protests, they are responding to sudden deaths believed to be caused by Covid 19. With evidence suggesting that you can be asymptotic, police can potentially become \u2018super spreaders\u2019 attending numerous 999 calls within a shift. Policing itself can be \u2018hands on\u2019 and in close contact with members of the public - it makes sense for officers and all emergency services and first responders to be vaccinated as a matter of priority",
        "background": "Advice from the JCVI on the priority groups for a Covid-19 vaccine does not include public facing police officers/staff or first responders. This petition calls for those in the emergency services be kept safe at work by being put on the vaccine priority list ASAP.",
