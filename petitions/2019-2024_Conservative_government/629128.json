The families also may not be able to provide a lunch for the children at home, so school meals are the only way that these children can get the needed nutrition to survive. However, due to the price of food in schools, this is hard for families to pay for.",

Catering companies do not provide a high enough quality food to be charging the prices that they do. People cant afford meals for their children in school, and due to the cost of living crisis, this is getting worse.",
