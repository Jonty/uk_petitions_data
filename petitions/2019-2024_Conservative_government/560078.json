For many, the cancellation of exams would be perfect as they have missed a lot of school however, many students would not benefit from this. A lot of students don\u2019t show their full capability in their school work and may be quiet in class. Also multiple people would just generally feel better doing exams as they have been working hard at home for them. People should have the choice to choose what suits their circumstances.",
