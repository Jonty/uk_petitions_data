        "action": "Enable the care at home sector to reclaim VAT on purchased goods and services.",
        "additional_details": "Reclaiming VAT on purchased goods and services is a solution that could benefit the care at home sector in terms of reducing costs and providing financial relief. Allowing care providers to reclaim VAT would help address the financial burden we face and improve the quality and availability of care services. \r\nIt would level the differences on purchasing goods and services with comparison to other sectors where price is always quoted excluding VAT where we have to look at final price.",
        "background": "To implement such a change, it would require a policy decision of UK government. \r\nGovernment should review the current VAT regulations and exemptions for the care sector and consider expanding the scope to enable care at home providers to reclaim VAT on eligible purchases.",
