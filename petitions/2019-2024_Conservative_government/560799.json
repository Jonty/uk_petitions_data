        "additional_details": "Another deadly novel infection, after Covid, is certain to arrive. Whether or not Covid is eradicated.\r\n It is thirty six years since the last Public Health Act. \r\n Nothing is more important than health. \r\n Where previously, policy has pursued other aims, (for example economic or political aims,) at the price of less healthy citizens, this must now change.\r\n Better health is a collective effort. While any one of us is needlessly unhealthy, we are all needlessly at risk.",
        "background": "We request the UK Government henceforth subject all policy to a detailed health audit. So no policy injurious to better national resilience is ever adopted. \r\n We call for immediate review in all areas, to identify and then remove all policies making citizens vulnerable to deadly infections.",
