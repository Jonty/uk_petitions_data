People who have bought covid testes to obey the rules and restrictions.\r\n\r\nIt is not fair that there\u2019s a pilot scheme, whilst the working class suffers. Enough is enough. \r\n\r\nWe have vaccines available now. We have PCR tests. We have lateral flow tests. What\u2019s the point in the vaccines and testing if we can\u2019t move on and go back to normality?",
        "background": "Portugal should\u2019ve never been removed from the green list. The WHO is not aware of any new variant being detected in Nepal. Portugal was a green country when it was convenient for the UK (Champions League). We have tests and vaccines available - we should not be in a worse position than last year.",
