        "additional_details": "Supermarket employees are at risk from infection as they are in direct daily contact with the public.  Supermarkets are ideal conditions for Covid-19 to spread as not all members of the public follow Covid-19 rules such as social distancing, hand sanitisation or wear a face covering (excluding those who are exempt for medical reasons.)  Supermarket employees are at very high risk of contracting Covid-19.  We feel like the forgotten \"key workers\" by this government.",
