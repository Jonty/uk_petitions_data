Today he had a temperature and cough and the doctor has diagnosed chest infection.  If he has to go into hospital and then discharged, the care home will take him back but will have no idea if he has become infected with Coronavirus.  Due to his dementia, he will be almost impossible to isolate, he will wander around the home, eating other peoples food and have no idea about social distancing.  This will be a death sentence for many of the other people in the home.",
