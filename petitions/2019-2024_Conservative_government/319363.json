The British people have honoured their commitment to arresting the spread of the pandemic at great financial and emotional cost. It is reasonable and proportionate to ask the Government to publish the reasoning and basis upon which it has asked the British public to make such a sacrifice.",
        "background": "The Governments approach to the pandemic has been predicated on following the science. The proper application of the science is thus central to the question of why so many people have died and continue to die. I want the Government to detail the reasoning considered at  SAGE by such publication.",
