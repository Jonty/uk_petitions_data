        "additional_details": "Having stability with accommodation covered will reduce panic and anxiety from a lot of tourists whilst a more permanent / repatriation solution can be put in place.\r\nSome have spent thousands on cancelled flights and only been refunded with flight vouchers, many will be struggling greatly financially and still will need to find accommodation with uncertainty about getting home\r\nMany will have lost income \r\nSome who have been living / backpacking may not have a home to return to even in the UK.",
        "background": "Could we see the government booking out hotels until repatriation is available\r\n  - bulk-buying thousands of rooms will make each individual room cheaper rather than individuals paying themselves\r\n- Countries like Aus/NZ/USA are very expensive countries to be for an unknown period of time",
