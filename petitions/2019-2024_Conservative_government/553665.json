        "additional_details": "With the amount of \u00a39,250 being a more than ever costly figure, students within this year and next year leaning towards not going into further education. With the financial burden of paying it back, and jobs and apprenticeships at the highest number of redundancies for young / inexperienced workforce\u2019s. This brings into question wether it is worth continuing to a university degree.",
        "background": "We want them to minus a decided amount of the \u00a39,250 for the next 2 university years due to the collapse of the economy. Not only would it benefit students but the government as well, with having less money owed and less money to pay back, with jobs at a potential risk.",
