        "additional_details": "I think personally that this is a very important petition and topic. There have been families (parents & Grandparents) that have turned their self upside down financially to send grandchildren and children to these universities. This means that some families are struggling to put food on the table and provide for their families. This is the main reason as to why I think it is a vital thing to refund a year of tuition, or give an extra free year.",
        "background": "With the COVID-19 pandemic there has been an influx of students that have paid thousands in some cases 10's of thousands of pounds only to be denied an education. This is the main reason as to why I think it is a vital thing to refund a year of tuition, or give an extra free year.",
