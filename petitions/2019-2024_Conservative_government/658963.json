        "action": "Make Friday a half school day and not a full day at school",
        "additional_details": "I want this to happen because in my opinion it really impacts each students mental health and physical health the more they are in school. 71% of students feel anxious about their classes/classwork so how do schools think students can work their bests if they are mentally fit to be in school and work the possibly best they can. Students also need to learn to socialise with friends outside school since half of students feel like they do not belong at school. Students also get bullied less outside of school then inside which could also boost the student's confidence and mindset to complete their studies.\r\n.",
        "background": "I want the government to discuss the importance of  a half school day on Fridays at 12:30 so they have time to be at school and to socialise and to have more time to do homework.",
