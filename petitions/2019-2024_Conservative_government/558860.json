It allows people to get away with bullying and the police aren\u2019t always able to help as they don\u2019t have access to the perpetrators details. It happens to thousands of people every day, celebrities and non-celebrities. Some people may commit suicide because of fake accounts and many will have mental health issues as a result, let\u2019s stop this from happening instead of having to deal with the consequences.",
