        "additional_details": "The changes force cars to come to a stop when turning into a junction, this poses a risk of rear ending incidents going up and will encourage pedestrians to \"just walk\" rather than checking, as they will assume that because they have a right to cross, everyone will give way and be able to see them, we frequently see evidence of this at zebra crossings where some people just walk. In addition to this cyclists riding two abreast forces vehicles even further into the opposing carrigeway",
        "background": "The highway code was recently amended, these amendments have made the road a more dangerous place for those using it, these changes should be scrapped immediately.",
