        "additional_details": "An XL bully is a \"Heinz 57\", a mixture of different breeds, so if you ban them then this will have implications for cross breeds of dog because nobody can be sure on the breed specifics. They are all different sizes and shapes. Just because a dog is big and muscular doesn't mean it can be labelled an XL bully, it is unfair to do this. \r\n\r\nIt is also a well-known fact that how a dog acts is a reflection of the owner's actions. Bad owners should be punished, not the breed of dog \u2013 hold bad owners accountable.",
        "background": "I believe that the XL bully is a kind, beautiful natured breed that loves children and people in general, and are very loyal and loving pets.",
