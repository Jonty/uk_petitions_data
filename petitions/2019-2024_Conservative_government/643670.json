        "additional_details": "A dangerous dog is dangerous due to its training, not due to its breed. A dangerous dog would have learnt how to attack and/or kill from its owner. We would not stereotype people in this manner, so why stereotype dogs due to their breed? The legislation needs updating. However, adding a breed will NOT solve the issue. The legislation needs to be more focused on the owners who train their dogs to be dangerous. Any dog breed can be dangerous.",
        "background": "The Dangerous Dogs Act was put into place in 1991. 32 years later this legislation has not changed. It has been proven that banning a breed does NOT stop dog attacks. Banning the American Bully XL will NOT stop dog attacks. The dog owners in these situations need to be the ones banned.",
