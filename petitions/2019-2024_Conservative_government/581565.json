        "additional_details": "Recently there have been several large developments approved in my local area of Sefton. Some of the developments have now completed areas of the properties. On a walk last week, I passed by such a development and I noticed that not one garden had a single tree in it. We are loosing green space at an alarming rate due to property development and whilst we are destroying the habitats of millions of creatures by doing this, the least we can do is pledge to give something back to the environment.",
        "background": "I want the government to make it a condition of planning permission for developers creating new homes to be under obligation to plant a minimum of two trees per property created.",
