        "action": "Have more stringent consequences for people who throw away their litter.",
        "additional_details": "People who throw litter know there will be zero consequences for their actions. The reason they do it is because, like most things, there are zero consequences for their selfish actions. It costs the tax payer a tremendous amount of money to clean up and causes damage to our environment in far too many different ways. This blatant disregard for the natural world needs an equally blatant disregard of their excuses of laziness.",
        "background": "Enforce a much more strict and serious attitude to people who throw litter as well as those who fly tip. We need more fines and even jail time for persistent offenders.",
