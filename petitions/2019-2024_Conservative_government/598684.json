        "additional_details": "I took up roller skating during the first lockdown, as a keyworker my gym was temporarily suspended and I still needed an outlet to de-stress mentally and physically. I know roller skating saved alot money for the NHS in terms mental and physical health issues.\r\n\r\nHowever, with more and more builds and less investment in communities, and facilities, I would like the government to encourage local authorities and businesses to work with Skate communities and render more safe, affordable skating venues for all to enjoy.",
        "background": "We the people would like the government and local authorities, to render more disused indoor spaces. I.e. Sports hall, warehouse and theatre spaces across London for roller skating activities and community groups.",
