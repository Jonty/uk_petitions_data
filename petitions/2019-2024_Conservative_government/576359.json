        "additional_details": "Firstly with the anxiety levels and mental health of the current young people we need clarity and clear understanding with regards towards exams. Exams are usually a point of anxiety - let alone when they are not confirmed. As a student I propose that the government cancel mini assessments this is because we've missed out on a lot of our education which disadvantages us. Not to mention, the added stress of revising for exams that may not even take place. 50% of mental health problems are established by age 14.",
        "background": "Give clear and decisive instructions towards teenagers regarding their exams, which are a  deciding factor towards their future.",
