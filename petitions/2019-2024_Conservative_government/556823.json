        "action": "Allow commonwealth soldiers to reside in Britain if they wish after service.",
        "additional_details": "Because these commonwealth soldiers from Fiji for example, fight for our country and in the past have paid the ultimate sacrifice. As a country we owe them our gratitude because we asked them to go beyond what most people would encounter. We ask them to fight if need be, to protect the Crown and its people. What good is the Crown to them if we won't allow commonwealth soldiers to part of its people.",
        "background": "As too often I see commonwealth soldiers who have served in the British Army being denied UK citizenship. I would like the government to grant all and any commonwealth soldiers citizenship if they wish after a minimum of 6yr service.",
