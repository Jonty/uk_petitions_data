The Government said they were increasing sentencing for animal abusers. I want the Government to look at the sentencing and reinforce this bill as it is not being carried out.",

Decisions about sentencing for animal abuse offences are the responsibility of the courts, not the Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition calling on the Government to introduce minimum sentences for animal cruelty offences, if that's what you want to happen."
