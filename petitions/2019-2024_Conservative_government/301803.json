        "additional_details": "People are being treated unfairly and like criminals. It is not right that the police are marginalizing CBD FLOWER users as criminals or drugs addicts. There is a massive difference between marijuana & HEMP (which is CBD FLOWER) the difference is the THC content in both products, one is psychoactive and the other is not. In other European countries CBD FLOWER is widely\r\nAvailable (Italy, Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, France) the policy's regarding CBD Flower is outdated MUST be changed.",
        "background": "We want the government to decriminalize and recognize that CBD Flower is not a class b drug (like marijuana). Because of the THC Content is below 0.2%. If caught with it we shouldn\u2019t face the same punishment as those with REAL marijuana (above 0.2% thc). The rules & REGs need updating on CBD FLOWER.",
