        "additional_details": "A 2019 YouGov survey showed 48% of voters support the legalisation of cannabis for recreational use, compared to 24% who object. \r\nBlack community represents 5% of population but 20% of convictions.\r\nIn 2017 the UK had 7697 alcohol related deaths and 95,800 smoking related deaths in a stark contrast to the 3 deaths where cannabis was mentioned on the death certificate.\r\nRegulation could reduce the number of harmful strains in circulation.\r\nThe industry could create jobs and additional tax revenue.",
        "background": "The Home Offices own assessment shows 7.6% of adults have used cannabis in the past year (2.6 million Brits). Use increased by 1.1% since the drugs reclassification, showing this approach has been ineffective. The black community is disproportinatley affected by cannabis convictions.",
