        "additional_details": "The government takes charge of curriculum in schools and as a young adult, kids are ill equipped on aspects of life that involve money. The government should do more to help children better understand society that they will contribute to after coming out of education. \r\n\r\nAspects such as taxes, insurances, banks and mortgages alienate kids and young adults once they leave school or college because they are not taught this in school when this should be made compulsory as part of their curriculum.",
        "background": "Despite the fact that schools exist to teach important things about society, many children come out of school not knowing about Taxes, Mortgages, Banks and Insurances. These are vital aspects of our society and we must better equip our children by making this compulsory as part of their curriculum.",
